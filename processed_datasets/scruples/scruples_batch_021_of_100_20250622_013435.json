      "title": "AITA for getting pissed at my friend that kept me up at his place?",
      "description": "This happened a while ago, but I still wonder about it sometimes. Throwaway, yada yada, you know the drill.\n\nI have this friend. We'll call him C. I've been friends with him for close to 5 years now. I'm currently 19. We're still pretty close, considering that we live two-ish hours away from each other. He's a pretty good guy. He got me into video games, and we've been there for each other through the hard times. He's a friend I'd like to retain for a very, very long time. The only real issue is that he's borderline addicted to video games (relevant later). \n\n\nWe used to be a tightly knit group of three. Me, C, and another guy that I'll call A. After highschool, we ended up physically going separate ways, but we still keep in touch, and I still consider them to be very close friends. C and I live in NC, and he's roughly 2 hours away from me by car. A moved all the way to Indiana. So over the summer, C and I decide to take a road trip up to see him (~13 hours of driving). So the morning of the trip, I wake up early to make the drive to his place. The trip itself was great.\n\n\n\nOn the way there, we stopped for the night before hitting the mountains. On the way back, we drove all the way to his place (~11.5 hours of driving). We set out way later than we wanted to, so we end up getting back to his place pretty late. Around 2AM. By this point I'm tired, tell my friend that we can do whatever he wants tomorrow morning, but that I want to leave for home around 12. That's great, he says goodnight. I'm sleeping on the couch; no complaints. The issue is, he logs straight onto his computer and starts playing video games. Normally I wouldn't care, but he lived with his sister at the time; his bedroom was separated from the living room only by a really thin curtain, and he has a mechanical keyboard... Which is really, really loud. I ask him to please hold off so I can get some sleep, but he refuses. Whatever, fine. I stick a pillow over my ears and try to get to sleep. Eventually, I do.\n\nThen I wake up at 4AM, because he's still playing on his computer. At this point I know if I do manage to get to sleep again, I'm not going to wake up for a while, and I'm going to lose a day. So tired me asks him why he has to do this right now. He says something along the lines of \"I'm sorry, but I've really been wanting to play this.\" So I just leave. I make the normally 2 hour drive home in 1.5 because nobody else is on the road, and because I don't want to fall asleep behind the wheel. I get home around 6, black out in bed, and don't wake up till noon. Apparently his sister tore into him for this, and he apologized. I told him it was a jerk move but left it at that. Some of my friends say that I can't really complain, and I can see where they're coming from. They didn't have to let me stay the night. I'd just never do that to a guest, never mind a friend.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA?\n",

      "title": "AITA for not telling my sister about a pretty serious procedure?",
      "description": "For some backstory, my sister and I weren’t super close growing up. We argued and fought over just about everything, and honestly there were days when I couldn’t stand her attitude. When I moved away to college, we started getting closer because there was that distance between us and we didn’t see each other every day. We would still talk relatively frequently and did share quite a lot.\n\nWithin the last few months, we both got really busy and haven’t been talking as much as we were before (cutting down from once or twice every couple weeks to once or twice a month). During this time, I found out I was pregnant. I knew it wasn’t the right time, my boyfriend and I are still in college and we want a family someday but we aren’t mentally, fiscally, or emotionally ready for a child. So I decided to terminate the pregnancy. I also decided not to tell my sister about this procedure before it was done. I was struggling with the decision that I had to make, and I was hurt and upset about even though it broke my heart, I knew it was the right decision. I didn’t want to talk to her about how I was feeling because I felt so guilty that I couldn’t let myself grieve, and I didn’t want to have to listen to her grieve over it while dealing with that. \n\nI told her after the procedure, and we talked about it a little bit but I didn’t go into detail. Lately people have been telling me (mainly her boyfriend, who is a friend of mine, and my mom) that she feels like I don’t ever want to talk to her and that she’s being replaced by the friend of mine who was living with me and was there when I found out I was pregnant. She never told me these things, I’m having to hear them from other people. I was angry about that, and reacted poorly by not reaching out for awhile after I heard how she was feeling. When I finally called, she and I got into a blow out argument about how she feels like she’s living on the outskirts of my life, and that she can’t believe I would be so shitty to not tell her beforehand and not reach out to her for support as I was going through all this. \n\nI understand she’s upset that I didn’t tell her, but I feel like I’m also entitled to my personal life and I’m not required to tell her about these things.  AITA for not telling her or reaching out to talk to her about my feelings after? ",

      "description": "\nIt was 7th grade and my school had alot of students who misbehaved, I was not one of those students. I mean that in the least egotistical way possible. There was this one science class that everyone including myself hated. Mainly due to the amount of homework that would be given by the teacher. One day while we are waiting for our science teacher to arrive we soon figure out that no one did the homework at all, except for me. Now everyone was asking me if they could copy mine and I politely refused (I don't know if that makes me an asshole either). So teacher walks in and we spend the class learning and stuff. Usually she checks our homework at the beginning of class and all that jazz, turns out she forgot to. Now our classes are 90 minutes and I'm thinking about this whole time. So end of class she tells us what we will be doing tomorrow and so on. I knowing full well no one did the homework say\n\"Aren't you going to check our homework?\" She thanks me for reminding her and checks each and everyone of the students homework pages. After seeing that I'm only one who did it she lets me leave and lectures the whole class about honesty and other stuff. Now after that everyone kinda sorta hated me\n\n\n",

(mum will buy and wrap the gifts from my nana and grandma so they don't have to go out and do it) \n\nwe visit them and it's not there, I question mum why it's not there a few days later and she said she returned it because she did not like the gift and did not want me to have it. she also felt like it was a inappropriate gift for my nana and grandma to give to me. (she did not know what it was when she bought it) \n\ninstead of the adventure time dvd I got a maranda one that was never used and we donated it to a salvation army a few years later. (that annoyed my mum) (I did not intentionally not watch the maranda dvd I just did not like her that much) \n\nshe is not the best as getting gifts as she got me a alarm clock for a birthday gift after I told her I did not want one because I had my phone. and even tho I dont wear makeup I got some lipstick in my santa stocking one year.

We bonded over similar interests and he quickly became a good friend of mine. \n\nAs our friendship continued, I began to notice he was copying me quite a bit. He started listening to the same music as me, getting the same tattoos, and adopting my sense of style. It got even weirder when he started asking me personal questions about myself, then would use the answers I gave him to describe himself during conversations with my other co-workers. \n\nInitially, I took it as a compliment. I convinced myself that he just really enjoyed some of my interests. Now I just feel like I'm talking to another me, yknow? It got to the point where I think I'm losting my own sense of identity. Music that I loved listening to for years, I now hate. I cant even bring myself to talk to him anymore, in fear that he will copy something I say again. \n\nI recently brought up this concern to a few of my friends and co-workers. Almost all of them told me he really looks up to me. When people tell him that his outfit looks similar to mine he thinks it's the best compliment. \n\nI feel like a normal person would take this all as a compliment, but I hate it and it's hard for me to continue to be his friend.

He asked if he could borrow my car, that he shouldn’t even have to ask and I should’ve offered if I loved him, that he apparently can only rely on himself and not me, that I don’t trust him.

I started football in my junior year and have been doing well at it as a senior.\n\nHowever since i haven't been playing long in comparison to the other guys I maybe dont know the football culture well? The quarterback constantly smacks everyones asses after a play. Especially mine, because im right in front of him as a center.\n\nHe does this after both successful and unsuccessful plays. He does this while we're getting ready for games and after games win or lose. He slaps dudes who didnt even play and were warming the bench. Told my coach it bothered me and he told me to approach him myself since we're all basically adults now.\n\nI did and the guy basically said that im being weird and that its just a team sports thing and as a leader he is trying to motivate people. Me and him actually work well together as qb and center so its even weirder.\n\nWell i decided to bring in 4 other guys who all agreed the ass slapping was out of hand and that our qb was out of line. We had like an informal convo outside of the locker room and he freaked out and said we can all fuck off basically. Now the locker room is divided and since i took a lead role its like im the leader of the no ass slap side vs his ass slap side.\n\nIt sounds weird as i dont think hes like raping me but i do feel weird being touched. Im actually like twice his size. AITA for not letting it go?",

      "title": "AITA For not liking my 5 year old niece?",
      "description": "I'm gonna put this in a few sections: History, My Niece, My Parents, My Actions and My Reasons.\n\n\n*HISTORY*: My oldest brother is mentally disabled, he has all the working to make him a typical super villain. Charm, Smarts, Manipulation, Anger, Drug Abuse, Schizophrenia, Sociopathic, and Murderous Tendencies. He was the first one to have a kid, right after almost murdering his pregnant girlfriend and carving \"Resurrect\" in his chest on the too of a building. After pulling a gun on our other brother multiple times and laying his hands on my mom and even sexually abusing me when I was a kid. CPS was involved and my mom fought for my niece as a Grandmother, wining the battle after 2 years, we now have custody and Alex, my crazy brother can't see her and Brionna, my nieces mom, has ran away with another guy to be a step mother. My mom raised her to not be like Alex, but she's showing signs of being exactly like him, but worse and no one does anything because she's a kid.\n\n*My Niece*: She's cute, very pretty and looks just like her mom. She's also very fat. She's larger than all the other kids in height and weight in her Kinderclass. She's 5 and weighs 70 pounds. She's also the biggest brat I have ever known in my life. She will throw fits at the littlest things, punch kick and act like a 2 year old when she's well above that stage in her life. She's vulgar and talks about people licking her but and constantly cusses. I hate cussing verbally, I just don't like saying bad words I don't mind other people saying them, but frankly I don't find a 5 year old cussing to be cute. I don't know what happened in my time but she hates me. She goes from \"I love you, Geri\" to \"I wish you die\" in a matter of seconds. She's constantly eating to a point where she can eat 7 ramen noodles in a day. I'm a full grown adult and I can only eat maybe 3-4 when I'm super hungry. I have to hind food from her because she will eat it all before any of us can get to it, and were poor as fuck, so its not like we have a lot of food to have around. Especially with the shut down, we are extremely limited. She does things just to make me angry and she doesn't listen, she ignores people and is incredibly bossy.\n\n*My Parents*: They thought all of her actions were cute. \"Oh she chunky, how cute!\" \"Oh she cussed, how cute!\" Until it backfired. Now they're struggling with essential a drunk angry midget 24/7. My moms tired of it and I laugh because of what she raised. She's now getting scared because she's reflecting Alex's behavior, but she doesn't do anything about it. she also lets her get away with nearly everything because her parents left her. She's guilt tripped by her which ends up leading to her punch or kicking an animal. (She's held a lighter to my dog because my mom let her have one.)Every \"threat\" (Gonna take away your toy if you keep acting up) is dismissed. My step dad did the whole counting thing, and once he reached 3, he did nothing. He stayed in his bed and continued to ask for Sophia to calm down. Now she knows my dad is packing a load of bull shit. He is also the reason Sophia is so large, by feeding her constantly and telling her to eat all her food. Now that he has a competitor he's trying to put her on a diet.\n\n*My Actions*: I've tried continuously to be nice to her. Asking her calmly and trying to reason with her, but she covers her ears and walks away. She spits at me, ignores me and when I try giving the simplest lecture, she's playing with something. I ask her to repeat what I said to her so I know she at least HEARD, but she always looks away and smiles saying \"I forgot.\" She's rude and doesn't listen when I tell her nicely, sometimes I have to yell at her to get her attention. Even then she ignores me. Its gotten to a point where I gave up trying to pick up the mess my brother and my parents made.\n\n*My Reasons*: I don't want to be around her or have her anywhere near my house/cabin because were just gonna fight. I've lost all patience and trust with her after working with her for 3 years, almost 4. She's a kid, I know, but I'd rather be a distant aunt than a sister that is known to hate my niece. Its better for her to not have my negativity around her. I'd be willing to work with her once she's grown out of her bratty stage. I just don't want to contribute to a negative future or risk tearing my vocal chords trying to get her to stop jumping on my bed for the 55th time or Dropping my rabbits after I told her not to pick them up.\n\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to be around a kid that I know is rude and just want to be left alone even if she's 5?",

      "description": "I'm in charge organizing a biweekly board game night for our department.  My \\[friend\\] wanted to organize a video/board game event, and the time slot I have is super convenient for this sort of thing. This \\[friend\\] reached out to me asking to combine the two events at some point in the future to both help get the word out about his event and to get this convenient time slot.  I agreed, and even offered to bring some department-owned board games usually used for my board game night and my personal switch to the event to help with supplies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of days later, my \\[friend\\] informs me that his event was filling up, changes the time of his event to start and end earlier than my board game night usually does, and indicated that I should probably still hold my regular board game night to help with demand.  I'm totally fine with this, and just point out that I will have to leave his event early with a couple of the department board games for my board game night.  I say that I specifically will be bringing back a game (Codenames), since it has been popular at my game night in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to two days before \\[friend\\]'s event.  I check that everything is still going forward.  \\[friend\\] says I didn't fill out an RSVP form, his event is totally full, and so I probably can't come.  (Aside: I saw the RSVP form but didn't respond, since I figured I was automatically on the list due to my participation.  I didn't clarify this, but should have).  I say fine, but I was still planning to come to bring the games and my switch.  \\[friend\\] says he will bring his own stuff and leave department games alone (indicating that I'm no longer invited?  I should have asked explicitly, but that's certainly how I felt).  People later ask if I'm going to \\[friend\\]'s event because I'm the game person, and I say I was 'uninvited'.  Because we're both super busy, we don't have more chance to talk about this after this somewhat frosty exchange.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the night of the event, I don't attend (of course), and go to pick up department games for my board game night.  Codenames, which I specifically pointed out I wanted, was not there.  \\[friend\\] isn't responding, and I didn't have time to go retrieve it from his event before my board game night starts.  Codenames is immediately requested, but I have no way to get it, so we make do with other games.  \\[friend\\] comes by our board game night much later carrying Codenames and a couple of other games.  Other friends ask how \\[friend\\]'s event went, when I chime in that I specifically wanted Codenames, essentially calling him out right then and there.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther friends weren't impressed with my comments about Codenames and being 'uninvited'.  I'm still annoyed with \\[friend\\] for what I see as a poorly managed event and leaving me out of the loop, but get that my communication could have been better.  AITA?",

      "description": "So this is prompted from a *long* discussion I had with someone about workload.\n\nBackground:  \nDegrees in the UK are different to those in other countries in that we get a fair amount of money from our Goverment so we don't have to pay for everything in a similar way to students in the US. Because of this, students with full time jobs (37+ hours a week) are rare if not non-existent, and some more academic universities ban term-time jobs completely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was talking to my friend in South Carolina about a situation where a child wanted me to give them something I'd spent a lot of money on because they deemed me too old to deserve it (I'm 21). I mentioned that I told her that I \"busted my ass working 24 hours part time alongside a full time degree\" because, in the UK, 24 hours is considered a lot as an undergraduate. Immediately she told me that her friends and family would see meobnoxious and self-righteous because they would think I was using it as a \"fuck you label\" to the girl who wanted me to give away something I'd worked hard for.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I totally understand how I could seem like a little shit, especially from, say, the perspective of a single mum who also works and goes to school, but AITA for complaining about my own situation with regards to someone trying to take my things for free? I just feel like I can't help getting frustrated when people saying that I'm lazy, or entitled when it comes to money; especially because I have a degree that means I spend 4/7 weekdays doing uni study and going to meetings, and then spend the other 3 working part time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf y'all tell me I'm the asshole, at least I'll feel like it was justified, but it's just something that's irked me.

I'm an IT Specialist, so I (out of respect and nothing else) Have been their sound guy and IT guy for the past 7 years.\n\nFast forward to last month; This church began a hostile take over to throw him out because he has attempted to teach things like \"Women aren't objects and Should not be treated as less than men\", \"Gay marriage may be against the Bible, but they are people too, so we should let them be happy\", \"Abortion may be murder, but there are circumstances where it is acceptable\".  For an Old Republican Pastor, he attempts to be very forward thinking, and I appreciate that in such a small old church. Now for all of this he has been basically forced to leave. His last Sunday is this coming Sunday (the 27th).\n\nNow after all of this they continue to attack him over small stupid shit like visiting his family in a different state a couple of weeks ago. He is old and Doesn't need this shit. I personally want to sabotage (IT and sound-wise) the church the second he's gone, but I feel that he would be blamed for this, so I will not.\n\nI plan to just disappear after he leaves. They deserve to panic, so I'm just gonna walk away. Not like I had much of a connection anyways. They have NO ONE else who will understand anything that I do for the church, so they will 100% scramble for music and other things like this.\n\nAITA for wanting to let a church panic cause they fucked over my grandpa for being a decent guy? Cause everyone that's aware of my plan keeps saying I'm a jackass.",

      "description": "So I'm hugely into D&amp;D right now. I want to play so badly, but I want to play with my one-year-younger brother. He's my best friend and I want to include him. We're both gamers, so I'm positive he'd love it. He's antisocial, so he's sure he'll hate it (even though we'd be playing with people we both know). He absolutely refuses to try it all, he won't even play to the point where he can be sure he hates it. I'm furious because I just want him to give a honest attempt at trying, not love it like I do. He thinks I'm emotionally abusing him (his words) for forcing him to do it. I've literally told him I owe him food or whatever if he doesn't like it, but he has to try. He says it's a huge time commitment to try and he doesn't want to spend the emotional energy. We're not talking because we're strongheaded and both certain we're right. Help. ",

      "description": "My girlfriend is gorgeous and wonderful but some of the things she does really bother me. We have been dating for almost two years and there have been some details that have me rethinking. When around her friends, she’s a totally different person, she’s loud and abrasive and very annoying to listen to, which is such a starch contrast from her normal actions where she is calm and collected. Another thing with her is she doesn’t find my style of comedy funny, and I’m pretty sure it’s not because I’m not funny because my friends and other people do enjoy my style of comedy. I know a girl who thinks I’m really funny and doesn’t act fake to me or her friends depending on whose around, she doesn’t mind what people think of her because she knows she is who she is. So naturally over time as I’ve gotten to know this girl the more I’ve enjoyed her company and sometimes would prefer to spend time with her over my girlfriend. My girlfriend however hates this girl because of the way she treated one of her friends, but I don’t know enough about that to know if it’s actually significant. ",

      "description": "My husband's mom has a history of trying to get the family (us, his brother and sister, and their spouses) together on less than a day's notice (context: we all live near to each other). I think this is pushing the bounds of reasonability--we are adults with lives. Additionally my husband and I are simply introverted and not always up for socializing at the drop of a hat. Sometimes it happens to work out. More often, it goes something like this:\n\n1. Saw MIL on Christmas Eve. She expressed an interest in having a family potluck and game night. Husband and I said we had lots of plans for the upcoming week, but were free on &amp; after New Year's Day.\n2. Dec 27th: MIL sends out a group text asking when people are available. I reiterate that Jan 1st would work for us. So far so good.\n3. This is where things start to go wrong. Nobody else responds to the group text, and MIL does not send any followup texts. I find out from my husband that his brother has to work on Jan 1st.\n4. New Year's Eve is here and I have heard nothing from my MIL since the group text asking when people are available. At this point I basically assume it's not happening.\n5. 3 PM, January first: MIL sends a group text asking if everyone can be there at 5. She says she will get deli subs and ice cream and everyone else can bring chips and drinks.\n6. Brother-in-law is the first to respond, stating that he's tired and can we please do something next week instead.\n7. I respond saying that I would have liked more notice, and also I thought it was a potluck and had been planning (when I thought the event was still happening) to cook an actual side dish.\n8. MIL replies saying that this *was* planned ahead of time, ostensibly in reference to my text saying we would be available today (but which she never replied to).\n\nThing is, my husband and I are just chilling at home reading and playing video games. We *could* go over there. But I am annoyed on principle by days of zero communication followed by a \"Hey, can you be here in two hours?\" text. I don't think it's entirely her fault; it looks like my siblings-in-law were being non-communicative as well, but I have no idea if she talked to them via some other method than the one group text I saw.\n\nEven when we do go over on short notice, things are chaotic: we show up and nobody else is there; it turns out they can't be there for another hour and we were not told. There are no plans for food and when people start getting hungry it inexplicably takes 20 minutes of back and forth (\"Hey everyone, what should we get to eat?\" \"I dunno.\" \"I dunno.\") to get everyone on board the same plan. We decide to play a card game but we have to sit around waiting while MIL runs around taking care of miscellaneous tasks, always saying, \"I'm almost done, I'll be there in a sec.\" Etc etc. \n\nI think I'd be comfortable with a day's notice and a firm arrival time. This is not the first time I've told her I would like a bit more advanced notice. I suspect she might not really get what I mean by that, and am considering calling her today to clarify. But my MIL seems to think that I'm being unnecessarily difficult and I'm worried that if I try to go into detail about the issue, she will perceive it as hostile.",

      "title": "AITA for throwing stones",
      "description": "Earlier today I was out on a cold walk with my wife in the countryside. The lake had frozen over, and I was absentmindedly throwing stones into it to make that weird sound that lakes make when you throw stones on them when frozen. A guy pulls up in his van, rolls down his window, and the following conversation happens:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim: \\[...\\] throwing stones in the lake?\n\nMe: Uhh what?\n\nHim: What the fuck do you think you're doing? They're expensive fish in there.\n\nMe: I'm sorry... I didn't think it would be...\n\nHim: You didn't think?? You're a grown man! Look at that fucking mess!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I didn't get to respond, as he drove on to turn his van around -- I'm glad I didn't, because what had occurred to me was \"They're just stones on an ice lake, it's not like I'm vandalising\". I think if I had said it, it would have only escalated the situation.\n\nA woman, who was walking with her family close by, asked me what he said \"He seems to have a problem with me throwing stones in the lake!\" I responded. At this point, I noticed that he was turning back and I didn't want to give him any more of a reason to be pissed off at me, so I pulled myself and my wife out of the way in anticipation of where he was going to be driving. We were now out of the direction of where his van could go and he stopped his van again and for the second time said something I could only catch the end of:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim: \\[...\\] run you over!\n\nWoman: What? You'll run me over?\n\nHim: No, I said \\_he\\_ should get out the way because I \\_don't\\_ want to run him over. Don't get fucking mouthy with me!\n\nWoman's husband: What did he just say to you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, the woman's husband appeared to be following the van and wanted some kind of conflict. My wife and I just left that area and walked off somewhere else; I didn't want to anything to do with that. It's not in my nature to want conflict over anything, not least of all over stones on a lake.\n\nSo here's the thing, the guy was confrontational and seemed to really want a fight with just about anyone. That said, him being confrontational by nature doesn't automatically make him an asshole, and certainly doesn't prevent me from being an asshole. I looked it up and found that apparently breaking ice with stones on a lake can indeed harm fish, so whether or not the guy handled it in the right way, he was right to call me out in doing something wrong. Not that I knew it would harm fish at the time. But the impression I had was that I was vandalising the lake with stones -- now admittedly they were large stones... like rocks... bigger than an apple I guess, but it has never occurred to me before that stones on a lake could be considered any kind of vandalism.\n\nI feel like the fish being \"expensive\", and the \"mess\" I made aren't really an issue. If I knew I was harming fish I wouldn't have done it. So I guess in addition to AITA, I guess my question is: Is it vandalism to throw stones, or even large rocks onto an ice lake?",

The flag offensive to us just like a nazi flag to germans. Anyways Koreans were going ham on in the comments like ‘go study some fucking history you fucker’ he didn’t seem to know what was the problem since none of the comments straight up told what was wrong there. Here he is clueless with a bunch of mad Koreans in his feed. I eventually dmed the guy and told him what was wrong. We talked through it all but although he showed some efforts, he could not hide his huge disappointment and upsetness. Even though he had made some efforts to make it work, eventually he decided he would scrap the whole project, and now I feel bad for ruining someone else’s project.

      "description": "Every two months they do random drug tests for my part of the company. I’ve been here for over two years and have been drug tested at least 10 times. \n\nI don’t do anything. I don’t smoke weed, drink regularly, pills, etc. \n\nI have three theories. My first theory is that they think I’m on drugs because I am kind of a skinny dude. I just have a small frame so I weigh less than average. Shoulders aren’t very broad kind of thing. People sometimes assume I am on drugs when I’m on the lighter side of my typical weight fluctuations.  I can understand that. \n\nMy second one is: when I was on second shift I worked with one other guy in the entire place. I was always pulled to get drug tested. One time the guy I worked with had a small accident on the fork truck that required a drug test. It was a Friday evening and he went and told the supervisor in the other building. Supervisor said he’d just call in the drug testing person Monday and do it then. The guy I worked with was like “I bet if it was OP you’d make him go now wouldn’t you?” And the supervisor was like “yeah, he just seems weird man.” Guy I worked with told him that he works with me every day and it’s just me and him and he knows for a fact I’m not on drugs. I am kind of quiet to people I don’t talk to much. \n\nThird: After drug testing me several times, they want people who can piss clean so it doesn’t make the company look bad. They hire a lot of dope heads sometimes and I’ve heard if you have so many people test positive that the company can get investigated or fined. \n\nI guess it just upsets me. I know they didn’t really like me at first. I’m not from the area and it’s a different culture here in the south than it was in the Midwest. I don’t really fit in and don’t have much in common with a lot of the people here so that kind of hinders what I can talk about with people. Plus I’m from a bigger city and like its just not really normal to sit around and bullshit all the time. I’ve got stuff to do and I don’t have time to sit around and BS all day. Nobody did that back where I’m from, but everyone does it here. \n\nI just feel like I’m constantly being judged for my appearance here. One of my supervisors thought it was kind of BS too. He’s from Florida and there’s a ton of overweight people around here. So it’s like if someone is a thinner / healthier weight it’s like everyone assumes that person is on drugs. \n\nI’ve always been self-conscious about my weight and it just hurts my feelings I guess. I’m not an unhealthy skinny. I mean I’m skinny but I’m not emancipated or malnourished looking. Just a smaller dude. \n\nSo AITA for being upset that I constantly get pulled for ‘random’ drug tests? There’s people that have been here 5x longer than I have and have never been drug tested. \n\n",

We don't have any kids, and I am still working while I am going places. \n\n\nI recently got married back in 2017 and have gone on plenty trips and vacations with my husband \\[34M\\], as well as traveling with another girl from work who is one of my closest friends. My husband and I have started to talk about kids and I feel like I haven't gotten the travel out of my system - but I realize it's time for me to start being an adult and stop going around to different states without him. \n\n\n\nMy friend and I have decided to plan one more trip to Europe in the coming months, and my husband is livid that he is not able to come - I don't want to invite him as he does not like the girl I am going with as well as he feels he needs to come to \"protect\" me from the danger that is in Europe. I have been to Europe 4 times and have never felt unsafe but understand I need to be vigilant. He is a different type of traveler than my friend and I - and while I love him - I feel like he will really drag the trip down with his depression, his overprotectiveness and his attitude towards my friend. He believes that I am choosing her over him - and I think in some ways I am choosing her style over his of traveling and company.\n\n\nI am saving for the trip, will not go into debt, and want to go on one last girl's trip before I start having kids.\n",

He was an extreme alcoholic and my mother ended up leaving him after it went a little too far. (Chased us out of the house while we carried all of our belongings in garbage bags while cursing and threatening to find where we're leaving too and kill us.)\n\nNearly 15 years have passed since then, and during this time he's never apologized for any of the things that he's done to us, he's now pretty much at rock bottom and all of his immediate family have left him, My mother feeling bad for him decided to invite him over for xmas dinner without consulting either me or my brother.\n\nShe told me about inviting him over this morning, and my brother and I were both extremely shocked and told her that we weren't comfortable having him here and that we would like him not to show up.\n\nMy mom then uninvited him, but I can't help feeling like i'm still the asshole as the dude is pretty much at rock bottom and has nobody else..\n\nAm I the asshole for making my mother uninvite him after she's already told him that he could come?

      "description": "So it was freshman year and I was constantly roasted by the same girl in my math class. If I spilled something on myself at lunch or had a hole in a pair of pants, I and the rest of the class would hear about it. This went on for a long time and seemed that she took a liking to singling me out in front of the class for one thing or the other. \n\nThis brings us to the day in question. This girl was big and very proud of it. Weight and looks were always off limits to me (although they weren't for her). She wore very form fitting clothing that would often accentuate her butt. This day she was wearing tight white pants made of the stretchy jean like material. I noticed as she was talking to her friend that there was a stain on the back/bottom of her pants. So seeing my chance I seized the opportunity to call her out in front of the class.  I figured she had just sat in something but to be truthful didn't have time to really think about it. She starts spinning around trying to look at her butt announcing to the class \"naw I don't have nothing on me\" then asking all her friends if I was indeed right. One of her close friends called her over to whisper something in her ear. After this, she started crying and ran out of the class. \n\nLater I found out from her friends that this was the time of the month for her. I felt bad afterward but the public shaming came to a halt directly after that for the rest of the year. Truthfully, had I known what it was I might have refrained from making it as public as I did. AITA? ",

      "description": "This is a repost because some cool people helped me realize I needed an edit/reformat to fit this sub better. Long read—sorry! \n\nI work in retail in a very high volume fancy tourist mall/casino hybrid. I’ve been working there since Black Friday of last year and generally loved working there. Fast forward to new year and my store manager (SM) and assistant manager (ASM) decoded they were ready to leave retail all together generally within the close time span of each other. Meanwhile another branch of the same brand in the city is closing because they didn’t make enough money to sustain. \n\nThe company decides to move management team from the closed store over to my store and they bring 6 of their associates. Good timing on their part there was a need on our end. They transition in or try to and in the meantime they rub everyone the absolute wrong way. \n\nTwo weeks in there’s a leadership meeting to get on the same page blah because they’re Outlet and our store is specialty so very different means of operation. Anyways, they ask for feedback on our part and I call them out on being lazy, absent on the floor (I.e disappearing out of the store for long smoke breaks), not cleaning after themselves/customers, answering FaceTime calls in front of customers all ON THE CLOCK GETTING PAID) of course everything is against policy and just plain terrible examples of management in general. \n\nAnyways, I also point out that an employee expressed feeling alienated by the new staff clique because they all were Hispanic and spoke Spanish 90% of the time they were on the floor in between customers and downtime). Apparently the new ASM didn’t like that, shut down in the middle of the meeting and tried to play the victim as if I was the racist one. First off, I speak 4 languages, one of which IS Spanish. Secondly, she proceeds to say I made HER uncomfortable for even suggesting she not speak Spanish at work. All I wanted to express was that while on the clock we should be considerate of EVERYONE not just those who are in her clique, speak the majority language being English because then it won’t make people alienated at work. \n\nWould I be the asshole for getting HR involved and getting it escalated to corporate? Since the meeting drama, they haven’t changed at all (literally she answered a FaceTime call in the middle of a rush yesterday) and now she’s giving me and my co workers the cold shoulder. The clique even whispers in Spanish now too which is petty AF by the way. And yet, the new people have majority of the hours scheduled now in spite of it being “performance based” according to my SM but they’re all just lazy motherfuckers who get paid more to do way less. “I’ve been in retail way longer than you’ve been alive”, my ASM brags. \n\nTLDR; new management team is lazy, plays favorites and my new assistant is giving me the cold shoulder because I called her out in front of everyone in a meeting. Debating getting HR involved. ",

      "description": "This happened like about a month ago but it still bothers me because of how brought up my family is in my daily life. So the whole situation goes that last summer when I was visiting my family in Kansas, I stay with my cousins almost everynight for about a week (5 boys). I'm a female teen but I never felt uncomfortable staying with them until one night one of my cousins made a sexual remark toward me and asked me to show him my privates which obviously made me extremely uncomfortable. Stupidly I didnt tell my aunt right away because I thought nobody would take me seriously or even believe me. So instead I just told him he was being weird and left the room to sleep somewhere else. I just avoided him completely for the rest of the trip and kept it in the back of my mind once I got home.\n\nSo back to this December. I went with my family to visit again and I had to stay there again. I was anxious about it but tried to keep it in the back of my mind. Of course though, my cousin notices and tells my aunt that I was avoiding him and wouldnt hang out with him. My aunt wants to talk with me and is telling me I'm being ridiculous. So of course I get emotional and call my mom to pick me up. My aunt doesn't like this and leaves me alone. I talked with my other cousins about how I felt she was treating me and how she was being completely immature and unhelpful about the situation (in the next room I heard her talking about it to my other cousins saying things like \"They're just boobs!\" and \"She's overreacting!\") She's done things like this in the past like insulting me (she always criticized my physical appearance like clothes and hair and even called me ugly once straight to my face) and my dad and always argues and picks a fight with him.\n\nMy dad agreed with me that she wasnt helping the situation and opened up to me about how he felt about her as well. I know she was just trying to stick up for my cousin and I do agree maybe I was being unreasonable for avoiding him like that when it happened last summer, but I really am tired of how she treats me and my family and I dont want to go anymore.\n\nSorry if this was long, I'm not the best writer. Please help me out here!",

      "description": "So I've never had that great of a relationship with my mother.  Ha! Reason being she is just a mean and unpleasant person when it comes to organizing and attending special events.  She got pissed and left my paternal grandfathers funeral because my brother didn't bring the boots for his kids that she had bought them.  She's pety.\n\nEvery holiday is the same.  My brother, his family, and my dad all have a pretty good time until she starts off.  It never fails that every year she gets mad about something trivial and goes off either yelling or ignoring everyone.  This year was no different.  The stuffing wasnt quite ready but we decided to just start eating anyway and this inferiorated her.  She sat in silence at the table and would get snippy and condescending if anyone tried to talk to her or cheer her up.  She ended up eating and going to sit by herself in the living room.  I tried to ask what was wrong and she just ignored me.  So I left.  I made it clear that it was her actions which made me leave.  My brother and dad tried calling me and when they couldn't reach me she drove to my house, knocked on my door, asked if I was sleeping and I said yes and then she just left...  I was expecting an apology but I guess she's to scared or whatever to admit she does this all the time and its finally accrued consequences for her.\n\nYesterday she texts me to see if I'd like to go out to breakfast with her and I ignored it.\n\nI also don't plan on going to our family Christmas.  I'm just sick of how she screams and yells or ignores everyone in a grumpy fit and makes everyone uncomfortable when we are just trying to have a good time.  She's never brought it up and when I try she just ignores me...  I don't know what to do other than just not go and save myself the stress.\n\nAITA for ignoring her and not wanting attend to holiday dinners anymore? ",

      "description": "On mobile so apologies for all that.\nAnyways I guess I should just jump into the story.\n\nI have two roommates who we’ll call M and L. We’re all in our early 20s.\n\nA few nights ago we were all hanging out and contemplating whether or not we wanted to go to a party, I should note that L had been pregaming before we’d even begun hanging out so she was already kind of drunk. M pulled me aside and told me that if we did go to the party she would be the designated driver. I thanked her and told her that would be great. \n\n(Keep in mind that no one had brought up driving arrangements by this point. She made the decision all on her own without us making her)\n\nAnyways we ended up going to the party and I had a really good time, I’m not much of a heavy drinker but I do like to drink enough to the point where I’m in that sweet spot where I’m relaxed and happy, L was also having a good time and got pretty trashed. M on the other hand didn’t have a good time (it sucks to be the sober person at a party).\n\nEventually L and M were ready to leave ( I was still in the party mood but I wasn’t about to appose) so we left.\nI was riding shotgun and L was half asleep in the backseat. This is when M starts going off on me.\n\nM says she didn’t like being the designated driver and that next time I would HAVE to be the designated driver. I kind of laughed it off a bit (probably the wrong thing to do since she was obviously mad but I was trying to lighten things up) I told her that while I’m not against being the designated driver it’s not something I’m really willing to be. I explained to her that when I go out to party I like to drink. I told her that she didn’t have to be the designated driver if she didn’t want to and we could just find someone else to do it next time. She didn’t say anything back but she clearly didn’t like my response.\n\nI understand that it’s not fun being the designated driver, but she volunteered to do it and then got upset over it. I find it especially annoying that she got upset with me in particular and demanded that I be the driver next time. This is the first time I’ve partied with her and I’ve decided that I’ll just find another ride for next time. Still I can’t help but wonder am I TA? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I'm a final year university student working part time and busy for most of my day like everyone else. Three weeks ago my friend, who lives around several hours away from the city we study in, went home to see her family. She was supposed to go for a week, but the next week she was nowhere to be found and did not go to her workplace without giving any notice. We (me and common friends) called and wrote her and she did not respond. I googled car crashes and found none, and she appeared online on facebook messenger so I assumed she must have had a dead relative or something. Pretty much \"she must have a working phone if she appears online so she chooses to not answer\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, for the next week and so I had other colleagues ask me if they heard anything about her. However, I always said I know nothing but I suspect she is fine, explained the dead relative theory and told other people to \"relax, everything is clearly fine, I googled and there were no car crashes etc.\". Another week passes and I mention this to my sister and she gives me the absolutely obvious advice to ask her brother. I obviously knew her brother, so I knew she had one. I take this advice and write him on facebook to ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out, she was in a car crash and was in a bad condition at a hospital, and there could be no visits. She luckily has her vitals in check and now I wait for the doctors to allow us to visit her. I found out her family announced one friend of hers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn retrospective, it's obvious that the messenger excuse I made up to myself is pure bullshit. Also, people give some notice when a relative dies, no one disappears like that. It's so painfully obvious now that she must have been in a car crash, and it's so obvious she announced that one friend I mentioned earlier and it's even more obvious that 1-2 days after her absence I should have asked her brother. I don't understand how I could bury my head in the sand like that. I keep telling myself how busy I was and how little a few weeks are but... it's bullshit. I lurked on reddit every night, I could have used my monkey brain for 3 seconds to seriously check on my friend. My actions have unfairly stopped others on checking on her, and she is a great person in a bad place. She does not deserve to think people do not care about her because I convinced people with some extremely sketchy arguments that she must be fine. Maybe if I acted like an adult weeks ahead we could have somehow helped but I didn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for actively hurting my friend with my stupidity and indiference? Do I deserve to have friends if I think so little about them?",

      "description": "It was definitely an asshole comment. More looking if my actions were justified. \n\nSo I was at Costco. I was checking out with approximately ten items in my cart. Nothing was exceptionally large but there was more than a handful. I pay for all of my things and I noticed that the person at the end of the checkout line who puts your stuff into boxes had put all of my things directly back I nto my cart. I reiterate, I didn’t have a lot of things, but it was enough that it would have taken me two or three trips in between my car and my apartment since nothing was bagged or boxed. As a result, I went to the next aisle (four feet away from the bagger), grabbed a box from under it and proceeded to fill the box with the items that I had just purchased which were sitting in my cart. I was able to fit all of my stuff into this box perfectly. The box was approximately 30” x 16” x 16” ( just to clarify). After finishing putting things into the box, I lost my receipt in the shuffle and had to find it in order to leave Costco. While looking through the box, the bagger looks at me and says, “did you forget something?” At that point I had just found my receipt. I turned around to him and replied in a very snarky and sarcastic tone, “thanks for bagging my stuff.” I turned around and walked out with my stuff. I know I made a rude comment. Were my actions justified or am I the asshole for telling a low wage employee to do his job?",

      "title": "AITA for forcing my way through a metro turnstile?",
      "description": "I live in Los Angeles and ride my bike to the metro every day for my commute.  To enter the platform area, there are 8 functioning turnstiles.  All of them are the standard kind with the 3 or so metal arms that rotate as you push through them and one of them is a double wide that has doors that fold open so that bicycles, wheel chairs and strollers etc. can get through.  People tend to take the path of least resistance, so when a train is getting out everyone tends to all exit through the double wide, which is not usually an issue.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy issue is every now and then, I have the unfortunate timing of getting to the station entrance right as a train is letting out.  It's often hard to tell if the train that's letting out is the direction I need to catch since the screens at the station are often down or not displaying the arrivals, and they usually come around the same time.  People will be exiting the platform only through the double wide and I am unable to get through.  The majority if not all of them could go through the other 7 turnstiles, but they just mindlessly pack themselves through the only one I can get through...and not just me, I've seen this happen to people in wheel chairs or parents with strollers.  There's often a lot of people exiting at this station, so waiting politely for everyone to exit could mean the difference between making or missing my train. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this time around and last time this happened as well, I kind of forced my way through.  I didn't just barrel through like an asshole and I also don't do this to people that seem like they need the double wide, but I waited for the people who were already moving through the double wide to finish, and then attempted to enter once those couple people were out saying \"excuse me\" nicely....but since people are so used to only going through that one, they still kept exiting...turning themselves sideways, awkwardly trying to squeeze through before I could get in, and I even bumped shoulders with a few.  They were looking at me like I was in the wrong, but I was trying to make it to my train, they had already arrived at their destination and there were 7 perfectly usable turnstiles for them to exit through.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen and experienced this issue on the stair case that leads down to the platform as well.  A train will have just gotten out, and the exiting people will take up both sides of the stairwell going up, and make people trying to get down to their train have to awkwardly force there way through.  In those cases I've started doing something similar...I'll start slowly at the top to give people just finishing their climb time to get off, but then I'll just start going down the right side of the staircase and if you run in to me or have to move, that's on you.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?",

      "description": "I'm 24 and have lived with my parents for basically my whole life. I've graduated from college now and am looking for a full-time job so I can move out. My relationship with my parents is pretty good most of the time, but it's really the little, dumb things like this that make me wish I could move out right this second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad has been an obnoxious eater for as long as I can remember. I mean, it's not like it's hardly noticeable - I'm talking open mouth chewing, smacking his lips all the time, talking with food in his mouth, slurps his soup, the whole gambit. In addition to all of the run-of-the-mill annoying eating habits, he also does this really dumb thing when he eats hot food, especially soups and stews, where after blowing on it, he sharply inhales while putting it in his mouth. I think it's a reflex to make the food seem not quite as hot, but as I've pointed out to him numerous times, it actually doesn't do anything to make the food not hot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a sense I can't really blame him for any of these tendencies, as his parents/my grandparents have similarly abhorrent eating etiquette. The problem is that listening to him eat basically ruins the experience of eating for me whenever we eat together, which is pretty much every night at dinner, plus lunch on the weekends. I love soup, but I hate eating it with him because of the disgusting noises he makes. I also try to avoid eating breakfast with him as much as possible because while I don't personally eat cereal, he does, and it's a similarly unpleasant experience for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad about this, because I know he probably can't help it and likely isn't aware of how loud he eats, which is why I never say anything to him. The biggest issue I take with it is that not only is he a loud eater, but he's also been hypocritical about it in the past. My brother (22) used to eat the same way when we were growing up, and I did as well to a lesser extent, and my dad was constantly criticizing us about it. My brother has for the most part grown out of it now, and while he still is noisy on occasion, his eating is nothing near as bad as what my dad's is like. I find the noises that humans make when eating, regardless of whether they're quiet or not, pretty gross regardless of who's making them, including my own eating noises. Because of that, along with my dad's criticism of my eating habits, I learned to be a lot quieter when I eat, and now the only time you'll ever catch me slurping my soup or smacking my lips is if it was a complete accident. So in a sense, I feel as though I've really improved my etiquette and noise level for my dad, and I don't think it's unreasonable for him to extend me the same courtesy, especially when it bothers me so much, yet I try so hard to not let it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My dad is a horribly loud eater and it annoys the ever-lasting shit out of me. I used to be the same way but I've reformed myself and wish he would do the same. WIBTA if I asked him to eat quieter?",

I never spend time with my brother and him inviting me somewhere is rare, so i say yes. I thought maybe he had something he had to talk with me about since honestly we barely even talk to each other that much. \n\nI tell my husband about my plans to spend time with my brother tomorrow and watch a movie. And well, he is really upset.

I dont want my family thinking my husband is super controling.\n\nSo... after how mad he is, i go to my brother and ask if we can change it to a family outing and go the 4 of us(me,husband,brother, and my dad) and watch Us on tuesday so we can all see it when its 5 dollars! They thought it was a great idea! And i go tell my husband to tell him we can all go together...\n\nand hes still mad.\n\nAnd he usual isn't controlling. He also said we was mad about me suddenly changing plans when we said we wanted that to be our next movie for tuesday. We watch movies every week and i didnt think it'd be a problem to watch with my brother on friday, then go watch it again on tuesday with my husband.\n\nHe said that he was going to watch Us with one of his friends. Then i said thats sounds good! Then he changed it to hes not going to watch it at all. And then now even saying he's going to watch Endgame by himself(which we have been anticipating for a long time). And I have a feeling like hes trying to get a reaction out of me.

      "description": "Backstory, Im 19, 6ft1 and I use tinder frequently. I also used to be really short, like up until 17 I was sub 5ft7 and got rejected because of my height more than once. Anyway, I matched with this girl Sandy on Tinder and we started talking a bit. A few messages in she asked me how tall I was, and I pretty much instantly knew where this was going. I checked her bio and sure enough, some stupid \"5ft10+ only\" bullshit was there. Anyway, I said 6ft1, and she seemed pleased. \n\nThen I asked her how tall she was, sure enough, she was only about 5ft2, to which I basically replied mocking her for going after tall guys, and I called her a \"picky midget\", which maybe was a bit out of line. Anyway, I started goofing on her, making a bunch of jokes about footstools, and calling her out for having those preferences. Also, she isn't the thinnest girl around, not fat or whatever, but anyway, I jokingly asked her what a fat girl was doing using numbers as dealbreakers, and she called me an asshole and unmatched.\n\n I feel like a bit of a dick, but those preferences are mad dumb though, and I think she kinda had it coming.",

She kept clawing my head, poking me, cooing at me in a shrill voice. I hated it. \n\nIt summoned some insecurities of feeling like a meek child, which she certainly believes even if she won't say it outright. I don't blame her for that, but it made the touching seem worse.\n\nThat and she had gone through a terrible breakup, so she was touch starved and lonely. Being touched instead of her romantic partner made this worse.\n\nI did tell her to stop (she didn't listen) and move away from her, but the bitterness remained. I felt like her purse dog.\n\nThe next week, I still feel like her purse dog. Whatever, I didn't bring it up as she visited. It went fine.\n\nThen she leaves and gives me a hug. Fine. It's a standard goodbye so I reciprocate. \n\nShe forgets something and comes back. She tries to hug me again.\n\nHer hugs are long and intimate, and I find them very uncomfortable. My bitterness at feeling like her purse dog returned, and I couldn't do it. I recoiled without thinking.\n\nI quietly reminded her that I never liked hugs, and she was like, ok. Then when she finally left, she did it again and I got so annoyed. I said goodbye, but it was obvious by my tone how annoyed I was.\n\nThis was never brought up again, but I still feel bad about it.

During my time there I was taking care of a lot customers and because we had quite a bit of a rotation in our departament most of them were contacting me directly with orders, enquiries etc.\n\nWhen I knew that I Will definetely quit the job I've sent an information in a reply to 2 foreign customers - exact quote:\n\n\n\"You are welcome to send new orders and enquiries, I will try to assist you with processing them, but please keep in mind that I will work at TheCompany only till 28.02\n\nAbout the additional discounts and project prices you can contact directly our Vicepresident of the Board (his mail is in CC) because he's a caretaker of your company after FormerEmployee departure at the end of 2018.\"\n\n\nAfter some time I received an e-mail from my boss:\n\n\"Don't write e-mails to customers in that form. Don't include information about the date of your and FormerEmployee departures. I don't like that.  I take that as making TheCompany look bad and that you're actions are not doing any good for it.

Day before my last day boss asked our IT guy to disable my accounts so I wouldn't be able to write 'farewell and thank you' e-mails to the customers I had most contact with. It ended that every one who e-mails me gets notice that my e-mail a count is disabled.\n\nSo what do you guys think, am I the asshole? \nThanks for reading. \n\n\nTL;DR sent an information about my departure from the company and boss got upset about it.

      "description": "A bit of background on my friend group: I'm a student (med proper), my two friends are unemployed, and one friend is employed. In our group of friends, we have an unspoken circular favor and debt thing going. For example, we all go out for the day, I'll pay for everyone's lunch, another friend will pay for everyone's dinner, and so on. We don't keep strict tally but we generally keep track by reminding each other who paid for which meal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're a pretty tight knit group and try to see each other as much as we can. Weekends, weekday dinners, and days we all have free are usually spent in each other's company. It took a while for me to notice but when I did, I became aware that our employed friend would usually beg off paying her turn because she had bills to pay or simply didn't have money at the time. This kept happening for a while and it came to a point where whenever we'd go out, she'd order two full meals plus a side or two AND THEN NOT FINISH EVERYTHING. She'd say that she was full or she overestimated how hungry she was and once, when this happened I said, \"that's fine, it's your turn to pay anyway.\" She just looked at me and tried to play cute and said that she didn't have any money because she bought clothes recently and would it be okay if she paid next time and could I foot the bill now. This made me pretty annoyed and another friend of ours picked up on my mood and offered to pay. I was still annoyed because they were unemployed and I knew my friend was having family problems but I saw that she was trying to keep peace so I said nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that though, I made an effort to do things in such a way that I would never have to pay for her food or whatever she'd spend while with us. If we all wanted coffee, I'd offer to pay for the drinks of the two and then say I don't have enough for everyone and she'd have to pay for herself. If we went out to eat, even if it wasn't my turn, I'd offer to pay for at least one friend on the grounds of owing her money or as a payback for a favor she'd done for me before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an additional note, I've brought this up to the other two and they've said they noticed this behavior before but just let it go because whenever we would bring it up, she'd give us a sob story about something in her life. The one time I brought it up, she cried and said I wasn't being fair and playing favorites towards the other two.",

      "description": "My housemates dog is an 11 month old boxer who has pretty reasonable levels of anxiety, shes not a dangerous nervous, shes just very visibly uncomfortable in certain situations.\n\nShe doesnt like alcohol, in fact after my other housemates 21st, the dog wouldnt even step foot on the verandah to go outside to pee until after i hosed it down to get the smell off.\n\nShe doesnt eat properly (though im finding the problem might have more to do with the fact her owner is cooking her meat instead of leaving it raw. She wont eat biscuits)\n\nAnd, while shes accustomed to being alone, (before i and the other housemate moved in the dog would spend 8 hours a day home alone) she isnt a fan.\n\nShes VERY afraid if yelling of any kind and i gt the feeling thats a result of her owners ex having been physically abusive (i cant confirm if she ever yelled at or hit the dog).\n\nLast night the owner (O) got very drunk as she has been since i moved in. Her ex broke up with her and she hasnt been coping. And the dog went into my room, and would not leave again. It was 2am, i didnt want to fight it and honestly, if the dog doesnt feel safe with her owner right now, im not going to argue with her.\n\nWhen O came to get the dog, she resisted, but eventually left. And i could here O swearing, presumably at the dog, when she got to the hallway to her own room. Ive never heard O swear at the dog before, but im not sure ive seen her that drunk before either.\n\nBasically, if the dog continues to try and sleep in my bed, im not going to fight it. O can come get her, i dont care. Its her problem that shes scaring the dog, im just providing a safe space for her. Im not encouraging her to stay, im not playing with her while shes here, or patting her, or talking to her. Im just letting her lay at the end of my bed.\n\nI feel like its going to cause a problem, that the dog is sticking by me, but, im not sure if i am the asshole for letting the dog stay here, or if i should be making more of an effort to get her to go with O. I dont know.\n\nThe dog IS safe here, im going to make that clear. She is safe, this is a good home for her, its just a bit of a tough time for O and she doesnt realise the affect she has on everyone around her when she starts getting as low as she is and acting the way she has been.\n\nIm already planning on calling some people who can do unwilling admin for mental health when i feel like shes a danger to herself, but right now. Im just worried about the dog.\n\nAITA for letting the dog sleep on my bed, despite the owner feeling like she should be sleeping with her instead.",

      "description": "Today, in my kinesiology class, the professor is talking about how companies are required to put any of the top 8 allergens on food labels if their food contains any. She then asked the class if they can list any of them. At this moment, I’m recalling a friend from high school who was deathly allergic to nuts and chocolate. It was so bad that he carried an EpiPen everywhere. So the class is near silent and I say “chocolate... nuts.” Most of the class starts laughing, and then I realize that my timing was accidentally absolutely perfect for it to sound sexual.\n\nWhat makes it even worse is that me and one other person in the class are the only ones that actually have “chocolate nuts,” making it seem like I’m referencing my own genitalia. Luckily, the professor snickered a bit and continued with class without making a big deal about it. I’m glad I’m half black and can’t turn red or else that would’ve been even worse.\n\nSo I’m just wondering, with today’s political climate and the completely inappropriate setting for such a comment... am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I follow a somewhat small youtuber on twitter (They have about 100 subscribers) and one day I get a random message from someone who also follows them (Let's call them Sherry). Sherry says she got randomly blocked by the youtuber (Which I will refer to as Daniel) on all platforms and wants me to to talk to him so he would explain why she was blocked. However, I call them out for being obsessive over Daniel since they contacted a random stranger for help. Sherry admits that they are and says that she suffers \"a bit\" from anxiety.\n\nI figure it's not a big deal to send Daniel a message since all Sherry wants is an explanation, so I tell him what happened. Daniel explains to me that Sherry thought he was toxic and that he didn't want to be around people that thought he was toxic. So, I tell Sherry what he told me and in return I got a couple messages from her saying \"I always try to apologize\", \"I don't know what I'm gonna do\", \"He's one of my few friends\", and \"God why am I so fucking dumb\". I go back to message Daniel again, showing a screenshot of the messages Sherry sent me and he responds \"I don't know what I can do\" and \"They will have to get over me\". I tell him to try unblocking her and sending a quick message to help patch things up. However, he says that he wants to move on from the situation. So I tell Sherry that he doesn't want to talk, she proceeds to say \" Just please tell him that I'm sorry\" and \"It's just that I struggle talking to people sometimes\". At this point I am getting sick of being a messenger between these people, so I try to explain to Daniel why Sherry can't get over it.\n\nI try to explain to Daniel several times that if Sherry truly does suffer from anxiety then it may be hard for her to get over some things and that he could help by doing a couple small things like sending a couple messages or unblocking her. I also point out that he could just block Sherry again if she doesn't change. However Daniel refuses then says that it's not his problem and that famous people have fans like this that they don't have to deal with. I decide to call him out and say that he doesn't care for his fans since he won't do something small for someone and that he would also be upset if he was put in the same situation. He never responded to me and I don't know if Daniel ended up unblocking Sherry.",

      "description": "I dont see the point in the invites because everyone thats coming Ive already told the date, time and place. I told her this and she said she’ll order 150 anyways, i explained the place the christening is being held only holds 120 and she still insisted on ordering 150, i said whatever and asked her to write a list of everyone in my partners family so I could sort out numbers along with my family. She did and the list is 100+ people long, i asked if this was all blood related as im doing them first and she said no but since my partner has known them his whole life they HAVE to be invited. I explained to her that Im doing invites for blood related family first, my partner and I’s godparents and then whatever numbers are left we will share out between friends. \n\nTo say she wasnt happy is an understatement. She told me that its abit rude to not invite the people my partner has always known, I told her thats our decision and not hers. She let this subject go and stated when she orders the invites shell keep half and give me half. I said no because shes just argued with me about whos being invited so not a chance am i going to let her write out invitations.\n\nI told her ill write out the invitations for blood relations and godparents and then whatevers left ill give half to my partner to choose who else he wants there and if that doesnt include his mams work friends then they wont be coming and shell just have to deal with that. She didnt like that idea and stated that since she is buying the invitations she should get to write them out, i told her the invitations are pointless but since she insists on ordering them anyways she can but she will not be writing them out. I also have a feeling shell order way more than what the room holds so i told her if she orders more than 120 then whoever turns up that wasnt on our list will be turned away as they wont fit. She still thinks that because shes ordering the invites she should choose who they go to, i flipped and asked who actually gave birth to the one whos being christened and whos actually paying for the whole thing, not just some stupid invites that we dont even need so who really gets to decide whos invited? and she walked out upset. \n\nShe told my partner im being unreasonable. He agrees with me that its upto us whos invited but he also said i was abit of an asshole on what i said about who gave birth to him etc, i agree with that i couldve been abit nicer about that but shes so overbearing its unbelievable. \n\nSo reddit, AITA for wanting to be the one who decides who gets invited to MY sons christening?

It was kind of comforting I didn’t have to worry about grossing him out.

But now I see he’s way more comfortable than I am on other bodily functions and the discrepancy is getting hard to take. He’s constantly unapologetically farting and recently he’s really gotten into picking his nose. Just jamming his finger in there and digging. Doesn’t matter if I’m eating. He knows it grosses me out because I’ve expressed it. He also gets upset if he hears my stomach make noises and he thinks I’m holding in farts, but I’m just not comfortable farting in front of anyone. I asked him not to pee in the shower because if I take a bath I don’t want to feel like it’s in his toilet. He said no he won’t stop. We just aren’t on the same page, and I’ve told him how I feel and he’s not budging. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I recently got engaged and took some time off to visit our parents and start planning. First stop was mine and then his.\n\nI suffer from chronic pain and take a variety of meds which cause a decrease in appetite and nausea. I haven’t disclosed my illness to my in-laws, but a few nights ago I could hear her complaining about how I’m too good to eat what they cook. I let it go.\n\nYesterday, fiancé took me around his hometown. On the way back, he remembered to get beer, but we were already pulling into the driveway. I was tired, so he dropped me off. His parents were waiting for me in the living room, angry.\n\nFuture mother-in-law - FMIL: You really think you can pull the wool over our eyes, don’t you? You think you can bring drugs into our house?!\n\nMe: *motioning to a seat because my legs hurt*\n\nFMIL: No no! You stand! How dare you bring this disgusting bullshit into our house!\n\nI reach for my cellphone and she yells at me to keep my hands at my side.\n\nFMIL: I don’t care how legal this stuff is. We don’t allow this garbage in our house! *She pulls out a plastic wrapped package and I immediately know what it is.* My husband took a bite out of it and got sick! \n\nI’m pissed off right now because this was at the bottom of my luggage! And then she starts going off about how many pills I take (again, wouldn’t know if you hadn’t gone through my stuff) and how her son doesn’t deserve a druggie. She takes my package and shows me where FFIL took a few bites and threw up soon after.\n\nIt’s been 10 minutes and my fiancé is back. His mom asks him if he knows all the medication I’m on and how I brought pot into their house. He can’t get a straight answer about how they know about my medicine, but then he glances at the package and just sighs.\n\nFiancé: Mom, it’s soap. Even says African Black Soap.\n\nHe broke off a piece, headed to the kitchen, and washed his hands with it, showing them the lather. FMIL fired back saying that she’s never seen soap like that and that this doesn’t explain the amount of meds I take. They say they’re justified in what they did because they want the best for their son and since it’s their house they can go through personal belongings at will.\n\nI let them have it. I start screaming and cussing because I’m exhausted and tired. I can’t remember everything I said, but my throat has been a mess from all of the screaming. FFIL tried to give me back the soap, but I kind of threw it at him saying I didn’t want his gum disease. Terrible, I know.\n\nWe’re staying at a hotel and not talking to his parents. I feel I could have gone about it better. I wanted a good relationship with my in-laws and we’ve always kind of gotten along... now I feel like I fucked up badly.\n\n**TL;DR: future in-laws went through my luggage and mistook soap for an edible. I cussed them out and offended them and now I feel like I burned a major bridge.**\n\n[Soap](https://imgur.com/a/fEIZw69)",

      "description": "I met a girl through a volunteer group and lately we've been becoming closer friends. I also introduced her husband to my fiance and they became fast friends as well, so we've been hanging out a lot lately, going out to brunch, etc. \n\nMy first name is Sara. I pronounce it like most people do, with the first syllable rhyming with \"Air\". And I guess she had never seen it written down before, because like two months ago I texted her from my fiance's phone and said \"Hey this is Sara,\" to let her know it was me, and the next time she hung out she was like \"Ohhhh I never knew your name was spelled without the H! Did you know that Sara-without-the-H is actually pronounced *Sara*? (first syllable rhyming with \"bar\")\" And I was like \"Uhhhh no I did not, I don't think that's true--\"\n\nAnd my dudes, she has been calling me Sah-ra ever since. Every single time. Even after I told her to please not do that she just answered back \"Well it's pronounced that way when it doesn't have the H.\"\n\nI seriously hate it. Not only do I think I should be able to dictate the pronunciation of my own name, I just think \"Sah-ra\" sounds so pretentious. It is not like I am over here saying \"Oh yeah my name is Ashley but it's pronounced Katie.\" And now I don't even want to hang out with her because either I will have to answer to the incorrect pronunciation of my name the whole time, or I will get into a standoff about it that she will never back down on. My fiance says that my friend doesn't respect me if she won't say my name how I would like it to be said, but my mom has told me not to be so petty and that I should be happy someone wants to be my friend. This girl was the closest friend I had in this state so far and it feels wrong to end things over a name. But I *do* feel disrespected and she has refused to back down on this. AITA if I tell her to say \"Sair-a\" or lose my number, and follow through?",

      "description": "I'm gay and have no intention of ever coming out. I have a fake boyfriend who's also gay.\n\nI've had this friend since I was 14 and basically been in love with her since I was 16. I'm almost 20 now. I always knew she was gay too even though she never told me. Luckily, nobody ever suspected we were gay because we don't \"look gay\".\n\nWe were hanging out in a park like two weeks ago. She just suddenly randomly came out to me. She seemed really nervous and was like \"And I...\" and went quiet.\n\nI assumed she was just going to explain more about how she's gay, so I tried to spare her the discomfort by saying I understood what she wanted to say.\n\nThe rest of the conversation was something along the lines of:\n\nHer: \"You know?\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, I've kind of known for years\"\n\nHer: \"You should have told me\"\n\nMe: \"I just wanted to wait until you felt comfortable enough to tell me instead\"\n\nShe started kinda stumbling over her words and said something like, \"Is it the same for you too?\" I can't remember exactly how she phrased it, but it was in a really awkward, vague way.\n\nI hesitated a lot, but I forced myself to just say yes because I trust her.\n\nThat somehow led to her kissing me in the park IN PUBLIC, and I freaked out. I panicked and looked around to make sure no one I knew was there and was like \"Why would you do that?\"\n\nI just went into full-on closeted denial mode and was like \"I can't believe you just did that, I'm not gay, I have a boyfriend\" etc.\n\nShe looked on the verge of tears and apologised and made up an excuse to leave.\n\nLater that day, I texted her that I was sorry for freaking out on her, but she didn't reply. She also started avoiding me for days.\n\nMy friend has a very close friend. (I'll call her \"Emily\".) I asked Emily if my friend was ok, and she told me my friend spoke to her about the situation. She said it was a misunderstanding because when my friend asked if I was the same, she was apparently asking me if I had feelings for her, but that I must have interpreted it as meaning something else.\n\nShe said my friend wishes I'd let her down gently instead of rejecting her the way I did, and that it was really humiliating for her.\n\nAlso, Emily somehow figured out I was gay from the story. I was very anxious because I was worried she'd tell someone. My family and most of my friends are extremely homophobic.\n\nIf it was ok for me to be gay, then I'd definitely want to be in a relationship with my friend. But it's not, and I'll lose everyone I know. Plus, I don't wanna end up in Hell if it exists.\n\nHowever, I also don't want to lose her as a friend because I care about her a lot.\n\nI'm pretty upset with my friend for telling Emily about what happened because Emily then realised I was gay. I'm also upset that she kissed me in public because someone we know could have seen.\n\nMy friend is hurt and embarrassed by the way I acted and is still avoiding me.\n\nAm I in the wrong here, is she, or are we both in the wrong?",

      "description": "I finished a writing class around 2 weeks ago where I had passed every assignment with near perfect scores, so I was caught way off guard when my final essay score came out to be a failing grade. I emailed my teacher to see if we could meet up and talk about it, and she explained that she was off-campus until the end of semester. \n\n  \nI ask if we could talk about my grade over email instead, since I wanted to know what I got points off on. Turns out, the physical copy of the essay I handed in didn't have my citations bolded and my thesis / topic statements underlined (this is a college level class but my thesis needs to be underlined like I'm just learning about them?) however, my digital copy did. At this point, I ask if I could get any of the points back, and she tells me to follow up at the start of next semester. \n\nAdmittedly, I ignore her - by next semester, she wouldn't be able to change my grade, would she? Wouldn't it be better to get it done now if the problem was so simple? I continue to email her for more information. She does prefer physical copies over digital, but since our class had trouble printing out our essays, she had mentioned in class that not handing in a physical copy was fine. I had submitted the digital copy with all the requirements, but handed in the physical copy as extra. In conclusion, she had graded the physical copy, and had taken off half of the total points for not having the requirements there, although my digital copy that was submitted at the same time did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFair enough. I thank her for the clarification and ask her again if there was any way I could get the points back. She responds to me with the following: (direct quote since I don't want twist her words)\n\n\"I must point out the irony. You lost those points due to a failure to follow directions. You are also currently refusing to follow my direction to follow up with this at the start of next term. If you learn anything from this, and I promise it is a skill that will serve you well in the future, it is that it is important to follow directions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stop pushing it. I apologize for being persistent and inform her that I would email her in a month, but I can't get it out of my head. \\*Technically,\\* she never said that she would grade the physical copies over the digital ones, though it could have been inferred by the fact that she always graded the physical copies in the past, but it's not like I didn't fulfill the requirements on time, since my digital copy was complete. I'm worried she can't change my grade by next semester, so I'm thinking of emailing the head of department just to see if the grade change is possible next semester (avoiding talk about the email chain as much as I can) but I'm still on the fence, since I feel like I'm being too persistent and forceful about the topic. AITA?",

      "description": "Ok, so this happened about 25 years ago, but it's been kinda eating at me ever since.  \n\nMy friend Kevin was a bit of a dick to women (yeah, I didn't choose great friends at the time).  He was never abusive and to my knowledge has never assaulted anyone.   However, he was known to be *very* aggressive when it came to sex, and had a bit of trouble taking no for an answer.  Again, to my knowledge he never assaulted anyone, but many women have said that no matter how many times they said no, he would just Not.  Stop.  Trying.  And if you didn't put out on that date, very likely there wouldn't be a next date.  \n\nSo my cousin lets me know that she's interested in him.  I knew she was sexually active, but I also knew she was very selective in who she slept with and wouldn't hop in bed with just anyone until she was absolutely ready to.  I let her know of Kevin's reputation, and she assured me she was a big girl that could handle herself.  If there was no \"next date\" because she said no, then so be it.  \n\nAs a largely-related side note, my cousin was known to be a bit of a liar who would blow things out of proportion.   While I've never known her to make up such a serious and possibly life-ruining accusation, she has been known to lie to get revenge on people she felt did her wrong.  As an example, she once called an ex-friend's boyfriend to tell him she was cheating on him.  She wasn't.  \n\nAgainst my better judgement, I introduced them.   They went on two dates.  I do not know what, if anything, happened on those dates, but both of them seemed to be enjoying each other.  On the morning after the 3rd date, I get a call from my cousin, who is crying hysterically to the point where I cannot understand all of what she's saying.\n\nShe basically told me that she wanted me to beat Kevin up.  At first, I figured that this was a situation of him wanting sex, her saying no and getting dumped for it, then calling me up and wanting me to beat him up out of revenge.  This was not the case.  From what I was able to put together, apparently they were fooling around quite heavily and at one point ended up naked.  She didn't outright say they had sex, but that was what was heavily implied -- if not intercourse, at least some kind of oral sex or something.  All she kept on saying was something to the tune of \"I didn't want to go that far\".  \n\nAt this point, I'm thinking he raped her.   Screw beating him up, I want this asshole in jail.   I kept trying to say things like \"Do you want me to take you to the hospital?\", \"Do you want to call the police?\".  Stuff like that.  She didn't seem to want to talk to me about it, but I wanted her to talk to *someone.*\n\nShe refused.  Her story started getting a lot more ambiguous from there.   I asked her if he made her do anything she didn't want to do.  \"No.  But he should have known.\".  I asked her if she told him and got an answer along the lines of \"we were fooling around and suddenly we had no clothes on and....\", followed by \"I didn't want it to go that far\".  \n\nAbout 5 minutes into this conversation and it became almost impossible to tell if I was dealing with a case of someone who has a reputation for being over-aggressive and escalating to taking what he wanted by force, or if I was dealing with a case of a woman who had consensual sex and just regretted it the next morning  -- or didn't have sex at all and was making a false rape accusation as revenge for being dumped..  My gut was (and still is) leaning towards the former, but since she refused to go to the police or go to the hospital, there wasn't much I could do to help her.  There's also the fact that some bits of her story didn't add up, and while I've never known her to make up such a serious accusation, I can't say that her making up the story without realizing the seriousness of what she was accusing him of is entirely out of the question either.   She was definitely smart enough to know better, but we were teenagers and teenagers don't always make the best decisions, or fully understand the consequences of their actions.  \n\nI never talked to Kevin again after that day.  I had never heard of him having similar incidents with other women (outside of trying too much, and dumping them if they said no).   The last I heard is that he got married years ago and moved several states away.  My cousin and I never spoke of Kevin, that phone call, or the incident again.    The relationship between my cousin and I was never really the same after this, and we no longer speak, but that's largely for reasons that are 100% unrelated to this story.  \n\nIt eats at me because I'm not sure if someone I knew got away with rape or if my cousin was a step away from making a false rape accusation.    I have a lot of trouble believing she made it up out of revenge, but given some of her past actions, it's not entirely out of the realm of possibilities.  I also have a lot of trouble believing he would resort to rape, but a lot of rapists start off the same way he did, so again...not entirely out of the realm of possibilities.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not reporting this?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "About 10 minutes go, I sent an ex-friend a decent length DM over Reddit that was very much hateful. This was because he used me and friends as his own ego charger and sent us all a doc titled, \"I Used You All\" which was him coming out and saying he used us all for his ego, he then blocked and unfriended my best friend, who was on the verge of tears because of how awful it felt to be used and the other friend cried because of all the memories he had with this guy I mentioned. The \"using\" went on for almost a year.\nAfter I sent the message, I started thinking that maybe it was wrong of me to send that message because it was a lot of hate and started feeling a little bad and had second thoughts about deleting it. So, am I the asshole here?",

I was fine with it.\n\nIt’s been more than 3 months since then, and I’ve asked them personally for a refund. Reason being that they never updated me about the item until I asked, and said they’ll text again, but didn’t. They’d say that “it’ll be coming in one week”, but 9 days later and I still have nothing. I’m basically tired of the wait and lack of responsibility.\n\nI’m concerned that if I report to the police (if they don’t wanna give a refund and continue pushing for me to wait), I’ll be pulling a huge asshole move lol, but at the same time I just think it’s justified. The shirt’s $20, and it’s actually my second time buying the same shirt because my mother destroyed it before and refused to pay (another story for another sub, for another time). \n\nSo yeeeee I was intending to wear it for school which is on the 8th of April, when I should have received it around the 14th of February. \n\nWIBTA?

      "title": "AITA for wanting my roommates to ask if they can use my parking spot?",
      "description": "TLDR at the bottom\n\nOk, some background. I live in a major city and parking is a pain &amp;/or expensive, with residential parking and no guest permits. The nearest public lot is pretty far away. When I first moved in, my roommate (1 of 3 roommates, the others don’t have cars) and I both had a car, and we rented “tandem” spots from our landlord. I put “tandem” in quotes because it’s kind of crammed and you “can” put two cars in but it’s awful and he only rented it to us because we live together and were kind of able to make it work. My roommate ended up asking the landlord for a different spot because she hated it so much, and then selling her car after about 2 months of living there (that’s fine, she worked it out with our landlord and it’s off the lease). \n\n\nI said that guests can park in the “tandem” spot but have made it clear MANY TIMES that I want to be asked if they can park (I have friends that come over and need to park, and bottom line, I pay for the spot). We’ve lived here for 1.5 years and for the most part everything was fine - I park in the spot every day and occasionally roommates would ASK if a guest could also park. All great. \n\n\nThen. Roommate 1 gets a boyfriend. I come home one day and there’s a car in my spot (taking up the whole spot) that I am unaware of. It turns out to be her boyfriend. I should have said something to her then, but I didn’t want to make the bf feel awkward (because it’s not his fault) and I had places to be. Now, yesterday she texts me and TELLS me that he’s parking there and to let her know when I get home so we can switch cars around since he wasn’t staying the night. As soon as I read the message I was LIVID. She’s a writer and very conscious about how she words things - she did not ASK me and it was very intentional. Honestly I LOST it. I blew up at her about how she and one of the other roommates only think about themselves and all I’m asking for is for them to be courteous enough to ask me to use MY parking spot. That’s all I want!!! She said that I was being aggressive and rude (kind of valid, but I don’t care - I am mad) and said that “There are two parking spots and you pay for one of them. I thought telling you was being courteous.” - it’s NOT 2 parking spots. It’s 1.  It’s been 1 parking spot for a year and a half. ADDITIONALLY. If I did not rent my “1” parking spot, the landlord would rent it to someone else and then she wouldn’t be able to park anywhere.\n\n\nI tried to talk to her about it earlier but she called it a “guest parking” spot and I LOST it again. I know that Roommate 1 and 2 think that I’m being a dictator about it, and I know I’m overreacting a little, but I still believe I am 100% right. ADDITIONALLY #2 - the phrase “guest parking spot” has just come up, after living here for 1.5 years. The verbiage from everyone has always been that it’s “my spot” (because, reminder - I’m the one that pays for it!!) and now that Roommate 1 needs it more for her BF she’s trying to justify that she shouldn’t need to ask!\n\nI’ve had similar problems with Roommate 2 (blocked me in when I had places to go, etc). \n\n\nIs it really SO much to be asked? I pay for it, and I park there every day. \n\n\nTLDR; I want my roommates to ASK if a guest can park in my spot. Roommate says she shouldn’t need to ask and that her letting me know at all is being “courteous”",

      "description": "The title is a bit misleading, since we're (best) friends first and lovers second, but I wanted to give as much information as possible. Before Tom met me, he was really close friends with a girl named Mary. Mary had obvious feelings for him, and at the time he thought he might also feel the same way about her, but then quickly decided that there was too many incompatibilities between them and sat her down to go over every reason why he didn't want to date her.\n\nThey stopped talking for a while and we got closer, but then Mary contacted him out of the blue and they started hanging out/being friends again. I didn't think anything of it until Mary started telling our friends and acquaintances that she and Tom were dating. Tom told me flat-out that it wasn't true, but he thought it was a funny joke to play on our friends since he and Mary were so close (???). I told him that she obviously still has feelings for him and he told me \"Yet I reject all of her advances, and spend all of my time with another girl (me)\". Mary still obviously has feelings for him, Tom has told me several times that he isn't interested and this whole situation makes me uncomfortable, especially since our other friends didn't know.\n\nSo I decided that our friends had the right to know that the relationship wasn't real and told most of them, which seemed to upset Tom because he said I was \"ruining\" his fun. Since then I've not done anything sexual with him, keep our conversations short, and hang out with him much less frequently, but Mary has also been somewhat hostile with me and has accused me of being \"jealous of their friendship\" and \"punishing Tom by spending less time with him\".\n\nAITA for telling our friends about this and distancing myself from him?",

      "description": "A few years back i met a really wonderful woman who quickly became a good friend. From the beginning i could tell she was into me but i was dating someone else at the time, and even though we were in an open relationship i wasnt really interested in anyone else so I made it clear i wanted to be friends. My ex broke up with me in september and it was really hard on me, and the woman i mentioned before was there for me in a really great way. She never pushed an agenda on me and was just very kind the whole time. \n\nSo that brings us to to the present. Ive been feeling better recently and have been going on dates/sleeping around. This woman made it clear that she was interested in me recently, and we went on a dinner date, drank a couple glasses of wine and eventually ended up going back to my place and making love. I really enjoyed the date and do love this woman, and could see myself dating her. But the problem was I wasnt attracted to her body(she has a pretty face, i should mention). I know i could get over it, and have a lot of guilt around feeling like this amazing woman who loves me from a sincere place is only non compatible because of her appearance. \n\nSo i havent said anything to her yet, but i feel like if she wants to come to the gym with me and learn a few excersises and work out a couple few times a week i would be much more attracted to her body. AITA for feeling this way? \n\nThanks for reading ❤",

      "description": "This happened in Spain. I am an American who was driven to a carnival with another American friend by a Spanish friend of mine. I had gone out previously many times with just the Spanish friend, she was adventurous and fun and we would have tapas and go to concerts or just commiserate about our coworkers together. All three of us wanted to go to the carnival, and my Spanish friend graciously agreed to drive me and my friend although she hadn't met my friend before. We get to the carnival, park and head over, everything is peachy. We go to meet up with my Spanish friend's sister and her sister's boyfriend. We're sitting with them at a picnic table for awhile behind a food stand, getting to know each other. My American friend and I decided we wanted to get something to eat, nobody else was hungry so the two of us get up and go around to the front of the food stand we had all been sitting behind. As soon as we round the corner, we see a huge line for this particular food stand. We stand in line for a little while, but this being a carnival, there are plenty of other food stands and they all were serving pretty much the same things. My friend and I decided to walk over to a neighboring stand to wait in a much shorter line and make things easier on our Spanish friends so they wouldn't have to be waiting on us for a long time. I sent my Spanish friend a text just saying that we were heading over to a neighboring stand but would be back soon, so she wouldn't come looking for us and have no idea where we went. Not 5 minutes later, my friend and I are waiting at the second food stand and my Spanish friend comes up to us, bristling with anger, shouting at me. I asked her calmly what was wrong and she said \"I drove you here and the first thing you do is abandon me! It's fine if you wanted to get food at a different stand but should have told me to my FACE, not via text!\" She went on and on and continued long after my friend and I had gotten our food and followed her back to the picnic table. The Spanish friend said her sister was shocked at our attitudes, that she was shocked, everyone thought we had done this huge disrespectful thing by not taking the time and going all the way back to the table to tell them in person that we were heading elsewhere, since the whole move in the first place was to save them time from waiting on us. My Spanish friend said she was surprised and she thought I was respectful, especially since she had driven us there, and started making comments like \"I don't know about your friend\" (who was sitting right there) \"but I expected more from you!\" \n\nMy American friend and I were basically sitting there shocked the whole time since we had absolutely no bad intentions, we were just trying to save everyone time and were not planning on abandoning anyone, rather the opposite. Although I didn't understand why my Spanish friend was so upset, I realized I had hurt her feelings in some way so I apologized. Over and over. But she would not accept my apologies, and only continued to berate us. It was highly uncomfortable and confusing, especially since she hadn't exhibited this type of behavior at any point before. I have lived in Spain for three years and I recognize that there are cultural differences and differences in Spanish and American values, but it is still something that bothers me to this day, especially since the Spanish friend and I stopped talking after that. AITA? Why did I lose a friendship over this? I meant no harm. Please tell me your opinions, reddit. Thanks in advance! ",

      "description": "This is more of a was I the asshole. I started freshman year with a new roommate and quickly realized that our sleep schedules aren't compatible. I liked to get all my work done and go to sleep from 12-1(2 ish at the latest). She liked to go to bed from 3-5 am ish. I woke up around 9:15 am except for 1 day on thursdays when I woke up at 7:45 for an 8am. She woke up at variable times. Sometimes before me and would wake me up to the alarm(very sensitive to noise) and sometimes later.\n\nCONTEXT: I have an anxiety disorder and a major trigger is feeling out of control. Probably some cPTSD from waking up to my parents arguing in the middle of the night(father was verbally abusive, there's a whole lot to this). I was unaware that I had these things as these events were occurring.\n\nAt first I \"let\" her study in the room with her desk light on until I realized that the light was keeping me from sleeping and the typing was causing my anxiety to go haywire. I asked her to study outside the room after I went to sleep and she agreed. I still had issues sleeping but I thought it was manageable.\n\nThe last two weeks of the semester I got a concussion that made me able to sleep through anything during the weeks I was there. The concussion also prevented me from taking my exams so it was pretty serious. During winter break I healed and started having trouble falling asleep. I came back to school and the opening of the door constantly when she came back into the room and prepared for bed and the brief times she would turn on the desk light woke me up and/or didn't let me sleep. I took a melatonin for the first time to see if it would make me sleep and it didn't. My roomate came back into the room arpund 4 amand I gave up and decided to kill myself. But I didn't cuz my roomate took me to the hospital. I took a medical leave.\n\nNobody has ever given me a straight answer on whether or not I was being unreasonable or not when I asked her to study outside of the room after 12.  Also, if its reasonable for a roomate to go to bed consistently from 3-5 am? So was I the asshole?\n\nTdlr: I have anxiety. My anxiety dislikes it when other people disrupt my sleep schedule. Roommate consistently disrupts sleep schedule. I ask her to do things more my way. My concussion fucks with my anxiety which in turn fucks me all the way up and I leave school.",

      "description": "Context:\n\n- I have been married to my wife for 8 years.\n- We have three children between the ages of 4 and 9.\n- My wife used to be in a gay relationship.\n- My wife has an auto-immune disease which can leave her bed-ridden for extended periods.\n- We each have our own businesses\n- I work from home\n- Her place of work is half an hour drive away\n- We are both named on a mortgage\n\nEarly last year, we hit a rough patch. We were not making each other happy. We talked though some things and my wife \"came out\" as unsure about her sexuality. We decided to call it a day with the relationship as she could never truly be intermate with me, which sucked to hear but I completely understood.\n\nA few months go by with us living in the same house, we have three kids, neither of us wanted to leave and we got on fine, so no big deal.\n\nWe decide to get back together, I did question her several times on her sexuality and whether she was doing the right thing for herself. I didn't want there to be any regrets down the line.\n\nThings were great for a long time, everything!\n\nAround December, I noticed some traits in my wife that indicated to me things were not quite right. She would stay in bed until the last minute she could, then get ready for work and fly out of the door. Sure, not a problem, I was seeing that the kids got to school, and sometimes she needs a few extra winks to combat some exhaustion brought on by her condition.\nShe would return from work at or after bed time, hardly seeing the kids, if at all. She would have some dinner then got up stairs to bed. Sure, not a problem, I can see that the kids get dinner, have their homework done, bathed and put to bed. Not an issue.\nI must add, that if she is up and about in the house, she is great with the kids.\n\nSo I ask the question I already know the answer to, a question I still don't want to ask because it makes it real. I ask if she is having doubts about her sexuality again and she says yes. So, again, we call it a day on the relationship. We continue living together because we do not want to leave the kids. And life goes on.\n\nThis is the part where I am questioning myself for being an asshole.\n\nFor the past 3-4 weeks, my wife has been laid up in bed either for her condition, or more recently the flu (the real one with the body aches, fever, chills and all that good stuff). Not a problem, I can take care of the kids, the house and the animals (one dog and two cats). I bring her medicine, soup and tissues, but not always in that order.\nEvery now and then, she battles her way out of the house to go to work because it is post-christmas, we really need the money. I am appreciative, very much so. When not at work, she is in bed unable to do a thing. Like I have said, not an issue.\n\nThen after being sick in bed for three full days, only making it out of the room for bathroom breaks. She gets up to go in to work. She informs me that she doesn't have anyone in for the morning, so is going to help her friend in another shop, for free because they are friends.\n\nI question her on this, asking how it is fair that she can get herself together to go and help her friend before going to work, but is not able to help me with the house (cleaning, laundry et al) or the kids (cleaning, feeding, watering and bedtimes).\n\nShe proceeds to stomp around the house and cleans the four bedrooms, then hurries out of the door.\n\nI receive multiple messages from her through out the day about how I do the laundry and throw some frozen food in the oven and make her feel like shit for it. All I asked for was some help around the house. One of her accusations was I work from home but \"never\" have a dinner ready for her coming in form work, or there are dishes in the kitchen that need cleaned, or the bathrooms are dirty. \n\nNow, dear reader, I thank you for getting this far. I would like to reassure you that our house is clean. It might not be 100% tidy at all times, because kids, but it is definitely clean. \n\nSince this incident, she has been holed up in the spare room, only coming out for bathroom breaks or down to the kitchen for food/drinks. There is no sign of apology from her, so that is why I am wondering if IATA?",

      "description": "It sounds worse in the title than it probably is. \n\nIm 18. So I’m from a well-off family. Not exactly rolling in cash but we don’t ever have to worry about money and that’s all thanks to my dad who works his ass off. For the longest time I’ve never felt like a success, and that was due to me being a mediocre student since forever. I think on average I’ve always been a B- or a C+ student and my parents always railed me hard about it, to the point of tears and stress like I couldn’t imagine. It’s instilled in me a feeling of terror and anxiety whenever it comes to grades and study and just school in general and it’s been this way for years since elementary school. Somehow I graduated high school on time and made it into a pretty respectable university in my state, I don’t even know how. My first (summer) semester went really well, then in my second one i bombed my stats class with a D and I’m terrified of telling them. I pushed myself harder than I ever have in high school and still got a shitty grade, and I feel like I just waste the money my parents have invested in me in college. I don’t feel like I deserve the things I have because I feel like I don’t put in the work needed for them, I don’t have a job because my parents tell me I should focus on my studies and give me (more or less) free reign on their credit card but I feel so dirty using it so I rarely touch it unless it’s for gas or food, and even then I hate it.

For months I've been telling my mom to clean her cloth mess couches, sofas and chairs are covered in pants, shirts, jackets. Sometimes I say fuck it and clean them myself but it takes one maximum two days for her to ruin everything again. I have anxiety and some other illnesses and the state of our house is unbearable for me it's choking me I can't stand staying in that house. Since the clothes are dirty they also stink the whole house. That's why I come home at 7-8 even though my school finishes at 3 . I told her thousand times clean your tucking mess but she never listened today I vented at her for her mess. I feel kinda bad but she needs to understand that her behavior is unacceptable. ",

      "description": "I’ll try to keep this short, I am the one in the family / group of friends who ALWAYS is the one driving to their location, reaching out, trying to make plans to see each other etc. I’ve been like this for years, lately I’ve noticed my friends and family don’t even seem to care to make an effort, some of my friends won’t even respond to a text (no issues or bad relations with anyone either) when I ask to get together. I’m starting to get tired of being the one to always make an effort, it’s really tiring and when you consistently ask someone to hangout and they reject the idea or do not seem to make an effort in return it becomes exhausting to keep trying. I feel guilty because I stopped on the last two weeks trying to make an effort to even see people like my brother just to see if he’d make an effort to reach out and see me and he hasn’t. I don’t want to regret quitting just because other people aren’t caring, but I also am struggling with trying to maintain these relationships with no effort on the other persons side.",

      "description": "I'm young, only 15 years old. I've yet to start professional drivers ed. This happened very recently. On our way home tonight, my mom pulled into the (empty) parking lot of my high school and told me to get into the driver's seat. I was confused, but did so. \n\nShe started pointing out all the different parts of the car. After she finished, she got into the passenger side and told me to drive around the parking lot. I've NEVER driven before, so I got nervous and said I didn't want to. She kept insisting I should, telling me it was a 'rite of passage' and talking about how her dad had done this with her when she was my age. I think it's important to note that I had never asked her to teach me.\n\nThat went on for a while, and finally I caved and agreed to drive down to the other end of the parking lot. Like I said, I've never driven before, so I made it maybe ten feet before the car began to veer towards the curb and I slammed on the brakes.\n\n I have anxiety, and this was all bringing me to the verge of a panic attack. I told her again that I really did not want to do this right now. But she kept pressuring me, and said she \"wasn't going to pay 400 fucking dollars (that's the price of the professional drivers ed course) for me  to learn to drive.\" I just refused to do anything else at all after that, and she eventually replied \"fine, you had your chance\" and we went home. \n\nAnd that makes me nervous she's not even going to bother with *any* effort to teach me to drive ever again. I do understand that I have to eventually learn to drive, but now I'm worried she won't do anything at all. And I can't make $400 appear out of thin air.\n\nAITA, Reddit?",

      "description": "About 5 or 4 years ago I entered a dark age in my life where a lot of bad things happened, like my parents divorce, my grandps dying, getting severe depression and a fuck ton of bullying, most of it physical. I never had a lot of friends I could rely on, except X, I met him about 12 years ago and we were close friends, until he got a girlfriend and thought she was the one he was going to marry, I started seeing him less and less and even though I needed him, I didn't wanna get in the way of his happiness and let him ignore me thinking once he's comfortable enough he'll help me out ,or maybe even that he didn't know I was suffering.\n\n Wrong, he knew how bad I was feeling and didn't care, he more than once saw how I was getting physically assaulted and didn't care, I sought after him, but he just didn't care. One day a bully stepped on my arm cast and damaged it even further, causing me to have surgery. The bully was expelled and I moved out, never to see X again. Until yesterday that I came to my hometown to vote and saw him working as an assistant for his dad, he said hello as if nothing ever happened and later when I confronted him about what happened 5 years ago he said he never thought of it as something bad, and said I was the one that didn't want to see him, I explained how I felt back then, but he just shrugged it off, changed the subject and asked if I wanted to get pizza tonight \"for old times sake\". \n\nAt first I thought I'd forgive him if he asked me, I am ok now and mature enough to let it slip, he was my best friend after all, but he doesn't think he did anything wrong, it feels like he wants us to be friends again, but I just can't. I can't stand him anymore, and I feel guilty about it. ",

      "description": "In my history class, we had a group project about immigration policies. Every group had four people and we were supposed to research about ours and then proceed to present it to our other classmates for a class debate.\n\nOne student, who we will call Andy, did not want to participate. He is one of the laziest people I know. When we were given our assignment, I asked everyone what part they wanted to do. The other two students agreed to do their part, which led to Andy telling us he didn’t want to do anything.\n\nWe finished the preparation part of the project and proceeded to practice our presentation. Andy completely ignored us while he was on his phone while we went through explained what part each of us saying. \n\nBefore our presentation, I told him that he could do the last slide (which was the easiest) so that the teacher could give him points. He told me he  didn’t want to do that either. I ended up offering him the job of reading the title slide an introducing our names, which he reluctantly accepted.\n\nThe presentation went smoothly and afterwards, the teacher asked us to turn in our prep work with our name on it. I looked over at our group and saw Andy with his air pods in sleeping with his head on the desk. I ended up not writing his name on the paper and turned it in.\n\nA week and a half later (today), we got our grade back. He was in my group again for a review poster and we did thing where we touch our noses and the last one who does it has to write and he was the last one. He was being annoying and didn’t want to write. At the same time, we got our grade back. He asked me if I got a score in the grade book and I said I did. He told me he has a F in the class because she gave him a 0.\n\nFeeling kind of bad for him, I thought about telling the teacher about what I did. I was also considering saying it was an accident for not putting his name on it. However, Andy didn’t even realize his name wasn’t on the paper. He just looked at the score went back to sleep.\n\nAITA for giving this guy a 0?",

      "description": "Hey, I’m back. Last time I posted here was about my girlfriend wanting a face tattoo. So here I am with another AITA post to avoid blowing my brains out from frustration. \n\nMy girlfriend has class 4 days a week, I have class two days a week. My week is significantly easier to manage then hers, and I do my best to accommodate and help make her life a bit easier throughout the week. Today she asked me as I was getting ready to leave work to defrost some shrimp, and I agreed once I got home. Well, life got in the way and I ended up forgetting to do this. \n\nGirlfriend gets home, throws a tantrum for an hour then tells me to defrost them. So, I go grab what I think is the only bag of shrimp in our freezer, and start defrosting them. Little do I know, there’s TWO identical bags, and of course my luck is already shit today so I chose the wrong one. She’s now screaming at me over shrimp..I apologize, try to correct the issue but the entire time I’m being name called every insult in the book, which leads to the grand conclusion of I should get myself checked, because I’m either heavily retarded or on the spectrum. This is not in a joking way telling me I’m a retard, she full on believes “I’m handicapped”\n\nThis is where I kind of just stopped trying to help the situation and walked away, I wouldn’t say anything equivalent to that to her in a million years, yet here we are. She’s right now just throwing a tantrum and finishing making her meal, and cleaning up what I left out. \n\nI’m a bit hurt by her choice of words, and I will never get a chance to bring it up to work through or get an apology. She’s just not the apology type. \n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR; forgot to defrost shrimp for my girlfriend, was insulted and told to go see a doctor because I’m either heavily retarded or broadening the spectrum.",

My great-grandmother was recently diagnosed with dementia, and now needs a lot more care than she used to. As my grandmother is retired/works from home, she is home most of the time and can take care of my great-grandmother. She does like to go out sometimes though, and on those nights other members of the family will go over to \"babysit\" my grandmother. My brother (16) and I often do this, and we don't mind at all, considering she is our great-grandmother, and we are helping out our grandma. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTonight was one of those nights, and because my brother had babysat the last couple of times my parents asked me to. I agreed, and my grandma  asked if I could go over for 6pm, and said she'd be home around midnight. My parents and my grandma asked if I just wanted to sleep over at my grandmother(s)'s house, but I said no. They had kind of sprung the fat that I'd be spending the whole night there, and I had plans for tomorrow morning, and really just wanted to sleep in my own bed. My grandma doesn't live far, and midnight isn't *that* late anyway. My grandma ended up coming home at around 1am, and I got home at like 1:30. My parents seemed kind of peeved that I came home, implying that I was being shitty for coming home and not staying with them. AITA for coming home? I really just wanted to sleep in my own bed and hadn't planned for sleeping over, I didn't bring a change of clothes, or even my toothbrush. I could tell my grandma was a bit taken aback that I was going home and made sure I knew I could stay, but I genuinely wanted to come home. ",

      "description": "My friend from high school graduated with a BA in English 7 years ago. She hasn't had a job yet but I've heard her complain on facebook about how no one will hire her since she lacks experience.\n\nI've tried to help her out. I sent her resume to my office, connected her to friends who do copywriting and grading papers, talked to her about her situation and barriers. She always has excuses.\n\nShe refuses to do an internship because it's paying to work. She won't do a job at a grocery store/waitressing, it's a waste of time. But she can't afford a car/ transportation. She was offered a job but she turned it down (and was proud of herself) since it wasn't enough pay or in the field she wanted.\n\nThe most recent incident that has me wondering AITA. She posted again that she can't get a job from lack of experience. I suggested that she volunteers so she has something recent on her resume. She said she doesn't have a car and can't afford to Uber every day. I looked up her bus prices, $1.30, and suggested she takes the bus. She said she would still have to walk. I asked her what her plan was for travel to a job. She said she'll Uber to an interview and then can afford travel after she's hired. I said it sounds like she's just waiting for her big break and doesn't want to boost her resume with volunteer/internship, which was me trying to wrap up. She said she was surprised I would insult her by saying she's waiting for a big break. I said it's the same thing as saying waiting for a chance. She disagreed.\n\nI said either way, she's where she is and seems defensive about it (she about snapped her own mother's neck for saying something about the job market being different 10 years ago). She said of course she's mad because I insulted her. I apologized for overstepping. She thanked me for apologizing. I thought that was a bitchy response, so I said \"you're welcome.\" To return the favor.\n\nLater, her friend commented sarcastically how nice it must be for me to live in a city where the bus is only $1.30 and how stupid that is. I said I had looked up the price for her area. Then I was fed up and said how surprised I was that my friend became so bitter and was just pushing everyone away. I reminded her how I've been trying to help her for years, yet she never asks about me or my life and obviously doesn't care. I decided to remove her from my friends' list.\n\nI could have ended it better. Still, how can she complain so much, not do anything to improve it, and then accuse me of insulting her and being a terrible person for trying to help? Is it just that I'm the asshole? My other friend thinks so because I missed her cues telling me she wasn't interested in improvement.",

      "title": "AITA for not paying WiFi at a house I moved out of?",
      "description": "I recently moved out of a house with two roommates to start a new job in a new city. I left before our lease was up, and verbally agreed to still pay rent and (perhaps stupidly) utilities until I found a subletter. That hasn’t happened and I’ve been paying for both. \n\nRecently, one of the roommates has asked me to also chip in on WiFi. I’ve ignored the request so far. From my perspective, I’m being generous by continuing to pay over 100 dollars every month in utilities that I’m not legally obligated to.\n\nI don’t mind paying the rest of utilities because an extra, unexpected 100 bucks can strain a budget. However, the WiFi contribution is closer to 10 dollars, and I do not consider it to be part of utilities. In my mind, I did not agree to pay WiFi before I left, and it is not written down anywhere that I am obligated to do so. \n\nI know it isn’t a lot of money, but asking me to chip in that small of an amount feels like they are taking advantage of me. \n\nAdmittedly, I’m also stubborn - so I don’t want to pay it just out of principal and because I am trying to save money anywhere I can. It may be that my ex-roommates consider wifi as a portion of utilities, but as they are two separate bills I don’t see it that way. Am I an asshole for refusing to pay? \n\nTLDR: moved out of a house, still paying rent and utilities. Roomies want WiFi payment, I think it’s not my responsibility. AITA? ",

A week ago I finally choose one and decided to go and buy it before the end of the month (they had 20% off until March the 31st, lol). In all the time between starting the search and buying it I never involved my father in any way, hell, he doesn't even know I wanna get married next year.\n\nNow, onto the why...7 years ago my father cheated on my mother and they parted ways. Since then he hasn't made any effort in spending time with us and has always been distant, not interested in my family, and not much of a father in any way. So I guess my reasoning is, if he's not interested in being involved in my life, why should I try to involve him?\n\nI tried calling him during the hunt but out of 10 calls he ignored 8 and the other two paid almost no attention to what I was saying and never had the chance to tell him about the ring.\n\nI feel kinda hurt because I would like to believe that buying your engagement ring is a once in a lifetime decision and it should be shared with your family to have their advice and help you find the right one, but he doesn't seem to care about me our my soon-to-be fiancée so I just left him out of this.\n\nAITA? Should I tell him something? I still need to pick it up because it needs adjusting (GF has big hands, lol), should I try and tell him to come with me to pick it up?",

If it isn't obvious I dislike Jeff and want absolutely nothing to do with this kid so I got slightly irritated when he started coming in late so that I had to put up with it. I brought this up with Tony and explicitly told him that I wanted nothing to do with this kid and that he had to put up with him and act as a barrier between me and him as he has known him for much longer then I have giving him enough time for him to him to suggest to Jeff that he has a strong oder. I ignore him when he attempts to talk to me (partially because of his breath) and give him simple 1 word replies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

I am very much so in love, and feel ways for her that I’ve never felt for anyone before. \n\nAnyway, Valentine’s Day was a few days ago now and we couldn’t be together because she is on a ski trip with her family. We agreed to celebrate when she got back. I still messaged her Happy Valentines Day and told her that I loved her, but I’m trying to save all the ‘big’ stuff so-to-say until she is back in town.\n\nThat being said, I woke up to a text this morning from her that said, “Why didn’t you say anything about me anywhere on Valentine’s Day. Not even a Snapchat. Like you didn’t have a girlfriend on Valentine’s Day.”  Since then she has been acting different, even though I apologized repeatedly. \n\nI feel awful.. I didn’t intentionally *not* post a picture or flex her, I just.. don’t use social media like that I guess (besides Reddit).. She *did* post a picture of me on her Snapchat, and I appreciated it, but I didn’t really think it was such a big deal that I needed to do it too? If it was that big of a deal to her, I feel like a hint (and by hint, I mean a *big* hint because half the time I’m a clueless boy) would have been a big help! \n\nI’ve always enjoyed living in the moment and I think that stems from seeing my dad live behind his camera lens as I grew up, so I was more or less just focused on putting my effort toward making the time when she is *here* special.  You can be damn sure though that I am going to make sure to post a pic to flex her when we celebrate *our* Valentines! \n\nI’m interested to hear other people’s perspectives on the importance of this. Am I the asshole for not ‘flexing’ her on Valentines Day, when she was doing it for me? ",

      "description": "English is not my first language . Apologies for the wall of text and my awkward writing . Also , I understand I am 17 . I may be overreacting a bit and life certainly isn't over yet . Please do not patronize me .\n\nA little background first .\nWe're both 17 and go to the same school . We liked each other for a while and tried dating . It was my first time and I was too shy  to properly communicate . Didn't work out for various reasons . Over time I got a bit worried she wasn't interested in me anymore and feared for our relationship . She kindly cleared my doubts for me . Apparently , she had already concluded it wasn't working and didn't see me as her boyfriend in the first place .\n\n\nAfter taking a screenshot of our convo to remind me that I had reached the peak of my life , I conveyed my displeasure about being led on and she didn't took kindly to it . She was quite rude . We had completely opposite viewpoints about the whole situation so I basically considered myself as being dumped  and ended things with her . She cooled down after a while and tried a lot to talk to me . She initiated contact all the time even though I made it clear I wanted nothing to do with her . She apologized , said she messed up and understands where she went wrong , and told me she misses me a lot .  While I initially enjoyed the attention , It went on for months and guilt arose in me . I tried to look at things objectively , realized it was no one's fault in particular and decided to try being friends with her again . We enjoyed talking to each other and things were going fine . \n\n\nYesterday , while walking to my class , her group called out to me . Now I will admit she is quite popular while I am not . I do have my own group of friends with whom I hang around and I think I am generally well-liked but I can get a bit shy and awkward sometimes . I also prefer being alone rather than tagging behind the first acquaintance I see so it could easily be misconstrued that I am a friendless loner . \n\nSo Friend A tried to have fun on my expense . Considering the fact I barely knew him , he came off like an asshole putting me down . One thing led to another and we nearly started fighting . The whole time she stood there without saying a word , like she didn't know me even though I was her best friend according to her . Back when we first confessed to each other , she made it clear she didn't want anyone to know about us as she hated others interfering with her personal life . I did as she wanted but it honestly hurt me as she acted like we didn't know each other and refused to acknowledge my existence infront of her classmates . She did sometimes greeted me when accompanied by other friends of her so I took it as her not wanting to create rumours in her class .\n\nThe whole experience made me remember all of our issues . Now I understand it was my problem and I don't expect anyone to stand up for me . I would honestly be embarrassed if that was to happen . But she didn't even gave me as much as a second look . I felt disrespected , like I was some sort of shameful secret being hidden . We went on our separate ways , she with the same people including the guys who picked a fight with me . I wasn't over her and even thinking about her hurt like hell , yet I was doing my best to support her and be a good friend . This was sort of the last straw for me . I texted her and told her I couldn't put up with this anymore . I was totally honest , told her that I couldn't be friends with her after all as I still liked her and it was a torture for me . I told her I felt she doesn't really care about me , which is of course fine , but since I like her , it is best for me to forget about her asap . I was a bit emotional and blocked her everywhere . Now I genuinely believe that not seeing her anymore is the best for me but I do feel I could have handled it better . So , AITA ?\n\n\nTldr; ex gf ignored me for the umpteenth time in front of her friends and I blocked her everywhere , ending our friendship . AITA ?",

      "description": "Some background info: I am a student in Turkey. Sometimes my moms comes to visit. I use Airbnb to rent an apartment so I can stay with her for the week or two she is here for. \n\n\n\nI rented this apartment and paid 1800 TL for 16 days. 1800 is like 370 dollars. \nFirst off, the apartment wasn’t as clean as it is. Even something as simple as the oven wasn’t clean! \n\nWe go with it and say this is fine. It’s not big deal.\nShe texts me yesterday STATING she is coming to the apartment tomorrow to take some stuff from her room. I remain very polite and I say of course. Just let me know when before. \n\nShe goes off saying it’s her apartment and leaves me some exclamation mark for asking when she will come exactly. I ignore her texts and I don’t know what to do now tbh. I don’t if she will just show up at my doorstep or what exactly.\n\nI am just a bit worried she will kick us out or something since it’s her apartment and I only used Airbnb to book it. So basically no legal contract or whatnot. \n\nAm I the asshole for creating a fuss about her invading our privacy without even giving a notice?",

      "description": "So, without giving too much info and random details I’m in my late 20’s working a cubicle job. I also like to go out on weekends and hit the clubs or bars. (Not as crazy as I was years ago) I’m also a big sleazy person who often has one night stands. Everyone at work knows this about me. I’m also pretty blunt and don’t shy away from answering awkward questions.\n\nPretty much at work I’m always cracking jokes and such. A lot of people come by my desk to “shoot the shit”. Most of the supervisors are cool because there is a lot of slow times and I get my work done in a timely manner. One of my coworkers has similar interests and we often hit the gym after work and hit the clubs a few times during the weekend. Let’s name him Hank. \n\nTwo of my coworkers in conversation heard about our adventures and wanted in. \n\n-One is a woman who is always overly cheerful and one of those “obsessed with Disney” types. Let’s call her Karen. \n\n-The other is a dude who is pretty normal but, over does the whole bromance shit. Let’s call him Bob. \n\nWe hang out that weekend and everything is ok for the most part. Except Karen is a drunk mess and keeps wanting to for me to dance (I normally don’t dance) and Bob is just being strange and keeps saying stupid stuff to us like “Hank, I will give you 20 bucks to touch his butt”\nBob and Karen keep trying to get into selfies I’m taking with the women I’m talking to and “fucking my game up”. We get the Uber back where Karen is rambling about she thinks it’s gay because I didn’t want to dance with her or take photos. Despite the fact I have a “no boning coworkers” (and just not interested. I HATE Disney for starters). Not to mention I was chatting with other women. We get back and they all crash at my place until they are sober the next morning. Where Karen and Bob won’t stop apologizing for stuff I don’t care about anymore. \n\nNext week I’m at work and I’m joking with Hank saying “dude I just got an unexpected bonus, talk me out of going to the club this weekend.” And he jokes back saying “Ok man what time we going to the club?” We both laugh about it and Karen and Bob invite themselves after overhearing it. Hank and I don’t really mind and we make plans for Saturday. \n\nSaturday comes and everyone meets at my place to pregame. I tell Hank about how I was at a sports bar Friday night and was making small talk and then ended up at a strip club with the people who worked at the bar. I ended up getting the number from one of the dancers who said they would try to meet us at the club. (I’m a sleazy dude) every one is laughing about it and sharing similar stories.\n\nWe head to the club and everyone is drinking. Same stuff as last week. Eventually Hank or Bob asks about the strip club and I say yeah we can go if everyone is cool with it. Karen is all for it saying she is Bi and she is just like “one of the boys”. We get an Uber to the strip club and I pay everyone’s cover. Before we even sit down at a table Karen is stating she doesn’t like it here “I just want to go home. They aren’t even that hot. You guys can stay but can I just get your keys and go back?” I feel bad so we call an Uber. In the Uber, Bob, Karen and Hank all agree they are cool with going to a nicer strip club. So we head there. As we approach a bunch of nearby bars, Karen gets out the car and decides she wants to go home and Bob is also tired. Bob is sober so I call them an Uber and me and Hank go bar hopping. 45 minutes later I get the message that the Uber got them to my place safely and I tip the driver using the app. I then get a phone call from Karen saying “Bob left his car keys in your house. You need to come back”. \n\nMe and Hank get an Uber back and then make sure they got home safe before just throwing back a few beers at my place. \n\nI realized I spent more on Uber than I did actual drinks. And we never made it to a better strip club. (Oh well)\n\nFew weeks go by and me and Hank talk about gym stuff or anything else. We also still hit the clubs and stuff but don’t tell anyone or invite them. Even when other coworkers invited us out we pretty much only go if one of us is going. Then afterwards we go to our own adventures, be it movie or just a sports bar to catch a pay per view event. \n\nKaren asked about all going to the clubs again and we just sort of changed the subject. \n\nTL;DR- My buddy and I hung out with some coworkers who didn’t match our vibe and now we don’t invite them to hang out with us and lie about our night life to them. \n\nHowever I feel bad for bringing Karen to a strip club even though she is Bisexual and she said she was cool with it but I feel like she was pressured into saying yes because there was 3 dudes. \n\nBob may have caught the vibe that I was going to punch him if he kept up the whole “we are homosexual together” jokes. As it was killing my vibe and I was ignoring him after I said enough of that. He and Karen left early and forgot their keys which let me and Hank to head back to unlock my place. \n\nAm I the Asshole?\n",

      "title": "AITA for trying to date while I still live with my ex",
      "description": "Long post, so bear with me. This is a throw-away because my ex uses reddit frequently.\n\nI started dating my ex a little over a year ago. About 9 months into our relationship, I asked him to move in with me, and he agreed. We started fighting pretty often, and I felt like he was being emotionally manipulative, and after discussing it over the course of a few months, I decided to break it off with him.\n\nThe paragraphs that follow happen over the course of a week and a half:\n\nObviously it was a bit messy, because he still lived with me. I agreed to let him stay while he found a place, since we live in an area of the country with a terrible rental market.\n\nA few days after I broke up with him, I downloaded Tinder and started talking to a few people. The next day, he asked if I'd downloaded Tinder, and I told him, honestly, that I had. He was visibly upset, and he asked me if I could wait until he was out of the apartment to start dating. I told him that, yes, I would wait, but that he needed to give me a hard deadline by which he'd be out of the apartment if he was going to ask me to put my life on hold for him. He said he'd be out in 2 months at the most, and so I agreed.\n\nThe next day we had another argument about the breakup, but ultimately he apologized and said that I could date, but I could tell he was pretty uncomfortable with it. But he said I could date, so I set up a date later that night (it was a Wednesday, and the date was for Friday when I knew my ex would be at a friend's birthday party).\n\nOn Friday, when I got home, my boyfriend had called in sick. He was acting kinda weird, so I went to go take a shower. After I got out of the shower, he asked if we could talk. He started telling me that he felt I was reneging on our agreement not to date until I'd left the apartment. (Apparently he thought that agreement was still in effect even after he told me it was ok if I date.) I told him that, no, I wasn't going on a date, but, even if I wanted to, he said it was ok for me to see other people. He said that that wasn't how he remembered it, and he'd prefer that I wait until he was out of the house. I said ok.\n\nI wasn't sure what to do about my date that night. It got later and later, and my ex still hadn't gone to his friend's party. I asked him if he was going to go to his friend's party, and he said he might go later, but that he wasn't feeling it. Eventually it was getting too close to the time I was supposed to go on my date, so I texted the guy an excuse.\n\nI later learned why my boyfriend had been acting so weird that day. He eventually confessed to me that he'd \"seen my messages\" to a friend that I had told I was going on a date with. I leave my computer open pretty frequently, but I felt violated when he told me that since he's never really checked up on what I'm doing like that before.\n\nSo. Am I an asshole for planning that date? He's since moved out, and I never did end up going on a date while he was still there.",

      "description": "Ok, some background story. Yesterday i had a really stressful day and i still don't feel good today, anyway i usually wake up early in the morning and after breakfast i spend 10 minutes or so in bed, and this is the moment when my cat, after she had her own breakfast comes up on the bed and i usually pet her for a while.\n But this morning i was on the phone and wasn't felling like it. But instead of accepting it she kept grabbing my arm and trying with her paw to get my attention, i asked to just be quiet and rest with me but she kept doing that; so at this point i was fed up and i scared her away (with a scream) and she left the room. Now I'm here alone in the bed writing this post and i feel like i have ruined this moment forever. Am i the asshole for being rude to my cat?",

      "description": "So, some backstory. I am the youngest of my family so my family (including my sister) usually treats me like a child and says that I over exaggerate a lot of things. For example: when I come home from a 9 or 10 hour shift and say that my feet hurt or that I’m tired, the response is usually: “you shouldn’t be tired because I worked longer shifts than yours when I was your age.” \n\nThat part is fine, I can deal with that much it’s understandable. But what I find offensive is when they directly insult my actions and work ethic, and say that they didn’t mean anything of it. \n\nSo here’s what happened: \n\nI came home from a closing shift and I begin to relax and just take a breather before I start to get ready to go to bed when my sister comes in and starts talking to me. It was a good conversation from the start, but then she made a comment that I found to be a little offensive. \n\nMe: “Yeah I’m really tired, my manager let me go home since they’re trying to save hours.”\n\nHer: “Well, if I were you, I would have stayed and help them close because I hate leaving when other people are there.”\n\nMe: “I would have too if it wasn’t so late, and besides I had someone waiting on me to get out.”\n\nHer: “I’m just saying, I would have tried my best to help them get out together and stayed.”\n\nMe: “Okay, and I’m just saying our situations are very different.”\n\nHer: “I still would have tried to help anyways. It’s not like you couldn’t have.”\n\nMe: “What are you trying to say? I had multiple reasons why I couldn’t stay.”\n\nHer: “You don’t have to make excuses and lie, OP. We know you just wanted to leave as soon as possible.”\n\nMe: “But I wasn’t lying! My manager said that they wanted us to leave on time and not stay late. Plus I couldn’t help with the other items because I don’t know how to do it...”\n\nHer: “Stop, I would have done stuff out of my job description so we could all leave on time. You don’t have to make excuses. I worked longer hours than you and worked for much longer than you, I have more experience so I know that you’re lying. So....”\n\nMe: “Stop! I don’t care about your work because it has nothing to do with me!”\n\nHer: “Well if you don’t care then I don’t wanna talk anymore!”\n\nAITA for saying I didn’t care? She’s really mad and I kinda feel bad for saying that now. She is older and has more experience so I probably should have taken her judgement as advice instead. \n\nTDLR: \nMy sister kept comparing her job and her actions to mine and saying I was an asshole for not helping my remaining coworkers closing. When my manager said that they wanted me to go home and that they would take care of it. So, i exploded and said I didn’t care about her work compared to mine. AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my husband’s best friend over every week.",
      "description": "My husband and I just got into (another) fight because his best friend who comes over every Wednesday is (again) staying the night. \n\nMy husband and this friend have had a Wednesday night “date” where the guy comes over to our house to “jam” every week for the last two years, and I’m getting to the point that I want to hit the guy over the head with whatever is closest at hand every time he is around. \n\nBuckle up. This is probably going to be a long one.... if you make it through all of this you are my hero. \n\nAt first he was supposed to come over just for a few hours on Wednesday nights to play guitar with my husband while I was at work. Over time I have stopped working late Wednesday’s but the jam session continues. Which was fine. However, for the last year they have barely touched the guitars and instead the guy just comes over to get high (on pot). Neither my husband or I get high with him (I don’t enjoy pot and my husband isn’t much into it either, but we aren’t morally against it so we didn’t say anything early on when we should have). \n\nNow that he is always high here, he NEVER leaves at the end of the night. Just expects to sleep over. But he doesn’t have a regular sleep schedule so instead of sleeping while we are, he is wandering around our house all night (in his boxers) making noises, watching tv, getting nonstop text alerts from other friends and ect. This always wakes me up and I have to pass by him on the way to the bathroom. At these points he always has demands. Like: “I want to watch this random movie your husband said you had. Find it for me.” Or “you need to change your litter box right now, because your cat just pooped and I can’t stand the smell.” He always says he’ll leave when my husband goes for work at 8am, but then complains that he couldn’t sleep until 6am, so he ends up sleeping until mid day. At which point he just decides to stay until my husband gets home from work and then the whole thing starts over again. What’s supposed to be one night a week often turns into at least two every week. \n\nOn top of never leaving, he has started showing up HOURS before my husband gets off work on Wednesday’s. My husband has told him “my home is your home” so he just comes right in. This wouldn’t be a problem if he could self entertain. But no. He comes in and will just walk into our bedroom (where I’m hiding) sit down on the bed, take a hit of his shit, and start talking to me through whatever I’m doing/watching on tv. \n\nEvery time he is here he eats A LOT of our food (gets the munchies, plus regular meals) but never once has had the courtesy to bring anything of his own, or to share, or to replace what he is eating here. He just goes into our fridge and pantry and eats whatever he wants because my husband told him our home was his. \n\nMy husband is always begging me to be nice and not say anything while he is here because he is lonely and needs friends.... except he has his other best friend living with him, and is constantly going on weekend trips all over the country to visit his other friends.  Not to mention those nonstop text message alerts all night. \n\nDealing with this guy is like hanging out with a 17 year old stoner non stop. He farts and burps as loud as possible wherever. Whenever. Is demanding and needy, but completely rude at the same time. Saying things like “dude! You actually made your house look SORTA nice this week.” (As I was prepping for Christmas), and “so you do sometimes make an effort on your looks” (when I had gone somewhere nice and come home with makeup on). He also complains non stop about the food I make (yet eats it all anyway). \n\nThis year for my birthday we couldn’t afford to get any gifts, so I asked my husband instead to line up his days off so we could spend four days just us together...... then this guy broke up with his girlfriend and my husband begged me to let him come over just for a bit on the first evening. Que TWO full weeks of him not going home, and demanding all of my husband’s time. I spent “our time” and my birthday, holed up in our room alone. \n\nThen, Christmas comes. I had invited my whole family to our house and tried to make things extra special because it was the first time I got to see my parents on Christmas in more than ten years. This guy’s mom had just moved to another state BUT this guy has plenty of money and no job to work around so he could have easily made the trip to her for Christmas. But he didn’t. Then his other friend/housemate also went out of town and he threw a “woe is me, I’m all alone one Christmas Eve, no one loves me” tantrum until my husband invited him to our house. He shows up. Gets high. And is a complete ass to everyone. Then throws a fit when he decides to sleep over because he has to sleep on the couch in a sleeping bag (my family were in the other beds.) the next morning we sit down to breakfast and he lets out this HUGE stinky fart right at the table like it’s nothing, then proceeds to dish himself up 90% of the food and just generally be a douche. My family was flat out disgusted by him and his behavior and couldn’t wait to leave. He stayed for three days. \n\nI feel like an ass hole because he is my husband’s best friend and I don’t want to make them not hang out, and honestly he hasn’t done anything truly terrible. He’s just annoying as shit. I fucking dread every Wednesday, and then I’m super irritated the whole time he’s here. Which I hide from him, at my husband’s request, but then my husband and I always end up fighting over him not leaving at the end of the night. \n\nI’m honestly one or two Wednesday’s away from homicide with this guy, and all this I’ve told you is just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nIf you’ve made it this far, please tell me AITA for being upset at my husband for letting this guy stay over again tonight, and wanting a substantial break from his best friend? \n\n\n\nTL;DR My husband’s best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. AITA for not wanting him to come over for a LONG time? ",

      "description": "My roommate is 30 ish with 4 kids. 3 of them live with us week on and week off. On black friday I went out with my roommate, my other roommate plus her boyfriend, and my boyfriend.\n\nThe topic was breached about the two roommates (sisters) pooling together to buy the 13 year old a playstation since she likes playing the communal one so much. I said something to the effect of “cool that’s a good idea!” \n\nNow last night we all congregated on the porch for a beer. The kids were inside. The mother roommate approaches the topic of the playstation again with her sister and then turns to me and says “Did you have any ideas on what to get them?” \n\nI THOUGHT she was asking for suggestions so I listed off some stuff like bras for the girl and legos for the younger boys and she was like “oh yeah you totally should do that!” \n\nI was like “oh I was giving you ideas!” and she looked puzzled and said “Then what are you gonna get them?”\n\nThese girls are privy to the fact that I’m having serious money troubles this holiday season and am having trouble scraping together money for my OWN siblings and parents. I have 4/10 people bought for and my money is already gone.\n\nI gently said “I didn’t know I was expected to get them presents” and she said, well you’re part of the family. \n\nI’m not even gonna BE here on Christmas morning, I’ll be at my mother’s house with my boyfriend and my siblings. I think she thinks I’m being an asshole for not thinking about her kids. \n\nDisclaimer: The kids WONT be hurting this year. There was so much stuff in the cart on black friday and they have grandparents who spoil them. There will be no lack of presents under the tree if i don’t contribute. \n\nI just think she thinks I’m an asshole. Am I an asshole for not buying them gifts?",

      "description": "I’m in a small team of six, however it’s mainly myself and my colleague, who I’ll call Jim, that work on a specific product. I am also his superior (but not boss/manager). \n\nI’ve noticed Jim has been taking anywhere between 15-30 minutes extra lunch break, which I don’t mind when we’re not busy. However this week we have been all hands on deck. Especially today and yesterday.\n\nWe were already behind on yesterday’s work and today’s work was starting to pile up a lot. I also have other duties (which he does not) that I have to attend to and prioritise at times. \n\nSo today Jim left for lunch before I did. I finished a few bits off and then went off about 10 minutes later. I get back to my desk after lunch and he was still not back. 30 minutes later he comes back. At this point we have a ton of work to do in 3 hours. I managed to get another colleague on our team to help out and spread the work load, however they also had other duties which they had to dip in and out of.\n\nAt this point it’s been around an hour and a half since Jim’s been back and has been on this one thing which shouldn’t take any longer than 20 minutes. In that time myself and my other colleague have been cracking on and getting a fair bit done, the end isn’t in sight, but we’re getting there. Bearing in mind my other colleague has been having to switch between his other work and ours, and myself likewise. \n\nSoon after, I notice Jim going on his phone a lot. All the while he’s still doing this one thing. I was really frustrated because I have been noticing a lot lately that it doesn’t seem he puts the effort in. We’re very team oriented in one part of our work and if one member of the team is slacking it will affect the rest.\n\nSo I sent him a message on slack “Hey sorry to be a dick, but we really need your help on X right now. We have a ton of work to do and I need you to pick up the pace, sorry”. \n\nDespite how angry and frustrated I was internally I feel like I worded my sentence fairly? But I know I am one to have a bit of a short fuse when it comes to slacking colleagues when it affects the team and I have in the past, not structured my sentences in the best way I could. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

He had a girlfriend now, so I expected him to spend more time with us, but still be on touch. John completely drifted away as he didn't answer texts, he didn't want to go out with us, and even when he said he was going to play online with us a certain night, he was quickly gone to play LOL with other friends of his. This went like this for a long time, I kept always inviting him to hang out with us, but he never wanted to do anything with us. At one point he exited out text group without giving any explanations, we took him in 5 months later but he exited again. Recently my friend has added him to the group for a 3rd time. So even though my other 2 friends (who im still close friends with) still talked to him and saw him in class, because I dropped out, I cut all contact with him, blocked him on Steam yadda yadda yadda. Now that he's back in our text group I'm decided I'm just gonna ignore his presence although my other 2 mates talk to him. Recently he got upset because I have him blocked on steam and my friends are upset with me too now. I just don't want to do anything with him because I KNOW he will cut off contact at one point. So, AITA? ",

      "description": "I'm a male in my early/mid 20s, I go to college in the US, but I'm not American. I'm currently back \"home\" with my family, with my dad. Here the culture is very big on physical affection, kisses on the cheek with a hug are the standard greeting and farewell. I am absolutely not big on physical affection. I am autistic, very reserved, and big personal space and autonomy, and depressed, which I've come to realize is partly caused by how my mom treats me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love my mom, and I know she loves me, but I don't appreciate the way she shows affection to me. It makes me uncomfortable, stressed, and feel powerless. Whenever she approaches to kiss my cheek I move my shoulder over to cover my neck, as before I started doing that she'd kiss my neck. This is an extreme no no for me. I'm very sensitive about my neck, it's very intimate to me. Imagine someone greeting you with a grab to the groin, that's how it feels to me. I've been vocal about my discomfort about it, but basically ignored. \"It's because you're too tall so I can't reach your face.\" I don't give her the opportunity to anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can imagine that if other people saw me cover myself before approaching my mom for a greeting they'd think \"wow, what a piece of shit person, who treats their mom that way?\", but I have tried to reason with her, my dad has tried to reason with her, but she's dead set on her ways. My dad is also very affectionate, he treats my sister very affectionately, but here's the difference, he doesn't treat me that way. Instead he treats me how I like being treated. He'll give me a short verbal greeting and let me have my space and time. My mom gives him a very hard time for that. Demands him to sit with me while I eat. I hate eating with people around. Demands him to take me out to the movies/dinner when I don't want to go. Demands him to force me to do things, to which he replies \"He's an adult, I can't force him to do anything\". I feel that my dad treats me like a person, while my mom treats me like her property in some ways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this kinda sounds like I'm just ranting, maybe it is a bit, but it ties in. In short, my mom's love and affection towards me are very detrimental to my mental health. I've noticed that I try to avoid spending time with her as much as I can. I've noticed that if she starts walking towards me, or getting closer to me, I'll instinctively recoil back and raise my arms to protect myself and push her away. Just the other day she came to visit me while I was sleeping, she took the opportunity to get in bed with me and cuddle me. I struggled and tried to push her away, but I was too tired to really put up a fight, and I just felt violated and powerless. It felt awful. But I also feel guilty, because I know that I'm not \"normal\", and I don't know if I should be the one adapting to her instead of expecting her to respect my needs, I don't know if I'm just being an asshole by denying her affection.",

      "description": "I'm a guy turning 18 next month. I'm a senior. My dad is a taxi driver. And I live in an apartment where my grandma and my uncle also lives in.\n\nSo here's the story: For the past 10 years, my dad had massive amounts of suspicious debts all over the place that we still don't even know what they are even today. To pay up all those debts, he sold many things, but most of these were insignificant things. But the moment he had to sell his own taxi's car plate, he was finally exposed. Upon learning the situation, we were utterly shocked. Our family's biggest source of money and our, financially, most important thing was gone for bullshit. My mom was rightfully super mad and he kept arguing my dad days after days, weeks after weeks. They were so close to divorce.\n\nBut the actual story starts right here. After months of fighting and lots of apologies and promises, they decided it's the best if they stay married, for the sake of their children and the people around them. I am studying for the university exam. My twin siblings are only 10 and they were probably really upset for their parents fighting for so long. Also, all the noises they are making was really getting irritating for our neighbors, my uncle and my ill grandma. But my mom didn't stop it. After an entire year of the exposal but my mom was still not ending it. She was acting like not us, but only she had lost everything. She was acting almost selfishly. And finally yesterday when she asked in an argument, \"what do you say, u/swfcapslock_?\" I just said \"no just shut up mom, look at all the things you are causing over some paper. i won't defend you any longer unless you talk normally\" and apparently that got her really upset. Not gonna lie I kinda feel bad now too.\n\nSo what do you say? Am I the asshole? Ask any questions, sorry I wrote this on a rush.",

      "description": "Last week I purchased a Volcano on ebay for $300. For those of you that dont know, the Volcano is a vaporizer that is used for the ole devils lettuce. Its a tank of a unit thats known for  for its sturdiness and basically lasting forever. The unit was described as used which I figured was fine - maybe some scuffs or some residue but whatever. The listing also described and pictured a traveling case. Cool.\n\n I get it a week later and the case has a hole in the back the size of a quarter. My friend points out that you could fit the plug through so you can just keep it in the case the whole time when using it. It made sense and then I didnt care so much.\n\nThen i go to plug it up and see the grounding prong is missing on the power cable, but theres still a hole im the cable as if one had been there before. I contacted the manufacturer of the vape with the serial number and confirm that its a 2011 unit and should, in fact, have a ground prong.The Volcano uses up 100 - 111 watts of electricity when its on. Neither of these defects were pictured (although the hole in the case I dont care so much about). \n\nI take pictures and open up a refund request on ebay. The seller offered me a $20 refund because it was \"fully operational\" (he is correct, it does turn on and function) and he \"only sold it cause he was in a motorcycle accident and needed money.\" \n\n \nI rejected the refund and want to pursue a full refund through ebay if necessary but kind of feel bad too. I know it functions, but but the cable just sketches me out, as well as the fact that he imtentiomally chose not to picture either thing. WIBTA?",

      "description": "So recently, as I started my sophomore year of high school, my friend has become what I see as the most popular kid in school, after being elected student body president the prior year and being involved in an absolute plethora of clubs, activities and teams. We’ll call him George here. \n\nGeorge is what you’d call the overkill, overachiever at our school. \n\nAnd George has done and gone through a lot lately. In the past few days he’s walked in looking a lot more tired than usual. In the last few months we’ve talked a lot about what he’s been involved in, the school wide events he (almost always because he kind of has to as president) attends, and his academic workload. I’ve heard about how much he’s involved, and he’s talked a little bit about how his grades have suffered recently in some classes. \n\nAfter we talked about his grades I started coming to a conclusion that he might perhaps be is so bogged down and involved with the school community that he doesn’t have enough time for work and study. He actually even once came to me and let me know that he had to drop his only AP course for this year because of its difficulty (not sure if that’s relevant to the topic though.) Even for myself, one AP course’s night’s worth of HW takes about 2-3 hours after getting home at 5, and having much more to do for other classes. \n\nNow what I’m concerned about is that one of my mutual friends with George told me recently while at a restaurant that George plans on taking the IB Diploma next year when we start junior year. He also said that George, with everything he does including personal stuff, only gets about 5 hours of sleep a night. **Five.** An extremely unhealthy amount of sleep. I’m not joking. \n\nI don’t want to interfere with what George aspires to or what his goals are with what he does but I feel that it would be beneficial to him if I strongly advised he not take all IB classes. I know he want to be the best of the best and go to a great school, but I really feel that he could be hurting himself if he made that decision. \n\nI’ve spoke with others students in that program and they all tell me that same thing, that it’s the most difficult thing they’ve ever done, even excluding their extracurricular activities. I’m almost certain it will be hell on earth for George. \n\nSo I’m thinking about whether to go to George soon and try and talk him out of the IB diploma, to and just tell him to stay on what he’s doing now, so that he can avoid any unhealthy hardships that may come to him. WIBTA if I did this?\n",

My partner is 17, and I am 18. I have already graduated year 12 last year when we weren't dating.  \n\nMy partner (We'll call her Bree) is deciding to go to her year 12 ball with one of her class mates.  She used to have a thing for this guy, they would send each other nudes etc.  They were doing these things before she and I started dating nearly a year ago. \n\nBeing her boyfriend,  I would love to go.  However, the school policy states that no one outside of the school or in any other grade is allowed to go.  Only the year 12 cohort for that year.  This upsets me because, well,  that's my girlfriend.  I don't want another guy hanging off her.  I know he will,  too.\n\nThen there's the after party side of things. She wants to go to this big after party,  but told me straight up \"You're not coming\". I told her I was actually planning on picking her up from the ball and bringing her home,  where I was going to have a surprise party organised to welcome her into the adult world and say goodbye to school. \n\nShe said she'd rather just go to this big after-party where I know from last year she'll make mistakes. Everyone who went to the one last year ended up ruining their relationships by cheating on each other in that one drunken night. \n\nI'm not telling her she can't go,  I just would rather she goes to this ball with one of her close female friends rather than a guy, and that she come celebrate at my place. \n\nAm I the asshole,  reddit? \n\n\nTl;dr, girlfriend doesn't really want me around on her ball night and would rather go be with drunk peoples",

      "description": "Gf and I moved in together not that long ago.  It’s been going ok except for one thing.   Her sister is always here.  Multiple visits during the week.  Then on weekends she’ll come spend a night, sometimes the entire weekend in the guest room.  \n\nShe lives with her parents as did my gf before she moved in with me.   I can understand that she misses her sister and that staying here is probably a lot more fun than at her parent’s, but Jesus is she annoying.   I’m starting to really hate her.  Plus I’m always out numbered on stuff like take out and tv.  My gf doesn’t see the problem and it’s actually led to our first fight living together.   She says that she lives here now and should be able to have her sister over if she wants.  \n\nI work a physically demanding job and weekends are pretty sacred to me.   I don’t want her here anymore.  She can visit during the week.   Gf only works part time so there’s plenty of time they can spend together during the week, but I want a no more weekends rule.  ",

      "description": "Sorry about the format, I'm writing this on my phone.\n\nSo a bit of context. A few weeks back my fiancée left me after i tried asking for help finding a psychologist. She told me that my depression and \"lack of fucking motivation\" was making her job of being my fiancée hard. I was missing days of work because i was too depressed to do my job, which made her financial burden more difficult. If you want to know all about it, the other two posts on my account will tell you all about the situation. Now that we're all up to speed, here we go.\n\nAfter breaking up with my fiancée, i got help from a co-worker, finding a psychologist. My co-worker, who will be referred to as Mike from this point forward, also let me move into his apartment for the next few months while i get my life put back together. The psychologist I found is expensive to go to, but he does a good job of helping me, so I've visited twice. For this situation, my job does offer support with medical bills, psychological appointments and other general insurance, but i can only apply for it every 3 months. Since this whole situation occurred partway through that cycle, i have no active insurance for this. The price is a lot to pay without any assistance, but it's the only thing that kept me from killing myself a few weeks ago, so I'm very grateful for that. \n\nI should also let you know that Mike is NOT pressuring me for rent money. He's basically told me not to worry about rent for a while and i can just buy him a few beers later if I feel inclined to do that, but his generally great attitude and assistance with getting me back on my feet makes me want to help him out in some way. I fully know that if i tried to throw some money his way to help with rent, he'd turn it down until I'm financially stable again, but i want to help in any way that i can, because he's already done so much for me. Mike's wife is also very understanding of the situation and has told me the same thing. Even though i know they'd turn it down, i feel like an asshole for not trying. Am I just overthinking it?",

      "description": "I'm a 24M, she's a 26F. I've been with her for a few years, and I do love her, her smile, being with her and doing anything and everything with her.\nShe helped me through my dad dying way back when we met, and she was always by my side when my mom became severely disabled after an accident seven months ago (we feared she might stay in a vegetative state, but she has regained some speech..although she's still 100% dependent and in a neurorehabilitation ward). I've been with my mom almost everyday since then, although she doesn't really remember I was even there the day after. That meant I never had as much time for my GF as I used to, and we hit a rocky patch where she wasn't sure it was going to work out between us...So there was a month where things between us were really up-and-down. But it did get better and everything has been great for the past two months.\n\nAnyway, she's always been pushing me, half-as-a-joke, half-seriously, to try out for a quiz show like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? but with a partner. It really was one of my dreams as I love trivia and we both decided it would be a fun thing to do together, so I signed up for it. We went to casting and we got the call that we'd be filming! We were both pretty thrilled about it. There was a cash prize of 100,000$ which would be useful to pay for my mom's treatment, not that we *really* need it, but it can get expensive.\n\nThe problem was my GF started to get cold feet. For several reasons, she didn't like that they asked her her medical specialty, and where she was going to work. Also, that I told the show's producers we were planning to move in together, as one of the things that had caused a rift between us was that I never took the initiative to discuss the future with her. She also said they would screw us over with the questions and we wouldn't get out of there with more than a few hundred dollars. And finally, she said that she wasn't comfortable appearing together on TV when we were in such a rough patch, playing an act.\n\nWe ended up cancelling our appearance and she was mad with me for a while. I was really sad about it, we make a really cute couple, we'd have fun, and maybe win some cash. I'd even told lots of my friends about it. It seemed like it would be pretty perfect.\nIn any case, we made up. But every time the show is on I still get a little sad thinking about it, about the money, and she notices and says she's sorry about the whole thing, and that there will be more chances for us.\n\nBut I'm still not really over it and she knows it. I know she has a right to choose whether she goes on TV or not, but the way she built me up and then let me down.. I understand it was a rough patch for us and she didn't want to go on TV and pretend everything was fine, but I feel if the situation was inverted and it was her that really wanted to go, I would have done it for her. AITA?",

      "description": "I went through a really bad breakup. My ex boyfriend and I were together for 5 years, three of those years being long distance. I grew unhappy with the relationship; it was emotionally abusive and exhausting. I went through a period where I was very depressed and having severe anxiety issues. Since then, I’ve been going to therapy.\n\nImmediately after I broke up with my ex boyfriend, he started coming into town every weekend trying to visit me. He would text me, call me, contact my family members and friends in an attempt to try and communicate with me. I had to cut off communication with him because it was taking a toll on my mental health. At one point, he came and sat outside my house. He went and visited my place of work and then went to my mom’s place of work. It was a miserable time for both of us.\n\nFast forward to today. I am in a happy relationship with a long time friend (that my exboyfriend NEVER liked). We are living together, and I’m in love. Still, this year, he sent me card on my birthday. I hear that he is having a very hard time and that he is waiting for me. And for all he knows, he thinks that I hate him-- which now looking back at things, I realize that I don’t. Even if the relationship was very hard on me. I no longer hold resentment towards him, and it’s my hope that we will be on good terms.

      "description": "I live in a small block of apartments, which are primarily designed for professional couples. We are incredibly happy here and have been for over two years. Most of our neighbours are amazing. \n\nAbout two months ago we had some new neighbours move above us, two shift working nurses. Initially we could hear them walking up and down the flat constantly which resulted in a lot of banging and lights shaking, but living in a flat means this is somewhat inevitable. They cannot levitate, therefore there will be noise.\n\nFor the past week or so, I've noticed a very loud droning coming from either next door or above me (almost certain it's above me). Initially I put it down to the festivities and ignored it, but it kept happening. I've lost so much sleep due to this, but it all came to a head last night when the droning went on from 8pm until 2am, getting mildly quieter after 11pm. I had been asleep since 7pm (which I accept is super early, so not a problem!) trying to catch up and the noise was so loud it woke me, and kept me awake until after 2am.\n\nMost of this is my problem. I get anxious because I can't sleep, then all I can focus on is the noise I can hear. I tried noise cancelling headphones with white noise to block it out but because they are more vibrations than anything else, they didn't work. I tried moving bedrooms but I can hear it throughout the entire flat. Last night my partner had to go to a different room because I was so anxious and couldn't stop moving around, which made me feel like absolute shit.\n\nI got 3 hours of broken sleep last night and I have been on the brink of tears all day. It has only happened a few times, so I'm currently deciding whether to send a very friendly letter just making them aware, in the hope that they might turn the sound down a bit, or move their speaker off the floor. \n\nI could go up and chat but they work shifts and I don't want to wake one of them if they're sleeping (the irony) and I'd rather them both be around to hear the issue. \n\nWould I be a complete asshole if I posted them a letter making them aware? \n\nOr would I be less of an asshole if I just gave them a few nights to see if it's a one off?\n\nThe letter is VERY nice and explains that I know it isn't intentional but sound travels because of our badly built homes, and asks them not to worry but to try and keep the volume down slightly after 10pm. I have also told them they can pop down for a chat or call me if they want to discuss.\n\nI guess I'm worried that there's a tiny chance it isn't even them and I'm going crazy. Blame the sleep deprivation. ",

      "description": "Hi guys, I wanted to get your thoughts on this situation. Warning, long post coming up but I want to get every detail I think is important in this post. Also, sorry for any errors as I am typing on mobile. \n\nI (32m) have been close friends with one of my old college roommates, Brandon (31m) for over 10 years. He and I have always got along well and have been there for each other through some hard times. When I started my relationship with my girlfriend (now wife) he was very supportive and they got along very well that they became good friends too. \n\nHe has been through a few relationships and I try my best to get along with his girlfriends, they are usually very nice and pleasant people. So when he started dating his latest girlfriend, Julie(27F), I tried to be as supportive and nice as possible. Right off the bat I saw red flags though because he would tell me how she criticizes his apartment and his love for collecting super hero memorabilia. I spoke to him and he said she’s never dated a “nerd” before and it’s just an adjustment period. \n\nThe first time we hung out with Julie was for Brandon’s birthday day. I started to talk to her and asked about her interests, including what kind of books she likes to read, since I like to read as well. She immediately went cold and walked away and didn’t associate with me or any of our friends afterward. A few weeks later Brandon admitted that she had came up to him and said she felt like I was interrogating her. I told him I just wanted to make small talk to get to know her, but I tried to put myself in her shoes, and I figured maybe she was just nervous around new people and was shy. \n\nFor the next year or so, my friends and I have invited Brandon and Julie to events and gatherings and about half the time only Brandon would show up, and when he did she never came with him. So I guessed she was bad around crowds, so I asked Brandon if she could do a double date with me and my now Fiancée. They kept canceling or rescheduling the dates. I can say I was a bit sad but I understood he was head over heals for her so I didn’t say much. \n\nThen my fiancées 30th came along and I wanted to throw her a big party so I rented out a huge space and I gave a price for how much it would be for anyone who wanted to join. I even said that if it was too high, then don’t worry about it I can help cover for some people as long as they tell me ahead of time. (My father had passed away and he left me good money, I saved most of it but had a little extra) Brandon calls me and tells me that he and Julie will definitely come as it is Julie’s favorite fancy restaurant, he also told me that they would cover their portion. The day comes and it’s fun and exciting for my fiancée and everyone’s having a good time, even Julie.  The problem is that it took me 5 months to get payment from Julie as I had to go through Brandon for it. \n\nNow here is the straw that broke the camel’s back. My wife and I had our wedding this past summer. Brandon officiated the wedding because I wanted him to be a part of a special day in our lives. So while Julie hasn’t left a good impression on us, we gave Brandon a plus one because he means a lot to us. After the initial ceremony and cocktail hour, I gave a speech to thank our guests and I gave special shout outs to important people including Brandon. I ended the speech by thanking my father whom passed away the year earlier, I was in tears and most friends and family became emotional too since my dad was such a good man who impacted all our lives. After the speech, my wife had gone up to get drinks from the bar when Julie went up to her. This is what Julie said: “I thought your husbands speech was good an all, but I felt it was too predictable and we all knew where it was going to go. I wished he had just got to the point and be done with it”. My wife was shocked and walked away. \n\nShe told me about it the next day and we crafted an email to Brandon to politely tell him that she was hurt by that comment from Julie and to ask him to talk to her about it.  He never responded to it and didn’t respond to any attempts that we tried to reach out to him. My wife sent Brandon a text and he finally acknowledged he received the message and will talk to Julie. So then at another friend’s wedding, Julie comes up to my wife and tries to make small talk with her as if nothing ever happened. My wife tried to be polite but she distances herself ASAP. \n\nFor the next few months we get nothing but radio silence from Brandon. I tried calling him and texting him...nothing. So I sent an emailing letting know I am disappointed with where the friendship has went. I told him I respect his decision and if he ever wanted to rekindle our friendship I’d always be there. \n\nSo there you have it, there are plenty of other things Julie has done to our other friends, but these are the instances that relate directly to me. So AITA for being upset with her and deciding to not try any more with my friendship with Brandon? \n\nTLDR: Ended friendship with a long term friend because his girlfriend was rude to me and then was rude to my wife as well.

I'm pretty fit due to my job/hobbies and she's overweight but it doesn't really bother me. \n\nAnyway, a couple days ago she asked me point blank if I thought she was fat. I don't lie to people, so I told her yes. I followed that up by letting her know that I cared about her regardless and would support her if she wanted to stick to a healthier diet/exercise routine to lose weight. \n\nThat didn't matter to her. She started crying, told me she isn't in a place where she can work on herself right now, and has refused to leave her apartment over the last couple days because she's feeling self conscious about her body.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I responded to her question in the most honest and sincere way I could. She clearly wants to lose weight and I thought I could help to motivate her. I obviously failed in that respect, but am I the asshole?",

They sent out a letter that the parents fill out asking for any specific food requirements, and I put Keto.  Normally I would bring my own food, but since they ask about accommodations, I assumed they would actually accommodate.  I found myself in an awkward position where the only food left for me was ziti.  So I waited until everybody got their food first and then took the rest of the cheese off the top of the ziti.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was apparently cardinal sin, because the moms at the school made a huge deal.  They called me out in front of everybody and I got very offended.  I made it clear to them that I had no other choices and I was very hungry.  All of the other parents started ganging up on me telling me that I wasn't being conscious of the picky eater children or the other parents and teachers.  When I tried to explain my situation, they told me I should have gone out and bought food to bring or make it at home.  \n\n\nThese Franzia siphoning momzillas have no idea how difficult it is to be a single dad in ketosis though.  I tried to explain how expensive it can be to buy keto food, and that they said they were accommodating of special diets so I didn't cook anything.  In the end they ended up banning me from any more of these events with food.  But my daughter is not old enough to be there alone.  It's really not fair to her.  So am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Note: the post is a bit rambly so thx to anyone who read it. There’s also a TLDR at the bottom, but if you can you might want to read the whole post to get more context.\n\nI (M14) have a close friend, we’ll call him A, who I’ve known for about 2 years. This friend knows how to play drum set and I can play bass, so we got another friend, B, to do guitars and a third, C, to do vocals and we started a band. Everything was going really smoothly until about a month ago. At that time I broke up with my ex girlfriend. However, I already liked someone else and two weeks later me and my current gf, who we’ll call D, got together. My ex wasn’t a big fan and called D a slut in my DMs. I got pissed and talked to A about it, and he said he agreed with my ex that D was a slut. For context, A had dated D a few months prior but they broke up only two months later. I initially got pissed but after a very long talk, me and A agreed not to bring it up again and everything seemed to be going ok... until it wasn’t. A has a very bad temper and would throw fits almost every week. The cause ranged from anything to ideas for album covers to calling our guitarist, B, a slacker. I would usually just tolerate these and let them go and that would be that. However, about a week ago, with no provocation, A called D a slut again in front of the entire group chat. Additionally, he accused D of flirting with him, which D denied. He had no evidence that D ever actually did and D has been really sweet in our relationship, so I said “why should I just believe that without proof?”. He then went on a tirade about how I didn’t trust him and that D was a hoe and that I was stupid and hypocrite. I got rather pissed off and called him a “mother fucker” for leveling that false accusation against her and having a tantrum every fucking week. After a while we both sat down and I offered to just move past this if he apologizes. However, he said that he was in the right for speaking his mind I should apologize. In the end we both apologized. However, C sent me a screenshot where A admits he wasn’t being sincere so I left the band after giving him another chance to apologize. After that C decided to join me and B is currently on the fence about it. I also told D and she’s pissed at A and wants to confront him about it. In short, I may well have ended up breaking up the band and causing a fight, so idk if I was really right here. So maybe y’all can help me decide? Thx.\n\n\nTLDR: a friend who’s in a band with me (M14) throws tantrums rather often called my gf a slut and falsely accused her of flirting with someone else so I called him a mother fucker. This has put the band in jeopardy and my gf is super pissed at my friend and wants to confront him.",

      "description": "So the guy that I used to call my best friend told me last night that we couldn’t be friends anymore because I like his most recent ex girlfriend. But this is a long story of why they broke up and why I think he’s over reacting. \n\nSo this guy, let’s call him Joey. Joey had this absolutely incredible girlfriend, she loved him way more than she should’ve.\n\nI say she loved him way more than she should’ve because he sexually assaulted and abused her for 2 years. He would grab her ass or vagina or breast in public when she would tell him not to. He would threaten to kill him self to make sure that she wouldn’t leave. He would grab her by her shoulders and shake her violently when he wouldn’t get his way. \n\nOver the past 2 years he has cheated on her 7 times (she only knows about 2 times) and broken up with her for different girls twice. Both of the girls he left her for cheated on him and broke up with him, he’d come crawling back to her every time. \n\nI had no idea Joey treated her this way, so I was a bit more than floored when she told me about it. This guy that I had called my best friend for 7 years was abusing this girl for no reason. \n\nWhen she left, he kept texting her every day. Every single day he would text her, threatening to kill him self if she didn’t come back. He would continue to tell her how she “ruined his life” and how he “should just die because she’s the only girl he’ll ever love”. She ended up blocking him on messages. \n\nHe continued texting her on Snapchat. Saying all the same shit. \n\nLast night he texted me saying that we couldn’t be friend anymore because it “hurts him too much to see (me) knowing that I like her and he can’t have her”. He found out that I liked her because he read my messages and saw a heart by her contact name in my phone. I explained that I like her but that I’d never do anything with her because I didn’t want to hurt our friendship. Little did I know he would blow this all out of proportion. \n\nJoey abused, sexually assaulted, and cheated on this girl but then tried to tell her she wasn’t allowed to be hurt about the breakup since she broke up with him. He continues to this day to text her, and as of three hours ago, FACETIMES HER, threatening to kill himself if she doesn’t come back. He then pushes away everyone that tries to help just because he is so caught up over this highschool relationship. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for liking her even though he (in my opinion) blew the whole situation out of proportion and ruined our friendship because this girl broke up with him?",

      "description": "This is kind of a long story, so I'll try to sum it up without cutting any really important details out. So my friend and I have had a complicated relationship. We sit next to each other in a few of our classes and when I ask for help she tells me that I'm a dumbass, and when I get any questions wrong she'd get mad at me and tell me things like \"That question was so easy! How could you get that wrong?? You're going to fail this test.\" I am not the best student and I was feeling tired of walking on egg shells trying not to disappoint her.\n\nSo one night around 12 I texted her \"Can we talk?\" and it lead to me expressing to her about how she hurts me (with no intent of hurting her or invalidating her feelings in the process). At the end of the conversation she stopped replying and wouldn't talk to me for the next few days. I've felt like such an asshole ever since. I'll admit that I did send some really long texts and if someone sent me texts that big I'd feel somewhat threatened as well. In the series of texts I said, \"I know you're going to push me away after I say this\", \"Character development doesn't mean change. And sometimes change is good.\", \"Please don't feel like you're at fault or anything. I'm just tired of the way that things have been and some things need to be said. When you say things, I feel it. I'm not going to act like a victim. I know I've made you mad or sad before and for that, I'm sorry. But I never deliberately say anything mean to you. I'm not asking for pity, I'm not asking for you to change your whole personality for me. But please stop treating me like this.\".  And she said \"It's too much to change. I don't wanna change and I don't want anyone to change me like j leave me alone if I'm in a bad mood I'll fix myself.\"  In hindsight, I should have stopped prying after she said that.\n\nShe then stopped talking to me for a few days and posted on Instagram, \"Old pic but in case u didn’t hear me before, if ya don’t like the way I talk or the way I carry myself ya don’t need to be near me or be associated w me. J leave me be it’s rlly not that hard I’m gonna say and do what I think is right and if u don’t like it then leave nobody told u to stay w me especially since u know I j got out of shit so why u tryna bring things back\". I knew that she was going through some stuff and I waited until it was over to bring it up to her so she wouldn't have a lot happening for her at once.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My friend refused to talk to me and talked badly about me for a few days after I expressed to her that she hurt me. \n\nAITA for bringing this up to my friend and putting her through this after she just got out of drama with other people? Am I too sensitive?",

      "description": "Obligatory TL;DR at the bottom. \n So a couple of months ago, i enrolled into a new school (I’m in 8th grade and socially inept, therefore i only made a few acquaintances), and i became friends with a boy my age-who, for the purposes of this post, I’ll call D. So D and i became good friends really quickly. Really quickly.\n He manipulated the teachers to change the seating order so that we sat together in every class, something I didn’t consent to  or even know about. He would follow me around, not giving me any space and often stopping me from talking to the other classmates (we sit in the very back, with no other desks on either side of us. He is very rich and constantly talks about it with everyone, so he has a bad reputation as “the weird rich kid” (he has long hair, doesn’t talk much, sings, etc.). So i wanted to find out who he really was. Bad mistake on my part.\n D began by telling me that he had had a dream where i died, and when he woke up, he cried for half an hour (i was really freaked out but played it cool). D began to tell me other things. Beginning with casual mentions of his mother hurting him, emotionally and physically, i soon learned that she was part of a pyramid scheme called Purtier Placenta (look it up, it’s disgusting). Apparently his dad was also absent for the first 9 years of his life, and his brother (18 years senior to him) was also quite the tyrant.\n D causally sprung factoids and tidbits about abuse during normal conversation, and it was beginning to get disturbing. I have terrible anxiety, I’m awful socially, and i have deep depression from some past traumas that I don’t want to get into right now, so it was very hard for me to have to deal with my issues as well as his emotional baggage. I like him, but it has been exhausting and even more depressing to be around him recently, and I don’t want to relapse into a deeper state of depression. AITA for not wanting to be friends with him anymore?\n\nTL;DR:\nMy abused schoolfriend got very pushy in our friendship and began to tell me (a severely depressed and anxious child) all of his emotional baggage and pain. This has left me tired as he is not giving me any space. AITA?",

      "description": "This happened a while back in Amsterdam.\nWe traveled there in a large group (18 people, most of them stonera) and only spent around 4 hours in the city, so i wanted to make them count.\nI researched on our bus ride some locations and then told two of my frienss the plan I had.\nThey both agreed and we arrived in Amsterdam, where we booked a place to watch our baggage and then went into the central city.\n\nHere it was were i got really stressed.\nI just wanted to go there in a small group, but because nobody else did *any* research about the city about 10 people followed me and asked me what to do and where to go.\nAdding to that two of those guys got pretty drunk on the bus ride and annoyed the crap out of me, so i sent them in a coffee shop and left them there on their own (i accept that that was shitty, but it turned out fine and they were pretty cool about it\n\nThen we didn't find the place to drop of the baggage, because the guy who booked it couldn't read the email with the location correctly and refused to share it.\nDuring this whole debacle one of the guys played a smartass and told us, we wouldn't be alloerd to buy any weed and that coffee shops only sell to locals, because he read a headline that said so.\n\nWe got into a fight about it and eventually i told him to \"shut the fuck up\" and to \"piss off\". So he and his girlfriend left on their own.\n\nNow without any baggage, we six went to the first location i wanted to visit (the cannabis college).\nIt was a 10 min walk, so being on vacation i planned 30 min for it, but it took us a full hour, because 2 guys had to stop to look at *every* red-light show/shop on the way and giggle like little girls.\n\nSo we arrive at the college, get the information about the best shops and then went on our way there.\nProblem was however that even though everyone went into the college (even though i told them it'd be best if only 2 of us go, because it is pretty small) and everyone listened to the information given to me, they still managed to annoy me with a lot of self explanatory questions, until i decided to just told them where we go and to shut up.\n\nSo the atmosphere was pretty tense and at the first shop we arrived (after another hour of stopping at every sex shop) i met a different group of guys we traveled with and i told the other guys, who were again questioning me about what they should buy like i would know that, to stop following me.\n\nThen i walked away with the different group and told the previous one to \"fuck off\" and to \"do what you want, but leave me out of it\". (It got pretty heated)\n\nThe rest of the stay then was pretty cool and there were no further problems with the other group.\n\nLater then however the others told me, that i was a jerk and ms being \"so uncool\" ruined their stay in Amsterdam.\n\nSo i apologised for being an asshole, but i thought about it a lot lately and was I?\n\nI mean its not a big deal, but i'd like to avoid being an asshole that ruins the vacation of others in the future.\n\n\n\n",

It was really representative of how I feel. My mom knew I was  doing it and knew I  was planning on writing one for her too. When I was done, my mom asked to read, and I agreed.\n\nPause. My dad is a harder working, smarter person than my mom and he also does more dishes, laundry etc. Me and my mom knows this. (she apparently goes to a psychologist because it's hard for her to live with someone like him, hard to explain in text, but justifiable irl).\n\nAfter she read it she said it's really good and 'amazing' and now I can't write for her because I won't be able to match the expectations. I took it seriously and we talked about it. she ended it saying \"so just don't write me anything, because I know it will be a lie to make me happy and not what you really feel\"\n\nLater that day we were giving them presents and I gave my dad the stuff I wrote, and my mom half-jokingely said (when he was there), \"What about me?\".\nI didn't respond to not make it more awkward and we moved on.\n\nI later asked her why would she say such thing, and she said she didn't really mean for me not to write her anything, when saying I shouldn't (I guess I didn't get the hint)...\n\nAITA for not writing her anything?",

We hadn’t prearranged it and B. His birthday was the Friday that just went. So I’m upset, so is she, and she says that her mothers said I’m invited over the weekend after that, now, the reason she was coming to mine is my parents are quite chill with the relationship thing, and leave me and the few partners I’ve brought home to ourselves. her parents, are not. \n\nThe reason I said about us trying a few months ago, is the main reason we stopped was the fact we’d arrange something, her mother would ok it, then a week later she’d go back on that, and that happened over and over. Now when I said this tonight my gf got a bit upset and said that I have to deal with it if I want to be in her life, then had to go for the night and left, I apologised but she won’t see it till the morning, but I’m still upset and not sure if I’m in the wrong, I also want to make it clear I wasn’t blaming gf, just saying to her that it’s happened a lot.\n\nSo AITA? I’m really confused and don’t know how to feel, it’s at the point where I don’t want to get excited to see her as I don’t know if it will get cancelled last minute by her mother ",

I feel like I did nothing wrong, but am guilty for her saying it was. AITA?",

My daughter is turning one in 2 months and I've already started planning her first birthday party. \nMy husband is insisting that we have it at our house and I agree with him. We've got a lot of kickback from family members because our house is not that big. They keep saying it's going to be too crowded and nobody's going to fit. I've also heard one family member is telling other family member that I don't care enough about my daughter because putting enough effort into celebrating her 1st birthday.\nMy daughter means the world to me. I just want her to be comfortable and happy during her party. I just want her in a familiar environment. It will also be a lot less stressful for me to plan her party. I don't know maybe I owe it to my daughter to have a huge birthday party for her I don't know. Maybe I'm a jerk for expecting family members to come to a party at my small house. ",

Bear in mind \\*correct means how words are generally pronounced utilizing non-regional diction. Example: jog (yog \\*wrong) = jaw-gh \\*correct. This might be a little lengthy... \\[evil chuckle\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSetting the stage: I work as a Sushi Chef in the restaurant of a popular beach resort/ hotel in \\*San Diego, California. Needless to say, we get a ton of visitors because our weather is pretty sweet, mostly tourists. They’re inexperienced with speaking names of places around here &amp; Japanese terms for sushi components, I don’t judge. However, unlike when I was much more understanding, I have stopped correcting their mistakes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample:\n\nGuest: Excuse me, kind sir. About how far is La Jolla (la-joe-la \\*wrong) from here?\n\nMe: Yes, La Jolla (la-hoy-yah \\*correct) is about 20 minutes from here. I then proceed to give them instructions on taking the route through town (a scenic drive along the coast) and directions using the freeway (quicker but much less to see). \n\nGuest: Thank you so much – looks at my name embroidered on my chef coat – Ecchi, you are a gentleman and a scholar.\n\nMe: Thank you, it was my pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, it looks like:\n\nGuest: Excuse me – looks at my name embroidered on my chef coat – Ecchi, could you tell me what’s in the Baja (buh-jaw \\*wrong) Roll?\n\nMe: Absolutely! In the Baja (buh-jaw \\*wrong) Roll you’ll find… and I give the list of ingredients. \n\nGuest: Sounds great! Thank you for your time.\n\nMe: Thank you! Enjoy your meal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never see them again, but their server comes up and comments on how the guest said Baja (bah-ha \\*correct) Roll in a funny way. Another time a guest pronounced it as Baja (badge-eh \\*wrong). They were from the East Coast, so I just rolled with it. Again, I did not hear anything from the guest, but the server came up asking if I new what a Badger Roll was. The guest said that I knew what they were talking about. I explained what I did and that the guest was asking for the Baja (bah-ha \\*correct) Roll. She laughed, called me a jerk and walked off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther words I don’t correct anymore:\n\nNigiri (nigh-jeer-y \\*wrong or worse n@#%&amp;r-y \\*wrong) = nih-gih-ry \\*correct\n\nSushi (suh-she \\*wrong or suh-shy \\*wrong) = sue-she \\*correct\n\nUnagi (you-nuh-ghee \\*wrong) = oo-nah-ghee \\*correct\n\nAhi (ehy-high \\*wrong) = ah-he \\*correct\n\nPoke (poh-ck \\*wrong) = poh-key \\*correct\n\nTempura (tem-pure-ruh \\*wrong) = tem-poo-rah \\*correct\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I’ve grown tired of correcting people and end up thinking: “go ahead and pronounce it that way, see how far you get in life.” I’m probably the asshole.

The roommate that’s staying, that I’ll call Emma, and I agreed we’d start searching after the new year.\n\nWell I put up a few Facebook posts, and we’ve gotten around seven responses so far. Some we agreed were bad, some I liked. Emma liked none of them, and she has twice now gone against an applicant just because they were a freshman. This means they would be a sophomore when they move in. She says that you can’t trust freshmen to pay the rent on time, or that they’re crazy and unpredictable. I fee she’s being too judgemental.\n\nOn top of that, Emma is holding out for that “perfect” roommate. She doesn’t want to settle this early, thinking if we wait, we’ll find someone else that didn’t want to settle. What I think will happen is that every good roommate will have found a place to stay, and we’ll be left with a bunch of procrastinators who are an actual risk for not paying rent on time. I don’t think this “perfect” roommate exists, let alone two of them. I want to give the freshmen a chance, but Emma seems adamant. AITA? Are freshmen really that bad? Am I rushing this?",

He found me on Facebook this past October. We’ve been talking ever since mostly about family, and our relationships. When he contacted me, we were both in a serious relationship getting ready to get married. However, his relationship ended a week before Christmas. His fiancée told him she didn’t want to be with him anymore because of his job as an OTR trucker. \n\nIn a conversation to find out how he was doing after the breakup, we talked about where he was going to go on his next days off. He asked if we mined if he came to visit us. I told him we didn’t mind we just had to plan thing around our schedules. I worked a consistent schedule of Tues – Sat 12:30 – 9.  My fiancé’s schedule varied from day to day. So, anything we did had to either be early in the morning or late at night.  Since our last talk about him coming to visit, on Dec 28, a lot has changed. My fiancé has changed jobs, and I lost mine. I am now in job looking mode. He has known about this since the day I lost my job. So, I have been reminding him often that he needs to let me know if he’s coming or not, how he’s going to get around, what hotel he’ll be staying at. Each time I question him about anything I’m either met with silence or told he hasn’t done it yet.   I’m at the point where I need to know. Because I could be scheduling the time to meet with recruiters. \n\nSO reddit, would I be an asshole for asking him point blank “Are you seriously coming?",

      "description": "So I'm at uni and living with 3 other guys. 1 of said guys is properly weird. \n\nIt has been a downward slope over the last few years, first he was normal but a bit to himself, no problems there. Then it turned to him only ever talking to us if we happened to be in the same room as him, and now all he says to us is asking us to move if we're in front of his cupboard and need something. \n\nThis year however, he took it to a new level. We used to buy everything communally (toilet paper, washing up liquid, washing powder,  etc.) but now he want his own of everything. Ok a bit weird. Then when we moved into this place this year the first thing he did was request a lock for his bedroom. Not a latch to lock it when inside. A full on key lock like you find on a front door. Hard to take that as anything other than paranoia. \n\nNow we've discovered he wakes up at 5am everyday so he can shower in the communal shower with his gf everyday in secret. This creeps us all out as we can presume what they are doing in there and we all use that shower. Not only this, but he leaves her in the house when he goes out for the day, despite us having asked him not to in the past. We don't know this person. She has never spoken to us, tried to get to know us, etc. We don't know her, so we don't really want her in the house when we're not in. \n\nThere is more involving him throwing people's stuff out of the washing machine, buying separate cooking appliances, very loud baby noises coming from there room during fun times, etc. But this post is already very long (sorry).\n\nAITA if I ask him again to stop leaving her by herself in our house and to stop showering together? \n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Long story short, I am very unhappy with my Valentine's Day gift. My boyfriend of almost 3 years this Valentine's Day got me flowers and one of those heart box chocolates.\n\nNow some back story, my boyfriend is basically broke, and has been for the past few years. I usually pay for all our dates and I spend considerably more on gifts than him. This does not bother me at all, I'm working and I know money is tighter for him because he is not. But he usually gets me something with a personal flair, like one year he wrote a poem, another time he framed tickets of things we have gone to together. The flowers and the chocolate just feel super impersonal, like he could have given it to anyone. They were not even my favorite candy or flower.\n\nAnd this year I got him a flight across the country to see his best friend, who moved and he hasn't seen in over a year. I will not be joining them its strictly a trip for him and his friend. But I coordinated with his friend and put a lot of effort into making that gift happen and this Valentine's Day special.\n\nPlus he knew about this gift 3 weeks before Valentine's Day because I wanted to be absolutely sure he could go.\n\nHe asked me if I like the gifts he got me and at first I said yes and he kept pushing it so eventually I told him how I felt. He got really upset with me and slept in another room.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not liking what he got me?",

      "description": "Background : I have been suffering from severe depression and was very suicidal until a short while ago. I opened up to my roommate about it and she said that she would gladly help me of I needed it. I thanked her, but never asked for help because I was not comfortable with it. Her way of helping me was inviting me to a spiritual/religious organization that she is a part of. I made it clear to her that I am not interested in it and that I do not like it at all. But she kept insisting on it, asking me to come with her friends. It was a time when I was isolating myself from everyone including my closest friends. I was in therapy too and on medication. I knew I needed my time. But my roommate kept insisting and kept inviting me so many times. If I tell her am busy, she would ask me to postpone my work and go along with her. I felt like she broke my trust my doing that. I felt forced. I did not go. We had an argument and I kept repeating that I was not in a condition to talk. Exact words. But she kept going and said that the arguments help her 'study people'. I somehow ended the argument by getting aggressive. Shortly after, I tried committing suicide. \n\nNow I recovered a lot. Am happier and am hopeful. I look forward to staying alive everyday that I wake up. Am still in therapy and on meds. Today I told her that she made me suffer a lot. And that she aggravated me quite a lot even after clear 'NO' I told her many many times to discussions. And I told her that I attempted suicide. She said that that was her way of trying to help me. I told her that I know for a fact that she had no ill intentions, but she is inexperienced with things like this and that she needs to stop arguing with me when I tell her that I can't argue at the moment. I told her she stamped on my sense of privacy and she broke my respect. She didn't say much when I said all these things except for \"how would I know that you were upset? This is how people talk, maybe our perspectives are different. I was only trying to help but maybe not in the right direction according to you. \" I said, \"how would you know? Take my No as a No. This is universal. \" I saw tears swelling up in her eyes. I didn't want to have that conversation with her at all because I felt she wouldn't be able to understand. I told her that it is v. diff to understand depression unless you experienced it and that she tried her best, but would need to pay attention to what I was also saying. I don't think she got my message. But should I have had this conversation with her? If she did not understand, she would be hurt and feel bad about herself. I should not expect anything from her. Why did I expect her to be supporting when I was going through something? I may have reacted the same way as her. Should I have never told her that she made me suffer? AITA ? \n\nPS: So sorry for the long post. Even if no one is an asshole, what should be done here?",

      "description": "Hello, r/aita.\n\nSome context: I am a 29 year old woman, I’m originally from New Zealand but I have been living in the UK for the last five and a half years.\n\nI’ve never had a particularly good relationship with my parents/family: I don’t really have a lot in common with them, and the older I’ve got the more I’ve begun to realise that they’re almost all narcissists (Mother, Father, Sister).\n\nNone of them have any interest in my life: I don’t hear from my Dad (at all) for months at a time sometimes (a year is the record - last time I was home, I had to call the cops on him), my sister only calls me when a) there’s a family crisis or b) she wants something. Not sure she has ever contacted me to ask me how I am and for no other reason. And, before my mother got ill, she stopped speaking to me when I refused to invite my ex-stepdad (ex!!!!) to my wedding.\n\nThis was one of many things we fought over — she sided with my housemates (one of whom had been sexually harassing me for a few months at the time) when she came to stay with me four years ago. This is the sort of shit I used to have to deal with on a regular basis. She would regularly tell me how fat I was, how much of a disappointment I was, etc etc. Pretty typical narcissist behaviour.\n\nThat was two and a half years ago now. She stopped speaking to me after that, and I was quite happy with that arrangement. I visited her in New Zealand when I was back 2 years ago, but the whole time was emotional manipulation and guilt trips and the silent treatment. I rolled with it at the time, not having the energy in the two weeks we were back in New Zealand to really care too much about it all.\n\nAbout six months later, in the month or two before I got married, my mother started having memory troubles, blackouts, didn’t remember entire conversations. At first we thought it was the alcoholism, but after she went in for a detox period in October of 2017 and they realised her brain had shrunk massively, which was now causing dementia caused by alcoholism. She hasn’t got massively worse since that period (a bit perhaps), but hasn’t got any better, either.\n\nMy sister has been dealing with getting her into a rest home, looking after her while she was living alone. She’s had the support of both of my aunts (one more than the other), and my ex-stepdad, but she doesn’t particularly like my aunts, and resents me hugely for not being able to do more from London.\n\nI go back to New Zealand once every two years generally, and the third trip home is fast approaching. I spoke to my sister yesterday who a) accused me of lying about the dates I was in the country (I didn’t) and b) told me I needed to spend as much time with my mother as possible while I’m there, in order to “give her a break” (her words).\n\nHere’s the thing, reddit. My sister never speaks to me, has never been a particularly good sibling to me (usually only comes to me when she wants something, I can’t do anything right, the night before my wedding had a massive screaming mental breakdown because the entire world wouldn’t revolve around her, etc etc etc), and has actively chosen not only to do a lot of this stuff for my mum herself, has also pushed away people who have been offering to help.\n\nI am in NO WAY minimising her pain, or frustration, or exasperation at having had to deal with this. I know it must have been extremely difficult for her and I am grateful that she has been there to do it.\n\nHowever, my own emotional mental health and wellbeing over the last 25 years of my life dealing with my mother’s alcoholism, manic depressive episodes, and manipulative behaviour and emotional abuse got too much, and after being blackmailed and screamed at again, I didn’t have the energy for. I grew tired many years ago of trying to help her with her alcoholism, and she didn’t want help from anyone, let alone me. I was unfortunately, at times, the favourite child as a result of this — because although I didn’t enable her, I didn’t stop her from her destructive behaviour either.\n\nThe problem is, now, my sister thinks I owe her for all the work she’s done, and in order to repay this debt, I should be spending as much of the very little (literally 9 days to see 30+ people) time I have on my first holiday in 9 months(!) to take out a woman who abused me for many years and whose scars are only just started to be unpicked and unlearned. I am of course going to go and see her, and I had planned to see her probably 2 or 3 times. Apparently for my sister this is not enough.\n\nAITA? I am so exhausted and stressed and have spent the last three days feeling sick to my stomach about the idea of going home and having to deal with it, and given how much money this is costing my husband and I, none of it even feels remotely worth it.",

      "description": "TL;DR: had an anxiety attack at my own going away party which led me to being quiet/on my phone, leading to coworker sending me a long message about how rude I was\n\nI quit a job I had for about two years. My coworkers were basically like family. I planned something two weeks in advance where everyone would meet up somewhere for dinner. My Facebook invite said about 15 people were coming so I made the reservation the night of, after confirming this with those who I invited. The day of, one by one, people started cancelling on me saying they couldn’t come. The thing is, they told me they couldn’t come around an hour before or even an hour after the time we were at the restaurant. It was embarrassing having to tell the hostess I didn’t need the extra tables anymore. I was having an anxiety attack and was having a hard time focusing. I made this vocal to my coworkers who I was with. I was also texting my coworker who was my best friend at the time and telling her I was nervous because no one was here. I did enjoy the company of my coworkers who were there. We had good conversation. But I was still glued to my phone unfortunately trying to figure out the situation of people coming or not. My friend texted another coworker for me who she is friends with and asked her if she was going. Somehow she convinced her and my other coworker and their friend to go. They showed up an hour and a half into the night. \n\nThey immediately began complaining about the prices. They ordered some food and tried it and said it was disgusting. I was quiet at this time because I was kind of emotionally freaking out. I joked about leaving at some point of the night which I understand is very rude. I vocalized how anxious I was to everyone but I didn’t let that stop me from trying to enjoy my time with everyone for my last day. \n\nAnyways, we pay our checks and we all leave. I go home to my apartment, glad it’s all over, then I get a looong message from my coworker who showed up later, from her friend who she brought with her. \n\nIt said different things like “You’re such an awful host I didn’t even want to go to your stupid party but [coworkers name] made me.” And it was calling me rude, saying I was “whack” and stuff like that. This upset me a lot of course. The next day I had to pick up my last paycheck too which made me have even more anxiety. I also told my friend about it and she was defensive against me saying i should’ve coped better, which I agreed. \n\nMy other coworkers who were there said they understood I was having anxiety. I showed up to get my paycheck and I apologized face-to-face with everyone who was there. The girl whose friend sent me that message told me “I didn’t even notice you were being rude.” which is obviously not true otherwise she would’ve told her friend not to send me that. Anyways it was an awful way to leave a place I worked for for 2 years but my old manager still invites me to hangout and everything so I’m not as concerned anymore. \n\nI still feel really bad about the whole situation and I wish I could’ve been less selfish in that moment. Am I the asshole here? Should i have found a better way to engage my guests and be less selfish/not have freaked out the moment things went wrong? ",

      "description": "Or , more accurately, not telling anyone until the last minute.\n\nTo put it simply, I despise my current job.\n\nWhile it pays well and the work is not particularly difficult (sorting freight), the people I am forced to work with make it incredibly difficult to work at the level which seems to be expected of me. I could probably deal with my issues with the other employees and the management, however I work in an area where I am alone for most of the night, and am basically only spoken to when something has gone wrong (usually just having miss-sorted a couple of boxes); even then, I usually only get to hear my manager give me an extremely patronizing speech about how I \"should know better\". Again, not the worst thing in the world, but when when you're spending five nights a week with that as your only communication with other humans it tends to weigh heavily on your mind, you know?\n\nAnyway, come last night I just couldn't take it anymore. I'd had a bad night the night before- the start of the Christmas rush meant that there was overall a much more stressful environment than usual. On top of existing mental health issues, the stress of keeping up with even more impossible-than usual expectations meant that I ended up having a near-complete mental breakdown when it came time to drive home. I was able to find temporary consolation in pizza and netflix when I got home, however when it came time to go to work last night I found myself completely falling apart, to the point that I almost caused a major accident while driving. As soon as that happened I decided to pull over, and almost-compulsively pulled out my phone and sent a text message to my boss that I couldn't make it in because of personal issues. That was met with a flurry of messages in return saying that I was absolutely needed tonight- understandable, since it is the busiest time of the year; however I found myself unable to respond as I found myself panicking to the point where I needed to call the suicide hotline to help calm myself down.\n\nAnyway, I'm in a much better place today; I was able to get an appointment with my doctor this morning to get a new antidepressant prescription, and I've been in a generally good mood for the first time in a while. I've even started searching applying for a bunch of different jobs. But I can't shake the feeling that by skipping my shift at such a busy time without opportunity for someone else to take over, as well as by wanting to take a couple more days off to make sure I'm in the best mental state possible, that I have been/will be a massive asshole. So AITA in this situation?",

The topic comes up that he gets very defensive about, a very silly subject mind you and I point out how’s he’s quick to point out when I get defensive about silly things... enough drinks were had and the tab was paid and I was annoyed that he was being argumentative about something so silly when we have laughed about me getting the same way so I got up and walked towards home with him behind me. \n\nI tried to talk about it on the walk home but he was already hiccuping and repeating himself so I dropped it and stormed ahead. His things are at my house including his laptop he uses for work because we basically live together despite him having his own room in another apartment. I went inside and closed the door and he was too drunk to realize he had the keys so started calling and texting from outside to open up. \n\nI opened the window and tried to talk and admittedly in my own anger and drunkenness said to him hiccuping “just admit you’re drunk and I’ll give you your things” \n\nHe said fuck you you stupid bitch so I tossed him his keys, told him to go home and I’d give him his things in the morning. \n\nSince then I have been met with a barrage of calls and texts calling me names, threatening his company on me for keeping his laptop and just repeating “fuck you” 15+ times in a row. \n\nI answered a few of his calls and tried to reason but he was still furious and hateful so I told him I’d bring him his laptop early in the morning and am still being met with angry texts. Not sure what to do. I feel cornered and alone. ",

      "title": "AITA For playing music loudly during the daytime as a music student?",
      "description": "I am a college student who produces music once in a while. I recently got a great deal on some high quality speakers on craigslist that sound amazing to produce on. My headphones/earbuds don't even come close to the quality of them. (Cheap apple earbuds) After classes to unwind (At random times from 12-9PM) I try and produce on these speakers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy roommate however, loves napping. We don't share a room, (we share an apartment) and he always seems to be taking naps at conflicting times when I produce. I understand if I'm playing music late at night (when we have quiet hours after 10PM on weekdays and 12AM on weekends) or during finals week/hell week I turn it down. However in the evening/afternoon when he decides to naps he always complains. (The bass seems to vibrate his room he claims). However, I'm getting annoyed at him that I can't ever really produce to do this. I feel as if he had a better sleep schedule, instead of staying up late until 2am before early classes (I know this as again I stay up late as well) he wouldn't need these naps. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA recent example is when he stayed up all night drinking and partying with his friends on a Friday. At around 10:45 AM (Within non quiet hours) on the following Saturday morning, I decide to produce, unaware that he's still sleeping. Obviously, he wakes up and yells at me for playing music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother example is when I had another artist over, where I've been planning on having them come over for weeks in advance to make music on a Friday evening. We make some progress for about an hour, when my roommate comes back to the apartment and decides to nap. Here I had to completely cancel my plans and my recording session as I was threatened that he'll report me to the RA, unwilling to listen to me saying I was planning this ahead of time. (Technically the rule is that \"students can study with out unreasonable noise - even during non quiet hours\") Obviously I turn it down, frustrated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the knee jerk answer is for me to get headphones. But 1) as a college student I can't really afford the same teir of headphones compared to these speakers for dirt cheap. and 2) The music I make is bass heavy, and I need the subwoofers on the speakers to get a closer true sound of what I'm hearing through headphones.  I also can't play late at night when hes awake as I have 2 other roommates who have a normal sleep schedule, and I don't want to wake them up. I know practice rooms exist, but they don't have the speakers I need, I need to rent them, and at my school they are really hard to book.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for blasting my music during the actual daytime if I'm trying to make some music? I can't really judge my roommate on his sleep schedule, but then again I am playing it during non quiet hours. My roommate is a night owl however. I don't think its too disturbing for studying purposes and none of my other roommates complain at all. As far as I can tell only the bass permeates my room. (I am not trying to destroy my ears, I think the speakers bass vibrate the wall, across the living room, to my roommates room, something weird about resonance and paper thin walls and a finicky roommate about noise?)",

Throughout this I texted my mom when we left, arrived, etc since she was kind of worried.\n\nI ended up getting home around 3:00 AM, and my mom was pissed. She had stayed up to make sure I got home ok, and she went to bed grumbling to my dad about it and telling me off for staying out so late. I feel like she could have just told me I couldn’t go in the first place if she didn’t want me staying out, and I kept her updated the whole night. I wasn’t the one driving, and I couldn’t really control when we left. Not to mention that the mall was far away. I can see both sides to this I guess, but what do you think?",

      "description": "Sorry for any typos, I don’t live in the US so English isn’t my first language.\n\nI (26M) met my boyfriend (23M) at a bar last year in July. We immediately got along well cause we have similar interests and the same type of humour. After dating for a few months, we officially became a couple in October. I was never particularly lucky when it came to stuff like dating or relationships, so getting together with him made me super happy. He is good-looking, funny, smart, polite and cute.\n\nThere is just this... one thing: He‘s a sex worker. He does webcam shows, uploads videos of him masturbating and playing with toys on a website (it’s one of those sites where you have to subscribe and pay to gain access) and also occasionally dances at a gay club in my city. He also used to meet up with people who offered  him money and have sex with them, but he doesn’t do that anymore.\n\nHe confessed all of this to me a month after we met each other. At first I was really uncomfortable with it. I don’t think sex workers are disgusting or anything, but the thought a bunch of other people fucking or jacking off to a guy I‘m into didn’t make my happy.\nHowever, because the vibes between us were so good, I decided to give him a chance - and I‘m glad I did. I didn’t want this stupid thing to stop us from being happy. He‘s a great person, lives life relatively responsibly (as far as a 23 y/o can) and, well, I was in love.\nThe only thing I requested him to stop doing was meeting up with people for sex. I didn’t pressure him into it, it was just something that crossed the line for me. He understood that and only does webcam shows, the videos and dancing now.\n\nAlmost all of my friends know about his job and while some of them were weirded out and thought it was kinda funny that I’d date someone like that at first, they all ended up loving him once they had actually met him. Like I said, he‘s a super likable and nice person.\n\nNow here‘s the issue at hand:\nOf course I also told my parents when I got a BF. They were both happy for me and immediately asked when I was going to introduce him to them. As you can tell from the title of my post, I‘m super scared of that though. I don‘t wanna lie to them about his job (and I don’t want him having to lie about it either) since me and my parents are very honest to each another. I‘m also scared that they won’t accept him and maybe even refuse to see him (or me) again. They are both rather prudish and conservative (took them a long time to accept the fact that I‘m gay too) so I just can’t see that whole thing going well. I can already hear them say: „This is disgusting! You’re dating a prostitute! What are the people going to say? He probably has diseases“, etc. \nWhenever they ask me when I‘m finally going to introduce him, I just tell them that we’re both too busy to match our schedules right now and change the subject. It seems like they’re getting impatient though and I‘m not sure if I can put it off much longer.\n\nI feel really guilty about all of this. I thought I had accepted what my BF does, but the fact that I can’t muster up the courage to introduce him to my parents makes me feel like an asshole. I do love him after all and know that I‘d be sad if my BF was too embarrassed to introduce me to others as well.\n\n\nSo, I just wanna know: AITA in this scenario for being embarrassed about it? Or do you guys think the way things are justifies my feelings? I haven‘t brought up the issue to my BF yet because I don’t want to hurt his feelings.",

      "description": "Okay, so basically this happened this morning and as the day has gone on I’ve gone from “that was fucking stupid” to “maybe I’m a dick”. \n\nThis morning I did a HIIT cycle class. Essentially 50 ish people on bikes doing a HIIT workout with an instructor. If you don’t know what HIIT is, it stands for high intensity interval training, basically doing bursts (45 seconds or so) of giving it 100% “I feel like I might have a heart attack” sort of intensity, then 15 seconds or so of catching your breathe. Rinse and repeat. \n\nSo anyway. I get on a bike that’s in the corner right at the back, an older dude (I dunno, maybe 60?) comes up and puts his stuff on the bike next to me and says hi. I say hi back, friendly and all. \n\nKeep in mind I’m just getting back into working out. So I’m just getting back into the feeling of physical excursion, and I definitely can’t handle it as well as when I’m flat out with my workouts. Which means I’m extra shitty during because, well, I’d rather fucking lie down and die than keep on working out.  \n\nAnyway, workout starts and this dude starts talking to me in the rest periods about my workout. As in shit like “why did you slow before the timer went?” “What happened there?” “Come on get up!” Now, I was being nice at the start. While feeling like fainting I gathered up the energy to respond to this dude. I told him at one point that I’m just getting back into working out so I’m doing mah fuckn best. This went on for like 10 minutes, and he’d say some shit to me almost every rest period. \n\nAnyway, after enough of this I said “can you stop talking to me” because seriously I was exhausted and I couldn’t be assed explaining why I’m working out the way I am or being watched over on how I’m going. He went all offended at me, can’t remember what he said. I said “rule no.1 of gym is don’t talk to people while they’re working out” (unless it’s a friend of course). He said “that’s your rule not mine”. In my head I was like, there’s 50 people in here and you’re the only cunt trying to have a conversation. Think you’re the odd one out. \n\nI’m feeling like I could have been less of a dick about it, but I think I was so rude because I was absolutely fucked from the workout which made me grumpy. On the other hand, for fucks sake mate we’re strangers. I’m here to work out not socialise. Why the fuck are you talking to me. \n\nHe started talking to the dude beside him instead after that. He seemed to be nice about it. \n\nAs the cherry on top, 10 mins after I said that he turns to me and goes “well don’t talk to me either”. I was like dude at no point have I initiated a conversation with you, you’ve got nothing to worry about. But I didn’t say anything in response. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? I’m on the fence about this. Could have handled it better, that’s for sure. \n\n",

After an hour and aa half I went inside and she's still there partying a way. I have her keys and said hey. I'm done. And went back outside. I really had no where to gI so I just sat there and waited. Finally when the bar closed three hours after I originally left she comes out. I didn't say a word to her until we were just about to my place. I told her I thought what she did was rude. She just wanted to drive home but she was shit faced drunk so I took her keys. I let her sleep in my bed and I stayed on the couch. The next morning she left. I didn't say goodbye. And I texted her later saying I was done. ",

      "description": "We were best friends at university for 3 years, we helped each other through a lot, pet sat for each other, stayed at each other's houses, etc.. She went through a breakup with her boyfriend of ~6 months and she naturally was very down. I tried to support her as best I could, we went out and did things, talked on the phone, I texted her when I couldn't call to make sure she was okay.\n\nSome background to this is that after a month of being together, they started looking at buying houses together. He earned quite a bit for his age, but she earned less than 10k year year, most of it from student loans. Her friends were quite concerned about this and brought up gently to her a few times that maybe this was all happening a bit fast. A few of our other friends were more blunt than I was and she was upset with them for it, and overall very quick to dismiss us. We still tried to be supportive. All this occurred after a bad longterm relationship breakdown for her, and we saw that she wanted to hit these relationship milestones in her new relationship quickly to prove to everyone she was fine.\n\nA few months after this second breakup she was not communicating well, one word or very short answers, saying things like she'd never be happy again, he was perfect for her, she'll never earn enough to buy a house on her own, etc.. After a few weeks of this I gave her a small bit of tough love and said 'it doesn't matter whether or not you want to keep going, you don't really have a choice. Sitting at home and being upset all day isn't a way to live your life. It will get better eventually'. \n\nAfter this, she stopped answering my calls. I sent her a thoughtful card, texts, Facebook messages, etc.. She ignored me on everything. I apologised the next day for being harsh, and said my best friend was like that with me after my last breakup and it worked well for me but I know everyone is different so I'm sorry I upset you. Still nothing. Didn't even look at what I sent. Once a week or so I sent her a message or tried to call, asking how she was and a small conversation starter.\n\nThis went on for three months before I deleted her on Facebook. It was quite big for me as I was checking her page everyday and getting upset when I saw her doing things with her other non university friends. I wanted to be there for her because she's obviously going through a hard time, but she wouldn't let me.\n\nTLDR: AITA for giving some tough love to my friend after a breakup, then deleting her after she ghosted me for 3 months?

Generally my BF asks that I go to him for my emotional needs so his particular issues aren’t aggravated. \nLast night I was playing a game with him and I was getting irritated that he was micromanaging me and I kept dying. Then I got into an argument with my sister and that just sent me over the edge and I was freaking out. I texted my BF so we could talk and I could calm down, which is how we usually deal with it, but then he made it clear that he was going to sleep in the next 10-15 minutes. I have weird emotional abandonment issues from a past relationship and I really don’t handle it well when my SO has to leave me when I’m asking them for help. The rest of the time he was awake it was just damage control for me feeling abandoned and me making sure he was alright before he went to sleep. \n\nI know I would have been the asshole if I asked for him to stay up last night because it turns out he has strep. But WIBTA if I asked him to stay up for a little while (10 minutes or less usually) when I’m going crazy so it’s easier to calm down?",

      "description": "Long, complicated story.  Buckle up:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile on a working holiday a few months ago, I broke my ankle.  I moved from my guesthouse into a hostel upon the recommendation of a friend, because they had crutches and a wheelchair available for guests (much, MUCH cheaper than renting those items from the local hospital).  \n\nAt the hostel I met several long term guests who were working/studying on the island, including another American who was very helpful when I couldn't walk at all.  She was there for weird missionary purposes, but was still pretty young and cool and only made me slightly uncomfortable by talking about Jesus every once in a while.  I genuinely liked her.  She picked stuff up for me from the convenience store next door and accompanied me to the hospital during one of my visits, as well as to the airport.\n\nI had made my travel plans before the accident and I was supposed to be taking a trip to another country in Asia.  I decided that I would go there to get my surgery since it was MUCH cheaper there than the place I was staying.  I already had a plane ticket leaving from another city.  But I could no longer take a long bus or train ride in my condition.  To make things worse I couldn't purchase a plane ticket to that city because I forgot my mastercard securecode (I STILL have to figure that out, because my bank was no help at all and every time I try to call mastercard through skype it's a shitshow.  Thanks mastercard!)\n\nANYWAY this girl was very nice &amp; purchased the $60 ticket for me and I sent her $100 on paypal because I knew there might be another problem.  Sure enough there was another problem though.  When she accompanied me to the hospital (I needed to get blood thinners to board a flight to avoid getting a blood clot in my leg) it turned out to be more expensive than the hospital had told me over the phone (because they'd only told me the cost of the shot- not the cost of the obligatory 2 minute \"consultation\" with their fancy bone doctor).  So I gave her the cash I had on me and she paid for the rest with her card (about $30 or $40).\n\nSo at this point I'd sent her $100 and she'd paid around $100 for me.\n\nAnyway this whole time we were at the hostel she told me she knew some people who had helped her a great deal when she was staying in the country I was travelling to.  They were locals who could help me get around, translate for me and get things for me for small fees.\n\nI always sort of rebuffed her though as I had already done a great deal of research and was pretty sure I could handle initial things on my own &amp; could likely find paid helpers if I needed to through expat grounds on fb.\n\nShe contacted them on her own and gave them my fb, told them to meet me at the airport.\n\nShe asked me if this was ok and I just said \"ok\" despite major misgivings, because I was tired and thought the worst that could happen would be an overpriced taxi from the airport.  I'd like to add that I genuinely think she thought she was helping.\n\nAnyway, I want to make this short: these guys were awful.  They tried to make me stay in a hotel with a lot of stairs and I was like \"no I can't fucking walk, what the hell?\" and then they were like \"there aren't any guesthouses without stairs\" so I got out the research I'd done and told them 2 and went to 1 and sure enough got a ground floor room.  They told me they were accompanying me to one hospital I'd researched, but actually brought me to another much worse one that they said would be much cheaper (it wasn't.  They just knew people who'd worked there).  I was stupid and felt unsure and unsafe and went along with things, but after the surgery the nurses kept telling me I was going to get robbed and/or raped if I stayed there without anyone accompanying me overnight so I ended up getting a random couchsurfer to come over (seriously he was a saint, what a nice guy).\n\nAnyway the 2 guys who accompanied me everywhere started hassling me for cash and I ended up having to give them $50 each.  To be fair, they had helped me somewhat, but only with situations they had put me in.  For example, the terrible hospital had no elavator and the orthopedic surgeon was on the 4th floor.  So with a bunch of doctors they carried me in the wheelchair up the damn stairs.  But like...I was only in that situation because of them.\n\nAnyway months later the girl asked me to send her more money, because she apparently forgot I gave her cash at the hospital to cover the shot (but not the doctor's consultation).  I gladly gave it to her anyway.  \\*She\\* genuinely helped me.  But the guys she knew here did NOT.  AT ALL.  They never got things I requested, gave me false information and always made me feel scared for my safety (and I mean I'm a solo female traveller who has lived &amp; travelled all over Europe, the Middle East &amp; Asia...I'm pretty good at gauging my safety in different situations).\n\nWhen I tried to bring this to her attention while it was happening, she would always say something about \"Jesus putting us through trials\" or \"Everything will work out in the end thanks to Jesus.\"  I strongly disagree and want to block her.  But do I still owe her anything?  Should I stay connected to her on social media in case I can potentially help her one day?  Do I owe her an explanation?  Thanks for reading all of this.",

      "description": "So I'm 19, and I just got my first job ever at Target. I'm gonna be going to college soon, so i wanted a bit of money to bring with me along the way. I get my paycheck and my mom is talking to me about how much I made. I owe my mother some money for some things she bought for me so theres that. But she also wants me to give money to my Aunt who sent me some money early last month even though I never told her I needed it, and just assumed she was doing it to be nice and just support me, since she not once asked me to pay her back. I don't even think my aunt asked for it. I think my mom just wants me to give it to her.\n\nSo me and my mom get into an argument about how \"fucking disgusting\" it is for me not thinking about giving my aunt back the money she gave me. She's given me some cash a few times in the past (which again i never did ask her for), but that argument left me feeling bitter, because she wanted to shame me being kind of hesitant for just giving money to those who don't ask for it. Like I told her, I'm just trying to save up as much as I can for college. What also kind of gets me is that they both have really good well paying jobs, so to just take money from me who's just working their first part time job doesn't really sit well with me. So am I wrong for how I feel about this? I fee like she's just trying to guilt trip me and teach me a lesson about selflessness.",

Last night when she got off the potty, she did this and my husband told her to put on her pants as it was approaching dinner time. After telling her to put on her pants she ignored him and kept running. Then he told her something like \"that's nasty; you need to wear pants.\" I gasped from the kitchen where I was preparing dinner and said, \"That's not nasty. There's not one nasty thing about our baby girl.\" Then I told my daughter we are about to eat and we wear pants at the dinner table in case we spill hot food on ourselves and she put on her pants and helped set the table. My husband says I shouldn't contradict him in front of her. I explained that he should tell her it's too cold to be without pants or it's unhygienic at the dinner table, but not to use the word \"nasty\" as I don't want her to feel shame about her body. He explained that he is her father and when I contradict him in front of her that undercuts his role in the family, and I said, \"And I'm a mother and a woman. I protect her like you do too but I also know what it's like to have  a complex about your body and that's not what I want her to even think about at 3.\" Then my husband said we shouldn't discuss it front of her so we changed the subject. \n\nSo was I wrong to react how I did? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He told me I was everything he wanted in a partner, which I found sweet but he froze up when I told him I loved how safe he was. He got unusually serious and asked me what I meant by that. I explained that in my teens and early twenties I had a habit of choosing guys who were fun and passionate but really unpredictable - like the bad-boy type or athletes, but now I was getting older I wanted someone who would be a good father, have a good steady job, and would get along with my family. He seemed to take this as an insult and asked \"exactly how many men have I been with\"? I told him it was none of his business and then he started throwing a list of questions like \"Do you even find me attractive\", \"How long have you felt this way\", etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese questions were insulting and he was being a dick but after arguing about this for half an hour, I gave him the whole summary that he should not be jealous of my previous relationships, he had no right to pry into my past, that I do find him attractive for his qualities not necessarily his looks, and that he should be proud that he's the first guy I was with that ever met my parents. This seemed to make him more upset and then he had the audacity to ask him if he was first \"Asian guy\" I've ever dated (we're both Asian). I told him the truth, that yes he was, but that it meant nothing. He suddenly stormed out of the living and shouted that I'm using him as a safety net to please my family. The truth is  my family is strict and conservative, so yes I wouldn't bring home anyone who wasn't Asian, but in the heat of argument I told him that's not true and he didn't believe me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe packed a bag and told me he was going to be staying with a friend for a few days before slamming the main door. I still don't understand why he's so insulted and I'm pissed off at him for asking all these prodding questions about my past. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Bf gets mad that I like him for being safe, accuses me of using him as a safety net for my Asian parents.",

I’ll be missing three days of school (I have not missed any this year) so that means I’ll miss three days worth of math notes, three days of history lectures, and three days of reading in ELA (we are doing a class read and I’ll be way behind. \nOn top of school work I always have busy schedules and this trip cuts right into it. \n\nMonday- viola lesson \nTuesday - teach  viola lesson (which my mother cut half an hour short unexpectedly today because she wanted to show someone my new room, which was just remodeled, and I had to be there)\nWednesday- DND with my friends\nThursday- volunteer (I volunteer at a place called the ARC where I work with mentally disabled people. The people at the ARC love me and I will feel like I’m disappointing everyone by not going)\nFriday and Saturday are my only off days \nSunday- volunteer at my church\n\nThis trip cuts right in the middle and honestly it’s just pissing me off. My mom calls me a lazy ass. I go get work and activities. My mom makes me unable to do them.\n\nOn the flip side, I’ll be visiting my papa in Idaho for skiing (which is always fun) and my papa and I have a really good connection. \n\nAITA for not wanting to go on this trip?\n",

My tuition teacher told me to sit beside her so that I can “socialise” with the other people in the tuition class. But all of them are my classmates when I was 12 and they all ostracised me or turned a blind eye to said ostracising. Now, they all pretend that didn’t happened at all. I get along with some classmates of mine (not in this tuition class), they’re nice people and they stood up for me just this year because some girl that actively took part in the said ostracising, refused to let me sit at her group even though it was another girl that asked me to trade places. The teacher also said that I have mild autism which I don’t have at all and I feel really salty about it too. I cried about those during the tuition class and the boys there were snickering.  With their constant talking behind someone back,Im not surprised if they talked shit about me as well. So, Am I the asshole or not?",

      "description": "First off obligatory sorry for formatting, on mobile.\n\nSo to preface my situation me and my roommate live in an old art gallery, that was turned into an apartment. The apartment doesn’t have real walls for the bedrooms, they are more like dividers, so anything that goes on in the apartment we can hear. It’s caused some problems in the past, as we have learned to adjust but this takes the cake.\n\nSo about a month ago me and her had gone out with some friends, and I went home early expressing that I had to work in the morning, and was going to bed. About 2 hours later she brings everyone back to our house, drink as fuck at this point, to smoke some weed. Being a drunk group of people they were loud enough to interrupt my sleep, so I go an ask if they could quiet down. I had to ask three times, before finally I decided to just ask them to either shut up or leave. They go , she apologized the next day and it was fine. So I thought.\n\nAbout a week later she brings a group over again, must be about 2am. I try to ignore them because I hate being that Bitch that tells everyone to leave. About 30 minutes to by of them loudly chatting and decide it’s time to ask for them to quiet down or leave. They go , we move on again. I feel like at that point she should understand the boundaries. Well no.\n\nSo last night she brings a friend over I wanna day around 2am again. Them coming in woke me up which frustrated me because I had to be up at 7am for an appointment. So I go and ask if they could just please be quiet and I had to sleep. They decide to go to bed, I get to sleep all is well. \n\nSo today I went up to her just to discuss how often this has been occurring, and ask if she could be more respectful of when I’m trying to rest. (Note I almost always use headphones at home , never have people over late , just generally do my best to be respectful). She starts to get mad saying that I bring people over at night and it doesn’t upset her, so why am I upset. Saying that we both knew the situation when we moved in, and just generally not wanting to change her habits. I was trying to ask her if we could just compromise, and she just got mad saying “I just want to be able to do what I want”, and “I’ve never had roommates who cared.” Pointing out to when we would hangout at her old place, before we were roommates, up late drinking and partying. \n\nI feel bad because I know she’s not used to a situation where her roommates had a problem with this, but I also don’t want to just sit in my room angry and awake whenever this happens. Am I wrong for asking her to not have people over so late ? Is there a way I should go about this differently?",

      "description": "There are 6 people in our suite and since we're all guys, our garbage cans get filled pretty quickly. To avoid any arguing, we all agreed to create a chart so that whenever the trash gets full, the next person in sequence throws it out.\n\nThis system works out pretty well until about 10 days ago.\n\n10 days ago, the trash can was full. At this point we all expected the next person on the list to throw it out. \n\nAbout 3 days pass, and the garbage is now very full, topping over its limit. Some of the garbage fell on the floor which is due to poor garbage Jenga stacking. We remind him in a group chat to clean it up. He says he'll do it. \n\nAnother 3 days pass, and now there is a ton of garbage on the floor, such as food, plates, and a bunch of empty wrappers. We all nag him to clean it up since it's getting too filthy.\n\nAnother day passes, and one of our suitemates gets fed up and throws out one of the maxed trash cans (there are two cans total). There is still trash on the floor and in one garbage can.\n\nToday (10th day), he finally cleans it up. But he only cleaned the two trash cans and says that the floor garbage is not his responsibility. At this point, all 5 of us start saying it is his responsibility since if he had just done his job like he was supposed to, there would be nothing on the floor and he says that we're just pointing fingers and just looking for someone to blame since it's easy to attack one person. \n\nThe garbage on the floor still remains.\n\nI get that we could have just cleaned it up, but we agreed that all it takes is one exception to end up just ignoring our cleaning chart and having an erratic system. He is the objectively the messiest suitemate out of us, so we thought him cleaning up extra floor garbage as punishment for being 10 days late was justified.\n\nAWTA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Ok, so I’m a junior in high school, and I’ve been hit HARD by school. It’s not an exaggeration to say this has been my hardest month of school ever. I have 7 classes, 5 of them are AP/honors level, and I signed myself up for way too much shit. My biggest problem is that I get really anxious when I overwhelmed, and i end up avoiding everything by procrastinating on the internet. I’ve had a year long research paper I just finished yesterday, test, projects, hw, insanity. My dad knows this and wanted to help the whole time.\n\nMy parents are divorced btw, they switch off at the house weekly. I asked for his help on much of the stuff, but then I lied about the year long research paper. We’d been working together on it all February, so two weeks ago at the switch off,I told him I got a rough draft in, when I hadn’t finished it. This made him happy because he thought I had just made the deadline. My mom had a stressful work project she couldn’t help me. \n\nSo how did I spend the two weeks while my paper was overdue? Panicking and wasting all my time on YouTube and Reddit. I frequently told my mom I was studying when I wasn’t. I also told my dad when it was his week and he asked that the teacher was being really late on getting back comments, still covering up how behind I truly was. Finally, it came to Wednesday, I bombed a Biology test, I bombed a music theory test, I was pissed off and scared. I told my mom that I got back the comments, and my “analysis is weak,” and I need help. She didn’t til 2 am with me working on it, and finally, together we scrounged together a decent paper and turned it in yesterday. Who knows how badly my grade will be affected by the lateness, luckily I managed A’s on that class’s tests without studying because I’m just good at history tests. I actually managed to do most of my overdue hw and now I’m chilling for the first time in 2019. \n\nSo I understand that I messed up, I signed up for only 5 classes next year. I know I should’ve told my parents about my hw truthfully, but they would’ve just been more stressed and come down on me, making me more anxious. It sorta all worked out in the end. So am I the asshole, and what should I do going forward?\n",

      "description": "1: AITA for putting him in trouble? this happened days ago.\n\nin our school there are a lot of trouble makers (guys), really especially in my class. \n\nSo, there is a guy (LETS CALL HIM A) in my school, A confessed his feelings to me through a letter, he wrote in the letter that he was embarrassed to just texts me on my social media, he thought that I will find him a creep if he does that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA is cool guy but also introvert, he used to do bad stuff like smoking, drinking, getting in trouble/problems with other guys etc but this school year he has been doing his best and showed changes.\n\nThere is also a guy, Z. Z likes me, because he always follows me around, he never allows anyone to bully me, he tries to flirt with me, get my attention and stuff.\n\nSo, A put the letter through the opening of my locket. I saw it days ago, I was reading it in class (A wasn't in school that day) no one was looking so it was fine. Then the teacher came in the class and I put the letter in my book, then there was a guy that needed a book. The teacher asked us if one of us can give the guy a book so he can read the texts and questions etc. I sat closer to him so without thinking (I forgot), I gave him the book, the letter was in the book.\n\nHe read the letter, after 2-3 mins I remembered it and took it. They all told each other, Z was mad for unknown reason.\n\nThen after school, I saw A, he didn't see me, when I looked at him I knew that those bullies caused him problems, that he went into trouble with them. He looked exhausted. \n\nThe day after, I went straight to the principle and told him everything I saw, I told him that A needs protection.\n\nThe principle called all the bullies and they lied, the principle had no evidence but he ended up giving detentions. They were furious at me, well at least they don't hurt girls.\n\nZ talked to me that day and told me ''you better stop protecting that \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* I will not protect you if you like him''.\n\nI visited A in his home after that, I apologized and I told him that I have no feelings of attraction towards him but we agreed to go on a date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas ITA? was it because of me he went through those problems with the bullies? we are 15/16\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2: AITA for kissing him on the cheeks?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntoday we went on a date, after the date when we were in front of our houses (he lives next door/house) I kissed him because idk I just thought he looked cute because he was blushing but I kinda feel bad because I rejected him to be my bf (or I to be his gf) but I kissed, idk it kinda felt as if I am leading him on, am I? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Not sure if this is the correct subreddit for this, but wanted some opinions. I recently got a job at Target working in the starbucks cafe. I have worked two days there so far, and thought it was going great. My trainer and I didn’t exactly click, but we were never unfriendly towards eachother and I did everything I was told. She even told me towards the end of my second day that I was doing great and she was impressed at how I was making drinks on my own on my second day of training. In this conversation, she also said I didn’t seem very “enthusiastic”. I told her I kind of have an rbf(which I do) and it wasn’t anything personal. I am also a very anxious person, so my first two days working I was kind of quiet. However, I was very attentive to customers and never rude, and never complained. \n\nToday, 20 minutes before my shift I get a call from the HR lady. She asks me if I remember my conversation with my trainer and asks if I know what she’s referring to. She says that I don’t have the “face of starbucks/target” which is very big on customer service and that I didn’t seem enthusiastic enough. She said she talked to other team leads and that “i’m not going to work out”. This took me very much by surprise, as I have only worked two five hour shifts with the same trainer, and have barely got to know any of the other managers. I think that my trainer told her I was blatantly rude or insensitive, as I said above me and the trainer didn’t exactly “click”. It still doesn’t make sense to me as I only worked there two days and I feel like I haven’t gotten a chance. I have worked in customer service for three years at my previous job and have ever had any complaints from those managers. Am I the bad person here or are they? I feel very upset and worthless as I have never been fired before and know I am a hard worker. \n\nI honestly think that if given more time my personality would’ve come out and I would’ve been less shy.

      "description": "To start off with some background, I'm Jewish, which all of my friends are aware of. Over the years, they've made jokes at my expense with that being the subject matter. Over time, these jokes have become more and more insulting, and I've had multiple discussions with them about how they make me feel. After these conversations, the jokes tend to die down and then start up after a little while. Most recently in December, I nearly cut off all contact with them before they got the message and the jokes stopped. \n\nNow for the current context. This past weekend, three of us (for simplicity, the other two will be called B and J - we're all 22-23) went up to visit another friend (R) at school. Friday night, I go out with B and J while R goes to another party. While out, B, J, and I end up going to the apartment of someone we knew. B decided to smoke pot with the hosts, and since I can't because of my job, I left and went to hang out with R. After a bit, R and I head back to R's apartment for the night, and I fall asleep on the couch with my sleeping bag as a blanket. B and J come back later, and B decided to wake me up by pulling my blanket off and spitting beer on me. I get pissed off, but get him to eventually leave me alone. He then goes into R's room and says \"this little k*ke bitch won't get off the sofa.\" Hearing that, I got pretty fumed and told him that if I ever heard him say that again, I'd put him through a wall. He continued to spit beer on me and get in my face before R stepped in and brought me to sleep in his room for the night on the floor in my sleeping bag. The most physical it got was me pushing B away from me after he tried to \"apologize\". The rest of the weekend, I was given the option to either sit alone in R's room or go hang out with the three of them in the living room. I wasn't about to sit around making merry with B, so I sat in the room basically until this afternoon when we left. I didn't have the option to leave because B, of all people, was the ride back. \n\nHere's where I might be an asshole. In the past, B had his mother send the group messages teasing us because we were teasing him. She sent me a gif of a typical Jewish stereotype to make fun of me, so I was a bit annoyed. Today, I decided since he brought his mother in to fight his battles, I'd do the same and make her apprised of the situation. I probably shouldn't have done it, but I don't really feel bad about it since it gave me a sense of closure. If not, I would have ended up just stewing for the next couple of weeks and been in a bad mood. Now, I feel pretty good and feel like maybe he got what was coming to him, but I really don't know. The friendship, and possibly the other two are over, so it's not gonna be coming back to haunt me at least. I get that I shouldn't have stooped to his level and acted like a child, but I was still pretty heated about it and I'm totally OK with it if I was an asshole. ",

      "description": "I posted on legaladvice about how in my project building, a crew/gang of 4-5-6 people (all males) will often hang out directly in front of the entrance of my building, which had a scaffold built recently above it, which contributes to this. They will hold the locked entrance (need a key) open so they can go in and out of the lobby as they please, almost always using the lobby to smoke and play dice in.\n\nNot only that, but they'll sometimes say things to people coming in the building and my lightskin friends sometimes mention that they get somewhat pressed coming in with questions like \"Y'all live here now?\" and offering them drugs, but it's just not offering, it's the kind where they aggressively offer and you refuse and they mumble some shittalk at you because they figure you're here for drugs anyway because you have light skin and they're racist.\n\nI got accused of being naive, racist and not actually living there long, when I've lived there all my life and do not actually have a problem with people hanging out on the project grounds. But directly in the lobby entrance, where I have to walk past and through groups of young hooded and du-rag wearing guys? Who wants to deal with that after work?\n\nSo I'll sometimes call the cops if I see them crowding the entrance or in the lobby in that group of 4-6 and in fact, I would like to do it each and every time I see them there, because they would NEVER be tolerated in a regular residential building, so why is this allowed in the projects? Am I using up police resources unduly?\n\nI'm in my 20s, light-skin hispanic. I just want to be able to come in and out unmolested, same with my friends. Not trying to be /r/iamverybadass here, but I can defend against one guy, anyone could really, but it's never one guy, its always a group and you feel defenseless. I'm even going as far as to consider applying for a pistol license. \n\n\n",

I usually have anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks off when I am home. \n\nMy gf(26) of 6 years understands mostly and is used to this by now. As I have been working like this for the past 5 years. \n\nAt this time I'm transitioning to another company that will have me working 4 days on 3 off but for those 4 days I will still be out of town. At this point I have everything I want. A car, dog, house all paid off. I still feel as if something is lacking from my life. So I'm going to join the Army reserve.\n\nNow on to the ahole territory. I have discussed this with her on several occasions and have tried to incorporate her into my decision for my job with the army but she's been pretty ambivalent about it. She said she doesn't mind what I do because I always do what I want even when I try and consult her opinion on everything. I love her and see a future with her. I just feel like I need to do this for myself. I would also give her my gi bill so she could go to school.\n\nThe current mos I am looking at has a deployment every 2 or 3 years for 9 months. Coupled with my civilian job \n\nSo reddit WIBTA if I worked a job that took me away 4 days a week and have a 9 month deployment every couple of years?",

The problem I am facing is that they want to celebrate my younger cousins birthday (We will call him YC) the same day, at the same dinner, at the same time.  Now I was not rude but I simply told my grandparents that I do not want to go to dinner for my birthday but thank you for the offer. My parents confronted me about it and I told them that I don't want to share my birthday party with YC because I really wont get a party and everyone focus will be on YC and ill be shunted off to the side. To clarify YC is 12 going on 13 and I am 19 going on 20.  My parents say that I am being unreasonable and I should deal with it. \n\nLater I was thinking about it and was not sure if  I am just being greedy and selfish or if my feelings had any validation.  So am I the asshole for not wanting to share a birthday with YC? ",

      "description": "So, I am a teenager and I do acting, dance, and singing in my spare time, it's practically my entire life. About 3 weeks ago I started to experience chest pains and they got worse over the course of a week so I went to the ER. After doing an ECG, blood test, and a chest x-ray they told me I could have an inflamed diaphragm and that I should just take extra strength Advil. \n\nFast forward to yesterday,  it had been two weeks and my pain still hadn't gone away. I was at practice when the pain got worse again so I went back to the ER. \n\nThey asked all of the typical questions and I didn't want to lie so I told them I had ADHD, anxiety, depression, and some episodes with voices in my head and whatnot. After they did the same tests they did last time, they told me it had a chance of being anxiety pain or another symptom of my psychotic episodes. They told me to take more Advil and if that didn't work they would give me a prescription. \n\nAt this point it was late at night, I was tired, and frustrated. I told the doctor I had been taking Advil for two weeks straight and asked him to give me a prescription. The only problem was, it was basically just fancy Advil. \n\nNow the problem is, I don't feel like the doctor's were taking my pain seriously and I was more than a little upset. I've had pain from my mental issues and it has never compared to my chest pains before. \n\nSo AITA for feeling mad at the doctor? ",

      "description": "Lately, I’ve been drinking tea a lot, especially this granulated kind I get from my local European store. This is the kind of tea that’s made up mostly of sugar. Usually, I add 2-3 tea spoons in a cup and mix it with some hot or cold water. (It depends on my mood and the weather, mostly.) \n\nThat was a little bit of a backstory. \n\nYesterday, my roommate asked me to go with her to the local European store and I agreed, even though I didn’t need anything. When we were there she got herself some of the tea I drink, because she tried it before and she liked it. \n\nWell, last night she told me she was making some tea and asked me if I wanted some. I said yes, and then she said “okay, but i’m using the one from your bag.”   She used my tea before and I never minded, but sure, if that’s what she wanted. \n\nSo I went to the kitchen while she was making them, and I noticed she was adding too many teaspoons of the granulated sugary shit for herself. And I’m talking half of the cup was filled with only the tea, no water yet. I told her “i don’t think you’re supposed to put that much” and she got really upset. She said something like “if you didn’t pay for it, you don’t get to say how much i should use or not”. \n\nThen she proceeded to finish making her tea and she locked herself in her room right after. She thinks I’m an asshole and hasn’t talked to me at all since then. \n\nSo, Reddit, is she right and I’m an asshole for trying to tell her too much of this kind of tea isn’t too healthy? Am I missing something here? I would really like to know, so I can apologize to her if I did something genuinely wrong. \n\nTL;DR: I like granulated tea. the one I drink it’s made up mostly of sugar and other unhealthy stuff. Roommate likes my tea too. Got some for herself. She put like 10 teaspoons in her cup. Told her she put too much, she told me I’m an asshole because she paid for it and I should shut up. ",

It’s basically items that were returned to Amazon’s warehouse that were all stuffed in a box without checking the quality of the return. We decided to go through with it and use that money to pay our rent. We both contributed the same amount of $400.\n\nWe received a whole pallet worth of goods a month ago. As soon as I ended my day job, I would come home and would do a quality check for each box (13 boxes). My roommate never helped out because he was “too busy with other stuff” but his lights are always out and I know he goes to sleep as soon as he gets home from work. He wakes up around 12am and doesnt go back to bed till 4. \n\nAnyways, after going through every box and listing every sellable item on ebay (a process that took a week, I managed to sell every item and made about $2500. Since my roommate did not contribute, I gave him back his $400 and kept the rest of the profit to myself. \n\nNow hes pissed off and threatening to get a lawyer for “stealing his money”. \n\nAITA here??",

It can be hard for people to make new friends in uni so maybe she was just trying to be friendly and I blew her off.

      "description": "I apologise in advance as I'm a bag of emotions right now as I'm writing this. As I just had an argument with my wife about this. \n\nTo give background of how things are currently; my wife are a happily married couple with a 2 year old with my father-in-law whom is retired (but working a part-time job) all living in one house. The house was purchased 8 years ago by my wife and her parents but once we got married 4 years ago the title (and mortgage) was transferred to me and my wife. I am grateful for this as the currently climate for where we live it is near impossible to afford such a house. \n\nBut this is also a source of contention with her parents and us/mainly me. As they initiated the purchase of the house almost a decade back there is an expectation that they still own the house, and believe it's their (the in-laws) right. To be honest they can do whatever they want to the house as I never had any emotional value to the house as I was never involved with its purchase. As a brief mention, there was a large argument (I will not go into detail as it is not relevant to this point) but it had to do with these \"rights\" as the buyers of the house. The dust has since settled on this but I have never been at ease after this incident.\n\nFlash forward to now, my wife had told me that her parents want us to work harder to earn more money so that we can support her parents financially when they retire in the next few years. I was shocked to hear this, and didn't react the best way possible. Frankly I was a real dick about it. But I understand that you provide support to you parents and in-laws at that retirement age. However, when you retire you have a nest egg and/or pension to cover your twilight years. Her parents don't. They really didn't plan it out well. Hence my reaction. I got real bend out of shape and demanded her siblings to help too (they live overseas) as it would be unfair for us to support her parents alone, as all her siblings had been gifted something similar to us by her parents. This was never the expectation for us to look after her parents.  \n\nShe then said she we would have to support my parents if it was expected. But there lies a part of my argument (which I did not bring up for the sake of not stirring the pot) my parents have planned their retirement nest egg. So won't need too. \n\nBut in all honesty my in-laws are wonderful parents and have supported my wife and her siblings. But just didn't plan this retirement aspect very well. \n\nI will support them, but knowing this was their in hand earlier I would of made plans to account for this.\n\nTL:DR my wife and I got into an argument about her parents expecting us to financially support them during retirement since they helped purchase the house we are currently living in.",

We dont see eachother a lot because i go to college an 18 hour drive away. \nShe says she doesnt want a job she doesnt like so refuses to get any job. But then she complains that she has no money. Shes blames her parents for not teaching her how to drive so she cant get her lisence. She wants to somehow get money for the government for her epilspy that she had 6 years ago. All she does all day is go on tinder to find a guy that will date her and buy her stuff basically so she can get things without working for it like she does now with her parents. She doesnt even leave the house ever she just watches tv and complains about her life and blames everyone else for the reason why she cant get her shit together. Sometimes shes get jelous of me and says how easy my life is (when its not) and sometimes ignores me because she \"cant relate to me when I do \"cool\" stuff\". In one case the \"cool stuff\" was going to canada for spring break.\nI would consider myself as pretty ambitous and I dont like to complain a lot so that fact that all she does is complain and not take responsbility for her life annoys me. She was my best friend for so many years and the sweetest person ever. \n\nTLDR: childhood best friend annoys me by constantly complaining about her life but refuses to do anything to change it.\n\nAm i an asshole for not wanting to be friends with her because shes not as ambitous as me?",

My friend, who we’ll call L, told me that H “thought I was hilarious” and they all wanted to hang out again. Couple of nights later we spend time at the bar together and I get into a pretty good chat with H, but we’re never really in our own conversation and I still don’t know that much about her after this. We leave the bar and say our goodbyes, as H and the other friend are leaving the next day. H says that she hopes it’s not really goodbye, as in she hopes to see me again (I think?). Anyways, I get home and start texting my friend L, talking about a series of things, then I just ask her to please either shoot me H’s number or just tell her I thought she was hilarious too and it was fun spending time with her. L gives number, but feels “weird” about it, before saying “wtf”, “if I were important to you, you wouldn’t have asked for her number”, and not wanting to talk much about it because she’s pissed. My fear is she thinks I only wanted to hang out (two times in one week is the most we’ve ever had) to get with H. I had some hope of that but also knew it was unlikely and really just wanted to return the compliment/keep in touch maybe (she lives several states away). Not the best way of going about it, but I don’t see the problem with my request. ",

He was hospitalized for a week and was given meds to counter his condition. Our doctor promised him a full recovery if he listened to his guidelines. Unfortunately, as he was getting better and better, he dropped his meds (he tried “natural therapy”)without telling me and was hospitalized again last month. This time it was more serious and it’s really affecting his quality of life (always tired, depressed,moody). Therefore, I have started to hide meat in his meals such as putting beef in his vegan sandwich and what not. When I told my sister, she completely freaked out and told me that I am a criminal.

      "description": "Okay, I know how this sounds already, but let me try to briefly explain the turbulent dynamic of my relationship with my mother. (I am an 18F and she is 42F)\n\nBoth of my parents were emotionally abusive and extremely manipulative to my younger brother and me growing up. My dad was by far the worse of the two (so much so that it took years for me to recognize my mother’s less-obvious tactics). My mother has struggled with alcoholism, depression/anxiety, self-destructive behaviors, and borderline personality disorder (undiagnosed but she and other people close to her recognize that she fits all of the symptoms) for the last 25 or so years. Because she has issues keeping family and friends close, I have been her primary caretaker since I was about 12 yo. As you can imagine, this has created a lot of tension between us as I have gotten older and more independent. \n\nI moved out of the house at 16 to go to a boarding school 2 hours away, and now I am in college about 20 minutes away from my mother’s house (she lives alone - my parents are divorced and my younger brother goes to the same aforementioned boarding school). Over the last three years or so that I haven’t lived with my mother, our relationship has all but deteriorated completely, and her manipulative tactics have gotten more drastic. Likewise, her mental health and alcoholism have gotten worse as well. \n\nThis summer, while I was living at her house, she drunkenly attempted suicide, and I called 911 and got her into long-term inpatient psychiatric treatment at a local hospital. After she finished her time there, she was supposed to do 30 days at a substance abuse rehab facility. During the appx. two months that she was in these facilities, I completely took over her life. I paid her bills, took care of her dogs, communicated with her job/doctors/insurance, cleaned her house, and did everything else that needed to be take care of. On top of all of this stress and responsibility as an 18 year old, I had two stressful jobs (one as a staffer on a political campaign and one working for a defense attorney) . I also found her suicide notes, in which she blamed my lack of spending time with her over the last couple of years as her primary reason for wanting to die. This hurt overwhelmingly, of course, but I was proud of her for being cooperative with her treatment and had hope that she would make progress. \n\nAfter 5 days at the rehab facility, she checked herself out. I came home from work and she was sitting in the living room. We got into a huge fight about her leaving the facility, and she ultimately ended up shutting off my phone and taking my car and giving it to my younger brother, who drove it to his school 2 hours away. (I am completely self-sufficient financially except for the car, which is paid off but in her name, and my phone payment). She didn’t cut me off from these things because she needed to financially but because I need my car to get between my jobs and my phone to do my work. \n\nEventually, we made up and she gave them both back to me, but ever since then, she will periodically threaten to take them away and cut off our relationship again in order to manipulate me and assert that I “need” her as much as/more than she needs me. This has happened 5+ times in the last six months and has led me to deeply resent my mother for how disposably she treats me and everything she has put on me my whole life. \n\nThis week, I admitted her into a facility again because she has been deeply depressed and self-destructive lately. This time, I got full durable medical power of attorney over all of her affairs so that I can take care of her insurance and employment stuff with more ease than last time (I had POA but it wasn’t full/durable and ended as soon as she left the hospital.) \n\nNow here’s my dilemma. Would I be the asshole if I used the POA to put my car title in my name so that she can’t hold it over me anymore once she gets out? I feel like it’s my car anyway since she didn’t really pay for the car (it was bought with insurance money) and I have put in $2000+ of my own money in repairs. I would take over the insurance payment if she wanted me to, but I’m worried it would make me an exploitative asshole/ruin trust between us if I did it while she’s in a vulnerable position. ",

      "description": "Bit of a back story to this one: My (now ex) GF and I went to different universities, so we had very different circle of friends. There was a girl (we'll call her Mina) within my friend group that GF didn't like. It was mainly cause she believed that I had a crush on Mina, and that Mina and I had a lot of classes together that we tended to study together. Other friends would call her my \"Work Wife\", which in turn made my GF dislike her more. Similarly, there was a guy (call him Rob) in my GFs circle of friends that I didn't like. So when I graduated from university, we both agreed to not see Rob and Mina respectively. \n\nFast forward to a few months ago. I still had a bunch of friends from university that I hang out with regularly, mostly guys, who I've introduced my GF to. One of them, Jake, had some difficulty finding a girl, so another guy, Mike wanted to try to set him up with a girl. We had a discussion on who to try to set Jake up with, and since Mike had recently been in contact with Mina, he suggested her. We were gonna invite Mina to meet-up with us for lunch with the intention of trying to get Jake and her to talk to each other. Knowing my gf wouldn't like that, I asked the guys to promise to not mention it to her, especially since a few of us were gonna meet up with her after the lunch for our usual hangout.\n\nIt was also at this point that my GFs friends had her start playing an MMO. She had asked me to play with her too, but since MMOs were not my thing, she asked others in my group of friends. Two of whom agreed, call them Ryan and Peter. \n\nFast forward again now to a few weeks ago. My GF and I have had some disagreements recently, and in our arguments, she had revealed that she knew about me meeting up with Mina for the lunch thing (Jake and her didn't work out incidentally). I immediately knew it was Peter who had informed her as she had grown fond of him during their time playing together. I had asked her to not talk to him anymore before (adding it to the ban on Rob as well) which she had refused to do so. Not to go into too much detail, but after many arguments with her, we both decided to break up. During the arguments tho, Peter would message me about them; she had evidently been confiding in him about our troubles, and he was trying to tell me to come clean and apologize about the lunch among other things. I didn't wanna talk to him tho as I felt that he had betrayed me and started to share my secrets with her without bothering to talk to me about it. \n\nAfter the breakup, when other friends in the group found out about it, I asked them to not speak to Peter anymore. One of them told me that that was going too far, but had agreed as well. So my question now is AITA? ",

      "description": "Yesterday I went dress shopping, and noticed I should probably start lifting again as my booty is getting a little saggy. I come home, tell my BF, and he mentions wanting to workout again too. We decide we should workout tomorrow, but make no real plan. \n\n\nToday I wake up at 8:30am. He keeps sleeping in, which is typical of our dynamic. He wakes up about 10:45am and joins me in the living room. I ask him if he wants to go work out, and he doesn’t sound very into it “I just woke up, maybe later.”  So I do some work until 11:30am, when I say “I’m going to get ready to workout, do you want to join?” As I’m getting dressed, he says he wanted to work out together, and maybe go for a jog. I think that’s great, and say I’m happy to wait if he can commit to a time he wants to go do that together. Then he gets annoyed in tone and says “No no, you can go do your work out RIGHT NOW since that’s so important to you.”  I again say, “I’m happy to wait, it’s no problem, but let’s make a plan and commit to a later time.”  He insists I go without him, citing “I’m not even sure I can run well on my knee yet, and don’t want to slow you down. Just go and I’ll workout here.”  He seems upset, so I offer a third time to wait and tell him no worries if we go slow, I’m fine with that. And again, he insists I just go without him. So, I go. \n\n\nI get back, and he’s doing pull-ups, so I start unloading the dishwasher. After his set, he tells me I’m an asshole for going without him. I felt pretty taken aback by this, and reminded him I gave him the choice to do it together later, but he refused. He then comes over and grabs the dishes from my hand and starts unloading them himself. He tells me to get out and go “have the day to yourself you want so bad”.   I didn’t really understand why he was so mad, as I felt I gave him plenty of opportunity to make a plan to workout together later. When I ask why he’s so mad,  he says I gave him the “ultimatum” of doing it right then or not together because I had gotten all ready to go, insisting “my actions were telling him I was going right then”. Sure, I got dressed, but after getting dressed, and hearing he wanted to go later, I definitely agreed to waiting and going later together. He said he insisted I went without him because it seemed clear to him that I was ready and wanting to go. Again, he’s right, I was taking action to get ready, but once he expressed he wanted to go together, I had said I’m happy to wait.  I don’t feel like I did anything wrong here, but maybe there’s something I’m not seeing. \n\n\nAITA for going to the gym without him/ WIBTA for not apologizing for doing so? ",

      "title": "WIBTA if I stopped being friends with my buddy for being friends with people who treated me cruelly?",
      "description": "Me and my buddy, lets call him \"Nick\" have been great pals for the past 2 years. We were buddies as kids but recently reconnected in a group of mutual friends and have been great friends since. He is more than a friend to me, time and time again when I need it he's here to talk, hangout or whatever. The world doesn't deserve a guy as nice as him. Honestly he could shoot me in the foot and I'd forgive him no problem, but recent events are really screwing with my head and I don't know how I'm supposed to feel anymore. I'll get right into it. \n\nAs I stated earlier we reunited thanks to a mutual group of friends. Nick was friends with this group nearly his entire life and I have been friends with them for roughly 2 years when this all took place. I started to notice that some people in the group really weren't being all that nice to me, in fact it was pretty bad. I'd constantly hear about cruel things they said about me behind my back, to give an example of this 2 days after my grandmother passed away I wanted to hangout with one of my good friends. This friend was at a party and did not have an issue with leaving early to see me. Some individuals despite knowing what happened 2 days ago laid into me hard while I wasn't even there to defend myself, saying \"its always gotta be a problem with this kid\" despite the fact that there was no problem. My house rules were disrespected. anytime I needed support or help I was met with \"that isn't my problem\", yet they had no issues coming to me when they needed help. That was really a miniscule fraction of the shenanigans I put up with. It started to have a bad effect on my mental health so I decided it would be best to leave the group.\n\nI did exactly that, silently. Despite this my leave was followed up with some more harsh trash talk and I thought it'd all be over. Here is where it gets cruel. After I left I was mocked pretty relentlessly to my friends still in the chat by the individuals who originally didn't treat me too well. This is where nick took a small stand and said that they were in fact bad friends, that didn't really have any effect but it was appreciated of course. I was snapchatted by one of the boys where he went on to say I have a \"Napoleon complex\" and \"its no wonder all of your old friends left you\" among other things. My only retaliation was calling him \"a follower\". This boy then went on to lie to others about what I said in an attempt to manipulate my remaining friends into thinking I was a bad person. Sadly, it worked, he sent it to my college roommate. That roommate then went on to actively make my life absolute hell at the college to the point where I was scared enough to go to the police. He actually could've gotten expelled, but I decided not to do that as ruining someone's future was a tad harsh. This roommate is in the friend group.\n\nAfter all of this happened I learned that nick was still talking to all of them as if nothing happened. I was a tad hurt, as how could one of my best friends just sit by and watch me get harassed without saying anything. I called him up and told him how I felt. Never did I say I would stop being his friend if he remained friends with them, nor did I try to control his choice in remaining their friends. I only told him how it made me feel, like shit. Being the great guy he is he understood to the point where he was overcome with guilt from his lack of action that he got really upset. Of his own accord he stopped contact with them, told me he did not wish to remain friends with them after how they treated me and was ready to move on. All was hunkey dorey for a while.\n\nThat was until I found out that nick was still texting and talking to them, with plans to meetup, talk and hangout. Nick claims he forgot why he was mad at them in the first place. Now I still adamantly believe that it'd be pretty fucked up of me to force him to pick between friends, I wouldn't want to put anyone in that position, it isn't fair. But... even so, I just cant get over the fact that he's still able to remain their friends after what they did to me. Call it selfish or whatever you want, but after hearing that news I just cannot bring myself to have the same respect for him I once did. I don't even want to see him anymore if I'm being honest. I don't know why, I thought id be able to live with it if he remained their friend but now I'm not so sure. It isn't even as if I'm reacting like this to spite him or to prove a point, if I could make myself not be upset at this I would. But I cannot bring myself to look at him the same.\n\nI'm not really sure what to do yet. I know it may seem childish to most but Nick is a special person to me. In the two years I've known him we have grown close and I don't want to end anything, but I just cant bring myself to look at him the same.",

      "description": "I’m debating on how to respond to a message sent by a friend who missed my wedding. \n\nWe have been friends now for about 5 years. We initially met because I needed a sitter for my dog and she answered my advertisement. But we became fast friends and even though she still dog sits for me occasionally, we chat and hang out as friends. I got engaged about 2 years ago and she was invited to the bridal shower by my maid of honor, but never rsvped. My MOH asked for help in getting her response and when I asked her, she said she wasn’t good at the manners thing but couldn’t make it and didn’t know she needed to respond no. Annoying but whatever. She also declined out of bachelorette. Okay. We still chat and talk like normal during the time. She flakes out of a few get togethers we had planned but that’s normal. We chat about my wedding occasionally and she tells me she’s excited, her and her boyfriend are making a weekend out of it. \n\nThe wedding comes and it’s amazing. So much fun. But I realize she’s not there. So I text her the next morning on the way to the honeymoon and ask if she’s okay. No response. Three days later, I ask again. She responds with a long message about how (cliff notes version) on the way she got caught in the rain, so had to change, then boyfriends car needed gas, but because they were late she rushed out of car to pay for gas and put weight on her foot weird and hurt it. So they turned the car around and went to the doctor. Foot is fine, she’s fine. Boyfriend is irritated they missed it and says she ” owes him dinner now LOL.”  She said she was sorry, she loved me, and had a gift. We would plan a time for her to come over.\n\nIf I believe this story, which I’m not sure I do, I’m still irked by it. If it’s real, why not text me the next day and say it? Why do I have to ask twice if she’s okay and get a response four days later? How does a foot you put weight on weird prevent you from coming to a friends wedding? \n\nSo I haven’t responded yet. What I want to say, is I’m hurt and disappointed and annoyed. That her story is iffy at best and if I was important to her, she would have been there. That weddings are expensive and I had to eat the cost of her two dinners. That I’m not sure this is working for me anymore and I need some space to decide if I can still be friends. \n\nBut is that dramatic? Am I the asshole if I say that? Am I overreacting in general? ",

      "description": "For the past year I’ve been going through an uphill custody battle for my son as his mother started withholding custody about 8 months ago and I haven’t seen him since then. I’ve been working a full time 9pm-5pm (Mon-Fri) IT job and a part time 11pm-7am (Fri-Sat) weekend job to help pay for my legal expenses. I’ve been exhausted, stressed, and a bit depressed for the past 4-5 months or so. My GF and I currently live together, and she hasn’t taken my depression very well. I don’t blame her to a certain extent as I had been been very closed off and unemotional. But recently I’ve been working on picking myself up and coming back out of my shell to get our relationship (and myself) back on track. \n\nFor the past 2 months my GF has been exhibiting some unusual habits and behaviors. She’s been coming home extremely late on a regular basis, always on her phone, dressing extra nice when she goes out, etc. I knew something was off but I didn’t want to jump to any wild conclusions. The other night I asked her if there was anything she needed/wanted  to share with me. She beat around the bush saying that the question wasn’t specific enough and eventually said no, but I knew she was hiding something. Tonight I went through her phone and found that she’s been going out with a guy for the past month or so. I don’t believe that they have done anything intimate but they’ve definitely been seeing each other regularly for lunch, dinner, movies, etc.  \n\nJust to lay out some additional details... I pay all of our rent as well as cable/internet and water. Ive also had her on my  health insurance for the past two years bc she did not previously have it and started showing symptoms for what turned out to be a somewhat serious auto-immune disease. Even with her being on my insurance as a domestic partner, my state does not recognize her as a spouse and so an additional $400/month is withdrawn from my check to cover the taxes associated to having her on my plan. \n\nI make a decent salary from my full time job and I don’t (didn’t) mind doing these things bc I love her and wanted the best for her no matter what. I’ve never held it over her head but now I feel so wronged. I refuse to be anyone’s doormat ad yet that’s exactly how I feel. I think I want to break up, move out, and remove her from my insurance policy as the this money could used elsewhere for my own personal benefit (my custody case, replacing my 12 year old car, saving for a house). My only hesitation is that I really do love her and I was optimistic about getting back on track.\n\nWIBTA for immediately breaking up and shutting her down financially or should i try to salvage this relationship first? Am I overreacting?",

So sleep is very important to me, I also have sleeping issues, when something wakes me up its very hard for me to go back to sleep. The person who calls me knows both of these things. \n\n\nSo when someone called me at 4:30 am I didn't regonize the number so I hung up, this same number then called me 3 more times. I checked our text history and realized it was an old guy friend I haven't talked to in 4 months and never see. I sent him a text saying \"why the hell are you calling me at 4:30 am, if you're not super drunk or mortality wounded then stop it's very annoying. If you call me again im going to block your number\" He then responded with \"its been awhile and I think itd be cool to catch up.\" I responded by saying \"at 4:30 am? Wtf, you know when I work and I have sleeping issue, now I'm going to be tired for the rest of the day, grow some self awarness most people are sleeping at this time.\" He responded \"But I normally get up at this time and I thought you'd be into this surprise.\" I texted back \"that's a dumb assumption why the hell would anyone be into that, I barly know you, leave me alone its 4 am and I don't have the time and patience for this stuff.\" When he asked when he could call me back I said, \"when people are normally awake.\" I told my co-workers about it the next day and they said I shouldn't have been so rude.\n\nTl;dr: A friend i barly know called me at 4 am to video chat and I snapped at him.

      "description": "For some background, I have been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half.\n\nIt was my girlfriend's birthday on Friday. I had planned to suprise her that night with a dinner and cake at my place. She got off work early that day, and had made plans to catch up with one of her friends for a coffee to celebrate her birthday before coming over to my place. Her friend (who I will call Ally) was one of her longtime closest friends who now lives on the other side of the country for work, meaning they don't see each other very often.\n\nNow I am not close to Ally, nor do I know her very well, but I have spoken to her before while they were on Skype, and she definitely knows that my girlfriend and I are together. Anyway, I am sitting at home on her birthday a few hours before she is coming over, and I get a text from her saying that she probably won't be able to make it to my place because Ally had organised a suprise birthday dinner for her.\n\nNow I was a little annoyed since I had already bought the stuff to make dinner, but I hadn't cooked anything yet so no big deal. I texted back asking her what time everyone was getting there, and she said everyone was already there and it had already started. I said I would come and join them for dinner and she said that the reservation was only enough for the people who RSVP'd. I told her I hadn't heard about it which is why I didn't RSVP. I figured it could have just been a miscommunication, so I asked her to check with Ally.\n\nI already know I'm probably an asshole for prodding as to why I didn't get invited, but I was just feeling a bit frustrated. A while later in the evening she texted me back that Ally didn't think to invite me because she doesn't really know me well and the dinner was supposed to be more of a get together of their old girl friends group from school. I was still a little annoyed that I had an evening organised, but I felt better knowing that it was more of a get together for her friends group.\n\nI told her to have fun and arranged to meet her the next day to bring her birthday cake over. I didn't hear from her the rest of the night, so I texted her in the morning to ask how her night was. She said it was fun and that Ally would be joining us today for cake. I asked who ended being at the dinner. I was pretty upset to find out that on top of her old friends group, all of their partners attended the dinner, including Ally's fiance. \n\nEven more upsetting she said that one of her friends boyfriend who originally couldn't make it arrived later in the evening, and the server squeezed in an extra chair for them at the table. I asked why she didn't let me know when she saw this so I could come, and she said she just 'forgot'.\n\nAt this point I was pretty upset and I bailed on plans to see her that day. Mostly because I was angry at Ally for not telling me and I didn't want to talk to her, but also because I was upset at my girlfriend for not seeming to care that I wasn't there. I ended up eating most of the cake I made for her out of spite, which I feel bad about and know I shouldn't have done that.\n\nWe haven't really spoken much at all since yesterday, as she is spending today with Ally again before she fly's home. I am still feeling bad for bailing on her and eating the cake without her, and I might end up making her a new one. But at the same time I feel so annoyed that I was seemingly purposely not told about her party. This may be me sounding entitled but if anyone should have their SO invited to a suprise party it should be the birthday girl, and I kind of expect I should have been invited considering everyone else's partners got invited.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\ntl;dr: Girlfriend had a suprise birthday dinner thrown for her and I wasn't invited, even though everyone else's partners were invited. Am I the asshole for expecting I should have been invited?\n\nUPDATE 1: We have been texting each other and I told her I have been upset with the whole birthday situation. Ally and her fiance have gone back home and my girlfriend and I have agreed to meet up tomorrow sometime to talk things out\n\nUPDATE 2: Sorry for the delayed update, was meaning to post it and I forgot.\n\nI met up with my gf and we had a serious discussion about things. I told her I was not upset about her cancelling our plans for her birthday, I am upset about not being invited or informed by Ally, and I am quite hurt that she didn't seem to care that I wasn't there.\n\nShe agreed that Ally should have included me but defends her actions because she doesn't really know me and she already knows most of her other friends partners from school and before she moved away.\n\nI told her I was upset because she didn't want me the there. She denied it and said she would have wanted me there but she felt it wasn't her place to go making demands at a party that was organised for her. she admitted she lied about forgetting to text me when the other guy showed up late because she was nervous about upsetting Ally and coming off as ungrateful.\n\nI told her that it hurt me because I felt like I was unwanted at the party by everyone there, and that if she considers us a serious relationship I expect to at least be invited to these types of events that are special to her. She said she does consider us a serious relationship with a future together but did not realise something like this was such a big deal to me, and has promised moving forward to put me first in situations like this. I know she is particularly close to Ally so I can understand why she might have got all wrapped up with spending time with her.\n\nI feel a lot better have talking it out with her, and I trust her so I believe that she means what she said. That said, the responses in this post pointed out some signs to look out for, and I will be keeping an eye out for any more of these in the future. I am optimistic that she truly means what she said and I believe if a situation like this happens in the future she would handle things differently. I am looking forward to continuing to build a future with her.\n\nThanks everyone for the responses.",

I made a loaf of banana bread a few days ago and today I put the last few slices in a bag so I can take them to work tonight. My work takes me to a remote location where I can't leave until the job is done and live out of my truck while there. Granted tonight if everything goes well I'll only have to be there a few hours, but I like to bring enough food in case I get stuck out there for days. He went to grab a slice and I said \"no, I'm bringing those to work tonight\" and he started slamming cabinets and the fridge door finding other food. I asked why that pissed him off and he said I'm so selfish with my stuff.. I had made him breakfast this morning which I didn't even eat and reminded him of the leftovers but he was still mad so I told him to just eat a piece of the bread then, but he wouldn't since I already told him no. Then he grabbed the chips I was eating out of my hands and said I couldn't have those because he was \"planning on eating them later\" (obviously just mocking me) and just yelled at me for being selfish until I was crying then he left. Am I the asshole/being selfish for trying to claim food as \"mine\"? ",

      "description": "Hello. First of all, I work in a dental surgery as a dental nurse so sterilization and all is very important and integral. Me and my bosses (head dentist and his wife) are friendly to each other so we never really had a bad time and I enjoy going to work everyday.\n\nSo today, I was the only dental assistant working and I'm was supposed to supervise this lovely old lady who we are currently training for reception and help in the sterilization. But due to our schedule today, I couldn't supervise enough so I just told the old lady to just dry the things and drop in the dry towel and I'll help her sort it out later. \n\nNow what happened later is, while me and my boss are hanging out in the room while gathering instruments for the next patient, we found heaps of non-sterilized instruments which we used today packed  but  haven't gotten through the autoclave mixed with the sterilized ones. I was a bit surprised and I accidentally said \"What the heck, these are non-sterilized!\". And my boss got noticed of it and it was the first time I've seen him really angry and anxious because of the unclean instruments mixed on there. We hurriedly scour the drawers and found several more. \n\nThis was then I knew that this were the instrument I packed earlier that I placed in the \"To autoclave\" section. Some of them have tracking stickers which I helped the old lady print it out but I didn't have time to check because I was mid surgery and I only got out to get some instruments needed. The packets have indicators if they are sterilized or not as well and I'm pretty sure my fellow dental nurse who was in charge of training her had taught her that. \n\nNow my boss was so mad he started cursing to himself in a soft voice and fairly anxious as well as this is what he says breach of safety. His wife came to us and he told her about this. I didn't hear their conversation since I went back to the room to set up for the next surgery. 5 min later, my boss came in the surgery and told me \"she's done working here, thanks for that. I'm really grateful you found those\". Now after this he told me that his wife said she's not doing a good job in the reception too and they also found some packs where the instruments are mixed and matched. They gave her time but this was the tipping point. \n\nI feel bad now because I could've checked those packs but I didn't and all I did was print the tracking stickers and ran off. Also I feel like if I didn't say that those aren't sterilized and just took them all out, she could've been there still. I really like the old lady since she was really nice and I know she's trying her best. She's also given me some jelly yesterday. I really feel guilty and depressed atm.",

I gave a slightly smugish response about it not being my fault they ain't in the mood and if they didn't take 22 hours to respond maybe they wouldn't have had a problem. \n\nAfter an hour or two, when looking through my notifications, I see that they posted a story. In the story, they mention their Grandpa died and they'll be taking a break from Instagram for some time. \n\nThis was the first time I knew of this, they never brought it up. I thought I won because they didn't respond and gave up for 22 hours. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So I have an illness that causes some relatively severe memory and processing issues, like not to toot my own horn but I'm fairly smart, graduated college at 20 years old, but have bad memory issues that make a hell of a lot of things really hard. My boss bullies the hell out of me over because she thinks someone my age shouldn't have the issues I do. Anyway-not the point. Because I have memory issues I often either tell the same story twice and ask the same question multiple times, it's something that I'm painfully aware of and hate about myself. Sometimes I'm terrified to ask a question and I spend time debating on whether I should ask or not.\n\nSo my sis tends to be a bit on the abrasive side, she often tells me shes working on being more empathetic because I'm insanely empathetic and she's seen how people need that sometimes. Regardless, so to the story:\n\nI was working on a project and remembered there was a fevor I needed to aske my sis about so I walked into the living room and just asked her really quick.\n\nShe looks at me and says, \"You already asked me that.\"\n\nIt was a yes or no question. This is a response I get at any point I accidentally ask a question twice.. It bothers me because I know I do that and I feel like I'm stupid for forgetting or like she thinks I wasn't listening, and because that doesn't tell me what she said when I'd asked before. Typically I say sorry and quickly walk away, still not knowing what the answer was, and just deal with the uncertainty.\n\nJust now, after walking away I walked back into the living room and asked her to stop responding that way, telling her it really hurt me and made me feel stupid. I told her that the only reason I ask again is because I don't remember having asked in the first place.\n\nShe sort of just stared at me, didn't say worry and just said, \"Okay.\"\n\nI walked away and went to my room and shut the door. I put sticky notes and write messages to myself all the time, but sometimes I miss things and I can't control this... and then I felt worse for speaking up about how much it bothers me because I can't help but wonder... am I the asshole?\n\ntldr: I have memory issues and asked my sister to stop saying something insensitive about it and she wasn't receptive. Am I the asshole?",

I got an email, called for an interview, got interviewed and got job offer 2 weeks later. Was super excited because this was my first choice.\n\nI called my boyfriend to let him know. I was so excited, I told him everything, my start date, my salary. I get a text from a family member of his congratulating me. Awesome. I immediately text him not to disclose how much I will be making. Too late, he already has. I am bothered and annoyed, upset even. \n\nI tell him that is personal information. That everyone knows you don't disclose your salary, especially the salary of someone else. I am upset. I cancel plans to see him. He says he was asked and answered because he was excited for me and bragging. I try not to be upset but I still am. We make plans for the next day. \n\nI know once I see him I will react and get angry. I decide to cancel ahead of time and make plans for a different day. He's understandably upset. \n\nAm I the ass for being mad and canceling? Maybe I will get over it later, but in my opinion it shouldnt have been asked and he shouldnt have given my salary.",

So she asks me to switch phones with her and i did because hers was fine except the voice issue and i didn't call people that much so i didn't mind.\n\n\nOne day i was looking for my usb that's full of series that i would download to watch when i felt bored and didn't have internet back in the day, i usually have it next to the tv in the living room.\nI couldn't find it so i ask everyone in the house including her. She says she didn't see it and goes back to her room.\n\n\nMy sister suggests she looks for it one more time in our room. That's when she hears my sister in law talking over the phone with her brother telling him she found a really nice usb that he could use if he wanted. (the room we gave her was sharing the same wall with mine so my sister could hear her without even trying)\n\n\nI was really pissed of and i wanted to go confront her about stealing but my mom said to just let it go because she didn't want my brother to know. But i couldn't just let her use my phone when she steals my things, so i took it back from her and put hers on her bed (there was nothing in it, she only used it to call my brother and her familly)\n\n\nWhen she found out she called me so i went to her room, she asked why i switched the phones... i simply said that i wanted mine back, she then reminds me of the fact that my brother won't be able to talk to her but i just said that i wanted my phone back. \n\n\nThat's when she started crying saying she couldn't believe how cruel of a person i was, how she always thought of me as her little sister saying she would never do anything to hurt me like i just did to her...\n\nI just closed the door and left.\n\n\n\nWas i an asshole for doing that?",

      "description": "To preface this, I (26 F) am terrified of flying and always have been, but also love traveling. In order to combat this conundrum, I take about 2 mg of Xanax so I don't have a panic attack [Dr. approved] when flying. This means I try to avoid flying whenever I can. Everyone that knows me knows this. \nFor Valentine’s day my boyfriend (29 M) surprised me with a trip to Las Vegas for the long weekend. This of course is amazing! We live in Los Angeles, so we go about twice a year for various reasons and always drive the 4 - 5 hour trip. \nWhen my boyfriend told me about his plans, he very carefully told me those plans included a plane flight. He explained he only bought the tickets because they were so inexpensive ($200 round trip for the both of us) so we could drive if I really wanted to. \nThroughout the night he kept bringing up why flying was the better option. This indicated to me that he would be a little upset if I made us drive, mainly because he didn’t want to waste the money. We did discuss the pros and cons of both options and we both understood each other. \nMy boyfriend and I have known each other for over 15 years and have been dating for 4. We have only flown together once, so I don't fault him for not truly understanding the nuances of my fear. He has always been supportive when I haven't wanted to fly to Vegas or the Bay area in the past, but since he loves flying it’s hard for him to understand my anxiety. \nIn the end I would feel like an asshole for making us drive but I really don’t want to get on a plane.\nSo AITA?\n",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my sister stay with me after she made a racist comment about my bf and used pepper spray on him?",
      "description": "So I invited my sister to come up to my apartment and stay the weekend because we've drifted apart since she got married and I moved 3 hours away. We were very close growing up but we had grown distant and were barely involved in each others lives at all. She couldn't come in until later that night, around 11:30 PM. I told her how to use the get into the parking garage and use the call box and everything, but for some reason she couldn't figure out the call box so I told her that my boyfriend was coming in in a couple minutes. Now the parking garage is really well lit and I live in a residential and super low crime area, so I knew she was fine standing there a couple of minutes or she could just get back in her car. My bf had just walked to the grocery store and was coming back and I told him just to let her in when he got there.\n\nThen I get a text from her saying, \"Can you just let me in? Creepy Muslim Iraqi looking guy walking towards parking garage. Don't wanna get raped or robbed out here\" Now I've never known my sister to be racist, so this really threw me off. So I'm like what the fuck. My boyfriend's Indian and has a beard so I figure it was probably him so I text her, \"That's probably (my boyfriend), does he have groceries?\" and I call him and when he picks up all I hear is him saying \"What the fuck are you doing?\" and commotion and I hear my sister yelling something back at him. He tells me she pepper sprayed when he walked up to open the door and to bring some water for his eyes. So I grab a bottled water and run to the garage. He said that he had just gotten on the phone with his brother and that he assumed that I had told her he was coming and just kind of mouthed \"Hey\" at her while he was still on the phone and started to reach for his key and she just whipped out her pepper spray before he said anything else and didn't even ask him who he was or what he was doing. Apparently one of my neighbors had been sitting in his car and had seen it happened and he pretty much backed up exactly what my bf said had happened and was totally confused why she pepper sprayed him.\n\nShe was totally unapologetic about it and said that she felt threatened by him and got scared because she felt cornered (the door is in the corner of the garage). He's like 5'6\" and skinny and dresses like a hipster. There's nothing physically threatening about him at all and he had a fucking recyclable bag of groceries. I realize she's not use to living in a city and is nervous about it and assumes that people constantly get mugged or whatever, but it made me furious that she would say something so blatantly racist and saying she was going to get \"robbed or raped\" by him and called him a \"creepy Muslim guy\". \n\nI told her that I didn't want her to stay with us after that and I would pay for her a hotel that night if she wanted me to, but I wasn't okay with her saying that or attacking my boyfriend for no reason. After a little while, and when the fucking pepper spray stopped stinging, my bf was trying to diffuse the whole situation and said she could stay and he didn't mean to scare her if he did and he was sorry. But my sister continued to be bitchy about it and wouldn't say she was sorry and said she didn't want to stay because I was siding with him ??? and that it was my boyfriend's fault and she was crying and making it a whole big thing. I called her out in front of him for what she texted me and showed my boyfriend and things kind of blew up between me and her, yelling and everything. She didn't really have an excuse.\n\nSo she left and now she will barely respond to me and apparently told my parents I sided with my boyfriend over her even though I told them the story and they basically said it was my boyfriends fault for sneaking up on her. He didn't fucking sneak up on her. It makes no fucking sense and she basically racially profiled and attacked my boyfriend for no reason. I still for some reason feel kind of guilty still for not letting her stay that night and making our relationship more strained but I'm not sure what to do at this point. \n\nTLDR; Sister was supposed to stay the weekend with me. Ends up pepper-spraying boyfriend in parking garage of our apartment complex when he tried to let her in the building and claims it was because she felt threatened by him, after making racist comment about her being scared he would \"rape\" or \"rob\" her because he looked creepy and Muslim. I told her she couldn't stay with us, now she's mad at me and I know I probably further damaged our relationship, but I feel like she basically racially profiled my boyfriend. Should I have been on her side at all or handled it differently? Am I being insensitive at all to her actually being scared? AITA for reacting the way I did?",

      "description": "So basically let me say this first. My mom and I have a very tough relationship that is in a tough spot. I'm 17 and I turn 18 tomorrow.\n\nSo I'm in my schools musical production putting on a show in less than 2 weeks. As a lead in my schools musical, I am called slightly more often than most others. Today Everyone was called for about an hour. Little did I know, my parents planned to surprise me with cupcakes for everyone in the cast.\n\nThey showed up and startled me a bit and they got everyone in the cast to sing happy birthday to me. I was a little embarrassed but was glad it was happening. Everyone started wishing me happy birthday. Now as a kid in front of 70 friends, it's a bit embarrassing when your parents force you to hug them. I asked them to stop. My dad understood but my mom got angry at me for being ungrateful. I told her I was grateful but I really did not want to be hugged at the moment.\n\nAfter everyone got a cupcake, my mom asked if she should wait outside or just go home. I told her she should go home because I hadn't asked the director how long the rehearsal would go for, but she knew it would end in a half hour so she insisted on staying.\n\nAfter a half an hour she came back inside. She asked if I could help her clean up. I said yes and asked her what I should do. She then starts talking to my director and wont listen to me. So I sit down nearby and wait until she is done. Then after waiting about 3 minutes. She asks me to follow her, but then talks to someone else. After about another minute of this I am done.\n\nI go to wait for her by the exit until she is ready. About 2 minutes later she comes to the exit and complains about how I didnt help but then handed me the trash to take out. (Mostly empty cupcake holders) we carry them to our car as they are too big to put in any trash can.\n\nNow my mom offered to drive us home as I have my driver's permit but not my license yet. Little did I realise that I left my musical script and Nintendo Switch back in the school. We drive home and she is reprimanding me for not showing enough gratuity for the party and for waiting for me for a half hour. I told her I said thank you and that I gave her the option to go home. When we got home I realised I forgot my Nintendo switch so I asked my mom if she would drive me back. She said no because I was being so disrespectful. I kept saying it was hard to hug your parents in front of a bunch of middle and high schoolers. So I am writing this while walking back to my school for a 40 minute walk round trip in high winds and freezing hands.\n\nSo, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "\\[throwaway account to protect my identity\\]\n\nAt my work, I manage three teams. Due to various M&amp;A activity we are well under-resourced and I'm running at about 60% of the staff I need - but we are recruiting to fix this. The administration is aware of the situation.\n\nI work very closely with our IT department - but they are also under-resourced and so are very behind on completing work for me. This is where it gets tricky.\n\nIt turns out the IT manager has been spending his time scoping out one of my teams (which is a marketing function), and he's gone into the administration and pitched that *he* should run that team – as long as he gets more staff. From his point of view, there is an opportunity, and he wants more budget, so he's made a pitch to takeover.\n\nNow since we are short staffed across the board anyway, the administration is tentatively willing to let him go ahead with it to keep the wolves from the doors.\n\nHe made this approach to the administration when I was on leave - so I wasn't in the meeting with an opportunity to raise my point of view.\n\nA lot of the new proposals that he has claimed he will accomplish are things I've already specified to him as required, but he hasn't had time to do it. In hierarchical terms we are both at the same level and both report to the CEO.\n\nI could kick off. I could make it completely obvious that some of these are my initiatives, and that it's me who is responsible for the KPIs - and that I’d have concerns about handing an important team to a department who is already struggling to do their day job.\n\nI could point out that some of his other proposed initiatives for this unit have underlying flaws - showing some knowledge blind spots of the subject matter.\n\nThis would damage his reputation at work. It would probably damage mine as well. Finally, we'd be worse off as a company because the work probably *still* wouldn't be getting done.\n\nBut I would have \"put right a wrong\" of him trying to poach my team while I was on leave and retain that control. I have the experience and the knowledge, so I've got a very good chance of winning that battle. \n\nThere's a 50/50 chance he would resign (he suggested to the admin that without his own career development he would have to consider resignation – M&amp;A stress is part of the driving factor I think).\n\nOn the flip side, if I just make the concession, his team will start doing the required work, which would improve my KPIs with no effort on my part. I've been advised by a mentor that the best way to handle this is to be publicly supportive, treat them like they are delivering on all their promises, and if he struggles, I could be completely gracious about it and offer to take it back on to help.",

      "description": "TL, DR at the bottom\n\nI was seeing a therapist for a few months, I have anxiety, depression and other issues concerning my family. I decided to go to see a therapist because although I do a lot of self therapy, reading and stuff, I still felt someone else’s perspective would help me as well as validation.\n\nI had had around 8 sessions, during which I talked about me, she asked me some questions, but did not comment much.\n\nSo a few problems I had:\n\n1. She never diagnosed me with anything or told me what she suspects I have. \n2. Most of the time she listened to me but never commented and I felt like I was going in circles. \n3. She did not explain to me how she would help me just said yes we will focus on this and this.\n4. I have quite a toxic family and can’t rely on them, besides my husband and a few friends that’s it. She told me I am dependent on him too much, but I haven’t talked about our relationship much. Only that he supports me and we generally get along.\n5. I told her my career options are close to zero and I hate my profession (mostly because my parents forced me). I told her that for the first time in my life I would like to see what I like. I told her I am studying in a new field that is loosely connected to my husband’s. She told me I shouldn’t do that because I will be dependent on him and she told me I should just work in my profession although I have told her I have worked, hated it and didn’t want to pursue it anymore. I also said that the profession is completely different just in the same field. He would basically not be able to help me much except to maybe introduce me to people in the same field. I also told her I was proactive and still searching for a job but couldn’t find one. She told me it doesn’t matter.\n6. I have big issues with my family, mainly my mother, and after the third session she told me it is time for me to stop talking about her because it doesn’t help but I felt I wanted to talk to somebody about this more. \n\nSo, the biggest problem for me was that I felt as if she was telling me what to do, but I hoped a therapist would help ME make decisions. All my life my family has made decisions instead of me and I wasn’t allowed to have an opinion. So I felt as if she wasn’t allowing me to have a choice either and I wrote her an email terminating our relationship. \n\nBut I am worried I may be the asshole. I am having doubts if I should suck it up and just work in the field I hate because that is what you do. I feel like I am spoiled (my husband supports me and earns enough for us to live comfortably). I am also starting to doubt my relationship because when my husband and I have a good relationship I feel as if I am doing something wrong now. That I am just dependent on him. I am just afraid it is my anxiety making me an asshole and I cannot see clearly? I am also afraid she was right I just should have done what she said because I know my anxiety and depression can blur my vision. \n\nSo, TL, DR: I fired me therapist because I didn’t like that she told me what I should do and I felt judged. Because of my anxiety I am afraid I may be the asshole. So reddit, AITA? ",

Said I need a new MAP sensor... and 2+ months and $1500 later... IT PASSED!\n\nI get it, fixing cars it hard. I don't blame him for all the repairs. But here's the thing: **afterward I asked him, \"Do I need to just sell this thing now to avoid future headaches, or is it safe to hold onto?\" And he said to me with a smile and full confidence, \"It's totally fixed. You will have absolutely no trouble smogging it in the future.\"** Awesome glad to hear it.\n\nSo fast-forward 3 months. I was still suspicious of the status of my car. I go in there and tell him I want another emissions test run on it, and **the fucking thing fails with the exact same issue it had all along.**\n\nOk, so here's the juicy part. **He tells me they never figured out how to fix it, so to get it to pass he ran the test when the car was ice cold in the morning, and also went through the gears in a specific way to minimize load.** He told me this was legal (I'm doubtful.) So basically, this guy lied to me about my car being fixed, charged me for it, and then fudged my car through the test. **Then he told me when I want to sell it, he'd get it through the test the same way again.** I'm not one to yell at people so I just said \"Yeah okay\" and left. But now I don't know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Options:**\n\n**1) Report him to BAR** (Bureau of Auto Repair) which is a gov't consumer advocacy agency in CA who help people who are getting fucked over by their mechanic.\n\n*Pros: He's a liar and might deserve it. Hopefully would get my $$ back.*\n\n*Cons: my car would be outed as not actually passed, so I'd have to take it to another shop and start over, or sell it as non-operational for less money.*\n\n**2) Demand he keep working on my car** (for free?) or else give me all my money back? Def don't want to go in there and say \"keep working on it and I'll pay.\" I feel like I've paid enough.\n\n*Pros: most assertive.*\n\n*Cons: could get roped into another wild goose chase with this guy. Also would be most stressful for me to do as a non-confrontational person.*\n\n**3) Have him fudge the test again and then sell it.**\n\n*Pros: I'll get the car out of my hair fastest and for the most money.*\n\n*Cons: Assuming he can actually even fudge the test successfully again (who knows), I'd likely be screwing over the person who buys my car.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be an asshole for reporting him after what I've been through? I've lost so much sleep over all this shit over the past year, so I'm pretty desperate. You would seriously not believe me if I told you all the other ridiculous stuff that has gone on with this car during my time with it. It's almost making believe in cursed objects.\n\n***tl;dr*** *- Had to get an emissions test on my car. Mechanic lied about it being actually fixed, and just fudged the test instead.

Both our names are on the house but she has not every paid anything in mortgage. I have the kids 7 nights a week and she constantly wants to try to make me feel like I’m the bad guy when I’m not the one who asked for divorce in the first place. Today she started saying that she should be allowed to stay in the house until she can find a full time job and an apartment of her own.. I don’t want to keep the kids from her at all but I do not want to be in the same house as her, she has proven time and time again that she is unable to take care of the kids right now.. just really torn between trying to help the woman that I’ve done everything for during the past 4 years, and trying to stand up for myself and my kids in a situation that I never asked for.

      "description": "To clarify, the promise was made while I was dating my ex.\n\nWhen I was dating my ex my mental health declined quickly from the lies she told me. And I dont mean entirely traumatic, I mean supernatural beliefs. She threw me into such a state of psychosis over all of it. And it held us together. The forced fake feeling that we are the only people we can turn too. Around this time I noticed the girl who is my current girlfriend was showing signs of liking me. As things go on, me and my ex go deeping and deeper into the rabbit hole.\n\nEventually, the girl who is my current girlfriend gave me a note confessing. And I started to like her aswell. So I went to my ex to talk about it. And she said she found another girl she likes. So we came up with a deal. With a promise. We would pursue these others, but if it didn't work out with one of us the other would have to act as rebound. So I dated this girl and she dated her girl. Her relationship doesnt work out so I have to leave mine to be with her. But deep down I knew I really liked that other girl. I mean I really liked her as a person and I hated having to hurt her for my ex. So, I broke up with my ex and went back to the new girl. And me and this new girl have been happy ever since. Almost 3 years we've been together now.\n\nNow, my ex has told me she isn't mad at me. I still told her I feel like I did something wrong to her. And she said not to worry about it. And I still feel like I just hurt someone I cared about for a healthier relationship. And currently I still retain some supernatural beliefs, but they are more reasonable. Like some people have dreamt of future events and not stuff like there is a demon who is my half brother and bullshit like that.\n\nSo, the relationship was toxic but neither me or my ex could tell.

I feel guilty as i love cats, and my fiance feels pressured into her sister staying with us because her sister says \"if she cant bring her cats shes just going to stay in an abusive situation.\" I find that extremely manuplative and not actually constructive to her wanting to better herself and probably a start to her taking advantage of us. She also has another option that she hasnt told us; that she can move to NY into her brothers studio and hes more than welcome to accept the cats as well, but she turned that down because its too small.",

My phone was in the bag too, did he not consider to go back and check for me or where the heck I was?!!! (I was not even within visual distance of him and I am not that slow a hiker)\n\nI am so fumed about this I cannot even go down to sit next to him to enjoy the scenery at the top. He later claims “that’s just how I hike, i go at my own pace.” Then he claims we shouldn’t be friends anymore because of our “miscommunication.” \n\nThis has got to be  BS? Who ditches a friend when hiking, when you’re meant to hang out together?  I mean, I thought that was common knowledge, not miscommunication.

      "description": "TL:DR I told my girlfriend's mother about something that my girlfriend told me, without letting my girlfriend know first.\n\nRose (not real names), my girlfriend, was complaining to me about her mother. Rose was talking to her mother about a sensitive topic and her mother was not showing a lot of support. Of course, I knew that her mom DID want to support her, but just didn't know how to do it correctly. Her mom is nice, but I guess she just didn't know how to deal with the situation.\n\nSo now I just had to get Rose to talk to her mom. I know that if they talked the situation out, they would get along again and Rose would've gotten the support she needed. The problem was that Rose was firm in believing that her mom wouldn't help her. I couldn't convince Rose to have a conversation with her mom. So what do I do now?\n\nIf her mom doesn't know that shes hurting Rose, things won't get better. This problem that they are dealing with is affecting Rose a lot emotionally and even physically (she can't sleep sometimes). I know that if her mom were to show some encouragement it'll make Rose feel better. So today I finally decided to tell Rose's mother... Without telling Rose first.\n\nWhat happened next? Well, Rose's mom listened to what I had to say, and she gave Rose lots of attention today in hopes to make her feel better. Rose noticed this extra affection, and knew something was up. She confronted me and asked me about it. I confessed that yes, I did indeed tell her mother without letting her know first.\n\nMy reasoning for my decision? If I asked Rose before I told her mom, I knew she was going to tell me not to.  If I told her mom after knowing that she didn't want me to, I would've looked like a real assholes and she would've completely lost her trust in me. I decided to tell her mom and gamble on her not figuring it out. I was willing to take the risk of her finding out and getting mad at me, as long as I have a shot of making thing better for her. Keeping her happy is more important to me than keeping her from getting mad me. \n\nAfter Rose found out that I told her mom without telling her first, she got very mad at me. Which is to be expected. Personally, I think I did the right thing. Now Rose can worry less about her mother not caring about her and getting support from her mom as well. But am I the asshole for not telling her first? She seems very hurt by that, and I take full responsibility for causing her those feelings.",

I think I should have nothing to apologize for. \n\nSo backstory a bit I am 19, my friend (we will call Gary) just hit 40 and he looks around in his mid thirties. Gary has had a rough time finding love and he got infatuated with this married women (apparently the married woman is on and off with her husband) and well apparently Gary went for it and she turned him down, because shes married, and he is super down. \n\nWell yesterday she walked by and to kind of cheer him up I said \"dont worry shes ugly anyways\" halfway through the work day. Well he has some anxiety and feels everybody hates him and doesnt want to step on relationships, so when I asked if he wanted to come over to watch some South Park because he has no internet, he replied with \"I dont want your husband to hate me or get jealous\". I said \"dont worry when he saw you in person he said he had nothing to worry about because you look like you're thirty\" as in like my husband knows I wouldnt date somebody older than me. \n\nWell today I walked into work and he gave me a huge attitude all day and then said \"you called me ugly\". I was honestly shook and was taken aback\n He said that both of my statements combined together meant that I was indirectly saying \"Gary is so ugly that an ugly girl didnt even want him.\" He says I should apologize for calling him ugly and 'I'm showing how young I am by not understanding his side'.\n\nI understand I probably worded the 'looked thirty' comment badly  but I just dont understand what I did wrong. When I tried talking to him he literally interrupted me everytime and said 'wow you really show how young you are' and 'just say you're sorry'. Tbh I'm stubborn and wont. \n\nAm I in the wrong?

About 9 o'clock I haven't heard from her, called her once and didn't get anything.\n\nI had had enough, I texted her how it was starting to piss me off how she has me make plans and sit at home waiting to hang out without any sort of reliability. I said I found it disrespectful and finished with \"not cool man\"\n\nShe then texted me at like 11 saying \"I just found out some not great news and cried and just woke up, so yeah. Sorry. I'll drop off again. Lesson learned.\"\n\nBlah Blah Blah, I pointed out that I was obviously unaware of whatever she's got going on and I'm not just trying to be a dick.

He tries way too hard to act like they're a couple that has been together for years. He wants to rush into getting married 🚩 and having kids🚩already and it has only been 2 months ffs. He has an 11 year old son from a previous relationship that he sees a couple times a month but he has blown him off twice already to hang out with my friend 🚩 \nHe's already showing signs of jealousy and has been caught going through her phone. 🚩🚩🚩\n\nThe only thing I tell her is not to come in between him and his son. The thing is, I want to tell her so much more! Like what a deadbeat I think he is for ditching his child for a new chick, how dumb she is for falling for his baby and marriage talk so soon, but I just dont say anything because I've been there before. I've been the person that gives advice only to have it blow up in my face, the person stays with their significant other and I end up looking like the jerk. \n\nWhen she talks about their future plans I just give vague replies that sound neutral but lean towards the supportive side. I know she wants children so I think she's ignoring the red flags because this (in her eyes) may be her only chance at having them before she gets older. \n\nAm I the asshole for not telling her how I feel and for pretending to be happy for her when I'm just so nervous for her future with this guy?",

Occasionally it is hard to find parking on the street and a neighbor will park behind my car in the driveway but knock on my door to make sure I'm ok with it.\n\nA month ago a new tenant moved into an apartment at the end of the driveway and wanted to be able to park in the driveway.  She is a relatively old woman (probably in her 60s) and initially did not believe that the driveway was only for me.  I asked my landlord to contact her and let her know that the driveway is included in my rent but not hers.  After an initial confrontation, she stopped parking in the driveway for a couple weeks, but recently started parking her car there again.  I didn't mind at first since she came home after I did and left before me.  However, I had to leave twice in the past few days and her car was blocking mine.  The last time I asked her to move her car we got into an argument.  She said that since she pays rent too she pays for the driveway (not true, my landlord told me explicitly that the driveway is mine).\n\nAm I the asshole if I stop letting her park in the driveway?  I do not want to have to ask her to move her car if I want to drive somewhere, but I also want to be considerate since she is an older woman who is living alone and I typically work from home, so most days I don't even use my car and it would not affect me if she parks in the driveway.  However, she has been mean and confrontational when I ask her to move her car and she never asked my permission to park in the driveway.  It's within my rights to not let her park there, but would I be an asshole?",

      "description": "I play League of Legends a lot. Love the game, it's a great game. Now I happen to main a champion in the game called Evelynn. For those of you who don't know LoL has different skins for their champions. Skins change the visual appearance of the champions you play.\n\nI have been dating my girlfriend for about a year. We were friends way before that. We were friends when I was dating a girl I'll call Tango. I was with Tango for 4 years, and apparently my current girlfriend liked me the whole time.\n\nThe other day I was playing LoL and my girlfriend was watching me. She noticed that the skin I picked looks in her words, \"Exactly like your ex\". I had never made this connection before, but looking at it now I do agree it looks a lot like my ex (It's Tango Evelynn if anyone was wondering). I responded to her that I've never even noticed that before and I've been using this skin since it came out. It's literally the only skin I use.\n\nShe then asked me to stop using it. I thought that was ridiculous. She's getting jealous over a video game skin that looks like a girl I havent talked to in nearly a year. I told her that I've always used this skin and I want to continue using it (it's the only one I own and I think the base skin looks like crap.). She got pretty upset about it, so I offered, \"Hey if you give me the $10 or so to buy a new skin I will gladly switch to a new one\". She refused and is still upset that I want to use this skin, AITA?",

      "description": "NOTE: I am posting this on behalf of my cousin, who does not have a reddit account. Any \"I\"s you see past this point are from her perspective.\n\nA family friend of mine, Judy, has a son, Jack, who is my age (15). Jack is special, and I think he has Asperger's on top of it. Judy always brings Jack with her when she visits my family (maybe once a month or so), which has been going on for as long as I can remember. When my sister and I were kids, we would usually go play with Jack while my parents and Judy talked in the living room. Now that we're all a little older, spending time with Jack is a little more difficult. I have nothing against him or anyone with a mental disability. He's a really sweet and goofy guy. But it's hard to be around him for hours on end. He talks A LOT, very loudly, and fixates on certain topics. He's been obsessing over his model train kit for nearly a year and will talk about it non-stop. He recently got a Keurig machine for his birthday, and now he won't stop talking about that. Basically, anytime Jack comes over, it means I have to listen to him pour forth about his favorite subjects for hours without much actual conversation (it can be hard to have an actual conversation with him because he doesn't get most social cues). But as I said, this only happens once a month or so, so it's not a big deal. And again, I know Jack can't help the way he is.\n\nHere's the problem, though: Next week, I'm having my 16th birthday party at my house, and my mom invited Judy and Jack without asking me beforehand. I'm sure this sounds horrible, but I am NOT looking forward to having Jack at my party. I'm a pretty awkward person and don't have many friends as it is, so I feel that Jack's presence would just make things awkward beyond belief. You have to understand: he *does not stop talking* about his Soda Stream, trains, or whatever he's currently obsessed with, so I feel he would be very disruptive and dominate the scene the whole time. My best friend also has a sensory processing disorder that makes her very averse to loud noises, and I'm afraid his loud voice will be disturbing to her. My mom totally blew me off when I raised my concerns to her. I found it really rude that she invited people to my party without telling me, and I'm especially pissed that she doesn't seem to care about how it will affect my friend's disorder. (Though to be fair, I guess, she doesn't seem to understand it.) When I think about how this birthday party will go with Jack there, I get so much anxiety that I'm honestly considering just texting my friends (four in all) and saying the party is canceled.\n\nBut I don't know. I'm anxious because I really don't think the party will go well with Jack there. But I also feel selfish and mean for wishing Jack wouldn't come. I don't want to discriminate against Jack and I'm afraid that's what I'm doing. So AITA for not wanting Jack to come?",

      "description": "I‘m having difficulty with a guest of mine at the moment and need some clarity.\n\nSo a guy is staying in my flatmate’s room until Friday. He’s been here since last Friday (visiting her) but she’s left since Sunday so it’s just him there now. I didn’t really want to let him stay in the room while my flatmate wasn’t there but felt that I should support a fellow student so that he didn’t have to spend money on a hostel/hotel.\nHe had been kind of getting a bit on my nerves with some little things but nothing that i couldn’t deal with until Friday. \n\nI should also mention that we’re having a problem with mold in our apartment. I live in a country where all the buildings are old and there’s very particular stipulations about protecting against mold in winter. We already have mold and are probably going to have to pay a lot of money to get rid of it already, so I’m a like a bit fussy when it comes to like the windows and the heaters basically. If I don’t deal with it myself the landlord could sue me and I could end up having to pay thousands of euros. \n\nSo this guy is Russian and said that he can only get to sleep when it’s cold in the apartment, had all the windows open when it was near freezing outside. While he was (very loudly talking to his mother on Skype at 11pm in the kitchen) I asked him to close them and although he said yes, he was clearly a bit irritated. He seemed to think that he was the guest, he should be able to live by his own rules here. He got a bit angry at me, told me he was going to continue talking to his mother, and somewhat aggressively told me good night.\n\nI went back to my room and considered whether to ask him to leave from tomorrow. I’d been getting more and more fed up with him about little things. What’s more, we got a letter that our rent is being raised for the second time this year, we have scaffolding and a plastic sheet around our home that’s blocking all the light out. This wasn’t really additional stress that I needed. So I called my flatmate and asked her if I could ask him to leave after he slept here tonight. She said yes and that he’d also been getting on her nerves.\n\nSo I went in to give him the news and safe to say he didn’t take it well. He refused to speak to me anymore and start banging pots and pans, throwing them into the sink as he washed up. He said that I had problems with people and that I had a problem with my character. He said he was going to go into “his” room to talk with his mother, and even listen to music loudly if he wanted. He left the kitchen slamming the door.\n\nI went back to my room and locked the door because I felt a bit threatened by him. He was very irritated and kept going through the apartment banging doors. I went back into him about 30 mins later and asked him to give me the keys and he refused, saying he would leave them behind when he left tomorrow. \n\nI couldn’t tell if I’d overreacted, so after talking again with my roommate, and worried that if I didn’t defuse the situation I wouldn’t be able to sleep. So I went in, capitulated, said that I was sorry for overreacting and that he was welcome to stay here. He made another jibe about me having an issue with people as I did this. We shook hands and said it was behind us but I was secretly pissed.\n\nI’ve now asked my flatmate to let him know that he should be gone by the time I get home from work. He was really rude to me the whole time and I just don’t feel I should have to put with that from a guest who I don’t even personally know.\n\nThe question: am I the asshole, is he, or are we both united in assholeyness.

      "description": "For those who don't know (mentioned it once here before)my Mom is going through an ugly divorce with my abusive step-dad. She is currently staying at my Grandparents and me to get her back on her feet. However while I am sorry for what is happening to my Mom, I'm sick her lying to my face and still drinking. She has been and alcoholic for years and its to the point where I just don't know what to do anymore.I get scared thinking one day I will lose my Mom. I recently lost alot of close people to me in the last 5 years so I'm very much on edge and she is completely aware of this. We told her she can't drink here at all and she needs help. She said she going to try it on her own will...Lasted for 2 weeks and came back drunk. We had a intervention with her but it went no where, honestly I almost beat her from how I'm upset and my family is upset, but...that fucking smug smile and laughing at us.. I legit almost snapped. I didn't hit her but I was close I am not my Step-dad but fucking hell. At the end of the night she cried on her knees begging me I mean begging me to give her one more chance.  I told her she needs to do AA or thats it and leaves this house, she agree and the next day she said \"I'll do you one better I'll go to rehab.\" Honestly I believered her and had some hopes.....that didn't last. I call her out on it saying \"You looked me in the eye and promised you go to rehab\" She wouldn't go so I said then AA there is one five minutes from us on Tuesdays. I basically gave her a ultimatum AA/me or you lose a son who wants the relationship you are breaking. She wouldn't go and I'm done. I'm tired of her coming into my room acting like my feelings don't fucking matter. Acting like I'm just emotional over nothing. Acting like we are buddy buddy. The only reason I'm emotional is because of her bullshit. I need/needed a Mom not some drunk pretending to be one. My Grandparents will give her one more chance (Even though she broke it twice already) I want her out of our home. If she wants to break my heart, drink and lie can do anywhere else but not here. I left her home to get away from my step-dad and from this crap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA and the hell do I do? She wouldn't listen to sense and I'm hurting here.",

      "title": "AITA for canceling my trip with my family to go home?",
      "description": "From the title, it might seem like I’m the asshole, but let me give you the story (sorry for formatting - on mobile). I’ve had a trip planned with my sister to visit my brother, where for the first couple days she’s gonna go to her boyfriends home town to stay with him, and I was going to have my friends come and meet me there. All of this had already been cleared with all family members, however, I found out earlier this morning that for the past two days my mother and sister had been lying to my face (we talked about me staying at an Airbnb with my friends, they said it was a good idea) and my brother was not ok with my friends coming to town, or so my sister told me. There were maybe 60 some hours until my friends were supposed to leave, so I immediately messaged them and told them the truth, stating that my family did not want them to come (I’m not gonna lie about the reason when I have to cancel a trip on them last minute). I also made arrangements to, instead of going with my family, return home for the holidays. When I informed my sister of my plan, she accused me of using her and my brother, defended herself, and didn’t apologize for lying to me or any of the sort. Now, I’m finding out, maybe 3 hours after this all went down, that she meant they weren’t welcome at the apartment, but miscommunicated that to me by saying generally they weren’t welcome to come. My family is asking me to remake the plans with my friends and come to Denver anyways, but after all of this, I just want to go back home and take a break from them. I understand they’re my family and I love them, and I understand my mom not wanting to tell me the news on Christmas (worrying that it would ruin the holiday), but I just can’t handle the fact that they were okay with lying to my face to “preserve the holiday,” and potentially leaving me on the line to foot a several hundred dollar Airbnb bill from my friends (luckily they hadn’t booked yet). AITA for no longer wanting to go with them? ",

      "description": "Lurker first time posting\n\nAlso throwaway account because i'm paranoid.\n\nSo i got a possible job offer this week in a city different from the one i live in.\n\nLuckily my aunt lives in said city and she kindly offered her hospitality. She is over 70 and lives following a daily routine so accepting to let me stay is a pretty heavy burden and i'm grateful for that.\n\nMy aunt has a miniature poodle that she treats has her only child which is understandable since she never married.\n\nThe problem is that she never taught her dog how to behave. He is allowed to sleep on the bed, jump on the sofa, he starts barking just to get attention, he growls at her if she wants to move him from the sofa... You get the idea.\n\nNow i have no problem with that as long as we are inside her apartment, after all i'm just a guest, but since her dog it's her \"child\" she brings it everywhere she goes.\n\nFast forward today she asked me if i could accompany her to the mall and help her buy a new phone. I said happily said since i could somewhat repay for her hospitality.\n\nSo we reach the mall and asa we entered i understood that tagging along her was a mistake. The little hellspawn decided he had to mark his new territory and pissed all over the entrance of the mall. My aunt didn't scold him. He then continued every minute or so to pee a little in front of various shops and corners. It culminated with him taking a dump over different stages while my aunt kept picking the small pieces with the plastic bag she brought with her.\n\nMy stress kept rising alongside my embarassment until i confronted her about it.\n\nI asked her calmly if she could take the dog out of the mall and close it in the car (the sun as almost set and it was not a hot day at all). She answered that it's normal what her dog did and that all the other dogs do the same in the mall and that the mall direction accept it by allowing dogs inside. She then added she would not close a dog in a car.\n\nI answered without raising my voice that maybe she should not bring her dog in public places if he can't behave.\n\nI saw from her face thay she was pretty hurt about it and even if i didn't scream i'm pretty sure a couple of people heard me causing my aunt quite a bit of embarassment.\n\nNow i wonder if i should have said nothing and pretend everything was ok.\n\nSo AITA?

      "description": "This morning, I found out that my co-worker and I have the same salary. My co-worker has a physical disability that affects her productivity, to a degree that is obvious to everyone in the office. This morning, I discovered that her salary is the same as mine. \n\nI was a bit upset because I’m way more productive and have only had outstanding evaluations. I started researching wage parity laws and discovered that up in Washington state their legislature just passed a wage parity law for workers with mental and physical disabilities. I think this is a bad idea for so many reasons, but the important thing is my state isn’t bound by this bad policy (yet). At least none that I could find.\n\nSo I met with my boss this afternoon and requested a higher salary. He said he understands my frustration and he’ll discuss the issue with HR. I told him my main issue is that I want my compensation to be reflective of my work and if it means either I get a raise or she (the disabled worker) gets a pay reduction, I’m ok with it. Obviously I don’t wish my co-worker ill will and prefer it to be a raise for me. I talked to my sister about this and she told me I was being an ass. She’s kind of PC. I really don’t feel that’s the case. I want my salary to reflect my value to the company and that is not too much to ask. Am I right? ",

He said he might be able to organize a meeting for me.\n\nIf you had asked me a year ago, I would have thought this horrible and morally corrupt. I mean, google Roman Polanski if you're unfamiliar with his charges. I've experienced a strange number of cases, growing up, of older men I trusted abusing their power with me (to various degrees of severity).\n\nSo much so, though, that in the past few months I've decided that I'd want to make a film about this.\n\nAnd it's making me think, if a horrible person can help me get to a place where I'm \"powerful\" enough to tell an important story and affect the world in a positive way, is it not worth it?\n\nI don't want to rationalize my way into a corrupt decision, but my thoughts are:\n\n1. People meet with awful criminals all the time, without this meaning that they agree with their views or behaviour. Meeting someone does not mean you respect them, and things can be learned even from the worst war criminals.\n2. I've thought about this analogy: a liberal young woman who dreams of becoming a politician so that she has the greatest chance of reaching a large number of people and affecting change on a large scale, somehow gets the opportunity to reach someone who might help her get there. Except, to do this, she must meet with Donald Trump and possibly get him to like her. Would we back this decision? I feel that I would.\n\nHelp me make the right choice!",

I mean dude, I just saw you a few hours ago and its morning, I just woke up, NOTHING HAPPENED. Why are you asking me how I am?\n\nTo my dismay we also take the same train to and from work. This train has scheduled times, unlike the rest of London underground where trains come every 2/3 minutes. As I get used to working there and try to find the right train to take, I end up bumping into him a few times. He's a co-worker I dont know, so I make friendly conversation (or try to). Then in the evening he also wants to talk on the train back. My introvert self is *struggling*\n\nIt's been a few months Ive been working here, co-worker is a great guy, very helpful, very kind, very friendly. I have, on occasions, being short; avoiding his questions or bluntly telling him I dont want to answer - he takes it as a joke and calls me mean hahaha. I've also said I had to go to this or that place so I wouldnt have to take the same train back. (not without him offering to come with me to this and that place...). I've also managed to find a train time slot that he doesnt take (he takes the one just before) but also I wouldnt be late to work. So we've reached some balance yay \\o/\n\nThis morning, I somehow end up running late, I dont even think about running into my co worker because well, I'm late, how can he be later than me? So I emerge onto the platform to walk right into him, no escape. (you have to understand that on some days where I suspected he might be on the platform, I would go round and stay near the end of the platform to avoid him as our exit is at the front of the train/platform.) \n\nI don't talk much (Im in a bad mood), the train finally comes. We get on and sit down, he then tries to initiate some sort of conversation but he speaks too quietly and the train is noisy so I snap \"Don't talk to me right now, its too early\" and go on my phone. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nI feel like one, I feel he's cornered me into becoming one with his over friendlyness ",

      "description": "Okay, first time poster so bare with me. I've been having a conflict with my father and would like to see your guys' opinion on who you think is in the wrong. I have been dealing with many mental disorders for years now. The most prominent of which would be my eating disorder and body dysmorphia. These things have obviously left me very shy/timid, especially in front of cameras. It can sometimes get to the point where I might have an anxiety attack over being on someones camera roll. I have expressed this to pretty much everyone who would try and take a photo or record me and usually everyone was respectful. My father, on the other hand, seems to not get it. \n\nWhen we're hanging out together and our attention shifts to his phone, (for some reason it always does) he always ends up sifting through his camera roll with me looking over his shoulder. it always ends the same way. Him pulling up and going through pictures of me. Pictures I did not give consent to him taking. Pictures I did not *know* he was taking. This has happened multiple times, each time I express displeasure and discomfort and try to make him delete the photos from his phone, him always (unfortunately) winning at the end. I've even tried having talks with him about it but he never seems to really listen. \n\nI try to explain how uncomfortable I am and how it makes me feel twice as much so when he's taking pictures of me without me knowing. I try to explain how it really tears me up when he disrespects me and breaks my trust like that. No matter what I say, he goes back to the same excuse. \"You're my daughter, I want to look at them while you're away! (My parents are divorced and I see my dad pretty much every weekend) I don't show them to anybody else!\" etc. ect.\n\nMy dad has never had the greatest relationships with my siblings (his daughters, obviously). I'm one of the last of his kids that has a pretty decent relationship with him and I know he always misses us dearly when we leave for the week. I know he just wants to make and keep memories, and from his perspective I'm trying to keep him from that. He has a good heart and just wants all of us to be young and happy forever. He does know about all my mental issues, but not much because I prefer to keep things quiet as to not worry anyone.\n\nI do get where he's coming from and I know he has the best intentions, but I'm just not comfortable with it. I don't want to have to be scared that I'll be in more secret photos whenever my dad's around. So, reddit, tell me what you think.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have an antique confederate battle flag framed in my home office. The flag has quite a storied history. First carried into WWII by my grandfather, it was then carried into Vietnam by my uncle, who passed away a few years ago. They do not have any ties to white supremacy nor did they hold any racist views. The flag is a family heirloom, not a political statement.\n\nMy wife was hosting a baby shower for a friend of hers. Out of nowhere, one of her friend's guests stepped out into the living room holding the very same framed flag above her head. She claimed she was looking for the bathroom when she opened the door to my office by mistake (very unlikely).\n\nEven when my wife explained the history behind the flag, she made a huge scene. During her rant about how her ancestors were slaves, she violently threw the frame on the ground, cracking the antique frame that had been in my family for three generations and sending glass shards all over the wooden floor. My wife's foot was cut quite badly by the glass, requiring three stitches. \n\nLong story short- cops were called, she was arrested, and charges will be filed. I have also retained a lawyer to go after her in civil court. As she works in the healthcare field, I am told a criminal record will be quite damaging to her career though it won't end it entirely. \n\nMy wife's friend apologized profusely for her guest's behavior and has offered to pay for any damages (I thanked her but I won't make her pay for someone else's mistake), but she made a comment about how I was overreacting and that I shouldn't ruin a young woman's life over this. She also said my flag should be in storage or a museum, not out on display. \n\nI understand the outrage at display of the flag in public buildings, but I feel like this was different. I did not have my flag out in my front yard, it wasn't in my living room, it was in my private office, behind closed doors. Moreso, her irrational behavior caused my wife to be injured. I don't know if I would want someone like her working in a hospital setting. Am I an asshole for thinking this girl was way out of line? ",

      "description": "Note: this is not my story but my friends, who asked me to post this here for her to see what you guys think of this as she didn't want to make an account for this one post. I'll do my best to answer questions for her as I know much about the situation but anything directly to her may take a bit longer for a response as I'll have to contact her to ask. \n-----\nMy husband owns a private practice with his friend. The only employees there are him, his friend/partner, and their secretary. She's been working there a couple of years and she always gives me hell for wanting to see my husband or leave a message. \n\nNow once a week or two I'll bring him lunch so we can eat together on his lunch break because I'm a good wife who likes to actually spend time with the man she married and make his life a bit easier. However, ever since she started working there she tries to make it hard for me to bring it to him. This ranges from trying to make me schedule a lunch appointment through her or even not letting him know that I called to tell him I'll be bringing his lunch ( so he won't go out to eat). \n\nThis is very frustrating and I've expressed to my husband that I don't like it and don't it's very professional for him to keep employeeing someone who doesn't give him his messages and acts like a gatekeeper for his wife. He's acknowledged it and said she does her job well and that me and her are probably just having mixed signals or miscommunicating. He also says he's too busy to hire a new one at the moment, and refuses when I offer to help him look for a new one. \n\nNow before anyone says it, I do not think my husband is having an affair with her ( it's been insinuated before), but I do think she's trying to steal my husband ( though unsuccessfully).  Aside from trying to make it so I can't see my husband, she seems to act very flirty with him in my opinion, which he doesn't seem to see. ( I love him but to be honest he's a bit... Dumb when it comes to girls hitting on him). \n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting him to fire her and find a new secretary or am I reading too much into this situation ?\n\n",

However, as I hope most of you will agree, it is not my job to influence the relationship they have together, so I don’t tell my 5 year old degrading things about his father as, quite frankly, that’s just fucking disrespectful. \n\nMy sons birthday just passed, and my ex called and plans on taking him out at some point ( don’t know when because he tends to be inconsistent), and my son was upset about it. I explained to him before that his father has to work hard just like mommy so he has “ a great future ahead”. \n\nThey just talked on the phone, and my son told him that he was upset that he missed his birthday, and he has a tendency to exaggerate so he said “ you missed too many of my birthdays!” And I didn’t correct him because it wasn’t my discussion, it was between him and his father. I did, however, tell him to watch his tone of voice. \n\nHis father talks it out with him and precedes to get pissy because I didn’t intervene and correct him. I told him that it was THEIR DISCUSSION. Mommy isn’t always going to be there to be a social buffer, and he is nearing the time where he will be in conflicts and have to communicate his feelings. I think communicating your feelings, especially in boys, isn’t always taught, as men are sometimes expected to be “ strong and tough”; I don’t want my kid holding himself to that standard, and I want him to feel comfortable communicating how he feels and interprets things. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for not intervening and letting them have their discussion and resolve it?

      "description": "So last night I was out a bar with some friends of mine and we got talking to a group of ladies and we were all laughing and having a good time. I’m single by the way, just thought I should get that out there. I got particularly close with one of them, we’ll call her Maria, who was easy to talk to and good fun. Me and Maria were the only two of the whole group who smoked so we occasionally went out for a cigarette together, maybe once every 30 minutes.\n\nWe had some fun talks when smoking and she told me all about her husband, who was at home taking care of their two kids so she could go out with her friends. As the night went on, our groups had kind of split into smaller groups, and me and Maria were pretty much just talking to each other. \n\nJust as the night was coming to an end, and we had all successfully gotten pretty wasted, we again went for a cigarette. But this time instead of her sitting on a chair she sat on my lap. I didn’t think much of it so I just rolled with it. As we were halfway through our drunken conversation she tells me about how she enjoys her fitness and runs everyday. I begin completing her on her body and how good she looks. She was enjoying the compliments and kept telling me how nice I seemed and that she thought I was a great guy. Then she looks me right in the eye, and leans in to kiss me. \n\nI was pretty surprised as she had been talking about her husband and kids a lot but I just went with it and we made out for around 5 minutes before we decided we needed to go back in to our friends. Pretty soon later the bar closed and we all had to part ways. We didn’t exchange numbers and have no intention to ever see each other again but I can’t help but wonder AITA for knowingly making out with a married woman? ",

      "description": "Last Christmas (2018) I gave some of my teachers Christmas presents in the form of plants (gardening is a hobby of mine). My art teacher also likes gardening and has a ton of plants in his room, so when I have him his present he gave me a little cactus. Fast forward to a few days ago. I didn’t know what type it was and I was curious so I posted a picture of it to r/whatsthisplant. Today at lunch I just got an answer and it turns out the cactus he gave me is psychedelic plant very similar to lsd. I kinda freaked out and told my whole lunch table and after doing even more research it turns out the juices in the cactus are illegal (not the plant itself) but I didn’t read it fully and the bell rang and I was being stupid and thought the whole plant was illegal. So anyways I went to the teacher and asked him about it and told me the plant isn’t illegal, then I told him I was sorry because I told some people it was and he got very upset. He told me he could loose his job and that if he hears anyone talking about it I’ll be in big trouble. I’ve never seen him that angry and feel really bad. ",

      "description": "So basically, I often eat out with my grandparent. At restaurants, they are polite and nice. But when it comes to fast food places, it goes the opposite way. During drive thrus, the worker will ask for the money, in which my family responds “Read my order back” in a very rude tone sometimes adding “because I know you guys never get it right”. So after that, we pull up to the food window where they hand us the food. When they do, my family immediately says again “is this right?” And checks the bag in front of them. All of this is kind of okay I guess, but there is more...\n\nWhenever we are told to pull into a parking space to wait, it’s immediately “ugh this is going to take forever!” Or “can’t we just wait here?” And it’s always in a horrible tone. One time when we were receiving our food, my family made the comment “did you finalllllyyyyy get it right this time?” With an eye-roll. And when we leave and the worker says “have a great day”, instead of saying “you too”, my family says “yup”, “thanks”, or nothing at all. \n\nRemember, all of this is in a rude, obnoxious and ignorant tone which isn’t present normally. Plus they tend to be super rambunctious and pretend to be in a hurry even though they aren’t.\n\nI know this might be nitpicking, but I’m not the only one who has called them out on it. I seriously feel quite embarrassed by this behaviour and I’m not even a full blown adult.\n\nAITA for asking my family to be more polite?",

      "description": "So my sister has just recently designed her own tattoo. Then, a few months later she designed her boyfriends. The topic of tattoos came up and I she asked me if i would ever get a tattoo. I said yes and began to explain what tattoo I would want. She offered to design the tattoo for me and I thought it would be lit for my own sister to make my tattoo.\nAnyways this is where she said \"and I won't charge you that much for it.\" I was like \"lol, I'm your brother. Did you charge (your boyfriend)?\" She said she charged him in sex and theres an obvious reason why I cant pay in that way. So, she didnt charge him money. As a matter of fact she has never once charged anybody for her artwork. Not a stranger or a single family member. I said that I would take her out for dinner if she made it and I liked it enough and she dropped obvious hints that she would abuse that power. Saying she would make me take her out to some super expensive place like FogoDeChow. She had made art for the family multiple times and I asked if she could make it as a gift for me. She flat out said no. The only way she was going to let me get this tattoo design was if I payed her. She then proceeded to show me a \"choosing beggars\" video and I was like \"I'm your brother not some random dude on the internet.\" Anyways she and my mom kinda ganged up on me and I thought it was totally fucked. Am I the asshole for wanting her to not charge me?\n\nTL;DR - My sister wanted to charge me and me only for a tattoo design, despite never charging anybody else. I thought that was bullshit and continued to give my argument to why it should be without charge. ",

My reasoning is that I want them to pay me back before we forget about it and thus why I'd prefer it asap. I'm only 19 and thus for me money in small amounts is still quite important as I've only recently acquired a job. After saying this I get told sometimes that they'll just pay me back for something in the future (which hardly ever happens) or that it's only $5 or so and they'll pay me back later (which seldom happens either).

      "description": "So basically, I have this school project that everyone in my TAG (Talented and Gifted) class has been working on for months. It's a horribly time consuming, difficult assignment that students dread every year. I had been doing fine on it up until one day, I had just gotten out my laptop to do some research on my topic for the project when I was unexpectedly called to the office. When I arrived, my dad was waiting for me to tell me that my grandpa had passed away. It was a shock. I knew he was sick, but the last time I had spoken to him, a few days prior, he seemed like he was finally coming back around. My dad took me home and I went to my bedroom and cried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had missed a lot of school, both for grief and for traveling out of state for the funeral, and later to collect my inheritance. When I finally did come back, my TAG teacher offered her condolences, then proceeded to chew me out for being so behind. I live smack dab in the middle of the midwest, and as many know, we've had horrible winter storms and had many days of school cancelled. She told me I should have used the snow days to catch up on my work. I try to explain that I wasn't even at my home for most of the days, I was in a hotel 400 miles away without access to my project. She wasn't having any of it. I finally just apologized for my incompetence and continued with my work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also had several tests, homework assignments, and projects for my French, Science, and Health classes that I had missed, and I was getting pretty stressed out about it all. I had also been having some relationship issues at the time that had been an added factor to the overwhelming mountain of anxiety I was feeling. On top of it all, my depression (which I thought I had finally been getting over) was coming back full force.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery day I would go to school, go to class, get lectured my both my TAG and French teachers, then I'd come home to get yelled at by my parents and ridiculed my older brothers. I couldn't go to my boyfriend because of the rough patch we had been hitting in our relationship. All of my friends had been occupied by other pressing matters, and I was so upset that every time I attempted to work on the project I'd break down in tears. I try to explain, but all people think is \"Oh, she's just lazy.\" or \"Oh she's just not smart enough for that class.\". My parents mock me for being unable to complete the \"easy\" assignment I've been given. The project is due tomorrow. My family and teachers think I'm a lazy asshole who can't get work done, and I think they're assholes for pushing me to the point that I'm at now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this just begs the question, who IS the asshole?",

      "description": "My wife has just one sister, and she just had a baby girl 2 weeks ago. The thing is when I met her i didn't feel the \"natural emotion\" i should have felt, they asked me to hold her in my arms and i did, but just to be polite with them, cause i didn't want to. \nSince she got pregnant every family reunion was all about her and the baby, my wife and I don't have babies yet, and i thought my feelings were somehow jealousness, but i realized they weren't. As i said, it has been the baby since the day she got pregnant, and also her job and how she had to adapt to it with the pregnancy and stuf. When we were there with my wife's parents, they asked her about her job, the house etc. But every time my sister in law was around she took all the atention and our lives simply didn't matter to them. \nThe fact that caused this feeling to increase was one day when we were talking about other people's babies and my wife mentioned: \"it doesn't matter, i will have mine soon to care about\"(refering to our niece) but my sister in law look at her with envy or anger (i saw it in her eyes) and asked my wife: \"You mean my baby right?\" And she answered: \"yeah of course\" and she looked at her husband and whispered to him \"you better\". \nI heard her and made me feel like she is competing with my wife and if/when we have our own baby she will feel that ours will steal attention from hers, to the point that she wouldn't like us to have a baby soon, despite all the dificulties we have had.\n\nI haven't mentioned anything to my wife, so when she tells me something about the baby i just say that's cool and change the subject.\n",

      "description": "I (M23) met her (F20) over Tinder over a year ago. We went out on a few Tinder-dates. I didn't see her as relationship material and told her this. We were on the same page for what we were. We remained friends and hooked up a few times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were both shy, her more than me, but we were still able to communicate fine. Recently however, I've felt like I'm the only one starting and maintaining the conversation. About 80% of her messages would be \"hey\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"haha\", \"maybe\", or just same vague emoji of a girl shrugging her arms. \n\n  \nNow by no means am I a professional conversationalist, but I seriously doubt I was boring enough to justify the lack of effort on her part. This one-word answer thing would happen with every conversation, including WoW (I didn't play, she plays a lot), sex, jobs, day-to-day life, League of Legends (we both played), and pretty much every other thing we talked about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis one-sided conversation thing continued on for a few months. I've basically given up trying to talk to her or even maintain this friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually I got fed up and just unfriended her on Snapchat, League of Legends, Battlenet and Facebook. Today she messaged me - 3 days after I had unfriended her - asking why she can't see me on League. I didn't bother responding. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel that by just ghosting her, it is sort of some justice for the lack of effort on her part. This is obviously extremely petty and unhealthy for either of us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI already know that I am an asshole in this situation. The main reason I am posting this is to gauge exactly how much of one I am or if I was somewhat justified. My question is to you: how much of an asshole am I?",

      "description": "I’m honestly at a loss here, so I’m turning to the most neutral of neutral parties— strangers on the internet.  And sorry, this is long (and if the formatting is fucked up— mobile user). But I just want to provide as much information as I can to get an honest appraisal of whether I’m the asshole here. \n\nSo. I’m a 33 year old woman who is currently in the aftermath of what feels like the most “am I taking fucking crazy pills??!” ever argument with two female friends: one I’ve been friends with for 18 years (32– I’ll call her N) and one I’ve been friends with for 11 (also 33– I’ll call her F). \n\nI introduced the two of them about two years ago, and gradually I noticed that I was feeling a lot more... judgment, let’s say, coming from the two of them together than I ever did from either of them individually.  Which I tried to just accept and ignore, figuring it was a combination of two strong personalities who both like to be right up against me, who just sort of goes with the flow and doesn’t like to argue or try to justify myself. (Note. I probably should have addressed this all at this point, but... I hate conflict.)\n\nSo around a year ago, I had an argument with N about a guy I was hooking up with, which led to her basically telling me that she didn’t want to hear about who I had sex with or who I was seeing because she didn’t like the choices I was making. Which was totally within her right to say, even if it sucked to not be able to talk about that part of my life with her.  (Again, should have addressed this here, probably.)\n\nFast forward to nowish, when I had an FWB relationship with a bartender from my regular bar.   Again, didn’t tell her about it because of the previous fight and because every time I tried to bring up any guy related things with her after that, she would act very dismissively, telling me that these guys are “garbage human beings” and I’m “not living up to (my) potential” and “can’t do this because (I’m) just going to get hurt.”  Fine. I’m an adult and I understand my actions have consequences, so yup. We good, won’t bring it up anymore since it clearly doesn’t sit well with you. Sucks, but ok.\n\nWell, as things tend to do, it got back to her (even though she doesn’t live in the area), and she and F confronted me about it on NYE.  I apologized for not mentioning my mattress-related activities, but again stressed that I thought N didn’t want to know about it.  It seemed to pass without much incident, though I suppose that could have been due to the lubrication of booze. But I assumed everything was fine.  \n\nHowever, every time I then mentioned him, she returned to the old pattern of “oh. I don’t care about him.”  So again. Stopped talking about it, particularly once he started seeing someone and the mattress-related activities naturally ceased.  But I continued to be friends with him because, despite the fact that we have completely different views on almost everything, we get along very well, he is always willing to have respectful conversations, to listen to me, and often intellectually challenges me in ways that most of my other friends don’t.  I’m NOT saying that he’s a great person or a saint or anything, but he treats me just fine and that’s generally how I judge people. \n\nFINALLY coming to the present (about a week ago).  F and N and I are texting about the dating trials of a third friend. I make an offhand joking comment about how I’m so sick of hearing about other people’s relationship problems lately. Which I fully admit probably wasn’t the best idea. Because it led to N asking who I was talking about, me admitting it was my bartender friend and his new lady love, and her responding alternately “oh I don’t care” and “I literally could not care any less.”  Again. Message received, and I changed the subject. \n\nBut N kept bringing it back to this guy and why am I friends with him because she thinks he’s disrespectful and a terrible person and should I really be listening to the relationship problems of a person I used to have sex with, and even going so far as to inquire whether all of our interactions were still appropriate given that he is seeing someone.  All followed by, “sorry if this seems harsh but I just care about you and think you’re making poor choices, and honestly, you’ve been super shady about this whole thing from the beginning.” Which. Ok. That’s maybe a valid perspective?\n\nAnd I expressed my appreciation for that perspective, honestly, but also expressed that I was fine with the choices I was making and, after at least three rounds of this during this particular conversation, was feeling a little patronized, especially since she had consistently said that she didn’t care to hear about that part of my life, and that while I appreciated that she didn’t like this guy, he is my friend and that’s my choice to make.  (Also, although I didn’t bring it up, N has been seeing someone since December and didn’t share it with me until about three weeks ago, so the fact that she called ME shady didn’t sit well with me for that reason as well.)\n\nCue the biggest... Event? Shitshow? Whatever. It basically ended with N saying that she was washing her hands of me, since I didn’t think she cared about her friends and how could I when she spent the last year worrying about my feelings and my job and my actions and how I was sleeping and my health and etc etc. \n\nI tried to clarify that that absolutely wasn’t what I meant, just that she seemed to have expressed that she didn’t want to hear about the men in my life unless they were a relationship prospect or someone she approved of, but she just kept saying that if I thought she didn’t care about me, then fine, she just wouldn’t.  F mostly stopped chiming in around this time (earlier in this shitshow, some discussion was had about a situation in which I was most definitely the asshole to F, which I apologized for and tried to make right.)\n\nIt ended with me saying that again, I was sorry that I had made her feel that way, that wasn’t what I intended or thought at all, and that I appreciated all the years of friendship we have shared. \n\nI haven’t heard from either N or F since, though they’ve both done some “subtweeting” on various forms of social media that I’ve just ignored. \n\nI... honestly have no idea what happened here, and if I’m the asshole or not.   On one hand I feel bad for what happened, but on the other hand I don’t really feel like I did anything wrong other than not hashing this out earlier.  I just hate that this is happening, and also that it’s over a guy who admittedly isn’t the best person in the world (although lately he has been a much more supportive friend to me than N and F have.)  \n\nThis definitely isn’t the hill I would have chosen to die on, but... here I am, I guess. I’d really appreciate some perspective and judgment from you guys. ",

      "description": "When the PS4 first came out I decided to buy one with money I had been saving up from my part time job. At the time I was 16 years old and I bought it with money I earned myself and I was proud of that. I'm 21 now.\n\nAt the time my little brother was 7 years old and he had his own 3DS which he played on, so I was the only person to use it. After he stopped playing on his 3DS, I let him start playing on my PS4 because he was interested in the games I had. \n\nThe past few years I haven't been playing games as much and due to school and work. I use it primarily for Netflix. My brother is really the only one who is playing on it right now, except for when I get in the odd gaming session.\n\nThis week, I'm moving into an apartment with my friends, so that I can be closer to school and work, and I'm planning on taking my PS4 with me. When I told my brother this, he freaked out. He got very angry and was crying since he supposedly wouldn't be able to play fortnite with his friends anymore.\n\nI know it sucks that he won't have anything to play on, but I bought the damn thing with my own money and I'm not going to lie, I kind of have sentimental value in it as it's my first \"big\" purchase. I told my brother that he could try saving up for one or ask my parents to get him one, but he says he can't save up money without a job. Our parents have also said that they don't want buy another while we already have one, even after I explained that there would no longer be one in the house, but they didn't seem to care.\n\nSo AITA for taking my ps4 with me, that I bought myself, for myself and leaving my brother with nothing?\n\nPs I do have a laptop that I could watch Netflix on but  the screen is too small and I'm uncomfortable when watching Netflix on it",

      "description": "I may be the asshole here..\n\nSo basically - I just got engaged. We dated through middle school, high, school, college, and new adulthood so it has been awhile. His dad has a fatal illness. I am in graduate school and work full-time. His family is pressuring us to get married sooner rather than later for obvious reasons. I have no idea how I am going to be able to keep going to school if I have to plan a wedding while also working full-time (I have my own serious health issues that make things more difficult, but I keep those to myself and it's not common knowledge but it's been about 12 years with the disease, so I really don't have extra energy after work and school). Other than my family and a few close friends, nobody really knows and I prefer it that way.  I also have absolutely no idea where this money is coming from to plan a wedding, because we don't have it. \n\nRight now, the plan is to have a wedding in about a year. I have always wanted a longer engagement (2-5 years). I would much prefer to have a wedding after school is done (about 2-3 years). I haven't pushed to change the plan yet but I am EXTREMELY overwhelmed and worry I will either need to quit grad school, or postpone the wedding and I think it is most appropriate to postpone the wedding. I don't even want to get married that quickly, and think it's a little rushed. \n\nI've asked my parents and they are also pushing for the wedding to be sooner so fiance's dad can be there but I cannot imagine what kind of basket case I will be in a year because school isn't going to get easier. At this point, it's already distracting me and I'm falling behind in classes. \n\nIn summary, I would prefer to postpone the wedding until after grad school. Am I the asshole? I kind of think so. I am feeling like I should just shut up and plan the damn thing to get it over with with a pretty smile on my face the whole time instead. Input appreciated!",

      "description": "So I want to start this by saying that I’m not the sort of person that does favours expecting favours, I’ll never accept any form of payment from my friends for doing them favours e.g. I used to take / pick up my friends from the city centre which would take about 60-90 minutes and cost around £3-5, I’ve seen my friends pay others £10 at minimum to get picked up by others (taxis are around £25) and I’ve never really wanted to be that guy (not that there’s anything wrong with being that guy, it’s fair to be compensated for your time &amp; cost) however these friends have been my friends since we were 12/13 &amp; others from when we were kids. \n\nI’ve noticed a lot of annoying behaviour from my friends such as I’ll do so much for them and help them get through daily life from things like taking them to do their food shopping, dropping or picking them up from various places and also lending them money without any interest, not a single penny.\n\nThese friends don’t pay me back on time, blow whatever money they do get or just flat out lie and that’s annoying, I wouldn’t mind if they just told me flat out “Hey man, I’m sorry I don’t have the money can I pay you another time?” Over the whole lying thing as lying really pisses me off.\n\nAlong with that the other day I was stuck in city centre as there were no trains in to where I live however I let my friends know this about 6/7 hours in advance and I got told by them that they’ll come get me and they were going out near the city centre so it wasn’t an issue for them. The time comes and they’re no where to be seen and they’re excuse was they were eating (they started queuing for a restaurant 30minute before I was going to get off the train), 45 minutes later they hadn’t even bothered to text or ring so I spent literally my last bits of money getting a taxi home. Along with this we never really go out to wherever I suggest it’s never an option and always just thrown aside &amp; I’ve got another friend who we constantly wait for because he’s constantly late and will make you wait outside his house for 10-15 minutes average before coming out of his house. \n\nI’ve got another set off friends who I hang around with here and there so they sell me out whenever but I’m not too frustrated at that as they’re not my main friendship circle.\n\nAll of these little things building up constantly have just left me to exhausted mentally, I can’t find it within me to really get out much and just prefer hanging out on my own and going on drives, I’ve got somewhat of a plan to further my own personal development starting 2019 too so yeah any advice would be great\n\nSorry for the long read! \n\nP.S there are a few other annoying things I’ve left out because this has gotten too long\n\nTl;dr - my friends never treat me how I treat them and I feel very much left out / unimportant, AITA for expecting them to treat me the same way?",

      "description": "Backstory: I’ll try and make this as non-biased as possible.\n\nThis conversation came up very early in our relationship. I told her from the start that I want my children to have my surname and I didn’t want any hyphenation. It was a short lived talk but it seemed like she understood. We have rarely ever had arguments in our relationship (Could count them on 1 hand!) and we are solid ‘life partners’. This conversation came up again last night which became a little heated. She didn’t realise how strongly I felt about this and I didn’t realise the same with her.\n\n\nShe doesn’t want her family name to die (From her step father) as all his children are women and have not given the name to their children or kept it themselves. Ever since I wanted children I have always wanted them to take my surname, I’ve never seen it any other way. I understand this is selfish but I had made it clear from the get-go this was what I wanted.\n\n\nIn the end she ‘gave in’ and said I can take it but did say various comments about me being stubborn and never compromising. In my head this is one of the very few things that I am dead set on…. But now it’s got me questioning if I am just a stubborn piece of shit usually, I don’t feel it is though.\n\n\nAm I the asshole? Do I need to compromise? I think if I did double barrel the surname I would start to despise the name/children and it wouldn’t be healthy for any of the relationships. I know this seems rather silly but it means a lot to me.\n",

      "description": "So I became an assistant lifeguard manager for an indoor pool after 2 years. Simple work is involved: making sure doors are locked, robot vacuum is in the pool at night, lifeguards present, constant cleaning, etc.\n\nI’m 19y/o and my head manager is 17y/o and still in high school while I attend community college.\nNearly every weekend the pool and our storage closets are obviously neglected. Things aren’t clean/put up like they should be and most chores aren’t done including putting in the vacuum. Every time this happens I make sure to text in our manager group chat (only the 4 managers of our pool are in) of things need to be done that aren’t being done regularly. I work every weekday directly after school until close (8 hours), whereas the other managers come in occasionally for weekday shifts and weekend shifts(4-6 hours). \n\nThis time a door leading outside that has been winterized (foam is put in the door frame to prevent cold air from coming in) was opened, out of place and not fixed. Not that big of a deal. This night in particular all 3 managers, except for me, were closing for the night and nobody noticed it. I texted in the group chat per usual that it is an issue and should be checked every night. \n\nTHEN another manager... let’s call him manager #2 (20y/o), called me out and mentioned that it was weird that our opening guards’ assessment of the pool from the morning doesn’t match our managers’ and that I should have their backs instead of “putting them on blast” The head manager agreed with him. This is where my tangent started.\n\nI mentioned that our supervisors would most definitely side with our morning guards considering there were several other witnesses of our closing managers not doing their jobs correctly. I also mentioned how I don’t give a shit who’s fault it was, I was addressing it as a head manager would... even though it’s not my job. Btw our head manager does not address issues with management. \n\nThen I called our head manager and asked him why they thought it was alright to berate me for addressing an issue to them instead of going over their heads or ignoring the issue and letting them carry on doing things wrong, which I would have to clean up along with my regular list of tasks to be completed every week . \n\nHe agreed with me and assumed that things were “lost in translation”. I told him that if he agrees he should apologize in the group chat and clear things up. A half ass, “we’re all to blame” text later and I’m wondering if I should go to upper management with this issue. My supervisors have been getting plenty of compliments about me specifically and I’m tired of being lower management to a high schooler who won’t even do his job. Was I blowing this out of proportion?",

      "description": " I am a night shift nurse and frequently work stretches of shifts in a row. I am not home a lot. Often the only time I can do laundry (after a full night’s sleep) is at 3AM. I only do laundry about once every two weeks at this time. I prefer to do it during the day, but sometimes I’m just too slammed.\n\nI live in an apartment building with a laundry room in the basement. Residents access it with a key, there’s no electronic lock. There is no sign posted for hours of operation.\n\nToday I started my laundry and then came back about 5 minutes after it had finished. The lid was up (manually) which freaked me out a little. Someone was just...looking at my laundry? But nothing appeared to be missing, so I tossed stuff in the dryer and started my second wash. When I returned to the basement again, about 5 minutes after my wash should have finished, the lid was up. There was 25 minutes left on the washer. And the dryer door was open with my first load. My underwear was on the floor. The machine said it had one minute left. I was freaked out now. Was someone going through my clothes? I tried to tell myself not to be paranoid and restarted the washer and began unloaded the dryer.\n\nSomeone (50sF) came in and started telling me (20sF though I look much younger) that the laundry room was closed after 11PM (there are no signs) and that the noise of the machine wakes her up.\n\nMe: I’m sorry, I didn’t know, there aren’t any signs and I work night shift so this is the only time I can do my laundry sometimes. Her: You have no idea of the noise. Me: I’ll keep that in mind for the future, but my load was still running when you stopped it...(I still had 25 minutes left, so it was still soaked and soapy....) Her: I could’ve pulled the plug. I WILL be talking to the landlord and the super about this. Me: Okay. I didn’t know. There was no sign. (Note: and hasn’t been one since I moved in a year ago.) Her: That’s how it’s always been! I don’t know what happened to the sign. Me: I’ll keep that in mind, but I’m going to finish my load now. Her: Be mindful of your neighbors. I WILL be talking to the landlord about this. Me: Okay.\n\nI feel bad (I didn’t know the machines were audible), but I also feel creeped out (my underwear on the floor?) and annoyed that the washer was just plain stopped in the middle of the cycle. Am I the asshole? Should I be worried that she’s talking to the landlord? I took photos of the laundry room to prove there’s no sign up. I’ll try not to do my laundry at 3AM, but I’m usually asleep by 730A so the “latest” I can do laundry is 6A. Is that a reasonable time? I don’t know what to do, really.",

It is my dream to become a professional and I have been going as much as possible there to try and improve, and it’s been working so far. I try to do as much of my homework as I can, and I know I could do more, it’s just a huge load. \n\nMe and my mom were having an argument about school and why I didn’t do good in a class because I didn’t turn in some assignments. She was mad because she said that she tried her hardest to be what her dream job was but wasn’t able to achieve it (pharmacist). I told her I’m working my hardest to achieve my dream, and she said she doesn’t care about what I want to be. I got upset because it’s really important to me, and my mom wasn’t being supportive. I left and went up to my room.\n\nAbout 10 mins later, my mom comes in to apologize for what she said, but I didn’t accept her apology because I was still really mad at her (other things from the argument too). Now my parents are saying it’s on me to try to get back on their good side and I should forgive her, which makes me more mad. AITA for being mad at my mom and not accepting her apology?",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend have been dating for about six months, and everything has been really good except for one thing. She wears a blue men's sized hoodie everywhere and I mean everywhere family outings, date nights, walks. If it's too hot she'll tie it around her waist, but she's never without it.\nFor a bit of clarification we started dating in the summer time.\n\nI've asked her about it, where she got it, stuff like that (I was afraid it was a ex's hoodie.) She's told me it's a comfort thing, and she feels secure with it on/around her.\n\nI don't like it, it goes down to her knees and is super baggy, not in a cute way. It looks like she's wearing a potato sack. I've offered her my hoodies, offered to buy her a new hoodie, offered it have it hemmed (my sister is a seamstress) but she refuses all of it. \nIt's become a regular thing we argue about, especially if we want to go somewhere nice or upscale for a date. A few days ago we got into a massive fight about it at my house.\nI told her it makes her look depressed and like a shut-in, she said I didn't have any control over what she wore, etc. It escalated and eventually she stormed out, but she accidentally left the hoodie behind.\n\nI was so tempted to cut the damn thing up right then, but decided to hide it in the back of my closet. She asked me an hour later if I'd seen it, I told her I hadn't. \n\nI haven't seen her the last couple of days, but we've texting back and forth. We've mostly made up from the fight and things look to be getting better. She's still looking for it, but I don't know what I should do with the hoodie. Am I the asshole?",

Martin was kind of weird but nice at times. But once he started to hang out with our friend group a little more, he started to act more like a douche. He has singlehandedly gotten everyone in our group of friends pissed at him at least 3 times. And every time he says the same thing. \n\n“I’m sorry. I know I screwed up. It’s completely my fault. I’m an asshole. Please forgive me.” Then he goes and does it all over again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther things Martin's done was:\n\n\\-Lied and said that my best friend told Martin to kill himself\n\n\\-Tried to attack me while we were playing night games\n\n\\-Constantly makes suicide jokes\n\n\\-Constantly makes fun of me and my best friend\n\n\\-Makes rude, snarky comments\n\n\\-Texting something to my best friend about how much he hates him\n\n\\-Being a jerk to me and my best friend, but being super nice to all the girls in our friend group\n\n\\-Is a classic NiceGuy™\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this time was different. For a little context, I’m a sophomore in high school. We had our school play (The Foreigner, if anyone is wondering) and I was one of the lead roles. Since I was so busy with the play and homework and school, I wasn’t able to hang out with my friends as much, in fact, hardly at all. When I texted my friends when they were coming, this particular friend just simply said no. When asked why he said “I don’t support people who don’t support me.” Later that day, my friends were going out to lunch. I told them I couldn't make it, as I already had plans. Then, my “friend” texted me [this (sorry, I've never used Imgur before, so this starts at the bottom and goes up)](https://imgur.com/a/dIPUmas). Since then, I've hardly spoken to him. I've given him chances before. And I'm done giving him more. Am I an asshole for doing so? Or should I give him one more chance?",

      "description": "My high school had a yearly trip to a summer camp type of place just before the start of the school year. Big hills, cabins with shitty AC, and rickety-ass bunk beds that take a fucking gymnast to climb to the top.\n\nOur cabin's group slogged all the way up to the top of the hill, where our cabin was. One girl (call her A) was overweight to the point where climbing up to the top bunk was dangerous, so we made sure that she got a bottom bunk. I also managed to get a bottom bunk, being a senior (this will be important later). So, our chaperone (not a teacher, a lady we'll call Mrs. C) wasn't there. I asked a teacher, and she said that Mrs. C would be arriving later. Okay, whatever. We left our stuff around the bunks and went and did summer camp things.\n\nWhen we got back, everyone was dead tired. I was ready to pass out on my ultra-convenient bottom bunk, when we find that A's stuff was in a corner, and Mrs. C's things were on her bed, and Mrs. C still was not in sight. A was not going to confront her about it, so I gave A my bunk and resigned myself to climbing up Mount Fucking Everest just to sleep. \n\nWhen Mrs. C returned, I told her what had happened, and as politely as I could, pointed out that it would have been more polite to wait for everyone to return before moving someone else's things and staking a claim on a bed. \n\nShe told me to watch my tone, and that she deserved a bunk because she was the chaperone.\n\nSo I shut up, and let things go, but ranted about it at home and to some trusted friends.\n\nTl;Dr A chaperone kicked a girl who couldn't climb out of a bottom bunk, and when I asked her to be more considerate she shut me down. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Pretty straightforward one here. I’m 30 so it’s not like birthdays are anywhere near as important as they used to be. But I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t nice to still have that one day where it’s sort of just about you. That being said, it’s in a few days and my grandpa (on my moms side) is in really bad health. He’s undergone chemo at 85, had to begin a second round of treatment on Friday, and was admitted to the hospital tonight with tests being done for a potential blood infection. He’s being kept overnight at the very least, but at this stage in the game, life is basically one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel. I know any little thing like this could potentially be the thing that does it, and while I love him very much and don’t WANT him to die at all, I really don’t want him to die near my birthday. They’re the only grandparents I’ve ever really known and my mom is very close with them, even more so in the last several years following my dad dying. So part of me is worried that if he dies on or near my birthday, it will kind of taint it with my family. So, AITA?",

I asked him if he could just get food after school but he had tutoring so he could only really wait until dinner. \n\nEventually another friend just volunteered to get the food but I feel quite bad about the situation because I feel like I owed that to him as a friend but I also felt he was being quite entitled in his asking and was being forceful.

I care about her, and the thought of her in tears, staring down at her phone while dealing with the emotional clusterfuck of a dying relative has been too much to handle for a while now. \n\n\nBut I just couldn’t be with her. I hadn’t realized I fell out of love until she went abroad and it was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. It was so ingrained in me that we were going to be together forever because the sacrifices me and family made for her finances that it felt like an investment.\n\n\nThere were times where I would get really fucked up and the feelings of not wanting to be with her would bubble up. I’d sleep on the couch because I couldn’t stand to be in the same bed as her but the feelings would go away the next morning. I was so happy for the first time in a while when she finally went away. \n\n\nBut I just couldn’t keep the facade of pretending everything was okay and reciprocating I love you texts when I had emotionally broken up with her. That’s not honest, and I’d be lying to her the entire time just to break up with her first thing when she got back. I felt like I couldn’t just ignore her either, she’d figure out something was up and try to get through to me through mutual friends which eventually would let the cat out of the bag.

      "description": "For context, I really don't like the vast majority of movies. I have a short attention span and find most of them cookie-cutter and not entertaining. That said, the movies I love, I REALLY love, and all the better if I get to enjoy watching them with another person. My husband, in contrast, loves movies and will watch basically anything. Usually, I just do my own thing and ignore whatever he's watching. No big deal. We don't always have to be doing the same thing.\n\nNow as in the title, the annoyance lies in that he always watches my favorite movies without me! If I'm home and awake, he'll have on some random thing I couldn't care less about. But I come home from work, and what do I see the case for, laying atop the DVD player? Wayne's World. Rocky Horror. Howl's Moving Castle. Deadpool. Adam's Family Values. Wtf dude. You couldn't have waited for me?\n\nNB4 you start, yes I know, there's no way for him to know that unless I tell him. So I did. I told him I'd really appreciate if he'd occasionally wait and invite me to watch, too. I'm not saying he isn't allowed to watch whatever movie unless it's with me, of course not, but it's literally ALL THE TIME. Makes me feel left out, you know?\n\nIn any case, it didn't do any good. I'm sick right now and have been hanging out in bed most of the day. The hubs, who had been hanging out with me, said he was gonna go get a snack, and eat in the living room as opposed to the bed, because duh. He asked if I wanted to come to, and being comfy and under the impression he was just going to go eat in a chair and probably continue watching videos on his phone (as he'd been doing for hours) said I'd stay where I was. 10 minutes later, and in through the doorway I hear the opening music to Clue. One of my favorite movies. He knows this.\n\nI call, \"Why didn't you invite me?\"\n\n\"You said you wanted to stay in bed????\"\n\n\"You didn't say you were going to watch Clue.\"\n\n\"I thought you wanted to stay in bed.\"\n\n* annoyed silence *\n\n\"... Do you want to come watch now?\"\n\n\"Just watch your movie.\"\n\n*noises of bafflement, movie resumes*\n\nSo, now I'm sitting here by myself, trying to ignore the sounds of one of my favorite movies. I guess maybe it's petty, but I don't think it's a hard concept to grasp- please occasionally include me in things I like to do. AITA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I am losing it, my husband and I have been together 5 years, married for 2. We both have children from previous relationships. His daughter is a 19 year old freshman in college but she has had a failure to launch and he has not made any boundaries with her.  She is constantly calling, texting, having him do things for her and her bf (that does not have a license) things that she should be able to take care of on her own. The calling/texting is constant as in multiple times a day everyday and if there is not an instant reply she calls her brothers phone. She has not packed her room up even though we have asked her to do so for the past 6 months, which wouldn't be a big deal if we didn't have other children that are still in the home needing the space. \n\nA little more background, my husband has had primary care of his kids since they were 10 and 14, his ex has a drug problem and lives with an abusive boyfriend. During this time he has allowed his daughter to use the mother as an excuse to act anyway she pleases. To this day she has never done a chore, cleaned a bathroom, does not know how to load a dishwasher, and anytime she is asked to do something she refuses or tries to get her brother to do it. This has been the primary source of our fighting because not only does she not contribute to household chores the way the other children are expected to but she is disrespectful to my husband calling him by his full name while demanding he do things for her as if he is a child. The list goes on, it's really too much for a post. She is constantly mean, bossy and disrespectful to my children, my husband and my husbands other child. She has been the source of many fights and we have started counseling over the issues that he and I have over how she should be handled. \n\nWe have reached some improvement with the way my husband handles some aspects of the situation, but I don't feel like it is enough. I don't think he should be responsible for taking her boyfriend to and from work without notice. She is off at college and living in a dorm, there is no reason her stuff shouldn't be packed up, so that our other children don't have to share rooms. Even though we live close to campus, he should not constantly be running around doing things for her, the whole point of moving out was to teach her to be self reliant. I am frustrated when she tries to stay at our house every weekend with her boyfriend and neither of them clean up after themselves, they have sex on our sofa and leave stains behind. \n\nMy husband and I have reached a point where we can talk about it and he acts like a dog with a tail between his legs because he knows this is a lot to deal with, but he wants to make these slow changes instead of just laying out what is acceptable and what isn't. I feel that this has continued to go on WAY too long and I am tired of being punished for her bad behavior AITA for wanting to stake our relationship on this issue? ",

      "description": "First, I’d like to apologize. Blah blah blah, I’m on mobile, you get it. \n\nLet me clarify some things — I’ve been texting this guy back and forth for years now. We’ve been extremely, forwardly sexual with each other since we met. I have had (romantic) feelings for him for a long time and he claims it’s mutual, but I don’t really think that’s the case. \n\nHe’s told me on more than one occasion that it’s okay if I send nudes, that I don’t have to ask before I do it. Okay, fair enough... I usually do anyway, to be sure, but there is a few times I haven’t. \n\nTwo days ago, he sent me nudes and I returned the favor. No big deal. Everything was fine. Last night, I sent him nudes after we had been flirting  (sexually) through texts, but I didn’t ask first, assuming that, based on what was said before, he would be okay with it. He didn’t express anything to me, didn’t ask me to stop, and did not say he was uncomfortable. \n\nToday, he sent a voice message to my friend explaining that “I don’t talk to him outside of sending nudes” and he’s “kind of uncomfortable with it” because I sent him nudes without asking first last night. He made it seem like it was a reoccurring event and embarrassed me in front of my friend, as she played the voice message out when we were in a Discord call together. \n\nSo..... AITA for sending the nudes? Also: AITA for being upset that he told my friend something extremely personal about me?",

      "description": "Now I'm new to reddit only got it recently, anyway so this happened around September last year my friend told me she was Bisexual and I was so happy for her because she was coming out anyway that lunch time I make a harmless joke \n\"hey now you got something incommon with *insert name here* (because this person was also part of LGBTQ community. So yeah I tell her that I was just messing around and me and my other friend just laugh it off, second lunch arrives and shit starts to go down, my \"friend\" is avoiding me and the other girl then suddenly around 2 minutes this happens\nEB=Entilted brat EM= entitled Mother  Foley =my other friend \nAnyway so EB walks up to me and starts yelling at me for saying what I said and I don't take shit from no one so I respond \"it was a F*cking joke she needs to learn to take a joke!\" me literally fucking made with rage then Foley steps in \"yeah (me)  is right like it wasn't meant to hurt her feelings\" then me and EB gets in to a heated argument (I'm gonna just keep it as short as possible) so after like 1min of yelling at eachother Foley pulls me away and I'm seriously about to lose my shit (I have anger issues) so many emotions where going through my head, half crying half wanting to beat the shit out of EB and that friend but Foley calms me down and tells me we need to find that friend of ours, so we look for about 4mins, everyone was harassing me telling me I was a f*cking bitch and how self centered I was (also I am have manger anxiety problems too)  anyway I start to literally break down unable to move and just having person after person tell me what a horrible person I was but Foley stepped in and helped me get out of there she could see I was struggling but before she pulled me away EB threatened me saying she would beat the shit out of me if I tried to apologize. So yeah we head to the counseling office to talk to them about what had happened and Foley and some others went to find where my \"friend\" was while I had a mental breakdown in the office, bell goes and she comes in she explains her side I explain mine and then they made me apologize and told us to wash our faces off cause we had red faces from the crying, anyway we hug and made up and they talk to EB and they tell me everything is going to be alright.\n\nF*cking wrong. Later the last bell rings and I'm just about to leave when EB walks up to me and already I know shit is gonna go down, so she starts harassing me telling me \"do you really think I wouldn't punch you\" holding my ground I avoid the question because at my school it's who ever starts the fight is the one to get suspended, so yeah Im just trying to avoid her just trying to get home but at this point I'm flaming I couldnt take this b*tches bs anymore I say yes you wouldnt and man, I get the surprise of my life she does it (PS barely hitting me and I had my phone in my other hand)lol you know I clock her back being fuckin way bigger than her it's a hard blow and me and this girl in a fucking fist fight eventually two teachers and one student pulled us off, everyone is staring at me and her (her being really popular) a day later kids take her side still calling me a whore and a self centered bitch but not the best part, (look I get you have to stand up for your kids but listen)  EM is literally telling the office I should get suspended for harassment and assault but since there were a heap of teachers there they didn't suspend me, I did get like a three day detention tho lol.\n \nAm I the asshole\nPS I thought this would be a r/entitledparents post but I realized it wasnt and its more like am I the asshole ",

Her biggest defense over this is that \"we weren't dating at the time of the incidence so what does it matter\". My biggest issue about this is the lying for the 5 months and that regardless of the dating we agreed to be exclusive.

      "description": "So I was brought up on a council estate,  the same place my dad brought up. \n\nLet’s just say it’s not a good place to live, well some parts are notorious for very minor drug use such as cannabis whilst other areas are infamous for crack, spice, heroin etc, as well as prostitution, gang violence. A lot of people are the stereotypical ‘chavs’ and I’m not saying this to be pretentious, but they are. They swear, they take drugs, they commit crimes. My brother is one of them lol. \n\nContrary to all this, my mum lived a very different life.  She was very privileged growing up: the typical ‘middle class’ person and who came from a family of doctors etc. She sheltered me from the ‘goings on’ in the estate, meaning I go to a school outside its boundaries and I don’t have any friends who live in the same area, I have an ambiguous accent, etc. \n\nI am proud of my family and where I come from. I think I am very lucky to have privileges and loving parents but, my friend group seems to think I am someone to be pitied. \n\nThey are typically middle class people and when they found out where I was from, they were utterly appalled. Since then, I have had my fair share of either pitying glances or class jokes, such as I am undereducated, how lucky it is I didn’t get pregnant at a young age or start smoking crack or whatever. \n\nAnyway, one day were discussing Cicero and I was talking about my difficulties with Latin etc and someone perked up:\n\n“Well, what can you expect from the school you went to. You didn’t even learn Latin, they should consider your mitigating circumstances before they give you such difficult assignments.” \n\nAnd someone else said, friend who is a girl.\n\n“Well, you can’t blame them, can you? There isn’t much time for learning Latin where she lives, they’re all too busy getting pregnant and high’. \n\nI, in return, said:\n\n“Maybe they should let me use english translations for all my Latin texts, to make it easier for me: the lowly hoi polloi. We need all the help we can get from our betters. And yes, while we are all busy getting pregnant, you can go fuck your cousin and spread your webbed feet to your inbred descendants’. \n\nPeople laughed but my friend in question came up to me later and said I had embarrassed her, in front of everybody and that it wasn’t fair. \n\nI didn’t mean to make her feel bad. I just felt defensive but I don’t like how they all seem to feel sorry for me now and that I almost have to joke about it. I was trying to be funny about the whole ‘inbred’ thing but in retrospect, it was a bit of a shitty thing to say. \n",

      "description": "Today my friend texted me about an essay that he had just finished written for his internship. He asked if I would read his essay and tell him my opinion on it. Of course being a good friend that I am, I humbly accepted it. Turned out, it wasn't good, at least in my opinion. \n\nMy friend is a very defensive person, and he tried to explain to me how my opinion is wrong and how proud he is on this specific essay. I agreed with him that the essay had a good heart, as in a very good concept, but the whole thing was all over the place and had no structure to it. For once I was surprised how bad it was, and so I told him exactly that, and a simple \"you should rewrite it\".\n\nHe took that as a very offensive gesture to him, and started to use more heavy hitting words towards me. Naturally I did the same thing back.  The fight took over an hour and he declared that he was going to block me for being toxic, and being a bad friend. I throughly explained that just because my opinion did not justify his, doesn't mean I'm a bad friend, if anything it should be the opposite. But at that point he stopped listening.\n\nThe essay was about feminism. He had no thesis, all 3 paragraphs did not connect in any sort of ways except that they all talk about feminism. Yet all those 3 points did not support any kind of argument at all. \n\nI'm hurted to see my only friend blocked me like this, and I came here to ask if I'm the asshole for being straight forward like, or should I have just support him from the beginning? He's not good under pressure and when he came to me to ask about my opinion, I knew that all he wanted was a support on his side. But the essay was definitely not the one a college student should have writen, and I wanted to help him...  \n\nIf I were the asshole, I hope to find a way to say sorry, but even if I weren't, what should I do to help him understand? He's my only friend and I treasure him a lot.\n\nTL;DR: My friend sent me his essay for my input. He didn't like my input. We had a fight. Now I'm being blocked for being straight forward.",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I, both in our mid 20s are together for four years. There has been an issue with a female co worker of his for over two years. He hang out at her house in secret 1.5 yrs ago, I found out much later. He claims nothing happens. They still work together and text sometimes, but less frequent. He swears he won't hang out with her - she has send inappropriate texts and such.  \n\n\nWe live together in our own house. I leave every monday morning to another city and come back tuesday morning for work issues. This means he is alone for 24 hours.\n\nThis tuesday morning 10am I got out of the bus and saw that girl walking to the bus. We live in a small craphole place, with nothing to do. We have a supermarket, a bakery, one tiny clothing store and that is it. This girl lives in another city, works in another city and studies in another city. I know she has NO friends or family in our town, because she mentioned it earlier to my boyfriend. (\"You are the only one I know that wants to live in that crap place!\")  \n\n\nWhat was her reason to be there, so early in the morning? I came home and my boyfriend was in bed asleep, with the window and curtains open. He always sleeps with the window and curtains closed.  \n\n\nI confronted and he said she was not there and has never been to our house. Then I decided to check his internet history. Yes, fellow redditors, I know this is wrong but I do NOT want a rant about this.\n\nSo I saw that the evening before he watched some netflix on his tablet until 11PM. After that, things get weird. He watched youtube on his mobile from 11.00 to 11.19 PM. This is odd, because I am with this guy for 4 years and he NEVER watches youtube on his phone when he is inside the house. He always only does this when he is in the bus, outside or whatever. However no busses drove at that moment so that can't be true. After 23.19 there was no signs of activity anymore on his phone, tablet or computer. He set up an alarm clock at 22.59 PM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first next activity was next day 08.04 am when he put off his alarm clock, and then 08.30 on Whatsapp.  \n\n\nHe has a car that he shares with his mom. Wednesday we got into the car and he said; Mom keeps asking bout the car and drives my fuel till its empty. And I said; no she didn't asked for the car for at least 2 weeks why you bring this up? He just said oh it bothers me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe kept bringing up this girl 2 or 3 times. \"I don't think it was her, I think you saw it wrong. Probably can't be her\" blah blah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe got angry and sad when I asked him if he cheated and he denied all and called me paranoid. Ever since, nearly a week, my boyfriend acts distant and avoids sex. When we talk he says he is disappointed in me and feels like he is together with a private detective. He asked me why I am with him if I dont trust him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for accusing him of cheating?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for asking my step-brother to stop poking me with his elbow?",
      "description": "This took place about two weeks ago at thanksgiving dinner. I was sat next to my step-brother who, when using his knife, flares his elbows out and bumps into me with each cut of the knife. I’m not going to say I should have made a deal out of this, and rather I should have just let it be, since it was thanksgiving. But, I asked him to please keep his elbows closer to himself. He was offended that I was asking this of him and started to tear up. I can honestly swear I did not use any tense or rude mannerism to him, he’s just a sensitive boy (13).   My father then told me to stop, to which I replied that he always does this when I sit next to him. My brother then looked to his mom (my step-mom) and told her what I asked of him, with tears in his eyes. In response, she glared at me and told him to sit somewhere else. And my father always takes her side, so he was equally frustrated with me.\n\nEver since then, my step-mom has held this against me. Telling my father to stop supporting me at university (I’m renting a studio apartment). Among other situations with her, where she has always favored her kids over me and my brothers, I am always forced to apologize for offending her. But currently I’m quite upset with her blatant lack of respect to me and how I’m always in the wrong. I’ve always either been respectful to her, or simply not talked to her. She is sometimes nice for me and has purchased things for me in the past, which is why I’m always perplexed at how fast she is to anger at me and how she shows such a duality in behavior. She then holds the fact that she has bought me stuff against me and I’m not allowed to be angry with her. This is why I simply try to have as little contact with her as i can. And in return this angers her more. AITA?",

      "description": "Just for a background, my (now ex, but this episode happened a year before we broke up) gf (F27) is very insecure, jealous and because of that, controlling. I (M23) always showed her that she was the only girl in my life and never did anything close to cheating.\n\nThe day I started in my job was the same day she had a test, and if she passed (she did!) she would enter in a doctorate program. This would make our relationship easier because we would be living relatively close (2h drive instead of a 6h bus ride).\n\nWhen I arrived at the office, I was the only guy, there was 4 women working there, including the HR girl who processed my admission and that my gf made it clear that she was not comfortable about me talking to her.\n\nAnyway, I didn't want to upset my gf or get her on her nerves right before the test, so when she asked who was in the office, I said there was 2 girls, 2 guys and me.\n\nI know it was wrong, but I did with a reason and with the full intent to tell her later that day, but what I intended was worthless. After her test, we were chatting, I slipped and she found out. Later that day we talk about it, almost broke up, but managed to stick together and work through it.\n\nNow I wanna hear some opinions because I'm on the fence, I feel like an asshole, but at the same time I feel justified.",

      "description": "So, this just happened and I feel massively awful. I bought a cat from really nice girl yesterday. The cat was adorable and we got along well when I visited. So, I brought him home and he seemed content at first. However, when 11 p.m. rolled around, he was suddenly incosolable, meowing at top volume, and wouldn't stop. He followed me through the flat and practially screamed when I closed a door behind me for a second. Needless to say, I didn't get a wink of sleep all night. So this went on for 7 hours, with him screaming, and me crying. I felt completely helpless and desperate and didn't know what the hell to do. \n\nSo, at 6 a.m. something inside me snapped. I took the cat and all his stuff and got a taxi to the girl's place. I rang the doorbell at 6.15 to return the cat. Now, I told her that I know this is awful but that I didn't know what to do. And she was sooo nice, it made me feel worse. Now, she texts me saying I really shouldn't feel bad and that it doesn't make any sense for the cat and I to suffer, when he is comfortable with her. Still, I feel like a massive asshole, especially for the earliness and me just coming over and giving her no choice. ",

      "description": " My girlfriend and I live together. Have been dating for a few years, but just moved in together six months ago.\n\nSomething I had noticed a bit before, but is now really apparent since we spend even more time together is her BO. I knew she didn't like to shower when we are dating, but I didn't know she only showers once every 7-10 days. We've had conversations about how I think it should be more frequent than that (at least 3 days) and that its embarrassing that I should even mention that she smells and that if I can tell, other people can as well. She says that someone would have told her if she did. I had to let her know that one of her friends told me in confidence because it was embarrassing and my mother, friends have said things before.\n\nShe doesn't want to shower more frequently because she says the water isn't good for her hair, but doesn't have a good response when I told her I'd get her a shower cap / she doesn't have to wash her hair every time. My concern is that we've had this conversation over a dozen times, but it doesn't seem to have changed at all. She has started showering regularly at exactly 7 days, but I don't think that is enough. I feel like an AH for noticing how often she showers, but it makes it uncomfortable to sleep in the same bed (her hair smells greasy even if it doesn't feel it) and I want a little femininity out of my SO (shaven legs, etc.). Speaking of femininity, when she is on her period she doesn't want to shower since \"she doesn't feel clean,\" which I can understand to an extent. So that adds another 3-5 days between bathing depending on where it lines up. Most recently, and what led to this post, was that day 7 she started, so she took a shower on day 11.\n\nFor me, its on the edge of accepting that we all have personal freedom to do what we'd like, yet I feel like there is a certain expectation for hygiene and that I'm not asking too much. My biggest concern is what happens when we have children and what will be acceptable/ ok then. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR girlfriend showers once a week, I have talked to her about showering more, we are at an impasse.",

      "description": "So I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years; we lived together for 2 years and are currently living apart because he went to grad school in another city. During this time, our cohabitation and relationship has mostly been fine, but there's been a constant disagreement over how much time he spends with his friends. For example, last summer was the last time I'd have been living with him before he went to grad school and almost everyday he spent hanging out with his friends in town, leaving almost no alone time for us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis spending time with other people and not making time for me has only gotten worse since he left for grad school last fall. It seems that every time I call him or try to contact him, he's spending time with his friends (who are not in the same classes that he is taking). He says that he's always busy with classwork and he almost never sees them, but almost every time I call, he can't talk because he's playing games with them or is out to eat with them or whatever. I also know that he's not really taking his classwork seriously because he completes his projects mere hours before they are due and asks me to proofread them (which I try to complete in the small amount of time he has before submitting the papers). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also completing a university degree in my city. When I started a year-long project in the fall, I said I'd need his help with one aspect of it or I'd have to go with another idea. He said it would be no problem and promised he'd help me. The course ended up being somewhat disorganized and I only got access to the software required for the project on Friday, with the part of the project he said he'd help me with due on Monday. I asked him to come back home on Friday to help me with the project, but he said that he made plans with his friends prior and he'd help me with it remotely today/Sunday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCome today and he tried to help me for an hour and we got really frustrated because the remote working solution was not working very well and I have no idea how the program works. We had a fight over it and how it seems that he's always with his friends and when I need him he's never here. That was at 2:00 PM. He then said he'd complete it on his own by tomorrow and have it for me tomorrow. I don't really like that solution because I still won't know the program and won't know how to fix it if something goes wrong. I've been trying to check up on him every hour/couple of hours to see if he's done anything on the project and if he can explain it better or something. It's now 10:30 and he has not done any work on it, even though he promised me he would. Instead, he's been playing games with his friends all day and gets upset with me when I bring up how this is a problem and we need to talk about it and how I'm stressed about my project. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know, reddit. I don't know what this will solve. I just want to know, AITA for getting upset that my boyfriend won't help me in favour of spending time with his friends?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hey all,\n\nToday we're having a math test. A friend of mine, in my class, has been repeating for the past two weeks that I had to \"save him\" by helping him with this test. He wants me to sit next to him during the test and give him all the answer, because he knows I'm good at math, because right now, with his current grade, his failing the year. \n\nI proposed to help him prepare the test, but it never happened. He sent me a message AGAIN yesterday, asking me that if I arrived before for the test to take two seats so that he can cheat on me. \n\nI'll be honest in telling you that it makes me feel uncomfortable. I have no problem with helping a friend cheat so that he can pass the year, or giving him extra math lessons. Both seems fine to me. But because he's been constantly asking me  makes me feel obligated. \n\nThe test is on the probability. It's the first subject of the year that I'm struggling with. So I'm not even sure I'm the one he should he cheat on. I tried to mention it to him, by answer to him when he was almost begging that \"trust me, I'm struggling too this time\". He didn't care. \"You'll do fine, don't worry.\" The exam being in a few hours, I'll be honest and tell you that I don't think I'll do very good. \n\nNow, I wake up during the night, feeling super sick. I was sick the whole week-end, but today I wake up even more sick. I'm thinking about not going to this test; I'm not someone who does well on test sick, I've tried but I would rather do it another time. It has not happened to me this year either, so I feel like there's no problem here. \n\nBut it makes me feel bad for my friend. AITA for not going? At the same time, I'm sick, so normally I wouldn't be going, but there's this whole thing around.",

      "description": "So background: My MiL and I have always bad some issues. She's divorced, single, lives alone, and recently moved across the state to be closer to my husband and our 8 month old daughter. \n\nNow onto the story. Yesterday we went out to lunch with my mother in law, my husband, and my daughter. Lunch was fine, food was great, we talked and got along just fine. I even hugged her goodbye (I'm not a touchy person so hugging her is compromising and really affectionate for me) I thought all was well. Then I get home and see she posted on social media a picture of her, my husband, and my daughter, with a message about what a nice lunch she had with just the 2 of them. I went to the bathroom during lunch, where she quickly took the picture of the three of them. (I totally understand wanting some pictures without me and wouldve taken the picture had she asked) I didn't even know about the picture until I saw it on social media. And it honestly kind of upset me that she went out of her way to make it look like I wasn't there. I didnt mind the picture, just the sneakiness of taking it while I was in the bathroom and then not tagging me in the post about lunch like I wasnt there. (Yes I know its dumb that I'm upset about social media. It's just it seemed like our relationship was on the up and the post makes it seem like she still has beef with me) \n\nSo when I saw the post I requested to tag myself in her \"check in\" to the restaurant we were at  and commented \"Lunch was great! I'm so glad the 4 of us could get together! :)\" admittedly it was pretty passive aggressively addressing that she intentionally excluded me, but I think to anyone else it just looks like I enjoyed lunch with my family. She got so upset that I \"attacked\" her on social media that she deleted her whole profile. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for commenting on her post? ",

      "description": "This happened over Thanksgiving, but my husband and I still can't talk about it. It's one of those topics that instantly combusts on us. \n\nMy BIL and I don't get along. I think it's a personality thing. He's a tough guy who tends to bully people he doesn't agree with, and I'm a puppy dog who just wants love and approval. BIL decided at some point that he doesn't like me, and was never shy to leave me out of get togethers, talk bad about me around others, and otherwise act cold towards me. The important thing here is I've felt bullied by BIL my entire marriage, and BIL and husband know this.\n\nMy husband goes back and forth on whether my feelings are justified. Regardless I know that my husband will always be there for his brother.\n\nSo... Thanksgiving. My BIL is going out of town and can't take his massive Gladiator Dane with him. He asks my husband if he can watch it.  Husband of course says yes. BIL (and husband)  know I don't want the dog at our house. \n\nI like the dog and my husband loves the dog,  but here are my reasons: 1) BIL doesn't clean up the poo (my husband doesn't care and says he'll do it, but then doesn't for days) 2) We have a renter and I don't want to inconvenience her out of using the yard and most importantly 3) I hate that my BIL knows he can ignore my preferences, and he doesn't need to work with me on a civil level because he can go through my husband who will basically never tell him no. \n\nSo after telling his brother yes, my husband asks my \"permission.\" I say no. Husband finally makes a compromise where he'll watch the dog at his brother's condo and his mom's house. I'm like \"sure sounds great.\" \n\nExcept my husband was super inconvenienced by that arrangement. He had to drive around a ton over Thanksgiving to make it work.  Also, he thinks I need to get over my feelings about his brother.  And finally he feels like he has no say over what's allowed at his home. He's got some strong feelings about this and he holds it all against me. \n\nSo AITA for sticking to my guns on the dog scenario?\n\n",

      "description": "AITA So my mom has always been some what (okay a lot) of an authoritarian style parent.  There were a lot of time growing up where I didn't agree with her about something but was not allowed to voice that. And honestly even now, there are some of those times.\n\nI love my mom, she's the strongest person I ever met.  But because of this I have never shared much of my personal life with her.  I try to open up more now, because I want an open relationship with her.  And, to her credit she has tried a lot harder to be less strict but she's still her own way.\n\nWell because of this I have made it a point to involve my son in our lives as much as makes since given his age etc.  he has always been given a voice.\n\nOkay so let's get the background over... I'm a single mother to a 5 year old boy with several allergies. Some severe and some mild.  Including an array of food allergies. My mother babysits him while I am at work.  This generally means she is feeding him about one meal a week by my request, and sometimes he gets junk or treats there too.\n\nWell recently my mom was feeding him and the other kids (cousins) some dinner which happened to be cooked with an ingredient my son is allergic to.  It's complicated to explain the nature of that particular allergy but while he will likely not die from it, he is still usually caused a bit of discomfort when he eats it.  Hives, itchy mouth, etc.  Typically if it is cooked and he gets some, it's okay. But he has reacted to cooked too. So even though his epipen isn't for that specific food, we avoid it.  Basically he *can* eat it and not die but really shouldn't and he and I have decided together he won't. \n\nWell mom told him he had to eat his dinner or he was going to be in big trouble.  When he said no again she told him he was grounded from\nScreens all night until he cleaned his plate.  My son's reply was \"Fine. I don't care how much trouble I'm in I am NOT eating that.  You can't make me.\"\n\nWell of course my mom was livid when I got there to get him.  And she had told me he has to apologize before he can come back.\n\nI told her that I can't make him do that. I have taught him from day 1 that he can refuse to eat any food he's allergic to. No adult can make him poison himself. And I will 100% back that up.  \n\nNow mom is saying we are both AH's and need to apologize to her.  That she knows which foods he is deathly allergic to and which ones are \"fine as long as he has antihistamines if he gets hives.\" \n\nSo, AITA? And was my son holey-jr? \n",

      "description": "About two weeks ago I was at the gym and was training back. I arrived and went to do lat pull downs, low rows, and straight leg dead lifts (all 4 x 10 sets), so I’ve been here for a solid 20 minutes already.\n\nI knew I needed the cable machine for my next exercise (straight arm pull downs) and needed a straight bar to do the exercise. I knew I needed to do these when I walked in but wanted to do the others first, and for the entire time I was doing the preceding 3 exercises there has been a cable free but with a water bottle and towel next to it. The reason why I didn’t the cable earlier was because I was going to do another 2 exercises on them on top of the one I was planning on doing, and didn’t want to lose the cable just in case. If I did them one after the other then I could stay on it as long as I needed.\n\nSo I head over to the cable that has the towel and bottle (again, haven’t seen anyone use the cable for 20 or so minutes), and look around to catch anyone’s eyes to let me know it’s theirs. I wait for about 30secs to a minute and take off the rope attachment and attach the straight bar. A couple of guys ask me for the rope attachment and I give it to them, then I start doing my first set.\n\nAs soon as I finish the owner of the towel and bottle taps me on the shoulder and says “You do realise you just took my machine mate”, and I immediately apologised and tried to get the rope he was using but couldn’t find any left. I apologised again and explained I didn’t see anyone here and he was visibly mad. \n\nI explained to him that I haven’t seen anyone here using the cable for 20 mins, to which he explained he was on some other machine doing another set. He said “You should have asked around” and “A little gym etiquette goes a long way”. He walked off pissed and did something else on another machine, didn’t even want his machine back when I offered.\n\nDon’t get me wrong here guys, I understand that I’ve outright taken someones machine at the gym - not cool. But WIBTA if I asked around and 3 (for example) people said they haven’t see anyone use the machine I want? WIBTA if I took his secondary machine that didn’t have his towel and bottle? Would I have to ask around for THAT machine?\n\nAm I 100% in the wrong here? Where and how far does gym etiquette go for someone not occupying a machine for a noticeable amount of time? Also not sure if worth mentioning but this is my first gym etiquette/workout related incident, I try to be as civil as possible.\n\nMuch appreciated guys!\n",

      "description": "Ok basically my old beater car, a 2004 sunfire had broke down, so we got it towed to a mechanic to see what was wrong with it. In the meantime my mom got a new car and I had been driving her old one. The mechanic got back to us saying it just needed a new battery but we didn't have enough space for three cars so I told my mom if she covered the fixing cost I could sell it, and she agreed. \n\nWell today I told her that I had been trying to find a buyer for $600 and she told me that I should give it to my late stepdads nephew. I told her that I didn't want to give it away for free and she said that I should. But I kept saying I wouldn't because it just got new brakes, new battery, oil changed recently and I put a new radio in it. So I wanted to get at least $600 for it. My mom kept guilt tripping me into giving away my car but I kept saying no. Then she says \"fine, sell it. But if you do you're gonna give me the money because I paid for the brake repairs.\" I said that was bullshit and I'm not gonna do that because I'm pretty pressed for cash right now, being a student. She told me if I did sell it she would take the money but since I've been taking law I told her that she can't legally do that. Now she's being petty and guilt tripping me and saying \"I won't do shit for you.\" \n\nI'm being steadfast in my position but I'm wondering if I am actually being an asshole. ",

I am wanting to host a 'goodbye drinks' for him at the end of the week, this is the problem:\n\nRecently he has been having problems in his relationship and personal life recently, on Thursday he got agressive and hit his girlfriend in the nightclub (we are all in a close friend group) so everyone got very angry at him and he got kicked out the nightclub. They have since broken up.\n\nA lot of people are saying they are not going to attend (Which is fine with me) but people are getting angry at the thought of bringing him to our block of flats, even going as far as to say they'll 'beat him up'.\n\nAll I want to do is give him a good sendoff as he is a good friend of mine and was also my flatmate last year, he's helped me through a lot and we have a lot of good memories. It would kill me if he left without anyone saying goodbye to him after living in here and being in the friend group for 2 years. I have not forgiven him for hitting her, I am simply looking past it just for one night, doesn't he atleast deserve that?",

We ate dinner, drank a little wine... everything was fine.\nMy fiance excused himself and went to the bathroom - exactly then the topic of the conversation turned to a family my parents are friends with. They have 3 grown children (aged 30-40, I guess) and two of them are married. The third one - let's call him 'Steve' - is still single, slightly depressed and struggling with loneliness but also making lots of money. Nice guy overall and I have known him for years, but I'm not exactly friends with him.\n\nOut of the blue my mother said to me 'Well, Steve - that would've been a catch! You wouldn't have to work at all if you would have married Steve! And I know he always had an eye on you. Missed chance right here!'\n\n...just seconds later my fiance re-entered the room and there was suddenly dead silence. He didn't here a thing and I didn't get to say anything either - the moment was just...over.\nI was/am totally pissed since she really overstepped boundaries of the acceptable here - I love my fiance and I'm not the type of girl that cares about marrying someone significantly richer (my mom followed that path though).\nI always thought they got along well... maybe she was just a little wine-drunk and didn't think much of it?\n\nHere is my question: I told my fiance about the whole ordeal because it really got to me and now he - too - is (understandably) pissed at my mother. I had a one on one talk with her, too, of course and let her know that I discussed the situation with my fiance as well and now she is mad at me for causing 'unnecessary drama'/making her uncomfortable. \nShe also claims it was just fun and kind of portrays me as a snitch.\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "My 17 year old step son loves with dh and I full time. He has been assigned the bare minimum of chores to help the household. Specifically putting the garbage cans to the curb and back, scooping the cat boxes twice a week and unloading the dishwasher every other day. He's is extemely lazy and it's a battle for dh to get him to complete these tasks every week. It is a constant source of stress for dh.\n\nStep son recently got hired to work part time at local fast food restaurant, but hasn't yet started. Dh got home from work last night to find that stepson hadn't done any chores, and instead had been playing video games for the 5 hours since he got home from school. After initially telling him off for it, followed it up with, but it's not your fault there are two other kids who should be doing this stuff too. Meaning our six and nine year old sons.\n\nHe then comes upstairs to me and asks why younger sons didn't bring up the cans or unload the dishwasher. My response see was that those weren't their chores, that they did the chores assigned to them. Dh then responded that the younger boys will have to start doing step sons  chores because he got job at fast food restaurant.  He then walked away aggitated without me responding.\n\nSo here is my question, am I the asshole to say that it's not the younger kids responsibility to pick up step sons chores because he has a part time job? The younger kids have their own chores, and they are quite frankly more involved and take more time and effort than step sons. Step son still lives here full time and still doesn't pay rent or anything, so he is working just for his own pocket money. I don't think this absolves him of the responsibility of helping to take care of the household. I feel dh just sees this as an easy way to absolve himself of the stress and headache of enforcing these expectations on stepson, by pushing the burden onto the little kids.\n\nSo Reddit, tell me, am I the asshole if I tell dh that  this is not ok and step son still has to contribute around the house and it is not the responsibility of the six and nine year old to pick up the slack?\n\n",

And yet he still says that he uses it in a different way and that relationships are based on trust and that i’m to blame for not trusting, but decided to delete so that could make me feel better.\nMonths later, he is caught using his account, a friend of mine showed me a match and a conversation with him, he’s actually looking for friends (i read the conversation) and after a few days he deleted.\nAfter hearing that, i chose not to talk in the day i found out, tried to calm myself down before talking to him, and after 3 days of not sleeping well we went to sleep together, and at the middle of the night (4am) i couldn’t hold it anymore, woke him up and we had a calm conversation, where he acted a lot nervous, tried to lie at the beginning but he was cornered, then briefly apologised and started to blame me for holding this much time not sleeping well instead of talking to him at the time, and waking him up really late.\n\nMore details:\n-He’s my first boyfriend, we’ve been together for 9 months already, have plans on spending christmas and new years eve with my family and have a trip planned to cancun.\n\nIf I’m TA: what do you people suggest that i can do to help it?\nIf he’s being TA: how can i talk to him out of it? It really bugs me, he says that i need to just trust him, i do, but i feel that he first needs to give me reason to trust, like, i don’t know... a facebook relationship status with me (he says that these statuses are stupid and even with me saying that i would feel better he doesn’t want it)\n\n... i need to trust that he’s not looking for someone else... because he should first break up with me before doing that...\nIs there anything i could do/say so that our relationship becomes better?\n\n(Sorry about the english, it’s not my first language)\n",

      "description": "To cut a long story short. I live with one of my bestfriends. We've been friends for years and been through a lot of shit together. Ive realised recently that ive started to have feelings for her. I told her my feelings and she said she didn't feel the same. I was bummed out but thought I could get past it. We do everything with eachother and im the only person she really hangs around with when shes not at work. \n\nFast forward to yesterday and she tells me shes going out on a date. My heart fell into my stomach and I realised I can't really continue doing this. Its not healthy for me. Ive decided to go back to my parents for a few weeks to sort myself out but i feel like ive just sort of ditched her and I feel awful about it. She described me as \"her person\" and that she doesnt know what shes going to do without me. Shes not doing great at the moment and I feel like im letting her down. I know shes upset that im going and when we said goodbye it was really hard.  We were both struggling not to cry. I just feel like an asshole for ditching her like that due to my feelings towards her. Shes loosing her bestfriend and shes done nothing wrong. \n\nI just feel awful. \n",

      "title": "AITA for supposedly ruining my girlfriends big moment after she received a prestigious scholarship?",
      "description": "My girlfriend and I are in our early 20’s and have been together for 6 months. A few days ago she found out she was selected as a Fulbright finalist and will be moving to Europe in August for 10 months. I’m extremely proud of her and I’m happy that she’s fulfilling her dreams but I can’t help but feel a little sad that she’s leaving. I’ve been trying my best to keep those feelings contained and to just be happy for her but it’s been a little difficult and I’ve sort of been distant with her these past few days. \n\nLast night we were at a bar celebrating this girls birthday party but also kind of celebrating my girlfriends huge achievement. Long story short, she started posting on Instagram and Snapchat right next to me about how she’ll be living in Europe in a few months and will meet one of her friends in Paris. I didn’t say anything but having her flaunt that in my face when she knows it’s a sensitive subject brought down my mood and made me shut down. She then went to the bathroom so I got on my phone for a little bit and was still on it when she came back because I was reading something. Admittedly, I didn’t really feel like talking at that moment and the phone was my escape but I couldn’t have been on there for more then 5 minutes after she came back. She then told me I looked miserable and to go home if I was having such a bad time. I told her I wasn’t having a bad time and I was here for her. I questioned why she was upset and she kept telling me to just go home because I looked miserable but I said no. She said she was leaving and Ubering home then and as I followed her out of the bar she kept turning around telling me to stop following her. She got in her Uber outside and called out to me saying “BABE” implying she wanted me to follow her and get in the car but I just said “No, I’m not going with you” so she gave me the middle finger and took off. That last bit made me upset and I texted her afterwards asking what the problem was and said that this wasn’t some game where she runs away and I immediately go chasing after her. She said I looked miserable when I was on my phone and humiliated her because I couldn’t even hold a conversation. Today we talked about it more and she says that she’s incredibly hurt because it’s unfair for her to have to censor her excitement around me. She says my excitement for her isn’t genuine and that I say all the right things but don’t mean them. She says she understands that I’m sad but if the roles were reversed she would at least make sure I felt celebrated and excited first and foremost and that after the celebration we would start having those conversations about how she’s feeling. In response I said, “If it was me getting a huge award I would like to celebrate with you but I would try to avoid flaunting it in your face until we’ve really talked about it. I’d know that something this big is obviously a good thing but it affects you too as my girlfriend so I’d try to be aware of your feelings.”\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for driving in the left lane of the interstate, and briefly using my brights?",
      "description": "I had an hour long drive home from a flight, mostly on an interstate through countryside in the dark. I typically drive 5 mph over the speed limit, but I'll often speed up when passing other cars. Most cars were driving a little slower and no one was in the left lane, so I got in the left lane to pass them slowly (I sped up a little). Eventually, a car flashed its brights at me from a distance behind me. I responded by speeding up a bit more (to about 8-9 mph over the speed limit), and looking for a gap in the right lane.\n\nI soon found a small gap, where I pulled into that lane to give him a brief opportunity to pass me, but I reentered the left lane because I reached the end of that gap before he even caught up with me. When he caught up, he flashed me multiple times, as I was looking for another gap in the right lane.\n\nWhen I found a longer gap, I pulled into the right lane again, and he passed me. As he passed, I looked at him to judge him, which he hard countered by flipping me off.\n\nI might have overreacted, because he had the gall to flash his brights repeatedly AND flip me off, even though I was trying to be accommodating. I thought he felt entitled to have the passing lane to himself. After he passed, I left my brights on a for a few seconds to push back against his behavior (I figured it was justified, since he flashed me repeatedly). He responded by break checking me.\n\nAt that point, I gave up because I felt that he was playing a game of chicken at dangerous speeds. I saw/memorized his license plate in case he escalated further, but he soon took his exit. I regretted using my brights, and it was kind of a wakeup call about how dangerous people can be on the road.\n\nAITA for getting in his way / responding with my brights? Is there any safe / appropriate way to push back against bad behavior on the road, or is no response the best response?",

I began to drive through the intersection (same direction as the pedestrians crossing with the crossing guard) and a woman walking dogs proceeds in front of my vehicle and then starts yelling at me for going and almost hitting her. I yelled back \"there's a crossing guard you need to follow\" and she yells back \"I'm not part of the school\" like she doesn't need to respect the crossing guard. There are people at all other corners respecting the crossing guard guidance. \n\nWas I wrong in proceeding consistent with the crossing guard or should I have assumed that the lady walking dogs doesn't need to follow the crossing guard and was going to walk out in front of me?

      "description": "I have a friend who ever since middle school I have been taking care of them. If they wanted a late night phone call, I picked up. If they were hungry, I bought or made them food. I drove them all over the place, spent more time with them than anyone else (mainly because they would throw a fit if I hung out with others without them even though we hung out alone more than anyone). I spent a lot of time an energy on this person but never seemed to have it reciprocated. They would constantly bring up my past mistakes and hold them against me, criticize my thoughts or opinions, and never as far as I can remember pay me back or say thank you for the transportation or food... but I never held it against them. \n\n2 years ago I was moving out of the country but was on not so great terms with my parents. the move was pretty unexpected and my parents were not equipped to see me leave. I was sharing and paying for a storage unit with them up until then but they said I could either take my stuff or throw it out. They were intending moving it all to another smaller unit. I ended up throwing a lot out (and giving a lot to said friend). A few choice items that were too important to throw out but would be way too expensive to ship, I was able to leave at the house of above mentioned friends parents. I was really thankful for this and told them if they wanted to use any of the stuff they were more than welcome, I just wanted it back when I either found the money to move it or found the room to store it. They chose to use some but leave most at their parents house.\nFast forward a year or so later, I'm on way better terms with my parents now. I visit them a few times a year and always try to make time to visit my friends. My parents knew I had some stuff stored at friends parents house, and told me they would be happy to store it for me so it's easier to grab whenever I need it.\n\n I tried to contact my friend to ask when would be a good time for them and their parents for us to go and get it and  me to move it to my parents place, but they left me on read. This was really concerning since they had mentioned their parents were planning on moving and I didnt want to burden them with the extra stuff. This was 6 months ago. They replied to a different message about a trip we were planning, where they wanted to cancel, and never acknowledged the message. By that time I was gone so I couldn't take care of it anyway, and let it slide.\n\nRecently I've discovered that a lot of my old friends will not reply to me. Especially this one individual, they will either leave me on read for days or outright refuse to reply. I've reached out multiple times through social media or postcards, with no or if I'm lucky a long awaited reply. It's really gotten to me. The only friend I have left who isnt ignoring me happened to be their roommate, who I fully intend to try and maintain a friendship with. \n\nBecause of the lack of communication, and constantly being taken advantage of or emotionally manipulated throughout our entire friendship, I fully intend to cut this individual out of my life. I really tried to keep them in my life, but it feels like I'm trying to hold on too much to the friendship and its hurting me a lot. After I get my stuff back. But it's gotten to the point where I feel like I need to tell them I'm going on X day at X time to get my stuff and if they want to come they can but I need it back sooner than later (if ever at all). This upcoming trip is my last chance where I will have the free time and resources to move the items. I'm not asking for their help in moving the items, I just want to be able to take them to my parents unit, especially if her parents are still planning on moving. \n\nWIBTA if I took my stuff back (with or without them there) and cut them out of my life?",

I'm also on mobile, so I apologize for any formatting issues.\n\nJust for some background, I am up to date on all my vaccines, including MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella). However, despite being vaccinated against measles, vaccinated adults still have about a 3% chance of getting infected (although in their case it won't be nearly as bad as for those that are not vaccinated). \n\nRecently, I have been one of those 3% that has contracted measles. I've stayed inside the house to limit my contact with people who may be immunocompromised. \n\nIt's also important to note that I spent about an hour together hanging out with this guy before my symptoms started, so he may be infected as well. He is not vaccinated as his father does not \"believe\" in them and he has gotten through school being unvaccinated due to \"religious reasons.\" \n\nWhen I told him I thought I had the measles today, he admitted this to me. I told him there are ways he can get vaccinated without his father knowing and he seems to not care and is being incredibly patronizing and defensive.  All I told him was that it would be beneficial to the common good if he were to contribute to herd immunity.\n\nSo, am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So I am currently dealing with the blowback (pun intended) of my actions last night. Not to worry, this will be short.\n\n\nLast night my girlfriend and had just got done watching christmas movies and drinking hot chocolate. The apartment was full of good Christmas vibes. After finishing our hot chocolate, we noticed it was getting a bit late and so we decided to hit the sack. \n\n\nNow in bed, we started spooning. I being the big spoon and her the little spoon. This was probably the most comfortable spooning sesh to date in our relationship and I was on the cusp of falling asleep when I hear my girlfriend say: “uh oh, i have to toot.” I immediately told her to turn the other way. She did not and fired away. Good thing it was a small one, but still, kinda gross. Instead of getting mad, I brushed it off and went back to spooning. Not 2 minutes passed and she says: “uh oh,  I have to toot again” and fired away. \n\n\nAt this point, I was like “what the hell!?” She barely gave me enough time to react and so I got hit by this one full forced. Also, this fart was bigger than the last and she was giggling at me while I was freaking out/trying to escape the blast zone. \n\nWhile trying to escape the smell, naturally, a bible verse popped into my head. “Do unto others as you would have them do to you” .  So I turned my ass canon towards my girlfriend and fired off a triumphant fart with impressive force. Little did I know, she had turned around towards me at the exact moment and received that monstrosity in the face. She instantly gets mad at me for farting in her face and ran to the bathroom pissed off. She eventually comes back but won’t talk to me.\n\n\nThis morning she tries to give me shit about “disrespecting” her and I respond with “If you can’t play with the big dogs, stay on the porch.” \n\n\nReddit, AITA??\n\n\n",

      "description": "I’ll keep it short: My ex and I divorced a few years ago after about 2 years of marriage. Recently going through my basement and found her old photo albums, these were her childhood and teenage pictures (she must have forgotten about them when she moved out). Without thinking I put them in the “throw away” pile (I was cleaning out old and unneeded stuff) and these got sent to the dump. \n\nThinking about it now: was I an asshole for doing that? We haven’t spoken since the divorce so I wouldn’t want to contact her about the albums anyway.  Also our marriage ended badly (she was unfaithful and demanded a lot in divorce settlement despite it being a short marriage). \n\nBut these were her childhood pictures. Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "Buckle up. Long Story Time!   \n\n\nI (22 Year old Female) used to work at a bank as an Audio Visual technician, and our Team Lead left, leaving a spot to fill. Instead of hiring a new Lead, they promoted me, and found a new technician (36 Year old Male, Married, 2 Year old Daughter) to fill my job role. \n\nAs the new lead, I was in charge of training this new tech, who had no prior experience in AV, so I went back to basics, and essentially went real slow with the training and explaining everything fully. I thought I was being careful and considerate by really being thorough, BOY I was wrong. \n\nWe'd gone into the storage room to sort through some old kit that needed to be thrown away. He picked up a bunch of cables, and just threw them straight into the recycle box. I politely asked him why he did that, and he just said they need to be thrown. He hadn't even looked at what cables they were. I've literally turned round and said \"Don't be so ignorant, separate the cables out and test them before you just thrown them away. They could still be useful\". No word of lie, hes gone fucking bonkers at me.. \"Stop talking to me as if I am stupid. I am a 36 Year Old Man, with a respectable job, a loving wife and a 2 Year old daughter. I do NOT need to take orders from a self-involved 22 year old woman who thinks she can boss me round\". Oh boy. I lost the plot. I've only gone and literally shouted at the top of my lungs \"Don't talk to me as if I am a fucking baby\". Safe to say, everyone and their mum heard in the office. \n\nI took a step back from training him from this point. I couldn't be asked to deal with someone so highly strung that they thought the world evolved round him, so I assigned one of the other AV techs (a man) the task of training him. A couple days later I was approached by this tech and he asked if we could speak privately. He explained to me that this nut job had spent the last few days bitching the hell about me.. \"She's a woman, I don't need to take orders from her. She's young enough to be my daughter. She's stupid. She's blonde. Who the fuck put her in charge\" You name the insult, he said it about me.   \n\n\nI spoke to my Account Manager and he was moved to Hardware, and a week later, he was removed from site entirely.   \n\n\nNo one ever really confirmed to me whether I was the reason he was removed from site, but a week after he was removed from site I heard that he was raising a complaint about me in the workplace. \"Unfair dismissal\" he said.   \n\n\nI got my account manager and colleague to vouch that this guy was a basic bitch nut job, and we heard nothing since.   \n\n\nSo my question is, AITA for getting this man fired?

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. \n\nBackground: two weeks ago I found out my girlfriend of 5 years has been cheating on me with her much older supervisor. It is devastating because I'm getting my masters in engineering, have a job lined up at an almost Fortune 500 company, I'm in good shape and decent looking and she's been fucking the out of shape alcoholic manager at Applebee's. My self esteem is shit right now.\n\nMy friends decided to take me to a strip club last night and I was finally having a good time. I really likes one dancer and my friends bought me a couple of table dances with her. She asked if I wanted to go VIP and I told her I didn't have much money. She said don't worry about that my friends told her I was having a hard time with a break up and she just wanted to chill anyways. So we wend back to an essentially private area. She danced for me and I gave her the $100 I had but after that we just sat and talked for maybe 30 minutes and then she kissed me and we made out for maybe like 45 minutes. When she first kissed me I told her I didn't have any more money and she told me to paraphrase \"I'm a 20 year old college girl, I like to kiss cute boys.\" It was an incredible experience and it felt amazing to just not think about my ex for a few hours. \n\nThe club was closing and I asked her if I could see her again, she said she had to change and I should wait for her in the parking lot. My friends told me she was just messing with me and all left. I waited for about an hour and she never came out. Using some stuff she told me I was able to triangulate her Instagram and tried to send her a message. She instantly blocked me.\n\nI got an uber and met my friends at Waffle House and they are being so harsh saying that she wasn't really into me and I told them I didn't give her that much money and what she said about me being cute. They say that she was like a drug dealer and offering me the first \"hit\" for cheap to keep me coming back where I'll start spending real money and maybe even she was a prostitute and that's why she blocked me oh instragram and why she never came out. Basically they say she played me like an asshole. I want to go back tonight and try to explain to her I'm not a creep and I just had a nice time. My friends say I'd be a real asshole then as she'd call the cops on me or worse see me as a sad puppy dog with a well paying internship and want to bleed me dry. \n\nI've been through so much turmoil over the past few weeks I don't even know which way is up so am I the asshole?

      "description": "I have a friend who I go on holidays with and is great in so many ways..  kind, caring and great fun. However when she knows there is a trip I wouldn't be interested in going on she will ask me to go with her and then when there/ very close to the time switch what we had agreed to do. For example she knows when I travel I like to take my time and see a country... she asked me to spend 8 weeks with her in Vietnam. On the first day she said her friends told her 8 weeks was too much and we should go to Thailand and Cambodia is well. I  (gay male 31) have lots of other friends I travel with while she  (33 straight female) complains all her friends are married with kids. I felt bad leaving them alone and also didn't want to spend a month by myself. We had an okay time but stayed where she wanted to stay and did what she wanted to do 90% of the time. This was two summer's okay. This summer she asked me to spend two days with her in Ljubljana.  I said yes thinking it would be short and sweet. She asked if I wanted to go canyoning while there.. I agreed not knowing it was in lake bled nearly two hours away! I never would have agreed if I knew it wasn't near the city and I'm sure she knew this! We had an ok time but I was a bit annoyed.... but I'm an idiot and let it happen again. I live in munich and she asked to visit me and go skiing for one day in a town nearby. I agreed and changed my flights to return from Xmas early... once the flight was booked she invited two other friends and planned to stay in a ski lodge 4 hours away from munich at a cost of 700 euro! At that stage I questioned myself but because I was busy at work agreed... today on the trip I asked her did she suggest munich because she knew I would say no to the 4 day trip( she had asked me previously to go skiing for 3 days and I said no.) I am pretty sure she knew I would have not agreed to the other of the two trips if she been honest about what they were. Am I the asshole for thinking this? Also I have suggested  and offer she goes on trips I planned but she never wants to go unless it's where she wants to go...",

We met twice, but after the second time, I entered senior year in high school and shit hit the fan.\n\nLong distance is a fucking chore, even when you love each other as much as we did, and since I am in regular school + the IB + Physics and Match, since I wanna follow my dream of becoming a theoretical physicist, I just didn’t have the time anymore. I told her that we should break up, we did, she took some time, but we talked again and it was fine. We still told each other we love each other and stuff, but the only reason we aren’t dating is distance.\n\nShe had a lot of problems in her life, mad abandonment issues from both her parents, and overall was treated like shit by everyone, and said to me constantly that I am the best thing to ever happen to her. She was super needy as well, and i absolutely loved it, and helped her always. \n\nLast month, my mental had been going boom, applying to uni and getting predicteds and not failing school and my dad losing his job, it’s been nuts. And 5 weeks ago, she completely disappeared. No phone, no instagram, no snap, nothing. Knowing she was depressive, and last time we talked she began by saying that she had a panick attack and looked at pictures of me to relieve it, I was fucking worried. I had seen she had been active in Instagram but not replying to me, so I started getting suspicious.\n\nI called a friend if hers to talk 2 her in person to see if she was ok. That day she comes and texts me “Whoops I lost my phone. How r u?” This ain’t the girl I know and love. Something clearly changed. I ask what happened, I was worried sick, and was feeling like shit, she replied that she lost her phone but it was “all good now, don’t worry.” And left. I’m fuming. She clearly changed, i ask about it, she says “yeah, I did. Im happy know.” Still no ducks given about what happened to me last month. I lose it, tell her “I don’t know who the fuck you are, but you aren’t the NAME OF GIRL that I love. I’m done” all I saw was “sorry, i love you, talk to meee...” as I deleted my Snapchat. She cannot and has not talked to me since. Also deleted our pics on Instagram, where she has been on. I feel like I hit her in exactly the point she hurts the most, and may have overreacted. I hope I didn’t hit her too hard, though. AITA?",

      "description": "Sorry if the title is kind of misleading, I'm not sure how to cram this situation into a sentence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work at a small grocery store behind the deli counter. I'm one of the few who switches between morning and night shifts, as I'm trained for both routines. There's not a lot of people who work in the department, probably around 10 total. Because of this, usually someone will work until a certain time and then someone else comes in to take that person's place.\n\nNow, I have this one coworker I'll refer to as \\[REDACTED\\]. \\[REDACTED\\] is always late. Always. That's not an exaggeration. Every. Single. Shift. He runs from 15-30 minutes late. I'm not sure why. I would think if there's a problem that causes him to be late he would had fixed it by now so I'm just assuming he doesn't care. The only reason why he isn't fired yet is because he's one of the 3 people who knows how to close down the department fully and does it the best.\n\nAnyways, this Sunday I was working a whopping 11 hour shift from 5am-4pm because a good amount of staff are college students and are taking spring break off to go back home/see family/ect.  I wasn't super excited because that's 10 1/2 hours on my feet (only get one 30 minute break) and my longest shift I've ever worked in any of my jobs. I also have bad insomnia so a opening shift means probably 4 hours of sleep for me.\n\nAs the end of my shift was (thankfully) approaching, I ran over to the schedule to see who was taking over for me. It's \\[REDACTED\\].  A bit later it gets to 4pm (the time I was scheduled to leave) and to no one's surprise, \\[REDACTED\\]'s no where in sight. At this point my feet feel like they're withering away from the pain of being on my feet since 5 that morning and I'm seriously debating cutting off my feet as I'm sure that would hurt less than the state of my feet in that moment.\n\nAt roughly 4:20 (hehehehe) and STILL no sign of \\[REDACTED\\], I go over to one of my coworkers and say \"Fuck this, I'm leaving\". He starts to say something but I speedwalk toward the terminal and clock out, grab my jacket and backpack, and book it out of there, too emotionally and psychically exhausted to deal with anyone else.\n\n2 days later I come back into work and my coworker I talked to before practically running out of there was working.  He comes up to me and basically says what I did was a dick move and I need to wait for \\[REDACTED\\] or whoever's coming to replace me before leaving. I argued that I would normally wait but 1) I worked a 11 hour shift that day and 2) \\[REDACTED\\] is always late, and, to be frank, that's not my problem. He didn't have a comeback after that but was still pretty rude and blunt to me the rest of the shift, as well as another one of my coworkers who saw me rush out of there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then I've been probably overthinking this and feel pretty guilty. But Reddit, AITA??\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Happened about a month ago and my friend is still angry with me for it. I graduated college last spring and moved back home but my long term girlfriend and big friend group still live near the school. I was visiting because my girlfriend's birthday was on that Saturday. \n\nLate Friday night my friend (we'll call him Joe) who lives there texted me saying he has something very serious to tell me and wanted me to call him in the morning. He kept texting me about how its really serious and I started to worry. I wanted him to just call me and tell me that night but he kept saying he wanted to wait for the morning. He assured me no one was in immediate danger and that it could in fact wait til morning. \n\nJoe lives a street over from my girlfriend in a sorority house, as he's subletting from a girl studying abroad. Due to some previous history my girlfriend does not like when I go to that sorority house, so I usually try to meet up with Joe at our other friends house. \n\nWhen Joe realized I was in the area he instead wanted me to go over to his house in the morning so he could tell me in person instead of over the phone like he originally planned. This morning was the morning of my girlfriends birthday, and I had a long and exciting day planned for us. I did not want to start the day off on the wrong foot by immediately leaving in the morning to go see my friend in the sorority house, so I instead called him like we originally planned. He told me the news, which was admittedly very serious. A mutual friend of ours has been inflicting self harm and Joe wanted to make sure I knew so I could help be there for our mutual friend. The phone call lasted about 8 minutes, in which Joe explained the situation. \n\nJoe is still mad at me because I was prioritizing my girlfriend on her birthday, but the original plan was for him to call me anyway. I didn't think it would be such a big deal if it was over the phone instead of in person especially after Joe said no one was in immediate harm but he still thinks it was a crappy thing for me to do.

I said no, and she followed up by asking if I cared.\n\nI responded no again, as after 16 years of being suffocated with Christmas for about 3 months a year I'm pretty done with the holiday (don't even ask for gifts anymore). She asked who she did the work (decorating and whatnot) for if not for me and my siblings.\n\nI responded that I always thought she did it for herself (she was raised a Jehovah's Witness and never got to celebrate Christmas as a kid) She stomped off to another room and started sobbing, muttering about how rude I am, and eventually came back in to call me a \"Fucking asshole\" and asking why I would ever think she celebrated Christmas for herself.\n\nI responded by stating that she has mentioned multiple times that she loved Christmas because she never got to celebrate it. She states that she celebrated Christmas so my siblings and I could have what she never did and proceeds into a long rant about how I'm so self absorbed, so rude, and how I don't deserve anything I own. I simply remain quiet, as frankly I don't know how to respond at this point. Eventually she starts talking about things other than Christmas, like my education, my upbringing, and a whole lot of other things that I feel have nothing to do with the situation. At this point I try to respond, but get cut off, so I simply remove myself from the situation.\n\n She has since stormed into the room, thrown papers relating to how my school handles absences (She had a direct influence on the current rules due to a situation from a year ago) While I tried to respond that I never said she did everything for her, she stormed back out of the room sobbing again.\n\nAm I the asshole for being tired of Christmas celebrations?",

      "description": "This happened almost a year ago, and is very lighthearted, and neither of us were mad for more than the night, but I think we both consider the other as the asshole in this story, so I will try to tell it with as little bias as possible. \n\nTo set the scene, we were both out with his family shopping for cool, vintage antique items that day, and my boyfriend (let's call him Henry) found an old vinyl that he was really excited about. We purchased it and continued having a great day with his family. Towards the end of the night, his family dropped us off at a bar so they could drive home and we could hang out with some of our friends.\n\nI had purchased some other item that day and was already carrying it, so I offered to carry the vinyl in the same bag so that Henry could have his hands free. We had a couple drinks with our friends, and we were both a little tipsy, not drunk. At some point, our group found its way to the basement portion of the bar. \n\nThis is where the incident begins. Henry and I decide to go down stairs since most of our group had ended up there. As we were walking, I slipped on (3rd-4th from the bottom) a stair and slid all the way down to the bottom. I slipped because the stairs were wet, and not because I was tipsy. I was a bit shaken, and Henry pulled me to my feet and asked if I was ok. I nodded; my butt hurt but I didn't want to make a big deal and I was a little shaken and my ego was hurt. The next question out of Henry's mouth was, \"Did you break my record?\"\n\nThe second he said that, I was furious. I had just fallen, and he was concerned about the record. Looking at it from his perspective, I'm guessing he felt that he had asked if I was ok, and asking about the record was the next logical thing. The record had snapped in half, and he was visibly disappointed. We both got into a bit of a squabble, raising our voices at each other. I was angry that he seemed more concerned about the record than my well being. He was angry that I had just broken his new, very cool record (I clearly wasn't really hurt so we were past that). \n\nAngry me decided to pull out my phone and start calling my uber because I didn't like being yelled at in a bar. Angry him was angry that I'd try to leave just like that without even saying anything. We both quickly said bye to our friends and got the uber and went home, where we stewed at decided to put this silly incident behind us.\n\nI later replaced the record (which I would have done as soon as I realized it was broken), and there were no hard feelings. Its a silly story, but AITA for slipping, breaking the record, and being upset that Henry was upset that the record broke?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Yesterday she picks me up for work and tells me that she's pregnant with his child but plans on a boarding it without telling him. Pro-life or pro-choice aside I am a firm believer that a man has the right to know that he has a potential child before the decision to abort it takes place. She then tells me that the only reason she's not telling him is because she knows he will want her to keep it. Now I know it's technically none of my business but then again she kind of made it my business when she told me regardless of that I think her reason for not telling him is bullshit, so I told him... it didn't end well",

I live close to my college's campus, which is about a 3 hour drive to my parents' house.\n\nAnyway, I'm on spring break this week and I've been staying here for 3 days so far. I was planning on leaving Thursday afternoon after lunch, but after discovering it's supposed to storm for most of the day on Thursday I thought it would be best for me to leave on Wednesday. I'm working on Friday morning, so I couldn't leave that day. Driving while it's raining makes me very anxious, and I'd rather avoid it. Plus, I'd really like to spend some time relaxing at home before I have to start classes again.\n\nMy parents were pretty upset when I announced that I wanted to leave a day earlier than I originally planned. My mom told me that I should just call off work and stay a day later, which I definitely DON'T want to do because it's an internship and I already committed. I just started recently and I don't want to get on their bad side.\n\nNow they're checking different weather sites and trying to convince me that it'll only be on-off storms or it won't be raining anymore at a certain location on my route after an hour of driving and stuff, and it'll actually be safer for me to leave on Thursday instead of Wednesday, even though it's not supposed to rain anywhere on my route on Wednesday. After all that, I told them that I'll be leaving on Wednesday, and if they want to visit with me more then they can come visit me.\n\nAITA for refusing to stay longer?",

      "description": "Throwaway because my main account is easily traceable to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say might have cheated, because that's grey area. It's kind of a long story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n%%Establishing some background info and the setting\n\nI  (M 18) left my girlfriend (17, now ex) in August to go off to college and do my thing. We attempted long distance, and it had its strains. Ultimately, I still maintained my strong feelings for her, and it seemed she maintained her feelings for me. She started working at a small restaurant and I started working as a tutor. Her place of work was far-ish away, so she'd often ask me to buy her an uber to get her to work if she couldn't make the bus (she didn't drive). She'd often do things that made me uncomfortable (her going to frat parties when she's not even in college yet, getting high with my friend \"Evan\" and driving around), and I'd bring it up with her but she'd end up getting mad. Not trying to be controlling, I backed off. This was fairly frequent. My friends at school suspected they had a thing going, but I trusted both of them. Important note: I have known Evan for 10 years, he's only known my GF for a little less than I had known her, but they became quick friends. Because of this, I'd often ask Evan to mediate some issues or to give me my GFs opinions on things when she was mad at me and refused to talk to me. But I digress. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months pass and I get four days of break to fly back home. She's completely cold, despite the warmth she'd shown me just hours before when talking on the phone. I get worried and admittedly kind of clingy, and try to figure out what was going on. Me, her, and Evan hang out and do our stuff. I asked Evan what he thought of it, and he kind of got mad at me for always going to him for his opinion on my relationship. My GF says she want's to take a break, saying \"We'll still be dating, but we just won't have the romantic part of it.\" I reluctantly agree, because I still have feelings for her. I fly back to school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still tells me \"I love you\" and all in all it seems nothing has changed and that we weren't even on a break. Once she started telling me she loved me I figured that the \"No romantic part\" was rescinded and told her how I felt and how I don't like breaks in a long text, which in retrospect was seriously cringey and weird. She breaks up with me a week after the break starts, but tells me she \"Doesn't want me to move on\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe still talk everyday after the breakup, she still tells me she loves me, and I still have feelings for her, but when I express those feelings she gets mad at me. (Side note, I'm still ubering her to and from work, to the point where almost all of my tutoring money is going to that). About a week later I tell her to stop sending mixed messages, to which she calls me a child. We decide to stop talking to each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n%Get to the AITA already!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after that incident, plagued with many negative emotions, I log into her snapchat and look at the messages between her and her friend. What I learned is that she had slept with her manager (M19) two days after we took the break/five days before she actually broke up with me. She had also been telling her friends that we were broken up months before the fact. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ask Evan, despite what he told me a month earlier. He gets mad at me for logging into her snapchat and says it wasn't cheating because it was a break (This is the grey area I referred to). I confront my ex about it but I honestly don't even remember what she told me. Cut off all contact with her since then. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for logging into her snap for this info? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n%AITA Part two:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen talking to Evan about it, he kept defending her. All the information he was getting about what had happened in the months prior was coming from her. He didn't bother to ask for my side of the story once. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell Evan about the shit my ex talked about him behind his back. He called me a piece of shit for lying, but then said he didn't care when I showed him evidence. I asked why he was getting so angry with me and asked if it was because he had feelings for her (he clearly did, but he denied it). He has not talked to me since. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for bringing this up with, and accusing my (now former) friend of having feelings for my ex? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n%Additional info\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see now she was kind of manipulative and I was kind of clingy. She accused me of trying to \"Buy her love,\" despite the most expensive thing I got her was a $150 piece of shit laptop so she wouldn't have to use her brother's to do homework.  Second most expensive thing was a $10 book (or ubers, but she requested those). The relationship was an overall train wreck, but of course I didn't see that when I was in it. ",

      "description": "I was just reminded of this and I thought I would get the reddit opinion on this. Names have been changed for obvious reasons. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nAbout 5 years ago I was in a pretty crappy living situation. I was living in the basement of my friend Beth's house. My other friend, Alex, also rented a room there. At first things were good, but eventually went sour. There are many facets to that story, but two main points stick out. \n\nBefore I moved in,  there had been some water damage in the basement. The damage was repaired, but half of it still needed some drywall mudding and painting, which I offered to do as I had done this type of work at my last job. Apparently, Beth mistook my offer to paint as an offer to not only do the work, but also pay for all the paint and other materials and tools needed, to which I disagreed. Needless to say, this caused some resentment from her and it never got done. \n\nThings came to a head when Beth got a new girlfriend who was staying over every weekend with her kids. I had no problem with this as the new GF was great and I got on well with her kids. The issue was that Beth wanted to up my rent be cause the bills were going up. I obviously refused. Eventually, I decided to make other arrangements and moved out.\n\nThis part is the relevant part. Normal tenant laws in my province require 60 days notice. Legally, as a lodger, I wasn't obligated to give any notice. However, not wanted to bail on her, I gave her the 60 days notice. I found a new place within a few weeks at another friends place and decided to move immediately, as waiting the 60 days would put the move right at Christmas/New Years. Even though I left a month early, I paid Beth for that month as agreed. So I paid for a month of rent when I wasn't living there so as not to screw over Beth. \n\nNow, Alex was also having similar issues with Beth in regards to the living situation. A few months later, Alex's boyfriend Doug bought a house. They had a spare room and she offer to let me rent it for cheap. I agreed, as I had no problem living with Alex and I worked with her boyfriend so we could carpool. This is when things got weird. I was great friends with Alex while we were living together. But now that it was technically 'her' place, she got strangely obsessive about things. It got to the point where I was relegated to the bathroom in the basement and wasn't even allowed to leave my shoes in the mudroom, I had to take them off and carry them up to my room. Due to all the animosity Alex created by her treatment of me, we had obviously grown distant. By the last few months I would come home and hole up in my room as it was awkward to be around her.\n\nDuring all this, I got a promotion that almost doubled my salary, so I decided to move out. I told Alex and Doug at the end of July that I was looking for my own place and just wanted to give them notice. Again, I don't have any legal obligation as a lodger to give notice, but I don't want to just abandon them. My exact words were \"I've decided to get my own place in the next couple months, I just wanted to let you know\". Alex said \"okay\". That was the extent of the conversation. \n\nAs I said, I carpooled with Doug. I told him everyday about the apartment search. Within 2 weeks I had found a place, payed my deposit, as was set to move in for September 1st. Again, Doug, was aware about the progress of my home hunt, and my move date, the whole way through. Due to me avoiding Alex and our different work schedules, she wasn't involved in any of these conversations. Remember, he is the only one on the mortgage, not her. \n\nSo, a week before I move out, Alex confronts me and says \"Doug told me you are moving out next week, that's not enough notice!\". I explain that I told them two months ago and Doug has been kept up to speed through the whole process. She claims the conversation two months ago was just letting them know that I was looking for a place, that it wasn't a set date and that it didn't count as notice. She said that I am screwing them over and that I should have given written notice. I calmly explain that I am legally not required to give any notice, and that I still gave them notice for the very reason of not screwing them over. \n\nShe then claimed that I did the same thing to Beth last year and left early. I reminded her that even though I left, I still paid for the month of my notice period. She still claims I was an asshole for leaving early. I point out that the whole point of notice is due to the financial issues. If she got paid, what does it matter whether I am physically there or not? Again, \"I was a dick for leaving early\". Doug contributed nothing to this argument, even though he knew everything and it was his house, not hers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I agreed that the original conversation wasn't a firm \"I am moving out on this date\", but I did say a couple of months. AITA here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Rented a spare room from a friend. Told my friend that I was planning on moving out \"in a couple of months\". When the date came, she said I didn't give proper notice and that I should have given it in writing, even though I wasn't legally obliged to give any notice as a lodger.",

      "description": "So this actually happened about 4 and a half years ago but I've been thinking of it recently because I ran into my friends mom not too long ago. \n\nSo my I had this friend \"Tessa\" that I had known basically since childhood. We'd hang out after school, we had multiple classes together and we'd even give each other rides to school. I think all of our freshman year of high school we gave her a ride there.\n\nAnyways she had been dating a friend of mine but they had recently broken up, and we were hanging out at my apartment and I asked her how she was handling it. \n\nShe mentioned that she had met someone new that was taking her mind off it, but I could tell she wasnt telling me something. When I asked her more about the guy she told me he was older (he was 33ish and she was 21) but I could tell there was more. I figured she just felt bad about moving on from her long time ex so quickly so I told her she could just tell me whatever was on her mind. \n\nThat's when she mentioned that this guy she was seeing was married and had two kids. Not only that, but Tessa mentioned that his wife is the daughter of the owner of the car dealership she worked at. I was completely shocked.\n\nShe mentioned that they had been flirting earlier that year (this happened in October) and that his wife had found out and they went through couples therapy. \n\nI was in complete shock that my best friend had done this. I told Tessa that I thought what she was doing was wrong, and why: she was endangering her job, she was ruining this womans marriage and splitting up these kid's family. She seemed to know it was bad but she really liked this guy and I think she wanted me to tell her to \"follow her heart\"\n\nWe had a bit of an argument about it and neither of us really budged on our opinions. Tessa ended up staying with that guy and he ended up divorcing his wife and moving with Tessa to the other side of the country and I havent heard from her since.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So my friend has been acting weird for a while now. She's been really flirty, sending underwear pics and wanting to spend time with me alone and shit. Basic flirting I guess, but I'm not sure I return the affection or whatever. I find her really attractive, but I've gotten to know her as a friend first and foremost, and this sort of just came out of nowhere. We weren't even that close friends tbh.\n\nAnyway, she kind of caught me on the spot every time she would up and send bra pics, or kissy faces or ask to be alone with me or whatever, so I didn't really flirt back, despite the fact I did enjoy the attention. Anyway, things weren't awkward, but she sort of hung out less around me and my friends.\n\nI had a little party of sorts a few days back, and a mutual friend invited her to go. She was skeptical, saying I had \"trust issues around her\" and that I seemed to dislike her and shit. Completely false btw. She also made small, fairly subtle comments about that I'm unattractive, a week or so after she told me she thought I was hot. \n\nAITA for being confused/annoyed that she's going around talking about trust issues, saying I seem to dislike her, and calling me unattractive, presumably because I didn't respond properly when she started flirting heavily with me?",

      "description": "I’ve been seeing this girl for about two months now, and it’s been kind of casual since neither of us wanted anything more serious. \n\nTwo weeks in I was at her place and was about to sleep there, and her roommate arrived there and, without seeing my face, called me by another guy’s name. I bothered me a little but i let it go, cause I really could not complain about it, because we did not set any boundaries.\n\nThree weeks later she’s at my place (we would see each other once or twice a week) and she found a ribbon in my room that belongs to an ex girlfriend of mine, and asked me about it. I told her the girl should come pick it up, and she asked if she was coming over to pick it up only or if we would hook up, as she wouldn’t mind. Literal words. This part really bothered me, as I assumed little by little we would be going into something more serious because I was starting to really like her.\n\nAfter some days thinking about it I talked to her, and told her that we shouldn’t see each other anymore, because it seems like we had different ideas about the “relation”. I did not get angry nor blame her, as I explained to her that it was entirely me who thought this was going another direction, and simply wanted to break it up before getting hurt by it. During this conversation she admitted about being with other guys while seeing me.\n\nShe then bursted into tears and blamed me for it, since I did not make it clear that i wanted anything more serious, and started make me feel bad by saying I didn’t make and effort to be with her.  For the record, I did not see anybody else during these two months. I am really confused right now.\n\nSorry if bad english, not my first language.",

I told her about it later and she told me she doesn't feel comfortable around him knowing that he said that, and told me she wasn't going to tell me who to be friends with but she'd be more comfortable if I didn't hang out with him anymore outside of big group hang outs either.

      "description": "My SO and I have been together for almost 4 years and have been planning on moving in together. Problem is he lost his job a few months ago and has not been able to find another one.\n\nI graduated earlier this year after going back to school, got a decent job, and have paid off debt while saving to move. During this time, he had to move back home and has been looking for work to no avail.\n\nI had wanted to be moved out by now, but I agreed for us to move in together. But I never realized it would take him so long to find work. Would I be an asshole to move out on my own without him? I have also told my parents I would be out by this point, so I have the added stress of them asking when I'm moving out. I feel in limbo because it depends on my SO's work, or lack thereof.\n\nI worry that if we move together without him having a job, I won't be able to pay all our expenses. And he does have the problem of being a little picky about what the job is.\n\nSo AITA for wanting to move alone?",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom,\n\nSo my Ex(23M) and I(F20) had a 4 year relationship, which was very serious and intense. The reason why I broke up with him is because I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him (he always said I'm his true love and he cant imagine anyone else at his side), also partly because my parents pressured me to leave him, they never explicitly said I should dump him, but they always hinted it. \n\nThen 6 months ago I decided to leave him, I just could not see a future with him and my parents ( I love my family more than anything and can't imagine having to decide between a partner or my family), he was very desperate, tried talking me back to him and making promises I knew he couldn't keep. A few days pass and he shows up around 10:00 looking like sh't and very sad. So we talked it out and he accepted the breakup. Then i blocked him on everything (Instagram, Whatsapp) and the last thing i heard from him was when a mutual friend told me he tried to kill himself (not sure how serious his attempt was)\n\nAnd now recently after 6 months of absolutely no contact another friend told me that he had a new gf, I looked into his Instagram and saw a couple of pictures, and seeing how happy they are hurt me very much. I have decided that I want him back, I know for sure he will take me back and from the looks I can tell that he has matured and grown as a person, that gives me hopes  that our relationship will be better than it was. \n\nSo am I the asshole if I ask him to come back and leave his new Gf? Don't I deserve to be happy aswell?  The love that we had was real, i know it and I feel if i dont act now I will lose him forever :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; BF was crushed after I left him, I now want him back but he has another GF.",

If she wants to do something like she does this saturday, fine, whatever. I'll go, but honestly I've sort of lost any enthusiasm about hanging with her. To be brutally honest, I was drugged and bad things happened to me this New Years. Not pleasant, but shit's been rough, so I guess I'm extra sensitive or something.\n\nAITA for basically checking out of this thing me and her have because she cancelled, basically leaving it up to her with me just sort of going along with it.

      "description": "Some background information; we’ve been dating for over a year now and have been friends for almost three. In the time we’ve known each other, I’ve seen him go through a lot, namely a drug addiction and a slight problem with drinking (though nowhere near as severe as the drugs). We’re currently both second semester freshmen in college and are three hours away from each other. \n\nAfter getting clean around last spring, he didn’t touch anything until he got to college. He went to a few parties during orientation week and then started going out every weekend. After expressing my concern for him drinking again, we came to an agreement that he would cut back on going out. However, after we came to this conclusion, him and his friends stopped going to parties and he told me that he had just stopped drinking. He told me a few times too that he hadn’t done anything in a while. However, I just found out that he had been lying to me and was still getting drunk every weekend in his dorm. This was after he had told me that drinking in the dorm was stupid because my friends do it and he would never. \n\nNow I don’t have a problem with drinking in moderation. However, with his past history, I’m worried that he’ll fall back into old habits and I’ve expressed this to him more than once. It’s why we came to the agreement in the first place. \n\nWhen I found out he was lying, I initially told him I wanted to breakup because I told him early on in our relationship that I don’t tolerate it. However, he apologized and told me he knew he was in the wrong and wanted to fix our relationship, which includes some of the other problems we’ve been having due to the distance. So I then asked him if he would cut back on drinking with his friends while we work on our relationship and regaining trust and then we could discuss coming to a new agreement on his drinking habits. I didn’t ask to be controlling, I did it because I’m afraid that he’s falling back into old habits and after watching his life improve due to him quitting, I don’t ever want to see him back where he was a year ago. \n\nSo, in conclusion, AITA for wanting him to stop drinking until we fix our relationship?",

      "description": "Alright, obligatory stuff first; I'm using a throwaway account obviously\n\nSo first of all I'm going to give you a bit of backstory; as seen in my post history, I recently left an overly-toxic friend group full of people who mocked me constantly(read about it there if interested)\n\nNow, I knew somebody in that group who I'm going to call K for the sake of this story. Now K, back in last year was kicked out the friend group due to a large argument between me and him, I eventually felt bad and hanged out with him until my friend group added him back, in their words for the 'sake of having me back'.\n\nNow, this group was a comedy group and often mocked it's members, however, K always targeted me and used anything I said or did to use against me as a joke ( I have ASD and felt really uncomfortable by this and asked him to stop); I would leave because this never stopped\n\nAfter I left, I at first treated K like a really close friend; until I found out he was being threatened to go against me or get kicked out. After that point, I get more news from friends about him saying stuff about me behind my back such as \\`I'll come crying back soon\\`.\n\nSince then, I ignored his message every day saying \\`Hi ACAG\\` until one day I snapped; messaging him that we're not friends and that friends don't talk about each other behind their backs\n\nNext day, he was **fuming**; talking to another member in the group angrily confused why I blocked him, not having a clue. I then say to him in the first lesson where we are next to each other, to move away from me in other classes or I'll move myself . He seems hurt but nods his head.\n\nHowever, when I get into the lesson, he decided to sit in the exact same spot; when I confront him about it he says \\`I prefer it here\\` and to move myself.\n\nThen comes today, another member of the group T, joins a discord server I'm very active in; and messages me out of the blue(I unfriended him) and this server was the same server I added K to month ago to show him where I'm mostly active. I **freak out** convinced that K sent him it. According to T he researched a game jam I took part in to find the discord. \n\nTherefore, tonight I asked T to leave and he agrees without question and argument ( T hasn't bothered me once ). However, when I tried to ask K he refused until he finds out the real reason I stopped being friends with him\n\n*I'd never actually given him a reason why*\n\nI try to explain what I'd heard and he just carries on probing for details, not believing me until I give up and say \\` Because I'm sick of you, the way you act etc \\` and \\`I genuinely dislike you\\`. It works and he ends up leaving the discord saying that's all he's wanted and that he will move away from me in physics now\n\nWhat I'm wondering is AITA for ghosting this friend; removing him and lying about why?",

      "description": "During math we were doing a math hunt thing  and I tell this kid who likes my kind of humor: \n“Last night a Jewish girl asked me for my number. I told her ‘honey, in this country we use names, not numbers”\nAnd he walks over to the Jewish girl (who he did not know was Jewish)  and tells her the joke. I kept telling him “don’t tell her don’t tell her,” yet he did. She seemed kinda mad but kinda chill at the same time. This is also the 2nd time that she happened, but i have a card up my sleeve: my grandpa was born in a concentration camp in 1941. This entire situation seems fucked now that I’m also writing this. \n\nThis has been weighing on my mind and I’m kinda scared of being in the principals office because like I said, this is strike #2. So am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: tell kid holocaust joke. Kid tells Jewish girl after I tell her not too. Jewish girl is mad at me for 2nd time. ",

She also mentioned that we effectively are creating \"exclusionary zones\" and has caused complaints and also something about political sensitivities of other workers. She also said she didnt care what we said off-duty or off the premises, but while on company groud we would now be required to communicate in English. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow when talking to my other workers about this, one mentioned how he was told by a manager something along the lines of that often we would laugh while talking in Russian, and that other people would feel that us russian speakers are laughing at somebody else .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe never would be in a group conversation with non speakers and just switch to talk in code or to make secret roasts about other people, we mostly talked in russian as its easily for alot of us and for some other workers. my opinion right now is that this is bs and unfair but i am open to discussion",

It absolutely devastated me to say the least.We have a child together so we have to talk. So last night my ex wife calls me to tell me a restaurant we used to like reopened. She says that we should go on a “friend date”. I didn’t say anything initially but I sent her a text shortly after saying “ I will never ever go on a friends date with you. You obviously don’t care but I’m  still dealing with the emotional fallout and will likely be dealing with it for some time”. I threw in the “ obviously don’t care” part because I’ve put up boundaries before yet she fails to respect them. Since my reply, I’ve been name called and all sorts of hurtful shit. To be fair, after she started in I name called back. I shouldn’t have but I did. Still...damn, a simple “ok” from her or nothing at all and I wouldn’t be here. So reddit, AITA?",

She's had a crush on me the majority of the time, and I've returned the feelings several times, but it has never worked out. Now that we got that out of the way, I blocked M on pretty much everything a few hours ago. No warning, just blocked her cold turkey.\n\nI just don't feel that \"spark\", that makes it fun to be with her, and to be completely honest, because of all the will-they-won't-they romantic drama shit, hanging out with her tends to make me anxious. I'm still attracted to her, but because of different views on life (she's going for a college degree, I dropped out 3 years ago at 16) and because of certain personal problems involving my friends, things never work out. \n\nShe's still really into me though, and everytime we hang out she seems to try something, even just innocent shit like holding hands and wanting me to hold her and shit. I'm sick of it, I wanna move on, and when I hang out with her I get this anxiety. So I blocked her. She's been getting on my nerves too. She has emotional issues and acts erratic sometimes (nothing at all severe), and she's a bit clingy. I'm getting seriously annoyed, and I just figured I'd block her and be done with it. AITA here?",

He's a major Trump supporter, build the wall, homeless people are useless, brown people are terrorists, etc. etc. It got to a point where even on statuses that I made that weren't political in nature whatsoever, he would post hateful comments. The breaking point for me was when he replied to something I'd said (I can't even remember what the original post was, honestly) with something like \"that doesn't sound very CHRISTIAN of you.\" and another reply on a different post was randomly \"i'm disappointed in you, baby-killer supporter!\" because he knew I didn't vote for Trump which obviously means I automatically supported Hilary and because she's pro-choice she's a baby killer, right?  \n\n\nThe point being, he did this in front of all of my Facebook friends and other family members. I deleted him and haven't seen his family since then, even though they live in my city.  \n\n\nMy family keeps trying to get me to go see him  with them when they're in town visiting me (\"family is family\"), but I can't bring myself to do it. His wife isn't any better, as she's always making subtly racist posts as well. It makes me anxious, and it makes me feel like I'm betraying my friends for associating with a man that basically hates them and people like them without even know them... Apparently he's been trying to \"apologize\" to me, but he's a grown ass man and I know that even if he did apologize, he's still going to continue being a hateful person. I'm sure you all know someone like this; he's the kind of person that cannot be talked into changing his mind because he thinks anyone younger/less conservative than him is an idiot.  \n\n\nAITA for not trying to keep the peace and appease my family?",

He took me and my cousin off the boat, and took us into a crowded street, getting drunk and eventually losing us in the crowd. He eventually found us, but slurring and clearly hammered. Flash forward about 2-3 years later. I'm like 14 or 15 by now. We're leaving to go visit my nana. Before we're leaving, something reminds me of that night, and I basically start breaking down. In the car, he sees that I'm clearly thinking about something, and asks what's up? I open up about my thoughts from the night in Canada, basically asking if we can possibly talk it out. He gets mad, saying that I should have gotten over it by now, and I'm being stupid, and that \"If I'm gonna act like this, than why should he take me to visit people?!\" I cry the entire drive. We eventually get there, and he tells everyone I'm crying because of something idiotic. I want to know, am I the ass for bringing something like that up that happened that far back, or no? If you want extra details, I'm happy to give them ^^",

      "description": "Hey guys, I am just wondering if I would be the asshole for asking her to stop asking me if I love her. (TLDR at bottom)\n\nA little backstory: my past girlfriend has been cheated on in her last 3 serious relationships. When I first met her I literally fell in love with her day one. We spent 10 hours talking in her car 10pm till 8am. It was crazy. We then spent the next 3 days together hanging out as new friends. After a while of flirting back in forth I asked if we could go on a date. She said no, she didn’t want to be hurt / hurt me. I talked to her for the next month and eventually we started hooking up. After a while she said we had to stop as I kept asking to be in a relationship. We stopped, we tried to stay friends. Didn’t work. The break ended up finally getting us into a relationship, this took 6 months. She had a lot of break downs saying I would get sick of her and it wouldn’t be worth he risk but she finally changed her mind. YAY. \n \nNow to the present. We have been dating for a year. She asks me on an almost daily basis if I still love her, I say yes, she says reallly, I reply yes. Now this both frustrates me, but also makes me feel terrible. I feel like I’m a shitty boyfriend and am not making her feel appreciated/loved. I brought this up with her and she said “ no your great it’s all in my head “. \nShe still asks me for this validation, it’s really starting to frustrate me a lot and make me feel very shitty. Would I be the asshole if I told her I really need her to stop as it’s effecting me even though she has trust issues. \n\nTLDR: spent 6 months getting a girl with trust issues in a relationship. 1 year in and she asks me daily GENUINLY if I still love her and it’s getting to me, would I be the asshole if I ask her to stop.

We are in a long distance relationship so we developed feelings and spoke for around 6 months before we met and had our first kiss \n\nI drove around 4 hours to see him, got there late (around 6pm) where he had to go back home in 3 hours (his dads stupidly strict with curfew). We met up, instead of going to dinner (pushed for time), we just got a quick £3 meal deal from tesco. All was good, I was nervous but having fun \n\nWent back to the hotel (split the costs) to chill (not netflix and chill lol) and watch tv, we were just cuddling on the bed and he knew i felt a bit uncomfortable, i have never been this intimate with a guy before (he knew this). He did do well to comfort me though \n\nBut then we eventually kissed. We have been together for almost 2 years now (still ldr) and it still bugs me to this day \n\nSo AITA for being annoyed that my first kiss wasn't as romantic as I always thought it would be i.e. dinner, talk, walk me to the door with a goodbye kiss or am I just stupidly naive?",

      "description": "Kind of long but you can skip to paragraph 2 if you dont need the backstory on my ex-friend. Fake names are used.\n\nThis girl we'll call K and I were friends for a few years during high school. She used to be super nice, but then she started to complain about being sad all the time and pushed everyone away when they tried to help, to the point where it was getting ridiculous. She also became extremely self-centered, and would interrupt me while I was talking to a friend of mine, and when I confronted her afterwards she said \"You didnt want to talk to her anyway\", which was obviously untrue. She just became a sad extremely mean narcissistic individual, she never did anything for me despite me driving to her house to check on her when she was sick or sad.\n\nK started having a crush on my good good friend we'll call Ivan, and for awhile it was mutual. Eventually her personality and the way she acted started wearing on him to the point where she was starting to ruin his life. She would keep him up late at night to complain  and chase away any girl he tried to talk to. K and I had our first falling out when I texted her a paragraph telling her that if she ever wanted to get with Ivan she needed to make big changes to her personality, which were Ivan's words not mine. We had a strained relationship afterwards. Ivan told me all the stuff K did and I realized that she was a toxic individual and she needed to leave him alone.\n\nIvan set me up with a girl (Bad idea, but that's another story), and I was asking my friend Hurricane what her opinion was on her. Hurricane knew she had a reputation and told me that I shouldn't go on a date with her and that she would force me to do drugs, and then told me that she would force me to do, \"other\" things. At this K speaks up from the corner of the table and says that she hopes it happens so I'll learn a lesson. Now I wasnt actually all that bothered by the comment because I was too busy laughing at the suggestions that a tiny 5'3\" girl could force me, a 6'2\" guy do drugs to really care, but I kept it in the back of my mind. \n\nOne's night while Ivan is complaining about the ridiculous shit K was doing I tell him that he should send her a text berating her for saying she hopes I \"get taught a lesson\". He eagerly agrees and after he does she sends me two huge paragraphs saying that she never said it and that I need to get my ears checked before blocking me. When Ivan pressed it further she changed her story to that she misheard me, which is bogus. It worked and she stopped messing with Ivan, but was I the asshole for telling Ivan to send her the text in the first place?\n\n",

      "description": "I met my boyfriend J, online 4+ years ago. He was working overseas in my country on a reciprocal work visa. I had alot going for me at that point- a good and supportive job,  my friends and family close by, and was completely financially independent with ambitions of my own. \n\nWhen I met J, I was coming out of a short relationship and was hoping to meet someone who was in the same mindset and place in life as me. He was very ambivalent about meeting up with me, and it took a far amount of convincing to  secure a first date. Subsequently, I got him drunk and slept with him, and the past 4ish years have fallen into place. Eg, living together for most of it and moving internationally for him.\nAfter his 2 year visa in my country came to an end, he asked me to move to his home with him to try living there, and I was more than keen to give it a go. \nSince then, I've struggled with my ongoing depression and during these 2 odd years, I've admitted to myself and him that I have a problem with alcohol. I feel isolated here and feel an overwhelming sense of debt to him, despite my ability to find work here. \nWhen i finally admitted my struggle with alcohol, he completely supported my return home for 3 months to address my addiction and find some clarity. \nThe trouble is, my sobriety ended the moment I was back with him. Part of me blames it on him and his ability to properly communicate issues with me. See, I have been begging him for a sign of his commitment to me in the form of an engagement. To me, that action means alot, and signifies to me that he's committed and willing to show me in a way I need. I've been patient and understanding of his apprehension. I gave him a timeline (3.5 years into our relationship, that I needed a proposal in a years time, or else I'd consider moving home). Its been well over a year since I've given him that timeline, and despite his reassurance he wants to be married to me, there has been no tangible evidence that he plans to follow through with a proposal, despite my many prompts.\n\nI'm tired of pushing and at this point, I think a proposal at this point would seem disingenuous. I told him because if this, as well as my need to focus completely on my own health, I want to split and move home.\nSo, reddit, AMITA?",

He then told me \"STFU, I want to watch the game now\".\n\nI gave him a chance to apologize for the STFU and then I would take the bus home and he could come a little later and drop of the stuff. He then said that he has nothing to apologize for, that I'm acting like a spoiled teenager.

      "description": "Ok. She does take showers but for once of every two weeks and once a month to clean her clothes and her bed. I had to spray air freshener every day so I don't have to smell it from my side of the room, but she gets a hissy fit everytime I either spray air freshener, open the window (which is on her side of the room) , or even asking her to take a shower. So she has excuses of how she doesn't do that at home, she doesn't have time, or she took one yesterday... EVERYONE at the campus can tell she didn't took one yesterday.  She even wears the same clothes for a week. She told me to  fuck off when I mentioned the smell everytime and mind my own business, kinda hard to really mind my own business when I'm stuck in the same room with the smell, it smells like a house with 9 dogs and the dogs aren't house trained.\n\nBut I do feel like I'm asking too much for her to shower and clean her side of the room, since she said my habits annoy her. Like my alarm clock annoys her, being loud and going off early (set at around 6:15am and bad hearing) or how I be staying in my room all the time after class (even though I don't think I'm in my room that much compare to her) so am I the asshole? I do feel like one but not sure.\n\n",

Steve has an ex \"Carl\" (28?M), and they at one point bought a house together, got cats, and were engaged. Steve found out that Carl was cheating and they broke up, with Carl keeping both the house and the cats.\n\nThis all happened before I met Steve, and I have never met Carl in person, but I love Steve dearly and therefore I severely dislike Carl.\n\nCarl has known his job was downsizing for a while, and knew that if there were layoffs he would be one of the people to be cut, but he never looked for a different job or tried to find a back up plan. Just as expected, Carl was laid off.\n\nThe part about if I am an asshole is that Steve has stayed friendly with Carl, and while he doesn't want to date Carl again, is still attracted to him and has sort of forgiven Carl of his (abundant) cheating. Steve made a GoFundMe for people to help Carl not lose his house, and has been linking, emailing, and posting about it on the book of faces.

      "description": "I was recently berated by my girlfriend for this, but I don’t think I did anything wrong and want to hear if I’m the asshole.\n\nHere are the story. In my department at work it’s me, my boss, and a woman who works under me who was hired about six months ago. We all went to lunch together about once or maybe twice a week, which is the same as before she started working when it was just me and my boss we did lunch about the same. We mainly just talk about work or other topical conversations. My boss got promoted a little while back, we still all do lunch together sometimes but lately  he’s been too busy and maybe once every other week I do lunch with just myself and the girl who works under me when he doesn’t have time.\n\nI was at lunch with her a few days back and sent a picture of my lunch to my girlfriend who commented on the food and asked who I went with. I told her I was with the girl I work with, and she responded weirdly and I knew something was up. I asked if she had an issue with it and she basically accused me of emotionally cheating on her with this girl, and that it is flat out wrong to be going to lunch with a married women. My gf told me at a work party I had brought her to a few months back, the girl that worked under me had grabbed my arm and it seemed odd to her. She basically said that that was inappropriate behavior and that it happened because I was encouraging it by going to lunch with her.\n\nI have no recollection of her touching my arm at this party. There is absolutely nothing inappropriate or suggestive being said at these lunches, it is topical or business discussion only. There is never any other physical contact either. I have no interest in this woman who is happily married in any physical or emotional way, and honestly I don’t even find her attractive in any way. Most days we don’t even talk very much I assign her tasks and review her work, probably a combined 30 minutes of conversation a day ( apart from days we do lunch)\n\nI told my girlfriend I would stop going since it was bothering her and I will, but I really don’t feel like I’m did wrong. This is typical of all divisions in our office and similar to what I’ve been doing with my boss before she was on board. I would be doing nothing different if she was a man. To me it helps with team building and working with people, and even though I won’t do it for my gfs sake, I don’t think I did anything wrong to begin with.\n\nAm I the asshole here for thinking I didn’t do anything wrong?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Last week, the newest installment in the \"Super Smash Bros\" series came out, a multiplayer party platform fighter where you play as various nintendo characters and try and knock the opponents into the \"blast zone\" to score a KO. It's on Nintendo's newest console, whose main selling point is that you can take it on the go. I've been bringing to school to play with my friends during lunch. But today, we had nothing do in healtha after we finished our work, so I [15m] brought out my switch to play with my friend, \"A\" [15m]. \n\"A\" had never played before, so I was going easy on him while explaining how to play. There's another classmate that sits infront of us that's a hardcore Nintendo fan, usually playing on his DS or drawing Nintendo characters in his sketchpad, he'll be \"N\". The way that Health is set up, is that it splits the large gym class into two health classes, and a friend of \"N\" came to talk to him and noticed taht we were playing Super Smash Bros on my switch. I had enough controllers for them to play, but I didn't want them to play because: A. They would probably destroy both of us easily B. I was still kinda salty that \"N\" didn't pull his weight in our group project, and C. I just thought they were kind of annoying.\nWhen they came over, me and \"A\" gave them a bunch of excuses about why they couldn't play, and eventually they gave up, noticeably peeved off because of it. \"N\" 's friend returned to the other room. Note: they both had their own switches with the game, but didn't think to bring them to school to play. Anyways, our friend, \"S\", came over and asked to play a little while later. We handed him a controller, and we had fun, playing 2v1 against me. However, this must've really pissed \"N\" off, because he slammed his fists onto the desk HARD, and said \"why does HE get to play?\". I said back, \"sorry, only people who did work on our group project can play.\" He was really pissed off for the rest of class.\nSo, AITA? I'm torn between \"My console, my rules\", and \"sharing is caring\" looking back at it. I mean, it's not like they couldn't play on their own. But because of his extreme reaction I'm second guessing myself. He's usually pretty calm and is a good kid, even if he's a bit weird and doesnmt seem to understand boundaries that well (He always eavesdrops on our conversations and butta in whenever he has input on the topic for example)",

      "description": "The title may be a little off, but I don’t know how to phrase it very well.\n\nVery recently my sister went to go study abroad in Spain, and she left her dog with my mother, brother and I. The dog started going to the bathroom inside quite a bit (especially in places like the beds and couches). In the past week, my dog peed on my mom’s bed three times. Today, she peed on it for the fourth time. My mom was furious about it. She began to scream about throwing it out in the cold and began to throw a single shoe at it (to scare, apparently wasn’t meant to hit the dog). I have hardly ever seen my mother like that and I was genuinely concerned. I then proceeded to call my brother in law who lives a couple blocks away and asked if he could take the dog for a couple days. He agreed, and I told my mother about it. My mother was angry that I made this choice without consulting her. I told her that she needed the dog to be out of the house for her to “calm the fuck down”, and she disagreed quite a bit. I did this to help my mom calm down (the well-being of the dog was also somewhat part of the equation, but I didn’t really think that the dog should be pitied due to how it constantly did something it knew it wasn’t supposed to do). I’m confused as in to whether or not I did something wrong by calling to get the dog out of the house.",

      "description": "I’m 22, and recently moved in with my grandparents after leaving New York City due to financial problems. My grandfather (70) had a stroke a couple years ago. He is doing much better now; he gets around on his own and can drive and do most things just fine. However, he has a hard time communicating. Oftentimes, he can think of what he wants to say, but can’t seem to get the words out. Sometimes, the wrong word will come out, like “truck” instead of “bicycle.” Most of the time, this results in him speaking very slowly and methodically. I try to be patient with him and wait a long moment before I respond, to make sure he is finished. \n\nMy grandmother (65) has a really bad habit of interrupting people. I don’t usually call her out on it when she interrupts me, I just stop, wait for her to finish, then restart my sentence slowly as if she didn’t say anything. She’s been doing it for years and most of the family are used to it. \n\nYesterday I got a call from two different restaurants in the area who are interested in hiring me. I asked my grandparents for advice about which job I should take, which led to a discussion about the benefits of each restaurant. While we were talking, my grandmother started talking over my grandfather and he exploded (rapid emotional changes are also a side effect of the stroke). Instead of apologizing, she denied that she had done anything, and argued back, interrupting him again. His hands were shaking and he was very frustrated because he was fighting to get the words out to tell her why he was upset. \n\nI jumped to his defense and pointed out that she did in fact interrupt him, and had done it to me twice that day. I think she felt cornered because we were ganging up on her, and said “fine whatever.” She then went to her room to sulk and blatantly ignored me for the rest of the night when I asked her if I should make something for myself or whether she was going to make dinner. \n\nTL;DR — I came to my grandfather’s defense because his disability made it difficult to defend himself, but in the process I think I made my grandmother feel more attacked. Should I have minded my business? Can I help her recognize her behavior or am I just creating more tension in the home? ",

      "description": "This is a throwaway account for privacy but I will answer any questions you may have in the comments. I’m male and both my girlfriend and I are 20 years old. I know the title itself makes me sound like an asshole already but please bear with me.\n\nFor additional information, I have kind of a weird relationship with hair. I’ve grown up in a family where all the women get rid of their body hair. My father, the only man in the family, seems to naturally have barely any hair on his body. This means I wasn’t really aware it was a thing until I started growing some myself and let me tell you, I started growing it early and lots of it. For years I was embarrassed for my hairy body until I started waxing it all off. Nowadays I know body hair is nothing to be embarrassed of but I still like the way my body and other people’s bodies look and feel a lot better without hair. \n\nI hate the fact that I feel this way because\nI actually like the idea of letting the hair grow:\n\nAccepting that bodies are beautiful naturally?\nThat’s great!\n\nNot having to waste hours just for hair removal?\nSounds good to me.\n\nNot irritating your skin?\nSeems sensible.\n\nSo I tried to force myself to get used to it. I watched porn where both men and women have lots of hair and I keep telling myself it’s normal to have hair but nothing has changed so far. At this point I feel like I can either try to bring it up in a non-hurtful way or shut up abut it forever and remain a bit frustrated.\n\nThe way I was planning on doing it is asking her if she has a preference on how I should wear my body hair and that if she does have a preference I would try it out for her. Then I would tell her that I prefer hairless but that if she doesn’t want to shave that’s her decision and that I love and find her attractive either way. I genuinely mean that but I’m still afraid to bring it up because this is a sensitive subject for many. We usually talk about everything and at least getting this off my chest would feel like a relief even if she doesn’t want to change anything so I’m unsure what to do.\n\nWhat do you think?

They live 20 minutes away.\n\nMy wife has the closest relationship with the wife. Because this woman and my wife's mother grew up in a Catholic orphanage in Malaysia. She is arguably my wife's best friend.\n\nWe just found out that her husband was in the hospital, was undergoing chemo treatment, died, and subsequently had the funeral Wednesday.\n\nAll we knew was that he went to the hospital for an eye surgery.\n\nWhat pissed me off the most was that this woman told my wife's mother of the cancer, the death and attended the funeral. We found out by seeing them get into their car dressed up. My wife's mother, my wife's father, and her 24 year old brother left for the funeral.\n\nMy wife had to keep asking for updates on this situation since no one told us of anything going on.\n\nI am furious with this woman, my mother in law, my father in law, and her brother.

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together a couple of years, and we have yet to move out. She has this crazy agreement (in my eyes) with her parents about how they are having her stay home while she is in college because they are helping with expenses, although she wants to move and now can't until another year and a half. \n\nAnyways, her parents are rather religious, the type to go to church every Sunday, and they constantly push that agenda onto me and my girlfriend. I'm not religious, but my girlfriend doesn't see an issue with anything they do.\n\nSo this morning, my girlfriend left for work at 7 a.m., and I don't start work until 10. So I was asleep, and all of a sudden I woke up to knocks on the bedroom door. It's her parents telling me that they're leaving for church. Ok... Whatever. Thanks for waking me up. But no, they are telling me I need to leave as well. I'm nearly 20, have been with their daughter for 2 years, and we have stayed at the house plenty of times while they were out... so why is it a big deal if I'm there just for a few hours while I wait for work? I don't have a bad history, I have never stolen or done anything wrong to them, and I'm not sure why they have this rule.\n\nSo I had to go outside and scrape off my car and didn't even have time to let it run a little bit before they had the house locked up and were telling me goodbye. I was, admittedly, a bit upset. It was pretty hard to see out the windshield cause it was so fogged and a little icy still, and now I'm sitting in a gas station waiting for work to open up cause it's freezing out. They didn't even give me time to eat breakfast. \n\nAITA for hating them for not allowing me to just stay for an hour or two? I understand the home is a \"sacred place\", but I'm the one who cleans a vast majority of anything relating to my girlfriend in that house anyways. I just feel disrespected, as I know my parents wouldn't do the same to my girlfriend. ",

      "description": " WARNING: Extremely petty content.\n \n \n My old college roommate moved in with me again last year after our girlfriends each left us around the same time. His current girlfriend lives out-of-state, but visits for a week or two at a time. Our first encounter was less-than-pleasant. I'm a rather anxious person (currently medicated for OCD), and one of the things that gets to me is glitter. When she first arrives at our house for the first time, she brought craft herpes with her, and didn't bother to address it before getting settled in and coating the whole house. I resisted exploding, and voiced my concerns to him. He understood my uneasiness, and did a reasonable job cleaning up (though far from perfect, as one would expect from glitter). I tried not to let that permanently condemn her in my eyes, and dismissed it as a careless mistake. Most of the other things have been largely trivial, like overstuffing trash, not replacing toilet paper properly, leaving the toilet lid up (I maintain that when a guest in someone's home, you should make an attempt to leave things how you found them). Yesterday I came home to the house smelling strongly of bacon. To preface, I'm vegan—I'm not preachy about it or anything, but my roommate is well aware of the fact. While I find the smell off-putting, I respect their consumption under our roof. What I do not respect, however, is the smeared grease left over on my pan (he doesn't have his own kitchenware) and the stove after an attempted \"cleaning\". I strongly voiced my dissatisfaction—he said it was her doing, and that he would talk to her about it. Alright, fine. The next morning, I found he had done a better job cleaning (though I am not satisfied, I appreciate the attempt), but my freshly roasted coffee has grease smeared on the container somehow. I'm somewhere between throwing something and breaking down, but I leave a text to the effect of \"if my coffee tastes like bacon, I'm gonna throw a fit\". His response consists of how sick he is of our toilet backing up (this has been an intermittent issue for a while now), claiming I must not be flushing, as he doesn't have the problem. I take offense to the absurdity of the accusation that a quarter-century of muscle memory just vanished in the past months, and he decides that me claiming \"muscle memory\" as \"more important\" than an \"overlook[ing] in the kitchen\", is too much, and that he's moving out.\n \nI concede that I likely overreacted on the bacon, but her repeated inconsideration is making me uncomfortable in my own home. She is a guest I allow to stay with us for an extended period of time, and I feel my property is not being respected.\n \n I usually take the helm on initiating household service (though nothing is stopping him from doing it), and offered to have the toilet directly addressed, being more mindful in the meantime, double-flushing if I have to. He maintains that the problem is me.\n \n Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "about two weeks ago a coworker  (CW) of mine contacted me after not being at work for 3 days asking me to go to his home to pick up his two cats. Specifically told me that he didn’t know what to do with them, and thought that I would be able to find a home for them and that he would prefer for them to be able to stay together. He also told me I could have things from his apartment, to take or sell. I asked him if he was coming back for anything, and after a day and a half he responded that he was unsure. \n\nNo one knew what was going on. Not his mother anyone we work with, or the owners of the company.  \n\nAfter two weeks of everyone worried, vague or no response, CW comes back and somehow the company I work for has agreed to give him a second chance and allow him to continue his employment after essentially 2 weeks of no call/no show. This complicates things because it’s someone I will be working directly with and require and decent professional relationship with CW at the very least. \n\nCome to find out the reason he left is that him and his husband (HB) got into a fight, ending with him hitting HB and the cops being called. Rather than be responsible and deal with the situation they both decided he should leave before the cops show up. Which caused a warrant put out for his arrest. He’s currently finishing up probation but rather than deal with the situation they both decide to skip town. They drove up the coast with their other two pets, and gave them away in another state 3,000 miles away to someone up there. \n\nNow that CW is back he spoke with me this morning about taking the two cats back. At the time I told him most likely, but I know that my husband is pretty upset about the situation and that CW abandoned them, which CW doesn’t see it that way because he knew I would get them. I reluctantly told him he could most likely pick the cats up this afternoon, I just needed to talk to my husband. \n\nWell, I sent my husband a text telling him and he called me telling me his friend (FR)  had been promised the cats already, and that we were just holding them for him until FR closes on his house. FR is a 22 year old, who works a good job, buying his first house at a young age, which I think goes to show that he is a responsible stable person, who is very much excited to take in the two cats. \n\nI text CW to tell him I was unaware that they had been promised to someone, and we had found a good home for them, but he doesn’t see it that way and he wants them back. In his argument as to why he’s even stated that he “can be 100% sure he can keep and care for them, but if not he is 100% sure his mother or brother could” if he can’t. \n\nThe more I think on it, the more I am hesitant to give an animal back to someone who would leave them, and put themselves in that kind of a situation. \n\nAITA for not wanting to give CW his cats back, and rather foster them until they can go with my husbands coworker? \n",

      "description": "Before you just pass me off as an asshole, let me explain. I've known this girl for about 2 years, the last year of which we've been on and off... something, we've been on the edge of sleeping together and even said \"I love you\", but things never worked out between us. I'm sad to say that I don't really have any fond feelings for this person anymore, and I mostly just ignore her or make small talk with her since this thing of ours shit the bed again last month.\n\nAnyway, I told her I needed some space, and after that she basically disappeared from my life. She stopped going her (and my) usual spots, and we didn't talk on text for half a month. I was basically fine with life, started chatting with another girl, until she just sat there in the same room as me and my friends yesterday. I was having a good time, just taking the piss with my friends while she sat there alone. I must've caught her staring at me at least 100+ times in what could have only been an hour, every time I looked away, eventually those looks got angry, and then really, really sad.\n\nEventually my friend took her to another room, and apparently she is suicidal, says she has nothing to live for, and according to my friend those stares the shot my way were to get me to go talk to her, and it made her feel even worse when I ignored her. I'll admit that I went out of my way to not speak to her, since I can physically feel the anxiety whenever I've tried, but I still feel really guilty for not helping her, seeing as she is suicidal and was trying to seek me out.\n\nAITA for ignoring this girl? I don't want her in my life I think, but I feel shitty that I ignored her when her life could have been on the line.",

      "description": "After I changed my school, I still had contact with some of my friends but we did'nt do much with each other anymore. So I looked out for some new friends and met a nice dude at my school. So we decieded to program and play some video games together. I felt like we really get along well with each other, but than i noticed that i was the one who always asked if he want to do something with me, also sometimes he didnt even answered my messages. It wasnt a big deal at this time. When I asked him he just told me that he hasnt to reply to all my questions and that he takes everything more easily. I thought ok, maybe he has some stress at home because i knew some of the background about his family he told me. I offered him help if he needs it and told him he could just write if he want to do something with me again. At this time he was literally the only friend I had contact with. So after a week I texted him whats going on now and why he didnt replied. He answered that sometimes he just wants to have his peace. I understood that and asked him if he is now ready to go on and program with me again (We had a little project and wanted to do this together). He replied yes and we continued and talked to each other several days until the day we met in school again. In school we decieded to countinue our project because we had nothing to do and we deciede to resume after school if we were at home. So Ive waited for him to join me on teamspeak but he didnt. After a couple of hours I asked whats up and he just replied that it could be later. I just waited but he didnt texted back or anything. Anyway after 3 days I wrote that if he dont want to do something with me i would go on alone with our project. Like i wrote Ive already asked why he didnt replied and if he didnt want to be friends with me or whats going on. He didnt answered most of the questions and just ignored them and said he doesnt want to talk about this topic. I guess he meant why he didnt replied and whats on his mind, but he wanted to go on and if i mean with beeing friends to share interests than yes. I dont understand it myself. So this time he answered that he often dont know what i want from him and that im often, and i think often negative. That could be true but how im supposed to think about this in a positive way I am also sometimes a little bit of a pessimist ? Then I replied with a really long message and explained all i wrote here to him. And asked him if he just could answer my questions more often and he could also ask me if i want to to something with him. Because for me this friendship was one-sided. It felt like he didnt really want to do something with me and was just nice to me to avoid stress but i also could undertsand if he doesnt want to be friends with me. I once said to him he just has to tell me what he wants i cant read minds and he said yes but didnt answered my qustions... and my question literally was whats on his mind. So as you can tell now he didnt relpied to this message as well and I asked again whats your answer? What do you think, sahre your mind. But again he didint replied and I saw that he just started playing a video game so I ended our friendship. AITA in this situation? Was I too negative or confronted him to agressive? What should I do now, i really need some good advice guys, i would like to go on if he would communicate with me because he is a really nice guy, but I also dont want a friend who just ignores me. If I should confront him how ? Or should i just let rest it ? What are your experiences and advices?\n\nSorry for my bad english but pls send help.",

      "description": "Go ahead, call me an asshole or a cold bastard. But I've contemplated this many times. In fact, I'm afraid to have sex and lose my virginity solely because of that one accident it takes, even with protection, to get a girl pregnant. I'm legitimately considering getting a vasectomy a few years after I graduate college and get my own healthcare and whatnot as a safeguard. I know I'd probably be ostracized by my family but oh well.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I love my baby nephew. He is so adorable and curious and he always lifts everyone's spirits when he's around. Some of my fondest memories thus far have been of when he would stay at my house and my parents and I would have to babysit him while my brother and his fiance were having some free time away from him for once. I'd go into the bedroom and see him just starting to wake up from a nap and watch his face light up. \n\nBut then I quickly come back down to earth and realize how little patience I have for the crying and whining.",

Due to this I have sole access to the modem control panel.\n\nMy brother has shown symptoms of computer/internet dependency for the past few years, he no longer has any hobbies or diversions outside of whatever he can access on his PC. I recognise these symptoms because I was once in the same position as him at the same age, which lead to a series of unfortunate events that I do not want him to repeat. \n\nThis dependency is also sapping his ambition to do something with his life, as mentioned before he doesn't want to study or work and he has no plans to. I've tried helping him directly but he has threatened to run away if I continued bugging him about it. \n\nThe best I've been able to do without causing mayhem is limiting his access to the internet during the day and early morning. I do this through the aforementioned modem control panel. The agreement we have is if he helps out around the house or does something during the day, I give him all day access.\n\nHis friends whom I also know have commonly stated that I'm being unfair and abusive. I'm worried that they're right and I've been overstepping my bounds as his brother. My brother has also been noticably distant toward me for a long time now, and it's starting to hurt. I'm worried that I'm being a hypocrite since I was essentially the same has him when I was younger, but I just don't want him to go through what I did.\n\nAny questions please don't hesitate to ask.",

      "description": "I’m a student and live with 4 other guys. It was my birthday yesterday and I got a waffle maker and we decided we would make waffles with it. We all contributed to the ingredients and utensils required in order to make them and we feasted on the waffles. The batter was running out but there was enough for a small one, so I stayed and finished the last one whilst the others went and watched a movie in the other room. I cleaned up the utensils and went to watch the movie. There was a mess on the counter surface from flour, sugar, spilt batter etc but I left it there.\n\nThe morning after, they ask me to clean up the mess. I declined as the way I see it, it is our mess and seeing as I cleaned up the utensils, one of the other 4 could wipe the surface. They all have a go at me saying I should clean it because I was the one that was actually cooking the waffles (even though we all ate them). They then go further and say that because one of them emptied the bins and another dealt with the recycling, there is even more reason I should wipe the mess as they have done other jobs for the house.\n\nAITA for not just cleaning it up? I know I could have just done it and been done in 2 minutes and avoided this whole situation, but I didn't because I thought it was ridiculous they were putting the responsibility of it all on me, even though it was a group activity that we all partook in.\n\nAnd before anyone says it, yes, we are all adults (21/22) arguing about who wipes the surface.

      "description": "I went to a cabin with my friends and our SOs last weekend. My gf (of 3 years) and I got there first and my gf realized that she forgot tampons. The nearest drug store was almost an hour away. She wanted me to text all my friends and ask the to stop but I thought that was weird and told her to text their girlfriends instead. She only had one of their numbers and the girl didn't answer, so my gf texted my best friend Leroy on her own and he brought her tampons.\n\nThe part that really rubbed me the wrong way was when he gave them to her, she gave him a hug and said \"I love you Lee you're such a good friend.\" She said it really loudly so everyone heard it and it bothered me a lot that she was basically announcing that she loves someone else in front of all my friends, and on top of that, she said it about my best friend.\n\nI didn't bring it up on the trip because I didn't want to start a fight when we were in close quarters with all our friends but it kind of ruined my weekend because I felt like I needed to keep an eye on her and if she was flirting with Leroy. Now we're back and I'm pretty pissed about how the whole weekend went downhill for me. WIBTA if I addressed it with her?",

      "description": "Let me just start by saying that I am a straight man that has never come out as gay. I don't dislike gay people however, I don't give a shit where you want to put your junk just keep me out of it.\n\nThis happened in my freshman year. I had just moved to the area so I didn't know many people and was slightly self conscious and on edge. Having moved alot I try to keep my head down and avoid people.\n\nAnyway, in gym class there was this guy I had never talked to (didn't even know his name) who started hitting on me. At first I thought he was just joking and it would stop after a few days. He would say something and I would ethier try to laugh it off or avoid him. He would compliment me and say I was cute. \nNote: I told him I was straight\n\nThis went on for about a week when I got feed up and told him I was straight with no interest in him. When he continued, I tried to ignore him completely and avoid him as best as I could. At this point he because more \"intense\". Saying things like how he wanted to kiss and date me. Calling me a \"snack\" and the like. \n\nAfter about a month or so I got feed up. The stress of moving, plus this guy that wouldn't stop hitting on me made me break. I yelled at him in public. I said somethings that I didn't regret, until now. \n\nWhen I yelled at him I threatened him, telling him I would report him if he talked to me ever again. \n\nSo it has been several years and he never talked to me sense. He had stepped back and has left me alone. I still can't forgive him though. I am still mad at him, and couldn't care less about what happened to him. So, AMTA for now letting go of my hate and just talking to him again?",

      "description": "About 4 years ago, I started playing D&amp;D with the person in question. I never liked this person. He is obnoxious, obtrusive, and starts a lot of drama.\n\nAfter about a year of an awful campaign, the group began to splinter. About 2 years ago we ended up with a stable group of 7 that didn't include this person. We hadn't kicked him out; it's just the group had shifted.\n\nBut 6 months ago, he came to hang out at our group one day. Drama in his D&amp;D group came to a head, and we spent like an hour comforting him. I was the only one who didn't like him. So when he asked to join our group, I obviously couldn't say no.\n\nImmediately after he joined the group, his parents kicked him out too, on account of some sex toys they found. They're hardcore conservative Christians and that stuff doesn't fly in their house.\n\nAt the time, he was a she; he wouldn't come out as a trans man for the next 3 months. And this is NOT the reason we kicked him out. But it did factor into some of the drama we started having.\n\nIn one of the campaigns being run, we all had to pick a horrible flaw, and my character had ended up a chauvinist. In response to this, the new guy made a character he described as a \"man who looked like a woman\". This probably had something to do with gender dysphoria.\n\nA few months into the campaign, someone played the song \"dude looks like a lady\" as a joke. He was very offended and said his character was trans. We were confused as he had never described the character as such. He finally came out to us now. \n\nAfter 4 months in the group, he joined this community at college. The best way to describe it is a \"safe space\". He started policing us on what we weren't allowed to say. We couldn't say clit or cunt, among several other things. Before joining this community he was the only one who said things like that.\n\nHe would also escalate existing drama in the group. If we had an arguement, he would always take the minority's side to extend the arguement, even if the arguement had already wrapped up in the chat or in person.\n\nHe would send offensive jokes and memes to the chat and then claim he sent them to the wrong person when no one found them funny.\n\nAnd on top of all that, all his characters in the various campaigns we ran were edgy attention whores who hogged the spotlight.\n\nIt got to the point that the rest of the group didn't like him either.\n\nI brought it to the group that maybe we should just boot him. He didn't gel well with the group, and he made everyone miserable. Everyone thought it would be best.\n\nWe confronted him and asked him to leave, citing all the above reasons. He was very upset, but we were all done with him by now.\n\nThe thing is, though I never liked him, I still feel bad since he had just been kicked out of another group and his house, and he had just come out as trans to us, which wasn't easy.\n\nAITA here reddit?",

      "description": "Hi guys! So, first, a little bit of background.\n\nEarlier this year I was in the hospital due to mental issues that I was having. While in the hospital I met a girl there, we hit it off, and, when she got out, we started dating.\n\nWe had a few dates and hung out a few times; we decided to mutually call each other girlfriends, which was fine to me because we were together a lot, intimate, etc. This was over the course of around a month out of the hospital.\n\nSo she winds up going back into the hospital, but, this time, it was different. My hospital stay left me relatively stable, but she'd been in and out of hospitals for the last year. They weren't working so well for her, and, given that she was banned from the hospital near to me, she had to be sent to a state run institution for long term care.\n\nShe was in the ER for an entire month as she waited for a bed to get freed up at the other institution. I was able to visit her during this period, and, eventually, she was sent to the other institution.\n\nI've tried to encourage her to use the hospital stay for her own benefit. Inpatient treatment can be really great for mental issues since you have an entire team to help you as you switch around medications and have episodes, etc. Really, when used correctly, inpatient treatment can be highly stabilizing.\n\nI was actually very excited for her to go where she is now. It's a good hospital, and she has a lot more freedom there than she's had at other institutions. I was thinking she'd start to improve; I've been wrong thus far. In fact, she seems to be getting worse, and, despite her being very self aware and knowing that she needs help, she doesn't seem to be giving it a lot of effort. She seems to assume that improvement will just happen on its own.\n\nI'm getting tired of having a relationship through a phone and hearing every time I call that my girlfriend has done something else, or, alternatively, hearing her beat herself up and say things that I know for a fact are to garner attention, consciously or subconsciously.\n\nI care a lot about her; I want this to work. I assumed at the outset that her self-awareness would lead to fairly rapid improvement. I've told her that, if she can't improve, there isn't really a way I can be with her healthily. I've also told her that I wouldn't break up with her while she's in there, and that I won't break up with her period if she continues to try to improve.\n\nI just tried to call and she was having another episode, probably being extremely terrible to the nursing staff, explosive, etc., so we couldn't talk. It frustrated me enough to think twice about being with her yet again.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I broke up with her while she's still in the hospital and in need of support?",

Things have been steadily going downhill with our friendship all month and I was getting tired over the lack of communication I felt from him, his arrogance he tends to have, and his always right mentality. He told me \"As an adult you have an obligation to fix this relationship.\" All I could think and was firm about, is that I don't have an obligation to do anything I don't want to do. I tried to make it clear that I felt like I needed to decide if I wanted to take some time and decide if I felt it was worth the effort. However he was just telling me that I was being a child and not being and adult since I didn't want to fix the friendship. I wanted to just drop the friendship at that point, but wanted to take time to see if it was how I really felt about the situation as a whole. He continues to push then blocked me because he found out I was upset with him because of terrible communication. Saying \"GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE\"\n\nI don't believe I was in the wrong here.

      "description": "When I was 17, I worked in fast food. Overall, I liked the job because of the people I worked with and just having a “customer service” personality. However, I was planning on quitting my job because I was going to be a senior in high school and I had activities and extra curriculars in the fall that wouldn’t allow me to work. I went to the general manager and put in my two weeks and he was very understanding.\n\nIt was my last shift working there, and somewhat emotional after spending 2 years there and meeting many friends as well as my boyfriend at the time. I was working a 10 hour shift, 3pm-1am. I was a closer, and in the company policy, closers and any shift 8+ hours gets a 30 minute break to eat. We are not allowed to eat on the clock at all so I was counting on this break for dinner.\n\nThe supervisor that was working always pulls the “legally I don’t have to give any breaks” card out whenever employees complain. Normally he just says it to be a jerk and everyone gets their breaks anyways. It’s 7pm and the dinner rush is beginning to slow down so I ask what time I will get my break. Supervisor says “you shouldn’t even be asking right now, I don’t even know if we are giving out breaks tonight.”\n\n7:30 rolls around, supervisor takes his break. I’m a little salty because most supervisors make sure everyone else has breaks before they take their own but I didn’t say anything.\n\n8:30 comes, nobody has had breaks and since I clocked on a couple hours before the other closers, I am getting my break first, per company policy. The drive thru and lobby are both empty, and I ask for my break. I am starving. Supervisor says, “I’m not giving any breaks tonight.” I go talk to the other employees and I’m pretty upset because I’m working 10 hours, we’re not busy, and I’m supposed to get a break.\n\n9:00, still nobody in the drive thru nor the lobby. I am getting distracted by how hungry I am, but I don’t steal any food or break the rules. I’ve had it at this point and it was my last shift so I had nothing to lose. I ask for a break one more time. Supervisor says “I told you, nobody is getting breaks tonight. I don’t legally have to give you one so you’re going back to work.” I then took off my hat and my headset and said I was leaving, supervisor replies, “are you fucking kidding me?” and I just silently walk out. \n\nAfter all this, the rest of the closers got their breaks and the general manager told me that I was still a good employee for him and that he would still be a good reference for me. My dad was irate and said that there is never ever an excuse to walk out of a shift no matter what. I feel guilty, however I did put in my two weeks and tried to be respectful to my bosses. Sometimes I still feel guilty.",

This is basically them not letting me go out. \n\nLong story short, my girlfriend is frustrated that I can’t go out, my parents are angry that I wanted to go out, and I’m angry that I’m not allowed out.

      "description": "So, my wife and I have been married for a couple years at this point, and are in our late twenties and our sex life has just...stopped. When we were dating, we didn't have sex much because of stressful work and life things, and while I would have preferred more, it was enough. Starting from our wedding until about two months ago was a gradual decline. Two months ago it just stopped altogether.\n\nAfter a month of nothing happening, I sat her down and asked if if something was wrong, if she wasn't feeling well or was stressed. She said nothing was wrong, she felt fine, she was stressed but no more than usual, she just wasn't ever in the mood. I suggested she visit her doctor and she told me to stop being ridiculous, and that sometimes women just aren't in the mood. Of course I understand this, but this had been a month of nothing. Not even second base, just nothing. She's fine day to day, we don't really fight or anything, but it had started to feel like we were roommates that happened to share a bed.\n\nWe've also been having the conversation about starting a family soon, and I'm not sure how she intends to do that if she doesn't ever want to be intimate. The other night (we are now at two months of no sex, she still thinks this is normal and fine) we were discussing it and we agreed a few months from now would be ideal. We did the math on finances and work schedules and whatnot and agreed that was the best time. Then, I made a joke about getting some practice in and she blew me off. I then asked her point blank if we were only going to have sex again in a few months just until she got pregnant. She sneered at me and said \"Why are you obsessed with sex? What are you a teenager?\". We had a... pointed discussion that centered her idea that sex is an occasional treat when the moment is right and is not a common occurrence. She said that I was acting like a teenager and that adults don't have sex all the time, and she just doesn't need it and doesn't really want it that often. She said when she is in the mood, it's great and she enjoys it (and I believe it, when we do have sex, it's awesome, it is just infrequent) and said that should be enough for me and it was selfish to ask for more.\n\nSo, AITA for wanting more sex? Am I just being a hormonal stereotypical guy?",

      "description": "So last year my brother moved in with me and my roommate. When he moved in his girlfriend started spending a lot of time at our place. This isn't a problem as my roommates girl friend comes over too. Here's the thing though. My brothers gf pretty much eats all our food. No matter who's it it she will eat it. Me and roommate have told her multiple times to stop eating the food we buy and only eat the food brother buys but she ignores us and eats our food anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have confronted her and my brother multiple times and told them she needs to stop but she just says \"tee hee, sorry but it's so good\" and he refuses to say anything about it. We both have tried to talk him into going to her house insted of bringing her over but he doesn't want too. It's gotten to the point where both of us are considering getting a second fridge to put a lock on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, we're both sick of it. Brothers gf is a heavy girl and weight is a very touchy issue with her. Well, recently both of us have taken to calling her miss piggy when she eats our food. If we ever see her eating our food or after she has we confront her and call her it. She hates it and has freaks out each time she hears us refer to her as it. Honestly though, she still eats our food and so we kept doing it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, today when I got home from work his gf was there eating leftovers I had cooked last night. I told her \"Wow, I love to come home to see miss piggy eating my leftovers that I was looking forward too.\" before I started oinking at her. She broke down crying and ran out.  She's been calling my brother furiously since and is refusing to come here anymore because i'm an \"asshole\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm i? Like, we asked her so much to stop and she didn't that i honestly just lost it. We all buy our own food and we have a rule never to touch each others stuff. She knows this and she still did it so I think she deserved it.",

      "description": "So me and my gf have been dating for 3 months now and things have been going real good. We're both at uni but I'm a full time student and she's a part time. I'm at campus from 6am-6pm every day of the week, plus doing 3 hours of extra self directed learning when I get home just to keep up and she'll have one 2 hour class for 3 days of the week, so our schedules are very different.  \nI'm exhausted pretty much every night.\n\nDuring the day we text, I tell her what I'm up to and what I've got install for the day, my classes I've got on etc etc.\n\nI don't quite think she gets how busy and full on I am and how bloody exhausted I am when I finish my days. I warned her prior to starting the year that I'll be busy and full on and probably won't be able to text 24/7. She told me that was fine and she can handle that.\n\n I've been Skyping with her probably twice a week at the moment (since we live about an hour away) but now she wants to every night. I'm asleep by 9:30 pretty much every night and the times I'm honest with her and just say I'm too tired or take a raincheck she gets all passive agressive with me and I just don't have the energy to deal with it after a long day. \n\nI feel bad telling her no because she gets all pissy with me, but I feel like I also need to take care of myself. For example today, we Skyped from 7-8pm since I got all my shit done during the day to make the time for her. She then wanted to Skype later on but I told her I just needed to sleep since I have to get up at 5:30. \nThe second I gently let her down (after already Skyping that day) I got shut down, she got all passive and just told me goodnight. \n\nI felt bad but sometimes I just need some time to myself to just relax. \n\nAITA here? Every time I even mention I'm somewhat tired it feels as though she takes offence from it. It annoys me and I don't know how to make her understand without her getting all upset. \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So for the past week, Ive had basically 1-2 job interviews each day. My post-interview routine is have the interview, thank the company, and then forgot about the job. This is because Ive had so many promising interviews that I never heard back from, so its best for me to pretend I didn't get it and keep looking for work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne interview (\"Job A\"), I thought I wouldn't get at all because of my experience, however they said they'd tell me by Wednesday this week (yesterday) if I had the job. They emailed me and said they had trouble getting in contact with my references, so id find out today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Job B sounded like I would get it, but honestly I've been in a situation where I thought id get the job and it didn't happen, so I didn't get my hopes up. The woman interviewing me for job B told me that she was impressed with me, got me to fill out an application and then told me she would send everything away for reference checks, but it all sounded really promising to her. I was told I'd hear by Monday this week.2 That was the only hint that I would be successful, but like with any other job, I waited it out to see what would happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBarely even an hour ago, I got a call from job A. The woman offered me the job, and even though I was surprised they wanted me (like I said, because of experience), I took it because it would be an awesome experience. Half an hour ago, the lady from job B called. She told me I had been accepted for this job, and I'll get an email with my start date and everything soon. This is basically how our call went down:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJob B: Hi atomicpigeons, sorry for the late reply, but we are wanting to offer you the job at (shop). You will receive an email soon with your start dates and any other information.\n\nMe: Thank you so much for your time, but unfortunately I just accepted a job earlier today. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity though.\n\n\\*silence\\*\n\nJob B: Well, you should've called me to tell me you got the job.\n\nMe: Yes, I'm sorry about that, I didn't think to as I didn't know if I got the job with you or not.\n\nJob B: Alright well, thank you for your time. \\*hangs up\\* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt guilty when she told me I should've called, but thinking about it, I'm not going to ring every interviewer that sounded promising if I already accepted another, especially if they ring late.

      "description": "So here’s the story I’ve been married together with my wife for 7 years, 4 as a married couple. My SIL 31(f) every year when we’re nearing her birthday we ask her if she has any plans or how she wants to celebrate it and she always says nothing then on the day before she tells us and her immediate family (parents, brother and wife) about her plans which involve a lot of guests, preparations and expenses, and then she expects us to all help and do all the work while she plays gracious hostess. She would expect her mother to cook, my wife to do the decorations and have me assist, brother would take care of booze and music, and then she would expect us to servicio the guests, take pictures as hired photographers and just plain do everything including clean up while she just spent time talking and mingling with her guests. This year was no different and I told my wife that I knew what was coming with SIL’s birthday this year and that I wasn’t having it. If she came to us one day before with her plans I’d refuse to help out with anything. So fast forward to the date and sure enough SIL uses same MO and pulls the same crap. My wife pleads with me to help and I say that I would do a bare minimum so she (my wife) doesn’t have to get the shitty end of that stick but that I refuse to play the part of the hired help without pay. So come Sunday we wake up at 5am (it was a lunch) and we go to My in-laws house I help with some minor arrangements and then I just stand aside and let them do there thing and just wait for the guest to arrive and enjoy the party as another guest. To be clear i served my own drinks and food and in no way had my in-laws serve me as that is what pisses me off about SIL attitude. When it came time to take some pictures SIL expected me to take them all and follow her around I refused politely and told her her bf could take them. She complained about how he didn’t have a good phone so the photos wouldn’t be so good. I said that I was sorry but I wouldn’t take the photos. At this time and aunt and cousin of hers interjected and told me to stop being an asshole and just take the pictures as that what was family did, support each other, their words. I told them no, and that they could take the pictures themselves if they really believed in supporting each other. So wife and I just got back and she’s upset with me because she says i didn’t help her today even though I told her I wouldn’t participate if last year’s events repeated themselves again this year. So am I the asshole??\n\nSorry for lengthy post, format (mobile app), and grammar (English is not my native language)",

Normally we clean the mess up from the kids, but this time I really wanted to get going. My wife made a comment about it so instead of making the kids clean their mess, I left an extra $15. I wont downplay the mess, it was pretty bad and probably took a few minutes for them to clean and get ready for the next person.

      "description": "Long distance relationship, like Europe to U.S. long 30/m and 45/f. She's visiting me for 5 weeks. She has less then a week left. I have made EVERY day since she was in town available to her except my Friday nights. Those have been my D&amp;D nights for the past 6 years. She knew this when we were still just talking. Her previous two trips its been the same way. I have given up 5 weeks of pokemon hunting/raiding on my own free will coming home to see her each night. Skipping out on community days and hanging out with my friends except the Friday nights. \n\nWith the snow storms hitting lately we were snowed in for 5 days and I did my best to give her a good time watching movies and spending time together. The last two nights Ive come home to her being in a grumpy attitude. I try to talk to her and get one or two word answers. I give her space and let her play on my computer while I sit on the bed with a switch ready to suspend it if she talks to me. Wednesday night she said nothing all night then gets upset at bedtime because \"the day didn't go as planned\". Last night similar thing but I was able to talk to her for a few minutes. All week Ive offered to drive us to the beach for the weekend if she wants to go and Ive offered to talk time off work next week to spend with her. She doesn't see that. She just sees that the one night a week for my friends is in her way. Yes I hardly see her. No she doesn't have anyone else to spend time with while Im at my friends for 4-5 hours on Friday nights. Yes I offer to invite her.\n\nIs it wrong to want 1 night a week to myself/friends even if she is visiting? We got invited to a friends party this weekend and Ive left it up to her if we go but her main resistance is that a friend (younger then her, older then me) who is recently separated/divorced will be there and things the friend is inviting me to hit on me even though I am not interested in her like that. Im still taking off 3 days next week before she flies out to do what ever she wants but she doesn't have an answer for that.\n",

I don't try to force them to stop being Christian or anything, I respect it. My mother seems to think that since I'm living under her roof I must go to services and read the Bible and stuff (I'm 16 btw). Whenever she brings up me not believing in God, I always give her valid personal, and scientific reasoning and she boils it back down to faith. \n\nLast week it got pretty ugly when she was trying to get me to open up about my feelings. She wasn't really doing it gently though, and I felt like she was prying a bit, so I told her off. She \"explained\" To me that I am a child, and since I am living in HER house I must follow HER rules and that I don't need privacy and that I'm ungrateful. She also basically told me that my depression was my fault and that praying would get rid of it. I've become more reclusive since then, and only talk to her when I need to. She's impossible to reason with. AITA? \n\n\nTL;DR: My mother is extremely religious and forces me attend church services and read the Bible. We had an argument about it last week and I told her off. I haven't talked to her for a while. \n\n",

      "description": "My friend is currently not speaking to me  - actually said he wants nothing to do with me anymore and I’m trying to figure out if it was because I was too blunt with my words. \n\nSome background to the lead up to this falling out:\n\nMy friend had a girlfriend back in December last year - I’ve never met her. She was actually cheating on her then fiancé with him so it was very hush hush. They had a falling out because her fiancé wouldn’t let her go, he slept with another girl and she got mad and they stopped talking. She eventually broke up with her fiancé and moved away from her home town where my friend also lived. \n\nAnyway about August this year he reached to her and they’ve been talking again. I didn’t know the girl even existed because I met this guy in February this year and he never bought her up until about August when he sent pictures of her dog, and other picture she sent him, onto me. He’s said that’s he’s never stopped loving her. She now apparently moving back to town so they can properly date again. \n\nA week ago he got mad at me because every time he sent me a picture of what she sent him I’d reply with “k cool, or cute, okay sweet” and that’s it. He then accused me of hating the girl because of my “disrespectful responses” which I replied with “I don’t care about her at all, little own hate her”. It was meant as I’m indifferent to her - which I explained directly after my “I don’t care about her” comment. \n\nHe then got REALLY mad saying that he doesn’t want someone in his life that doesn’t care about his SO who is a big and important part of his life. He’s now blocked me on Facebook but I’ve tried talking via normal text and whilst it’s “seen” there’s no response... \n\nAm I the asshole? Or is he overreacting about my not caring? I explained straight after it meant as indifference when he accused me of hating her - I have bigger things in life to focus energy on then a girl Ive never met. \n\nBut I’m lost as to why the overreaction - or what I think is an overreaction. Outsider insight would be nice! Or maybe I’m just a dick and can’t see it...\n\n",

      "description": "My fiancé does home care for a quadriplegic guy. The guy has been a quad for about 11 years. The wife has “faithfully” stayed with him through everything but it’s become clear in recent years that she has found a boyfriend who she spends a few months a year with overseas, and in the last couple of years, she’s even been bringing him home to stay under the same roof as her husband. Anyway that’s not the main issue. \nThis woman is quite passive aggressive towards my partner. On  Thursdays he does a “domestic” shift where he is expected to help clean the house. The wife of the quad is a pig. My partner and her husband actually prefer it when she’s away because the place is kept tidy through the week and she isn’t there to trash the place. Being in a full wheelchair, the guy doesn’t make much of a mess. He’s fully aware of what she’s doing with the boyfriend and resents her for it but because of the position he’s in, he feels he can’t divorce her. \nWhen she’s around, she will have full on dinner parties for heaps of people on a Wednesday night because she knows my partner will be there in the morning and will have to do the clean up. \nShe recently yelled at him because while he was trying to do the washing up and clean the kitchen he accidentally walked in some milk. Milk that she had spilt on the floor and hadn’t said anything about. \nShe also expects my partner to clean the parts of the house that the quad guy can’t even access, like her own bedroom and upstairs, not just basic cleaning but things like flipping mattresses and even moving furniture around. This was never in the job description when he signed up for the role. \nHe knows that if he refuses, she will either make his life very difficult at work or he fears he could lose his job. There are a number of carers, but my partner is the one that does the domestic shifts. So he can’t say anything to the company he works for because the wife will know he’s the one who has put in the complaint. \nJust last week she announced that she would be coming to our wedding. This is a private wedding on a private property. My fiancé felt like he couldn’t say no to her because of the unspoken threat that she could make life really hard for him at work. He tried to tell her that there were no chairs but she brushed it off saying that she would stand. \nAITA for wanting to complain about this?  I completely understand that having a husband suddenly go from being completely able bodied to being a full quad must have been absolutely awful but this woman seems to be milking the situation for all it’s worth. Can anyone suggest anything else that could be done about this?",

      "description": "Six months ago I (45M) met a woman (34F) on a dating site. We had dinner/drinks and went back to my place and had sex.\n\nWe kept trying to set something up to see each other again but I have a demanding job (lots of long hours) and she is the single parent of a special needs kid and so trying to secure childcare for her was tough which I understand. Eventually after about four weeks of trying we both sort of mutually stopped sending messages trying to setup a second date.\n\nThen six months pass. Last week she sent me a text \"how are you?\" That's all she said after six months of us not sending a peep to each other. I didn't reply because honestly, I am busy with work, I am casually seeing someone else, and I don't have anything to say to her? So I never replied.\n\nThen a day or two later she called, saying she was thinking about me, she'd love to hang out. Again I never contacted her figuring she'd get the hint.\n\nThis week I'm getting a ton of texts and voicemails from her, she's blowing up my phone. She's accusing me of \"ghosting\" her and \"using her for sex.\" We had one date last summer and it was fun, then we never saw each other again. How did I use her or ghost her? Sorry but I don't want to field calls from random women. I assumed she'd get the hint and stop calling me.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Just like it sounds... I've just started dating again and am giving the apps a try. On the one hand, it's super convenient and I'm obviously glad it's an option. On the other hand, I've run into a bit of a snag in terms of self-presentation, and it's occurred to me that I might've been a bit of an asshole about it. \n\nAnywho, I'm a single dad with a two year old daughter. I didn't quite anticipate this, but it seems like this is a pretty clear disqualification for a significant portion of women. Like, I'm on a date with someone, and we're hitting it off, and I bring up the fact that I've got a kid... and the whole thing very quickly falls apart. I should make it clear that I don't blame women who feel this way one bit; that's totally understandable. But I've gotten the strong impression from a few of them that *not* advertising this fact upfront is kind of a dick move. Like, they feel blindsided and a little angry at me for wasting their time. \n\nOriginally it had not occurred to me at all that I should put this info in my bio. Now I'm considering it... but can't figure out a way to do it that doesn't sound either very awkward or like I'm using my daughter to hook women (gross). There is a pic of me and her together, but apparently it's not obvious that she's my daughter. So here's me wondering if this is actually a big deal/asshole move or if I'm just being insecure again.

      "description": "Hello, \n\nHere's the situation: I work at a educational institute. Colleague (let's call this colleague OB) usually teaches \"Course A\" in field A, but has picked up teaching \"Course B\" in the same field. Issue is, OB doesn't know anything about the topic in Course B. OB has my students teach her the material for Course B, before she parrots it back to the students in Course B. This happened regularly, to the point it was blatant and I would walk in to one of our higher level students teaching OB parts of a certain model before OB taught it in the next day. OB also actively hunted down other higher level students to teach other material and wasn't shy to tell me about it. This already should be setting off warning alarms in my opinion, but I'm not a course coordinator for that course so I have no say. I also don't want to randomly \"out\" OB as that will just cause office drama. \n\nNow, the course coordinator has let OB (with some begging/convincing by OB I'm sure) lead a working group in refreshing some materials that's taught in Course B. I'm really uncomfortable with this as I think the course coordinator has no idea all this student teaching to OB has happened since he is not around as often. Also, the working group impacts me as my job is indirectly impacted by the course updating. I have another colleague (C) who knows the material much better than OB but cannot teach it because C hasn't finished her higher level degree yet. I much rather C be at least in the group so she can kind of act as a \"check\" on OB to make sure that OB isn't doing what OB usually does - faking it. \n\nAm I the asshole if I go to the course coordinator to request C joins the working group (in lieu of me, cause she can be the contact person)? Should I tell the course coordinator the *real* reason for my concern over OB leading the charge? My original plan was just to say C is a good liaison since C knows the field better than me. \n\nThanks!",

      "description": "I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for a considerable period and we intend it to be for the long term and are quite committed to each other. I have generally been a reserved person and am not that verbally expressive perhaps. I got over this a few years back when I started being close to people romantically. That included not only emotional expression but expressing sexual desire and wants as well and involved some sexting. Due to a draining relationship in my past where I felt almost objectified with the incessant sexual undertones being taken in every other conversation, I sort of grew weary and tired of it and I stopped. Over time, I've again become uncomfortable with talking about sexual scenarios explicitly. This is just about sexting and not my actual behaviour and level of desire which is quite high. I don't mind such conversations and in fact I love to listen, however I feel unable to contribute too much as I feel as if there is a block and hence I invariably change the topic many times. My boyfriend knows my past experience, and that I feel uncomfortable. But he thinks my behaviour makes him self doubt. He loves the experience of sexting and he feels quite bad about not being able to share it with someone he loves and also he feels as if there's a part of me that he missed out on and others experienced. The lack of equal reciprocation bothers him. He doesn't blame me but he just gets upset and this has happened too many times. He tries to make conversation about something sexual, asks me questions and wants me to react, talk about what I like etc, I do like it but I somehow don't continue with it and then he feels off. It's not like I am reserved in any other way except this sort of expression. I share everything else. So am I the asshole for just being how I am? Is there something wrong with me?",

      "description": "So let me start by saying that everyone is entitled to their thoughts and opinions and I don't begrudge anybody for what they think.   \n\n\nSo recently I've been living with a group of new-age types (we're all late 20s) who often offer eachother medical advice in terms of ayurvedic, spiritual and various other alternative medical ideas. I don't think these ideas are helpful in terms of reality and will often join in the conversation by explaining how experimentation and science works and always cover myself with the knowledge that I don't know everything - they seem to be offended by my mere mentioning of the fact that for example. candida, which most everybody has in their gut, can be treated with anti-fungal cream when causing thrush in the mouth or... you know where - then I further explained that if it was in their blood that it would be a legitimate medical emergency.  \n\n\nThis is where the potential assholery comes into play. Last night one of my housemates (the most spiritual one) had a word with me about it, basically saying that although I'm entitled to my opinion, I'm no more right than anybody else and that everybody is getting upset with my \"trying to one up them\" when from my perspective I'm just (non-aggressively) giving the general scientific medical reason for things and saying to look up peer-reviewed studies and the like to get a less biased view. I've started just asking questions about their superstitions etc to see if I can get them to see the errors in their logic and clearly they've picked up on this as an attack.   \n\n\nSo, AITA? Should I just keep my mouth shut and let them reinforce eachother's distrust of science and ignorance of how it works or should I go about it in a different way? If so, what way?",

      "description": "This is a throwaway account because reasons. On mobile so sorry for formatting if it’s an issue. \n\nAbout 3 years ago, I was diagnosed with HSV1, or ‘oral’ herpes. \n\nThe fun thing thing about herpes is that there are two types and you can get either HSV1 (oral) or HSV2 (genitals) but you can get either type on either your mouth or on your genitals. Each type is more commonly found on the respective body parts, but it’s possible to have oral herpes on your genitals and genital herpes on your mouth. \n\nMy question is because I have oral herpes, but on my genitals. \n\nI haven’t told my boyfriend about my condition. My reasoning is that if I had oral herpes on my mouth, I wouldn’t bother sitting him down for a big chat about it. It’s such a common condition and there’s no stigma for people with oral herpes on their mouths. I know some of those people do disclose with their partners before kissing them etc, but I find that unecessary.\n\nMy doctor told me that because I have HSV1 on my genitals and not HSV2, the risk of transmission to my boyfriends genitals are even lower than normal. Oral herpes doesn’t spread to the genitals as easily as genital herpes does. \n\nI never sleep with my boyfriend when I’m having an outbreak. I would have told him if I were diagnosed with HSV2 on my genitals, or my mouth cos I go down on him. \n\nI hope that makes sense - and my question is Am I An Asshole for not telling him? ",

I stopped but I still sat next to her (too late to move at that point).\n\nI know it's an \"unspoken rule\" or whatever to not sit right next to people in a lecture hall that isn't full, but I can't really chat with someone sitting multiple seats down without yelling. AITA for sitting next to her?",

      "description": "First of all, this is long so thank you to anyone who takes the time to read it. \n\nMy fiance and I have been in a relationship for about 3 years now and our relationship is truly a dream. We're best friends, never argue, always caring towards each other and finding entertainment in the boring moments in life, and have lots of similar interests. But, sexually, I find our relationship very lacking. \n\nFor some background, I'm your typical late 20's dude. I have a pretty strong sex drive, but nothing crazy. I'm perfectly fine going days, and even weeks without us having sex. But eventually, it takes it's toll. She, mid 20's, by comparison, has an extremely low sex drive. \n\nWe've talked about her lack of a sex drive, and she blames it on her birth control, which I suggested her looking into other methods but it didn't seem to interest her at all. \n\nThe main issues are : \n\n1) She NEVER initiates sexual activity. If anything happens, I start it. I have experimented before and decided not to initiate any of that activity to see how long it would take her, and after 3 weeks I gave in. \n\n2) She never does anything but standard sex, ie; vaginal penetration. In the 3 years we've been together I've gotten maybe 5 blowjobs. That's to completion. Occasionally during foreplay, when that happens, she will perform oral for maybe a minute or less before moving on. \n\nWhen we do have sex, it's great, and she enjoys it, but it's like it's something that is not important to her at all and she forgets it's even a thing. \n\nSo yes I know, talk to her, but like I said this isn't a very easy subject to talk about because we are both pretty awkward about it, especially her. (she had only been with one other partner when we started dating, and had never given oral before) \n\nSo I started writing her emails when we are working in our offices because it's an easier way for us to talk about this kinda stuff without the awkward face to face. G\n\nEvery few months when I get really sexually frustrated, I'll write one of these long emails and explain things to her. I've explained to her that oral is something I really enjoy, and that I would like her to initiate things sometimes as well because if I'm the only one doing it it makes me feel like she doesn't really want it.\n\n I've asked her what it is she doesn't enjoy about doing it, and if there's anything I can do to make it more enjoyable for her, and of course always return the favor. \n\nWhenever this happens, she'll write back explaining she understands and will try to do that more and so on, and usually that night she will and for a day or two after she'll make more of an effort, but then it starts over again, and it's like I never wrote anything. \n\nThen a few months later when I finally can't take it, I'll write again and the cycle starts over. \n\nOf those 5 full blowjobs I've gotten, only two of them were spontaneous acts and not the direct response to me saying something, which makes me feel like I'm forcing her to do something she doesn't want to do.\n\nWhen I ask her what she doesn't like about it, she seemed very honest when she said she doesn't mind doing it at all and there's no reason she isn't doing it other than she, \"doesn't know if I want her to do it or not\" or \"doesn't know if I'm in the mood.\" To which I told her, \"I'm always in the mood for that, just do it.\" \n\nBut still nothing. I feel awful having such a problem with this part of our relationship because everything else is so good, but it is very frustrating to tell her something over and over, albeit through email, just for nothing to change. \n\nPossibly even more frustrating is that she will tease me quite often, such as talk about doing oral while we're doing something where that isn't an option (in a restaurant, etc), or say something similar in a flirty way, or make jokes about doing something naughty, but then nothing comes of it which really kicks the disappointment up a notch. \n\nFor instance, tonight, as we were lying on the couch she pulled down my shorts and kissed my thigh and then touched me for a minute, before pulling my shorts back up. So then I started cuddling with her, now in the mood, and then right when I start to touch her breasts she decides she needs to clean up the dishes from dinner. It was in a very casual way, not like a sassy tease or that she didn't want to do anything, just that was on her mind at the time and not sex. This happens a lot. Again, it sounds like she's avoiding sex, but it's just that sex is the lowest thing on her priority list. \n\nI do my absolute best to always make her feel sexy and confident. She tells me the same and is always complimenting me unsolicited, but her actions make me feel very unsexy. \n\nWhen she asked me what I wanted for Christmas, I told her, \"a blowjob.\" She laughed and asked me what I really wanted to which I repeated that. She then said, \"That's not a present, you can get that anytime, what do you want for real,\" I got frustrated at that because no that is not something I can get at anytime without bluntly saying \"Do this\", and for me that is not sexy forcing someone you love to do something they potentially don't want to do. \n\nSo I'm not sure where to go from here and if I'm in the wrong for even feeling this way. \n\nAnd before anyone says, \"Oh, she's probably cheating.\" Or anything like that, trust me that's not it. We are best friends, and we both work from home, we are with each other almost 24/7 and there are zero red flags in that area. (I've been cheated on before, and she has been like this the entire time we've been together)\n\n",

My dad was paying and ordering (we’re broke teenagers), and we were having such a good time that it totally slipped our minds to get her some pizza.

I said it again, louder, since the heat in her room can be loud at times and I was sure she just couldn’t hear me. She just started yelling at me, and then went downstairs to yell at my dad.

      "title": "AITA for firing my brother?",
      "description": " \n\n\\[Apologies for the length, writing this turned out to be somewhat cathartic for me\\]\n\nI am a senior manager at a moderately well-known software firm in the Bay Area. A few years ago, I made a fateful decision to hire my wife’s younger brother (I will call him Jim, because every Jim I’ve ever known has been awesome)  after he approached me offering to work as a systems administrator. This was under the pretext that while he was doing well in his current company, he lacked growth opportunities and was seeking a change. By this point, Jim and I were best friends, we shared common interests and views, I was even best man at his wedding. I knew that he was more than skilled enough to handle the role so I gave him the job.\n\nThings went pretty well for about a year, Jim helped on various projects and got along well-enough with everyone, but after a while things began to change. Jim would frequently miss work for various reasons, projects and commitments began to slip and overall results were getting worse and worse. I counseled Jim on multiple occasions trying to turn the behavior around and each time he would acknowledge the issue, and commit to correcting it. Unfortunately things only got worse, he began not showing up for work more regularly, often times without providing any notice of his absence which left project stakeholders asking me “Where’s Jim” pretty regularly. \n\nThis peaked about 10 months after the problems began when Jim just went AWOL for an entire week - no warning, no phone call - just didn’t show up and didn’t answer calls. While I was initially worried for his safety, I found out through a mutual friend that he just wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t make it to work or even manage to contact us. When Jim returned to work the next week, I sat him down and put him on a formal performance plan under the direction of our department’s executive leadership and the company’s HR department. The plan was simply “show up on time, or contact us before your scheduled start time if you will not be showing up” with all of the standard HR speak about “failure to comply will lead to further disciplinary action, including termination of employment”. \n\nThis seemed to correct the behavior for about three weeks, Jim was on time and working hard every day. Then on Monday of the fourth week, Jim just didn’t show up in the morning. My boss asked me what I planned to do and I said that I would find out if there was a reasonable explanation and make a determination based on that. When Jim appeared at the office around midday he said that he was sorry and that he had tried to send an E-mail the night before but the message got stuck in his phone’s outbox (Did I mention part of Jim’s role at the company was management of the E-mail systems…). Given the improvement I had seen in the past three weeks I asked my boss to let this slide as an honest mistake. Thursday of the same week rolled around, and there was no Jim to be found in the morning. Jim arrived again around midday with the excuse that his phone’s battery ran down and he missed his alarm. This was it, my boss asked me again what I planned to do and I immediately got with HR to begin an exit plan. \n\nEven through this, I tried to get Jim everything I could to soften the blow. I got him six weeks severance, and the ability to publicly resign so save face. John accepted the offer and left. \n\nThis is where things get a little weird.\n\nJim seems to have lost his mind as a result, or was perhaps losing his mind already and I just noticed the results as poor work performance and lack of professionalism. Jim immediately took to trashing my character to anyone who would listen to him. He told family, and mutual friends alike that I had fired  him with no warning and without reason, he said that it was some “cold, calculated career move” with a goal of making me more money (I never understood how this was supposed to work). He even tried to convince my wife (his sister) of this crazy story and when she told him that she was fully aware of the issues he’d been causing at work Jim completely shut her out of his life and refused to talk to her again.\n\nThis continued on for a few years. My wife was furious at her brother and said she didn’t care to speak to him again, though I sensed she was also very sad about it. After some time though, I felt guilty that my wife lost her brother over this insanity and tried to find some way to at least get her back in contact with him. I found an ally in a mutual friend and after lots of effort managed to arrange a meeting for Jim, his wife, my wife and myself where I hoped we could finally bridge the gap.\n\nThat meeting eventually turned into one of the strangest social interactions of my life. After the initial small-talk was dispatched with we got to the matter at hand. Jim said that he was willing to just put everything in the past and move on like nothing ever happened as long as we never mentioned it again. Oh and this time he would totally not just shut his sister out for no reason at all. This did not satisfy my wife though and so we pressed a bit for some kind of explanation or acknowledgment of what happened. Anytime we would try to bring up any aspects of what happened, Jim’s behavior was bizarre - he would bury his face into his hands, he would gasp or groan like we were causing him physical pain, and when he could manage he would start to cry. Jim said that because he had been through a tough childhood, that he couldn’t talk about things that happened in his past at all because it just brought up to much other painful stuff from his past. His wife was very convinced by his display, patting him and rubbing his back to comfort him.\n\nWhile it’s true that his childhood was tough as a result of an abusive narcissistic mother, that had absolutely nothing to do with what we were there to discuss. It also completely ignores the fact that my wife was in the same situation, arguably worse as the older sister. This whole theatrical display pissed my wife off something serious, she said that he was just blaming their (admittedly awful) mother for his failings and using their childhood as a shield from any responsibility. She said that if he can’t ever talk about or reflect on his past then it sounded like he could never be responsible for anything he ever did wrong and that people like that are dangerous like their mother. We have children now and my wife is determined to keep them away from her mother, and she now sees to much parallel in her brother’s behavior to risk staying in contact with him too.\n\nSo here I am /r/AmITheAsshole my wife has penned a farewell letter to her brother asking that he never again tries to contact her for any reason. I managed to convince her to not send that letter during the holidays, but that time has now passed and she is still resolved. I don’t know what else I could have done, but I feel guilty that my hiring Jim caused my wife to lose her brother. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**: I hired my wife’s brother Jim. Jim turned into a flake on the job. I fired Jim. Jim lost his mind. Jim wouldn’t speak to us for years. I Tried to reconcile. Jim contracted “past-itis”. My wife never wants to speak to Jim again. I feel like TA.",

      "description": "So hey y’all I have a story for you! So recently me and my friends in our group chat have had drama of sorts and over all it’s really annoying. I’m really bad at formatting my thoughts so excuse the run on sentences lol. Anyway, so the other day me and my friends started talking about pyromaniacs for some reason and I mentioned how basically Codey (the main guy I’m talking about) described Michael Baye. But he retorted in quote “Um actually that’s a pyrotechnic, you might wanna look that up” which sorry I guess.. this has actually happened before when we talk about other subjects. Whenever me or other people in the chat talk about a game or comic he always says that he is the only TRUE fan of the subject (mind you true fans don’t really exist, like for example you can be a fan of a band and only like one or two of their songs). Like one time we where going to draw our Pokémon teams (because this chat is an art chat even though we never post art lol) and there was a rule for no legendary Pokémon, and then he says “What about Mystic Pokemon?” I say “Well they are technically legendary if they aren’t commonly found, so I would say no.” And after that the man goes on a rant on how they don’t count as legendarys and holy shit it was annoying to read. Luckily my friend Elizabeth (the saint she is) said it was alright just so he could have a challenge because tbh he isn’t the best at art.. So back to the pyromaniac thing after we talked about it a bit he said “True I guess that’s the same thing.” I was kinda ticked of and tired so I typed “I was about to go on a small rant on how much of a narc you can be sometimes but I’ll drop it.” And right after I sent that he said “ Excuse me, narcissistic?? I care about few people in this world, and sometimes I'm not one of those” so him wanting to continue the conversation I said quote “Im just saying you get on your high horse thinking your smarter than everyone else, but then when we retort with you have no comeback (at least one that’s not a curse word) And you also take things to seriously too, like when we talk about some game or some shit you think you know everything and believe me it gets annoying, when I think about it your like a Gray( his gf) 2.0 with less triggers and swearing, Jesus like dude get a life man.” Which thinking back on it it was kinda mean but I said what I wanted to say and even the people in the group (besides Codey) said we should probably just chill out, I said I was signing off and going to bed(and yeah I kinda only said those things because was tired) and when I wake up this is what I’m greeted to from Codey “Hey,let me kick you where it'll fucking hurt, At least I still have parents to love me.” Mind you my parents are dead.. so for me calling him a narc and his girlfriend annoying I have my dead parents brought up to make him look better??? And the people who where in the chat at the time where like “Dude like that was hella unnecessary and a total low blow.” And he just ignored them and kept going on on going saying “Look, I'm not as sorry as I probably should be, but when you decide to pick on someone you know damn well can't help their problems (Gray), then who's being a complete shit bag, she goes to me for shit you guys don’t even help her with. Which man I understand you wanna help and defend your girlfriend but dude like not my fault she has some mental issues that are seriously not being taken cared of properly and sorry I sometimes joke about your untouchable goddess that you yourself think you can save and take care of yourself with no mental medical experience. Look I have know his gf way WAY longer than he has and since they got together I have seen some regression in her, she now has ticks and triggers that she has never had before and I can’t talk to her without triggering her about something like I’m not saying it’s his fault but when two people with problems and issues it can become toxic and I don’t want that for either of them really. So know it feels so awkward talking to either of them because both him and his gf (who even isn’t in he chat btw because of a kinda unrelated story) think I’m an asshole just for stating my opinion on their character, am I though because I feel guilty from what I said.. The other peeps in the chat say I was in the right but could have been handled better, Idk I just what your opinion.",

      "description": "Found out that I (24f) was pregnant after a perfect relationship with a great man (31) a few weeks ago. We were really great together and had everything going for us; it really feels like i met my soulmate 8 months ago. EVERYTHING changed the minute we found out I was pregnant. We did not plan this pregnancy; something went wrong with bc. He has a carrier and I have a job, but we have seperate houses and I really would like to get married before moving in together. Also, very important, I used drugs while being pregnant (unknowingly); I do not live a healthy lifestyle and so is he.\n\nAt first we were shocked and we decided to make an appointment for an ultrasound at the clinic. This story could go on and on; because everything you can imagine going wrong in the process, did go wrong. I won't bother you guys with all of that but imagine the clusterfuck of a liftetime which really, really traumatised the both of us. We are both deeply hurt. We told our familly and close friends about the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a week I changed my mind; I wanted to keep the baby. We had A LOT of arguments and I know I was not very reasonable, hormonal... I was a downright bitch, I'm not proud of my behaviour. He was scared and stoic; would not look further than his own opinions and would not listen to my arguments. I got the abortion pills and wanted time to clear my mind. He did not like that. I told him it was against my will, but; I took the first pill (with a lot of drama). I felt horrible and could not do anything for days. I was insecure and his (fulltime) care, felt like pity. It was a caregiver-patient relationship and not a loving one as we used to have.\n\nI told him that I needed confirmation for his love for me. He told me he knew nothing right now, that his love for me changed over the last two weeks and that he could not choose for me. He was afraid I would keep the baby against his will, although I said, every moment possible, that I see it as a joined decision.\n\nI gave him an ultimatum; to tell me the following morning that he would stand by me and go for it together in the future. But instead; he dropped me off at home with all my belongings and told me that when I had such high demands, he didn't want to be with me.\n\nSo, now I'm sitting here alone crying while bleeding in my appartment for the loss of the baby, my man and the awesome life we've lived together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for giving my boyfriend an ultimatum?",

      "description": "So he was doing curls with like 15-25s and actually flexing in the mirror after every set. But he was putting his weights on the top rack on top of other dumbbells and it kept being the weights I needed so every time I went to grab my weight there was another set of dumbbells on top of them, so I kept picking them up and putting them back in their place in the rack rather than in front of the guy. It got kind of tense and I could tell everyone around noticed and thought it was funny and on my side. Nothing happened from there but now I’m wondering did I like.... bully this dude? For the record, the 15-25s for curls is not to say he was small, he definitely has been going to the gym a while but was just doing this weirdly easy workout and just ‘mirin himself",

      "description": "Tlde at bottom\n\n\nOkay, ill tell a little bit of back story. We've been friends for a long time, around 6 years i think. We have a group of friends who are all weirdos, so we like to fuck around a lot. This particular friend, lets call him John, took my other friend his phone (it was unlocked). He pointed it at me so i made a \"funny\" face. And i mean a really really freaking dumb face. He showed it to me(it was on snapchat) and started clicking on people. For the people that dont know how snapchat works: you make a picture, select people and then send it to the selected people, the picture isn't saved unless you screenshot it (you get messaged when someone screenshots it). He selected ALL the people on my friends phone. That is not 5 or 10 people, he send it to i guess 50 people. Mind that this is a very awkward picture of me. He send this to a lot of people i know, dont know or barely know. I thought he selected it for fun but wouldn't do it. I made it very! clear i didnt wanted him to send the picture. Picture was send, i felt shit all day. That was around a week ago. Then today, i forgot about what had happened. When I suddenly get a message from the group chat with my 4 best friends. Its that picture of me, i told John not to send. This time i got pretty angry, told him to piss off and that it isn't funny. Aita here for getting mad at him? \n\nTldr; got really mad at a friend for sending a really emberassing picture of me to atleast 50 people.\n\nSorry if there are any grammar or spelling mistakes.

      "description": "I was in the supermarket the other day, waiting in line at the self service checkout. I had been there a minute or two when I noticed one of the checkouts was being ignored/overlooked by everyone else in the queue in front of me - I assumed it was because it was contactless only. I looked at the people in front of me in the queue - there were 3 or 4 of them, and they all had full enough baskets, or were buying expensive enough items, that I was fairly confident they wouldn't be able to pay by contactless because of the £30 limit. I then asked \"Is anyone planning on using the contactless checkout?\" There were various negative grunts, and the guy at the front of the queue said to go for it - so I did.\n\n\nI was there for all of 5 seconds before a woman called out at me in a venomous voice saying \"Excuse me, people are waiting!?\". I stammered a little, and said that no one had gone to this checkout for a minute or two, I assumed because of the contactless payment requirement. (Also, for the record, I'm about 95% sure this lady wasn't in front of me in the queue, I had no idea where she came from). She then told me \"Well I was heading there actually\". I immedietly apologised and offered to step aside - I hadn't yet scanned my one item, so there wouldn't have been any problem if she had wanted to use the checkout. She then got a little quieter (she had been talking loudly and sharply before) and told me to go ahead - I asked if she was sure, and when she confirmed it I did just that.\n\nSo, was I the asshole for skipping 3 or 4 people in the queue to get to the checkout with special requirements everyone was overlooking? Writing it out and remembering the facts I feel like I wasn't, but I'm not sure, and was a little taken aback by the confrontational way I was called out - so I thought I'd check with you lovely people!",

      "description": "Hello everyone! So for the last year or so I have completely cut off all contact with my mother and step-father.\n\nFor a long time my mother was actually my inspiration of independence, strong will and a model of free thinking, in about 2009 she married a man who we will refer to as SF for Step-Father. SF is undoubtedly in my opinion a horrid person. I know this may seem bias, which is why I'm here.\n\nAbout a year ago I was asked to babysit my half brothers overnight, which isn't a big deal at all. They're wonderful kids and being on the spectrum as well, I relate to them very well (bless their hearts). When came time the next day came for them to be picked up, I had been told they might be a half hour or so late, no big deal. Well over 2 hours pass, and I have work in less than an hour. I ask if they'd be able to make it before I needed to leave, and from here I will give the texts that ensued: M is mother, SF is Step father, U is uncle and Me is Me\n\nMe: Hey guys, so I do have leave for work in about 20 minutes or so. Will you guys be able to make it by then?\n\nSF (and me assuming this is my mother texting): ToxicWaste, you're grown up, put on your big boy pants and figure it out, we're not going to hold your hand. \n\nMe: Wow, mom. I do have a job to go to. I want to figure this out but I'm not just going to drop them off wherever. \n\nSF: this is SF and you will not disrespect your mother like this or I will come give you something to respect if I have to get it out of you. Now figure it out and stop being a little shit.\n\nMe: SF, do not threaten me like that, or the police will be the ones I call. \n\nI called my uncle who was more than happy to come get them. The incident seemed to have blown over until I got a text from my mom that night.\n\nM: You really need to apologize for SF for what you said to him, we aren't going to pay you until you do. That was disrespectful.\n\nMe: I was trying to figure out a plan, I couldn't have been as late as I heard you were (around 3 hours after texting me). I won't apologize for calling SF out on acting like a child and threatening me AGAIN.\n\nM: you know SF has problems and you don't make them any better by acting like that. \n\nMe: Bull, I have dealt with his issues for years and been told its everyone's fault but his, and I'm tired of you standing up for this, especially when he threatened me.\n\nM: You're being immature, text me when you're not so angry then and we can talk about you apologizing.\n\nMe: I'm sorry mom but I'm not apologizing for being threatened by a grown man, and if that's how you want this resolved, then I'm done, do not contact me further.\n\nEver since this incident I've received countless voicemails from my mother telling me that it's my fault our relationship fell apart, that my little brothers are suffering from not seeing me as well as my mother telling me that her recent mental depression is solely due to me cutting her out.

He is constantly dropping/ spilling/ breaking things to the point where its starting to really bug me. He has broken several of my own things, usually with no apologies (although I think this is due to his own frustration/embarrassment rather than actually not being sorry) and spills drinks constantly.  Our fridge has several pen holders on top and on the doors and he is constantly knocking them off, while neither myself nor our roommate has ever done it. He knocked one of my picture frames off the wall and completely ruined it, and then bought me a new one and knocked that one off too. He is also just kind of messy and careless about everything like cooking and such. I just feel like he could be more careful if he tried, but he just doesn’t care or see an issue. Would it be mean to bring this up or is it something people cant control even if they try? I love him but its driving me bonkers after two years and I cant imagine spending the rest of my life like this but I also feel like its silly and kind of petty... help me out!!",

When I came to (still pretty drunk) there were 5 or so people there still, including, the two guys whose house it was, a friend of a friend (let's call him Tarzan), and a girl Tarzan had a crush on (let's call her Dopey). \nI woke up because the three stooges mentioned above were trying to wake up Dopey, who remained deeply passed out. After some back and forth it was decided that Dopey needed medical attention, but the hospital was too far away to walk.\nIt turned out that I was the only one with a working car, which was a stick shift, and the only one able to drive manual. So, after Moe and Curly lost interest and Tarzan pleaded with me, I helped carry Dopey down to my car. \nAt the time, all parties involved were still underage. So, not wanting 3 drunk minors in the car if I got pulled over, I left Tarzan in the trees as I went to town.\nSo, the real point of this post. When I got to the hospital, I opened the door, pushed Dopey out, honked several times, and drove back home and went to sleep.",

      "description": "So we're at one of the public campgrounds in Shenandoah National Park, my wife myself and my one year old toddler. It was no joke about 4:30 in the morning when the campsite catty-corner to us started going nuts. Apparently this campsite was two families that were friends. The first family had a four year old girl who was screaming bloody murder while their parents pulled a Ned Flanders \" we've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas\" and just let the girl go off for about an hour. \n\nThis woke up the other family who had three young boys. This family was the exact opposite, complete micro managing helicopters, screaming at their young boys \"Griffin! Sully! Griffin! stop! Griffin! Griffin! Sully! Sully just ignore him!\" This went on for hours until about 7 a.m. no joke every hour I must have heard the word Griffin or Sully yelled about a hundred times when these little boys weren't doing anything but running around having fun in a very safe place. It was driving me crazy and woke up my toddler.\n\nI'll admit by then I was delirious with lack of sleep and a tiny bit hungover. So I exited the tent at about 7 a.m. and decided to poke a little fun at them. I sort of scream whispered at my wife as I set up camp Griffin Griffin Griffin Griffin over and over and over again. We were both laughing our butts off including my toddler. I know these people heard me and probably felt pretty bad, they ended up quickly packing and leaving shortly after that. I really couldn't help myself though. It was just ridiculous what these people were doing so early in the morning at a huge Campground. This is now running joke every time we go camping to yell over and over again Griffin Griffin Griffin.\n\nSo what do you guys think am I the asshole?",

After a month of staying at the hospital, she finally had been allowed to return home on 28th January this year. Since then, I stayed at my gramma's home to help and take care of her.\n\nMe, my cousin, and a few of my aunts were responsible to help and tend her bcuz the other cousins were either working, or still studying.It wasn't an easy task obviously, because we were shorthanded. The ones that always helped out was 3 of my aunts including myself and my cousin. All of us were female bcuz my gramma didn't want to hire a nursemaid(?) and she preferred her own daughters \n\nAfter almost 3 weeks of staying there, I had to go back home for awhile bcuz my sister is going back to further her studies ans no one would be able to tend the things at home. So, I went back home for jst 2 weeks (I think) and returned back on 1st March bcuz my mOm forced me and if i were to say no, it would be rude bcuz it wud seem like i dont wanna help take care of my gramma. And on that very damned day, I had my panic attack. But still, I was forced to stay at my grandma's house again.\n\nIve had a few other problems including this whole thing about taking care of my grandma. I cant even release my tension bcuz THERE IS LITERRALY NOWHERE IN THIS HOME TO CRY ALONE WITHOUT PPL KNOWING. If i want to go out with my friends I cant bcuz my childish aunt thinks that its a bad thing to go out with your friends. I cant even go back home without feeling guilty. I dont enjoy doing the things I had once enjoyed bfore. Nowadays i always have heart palpitations. Theres not much that can help me retain my sanity rn. Not if I were to stay in this toxic environment.\n\nI cant rely my OWN family. My father RARELY talks to me. If i were to talk to my mom instead, I would jst break down and cry or get angry bcuz shes not the type who would listen carefully to my situation. Even if I were to succesfully get through her, in the end she would jst say \" Remember god, pray to god.\" Jst like any other of the ppl i talked to, said. Same goes my Oldest sister. My brother always prioritise his own friends first and dont give a shit about me. And my other sister that i can kinda depend on is somewhere else rn.\n\nI feel suffocated living at my grandma's house rn and i feel like running away from here. But shes my only grandma thats left. However, I dont think i can keep myself up at this point.\n\n(Sorry if this doesnt make much sense)",

      "description": "\nOk so Im about 13 when this happened and my stepmom had gotten married to my dad about a year ago when she moved in. I had a pillow that my dad gave to me and it had quite a sentimental value. I get I’m too old to have a pillow around and have a connection to it, but IMO that’s something I should grow out of. It looked kinda gross because it was quite aged but I didn’t think much of it. I came home one night looking for my pillow in my bed, come to find out my stepmom had taken it. And thrown it away. My room was in the basement and my door was shut, so this was obviously a planned attack. She had previously told me that I am too old to have a pillow, but that was not her call to make. So I sent her a text saying\n\n“Your lack of respect for my boundaries is honestly pathetic. I wouldn’t want you as a friend, much less a mother with how you’ve treated us overtime. You need to learn to treat others the way you want to be treated. I grew up taught that, and I’d like to assume you were too. Treat me with respect, or you’ll always be a stranger to me. I’ve attempted to make you feel involved and show care for you, but I’ve seen almost nothing in return, I’ve spoken to dad but nothing has changed. Even he agrees it was way out of line for you to throw out MY pillow. “\n\nI then talked to my father and he pretty much said that she was very hurt by the message (it was not uncommon of her to twist things around and make me the bad guy.) and I understand it may of been a little bit rough to send but it was also a retaliation to what she said. So she proceeded to ignore me and actually didn’t want to come home that night because she felt “so hurt by my horrible message” it’s been about a week and I am still being ignored, although I am not attempting to engage conversation with her because I am quite hurt from what she did. Was what I said too much? Thanks for reading",

CG forgot about the whole thing in a day but idk if the class still hates BFK for being \"a bad preson\" (he didnt do anything)\ni apolegized to BFK and he just went away, i lost one of my best friends and i feel really bad.\n\nAITA for saying BFK hates you while being half asleep?\nis BFK the ass for not forgiving telling me to kys and attacking me?\n\nis the class the ass for beliving CG?\nidk ",

      "description": "For some background my friend is slowly becoming recognized by swimsuit companies on Instagram. We talked about it a lot and I said go for it, you can get paid to post pics so why not? She chooses to accept a few offers and posts a couple pics in the company’s swim suits. \n\nHer pictures look highly edited. I mean looks like the swim suit top is copy and pasted on. Her face looks like it was blurred a crap ton in an editing app. You’ve all probably seen poorly edited pictures where the person is trying to cover face flaws with a super blurred effect and it looks terrible. Well that’s what this looks like. Eyes look edited, the whole shebang. I asked my boyfriend if I should say something after she posted the first picture and he said “No, just let her live her best life” so I said nothing. She posted another one the next day that was even worse. I showed him and he totally agreed and I decided to reach out. She’s like my best friend and I didn’t want her to look bad online, especially since it’s for a deal with the swimsuit company, ya know? \n\nHere’s where I think I messed up. I message her and imbedded in the message I say “I can see the siting a lot and as a friend I thought I’d let you know it’s VERY noticeable.” That part was cushioned by other nice things but reflecting on it, it seems bad. She claims that she didn’t edit the picture. \n\nThe part that makes me feel worse is that she said others are saying it. I check her page and no mean comments are there. I checked the swimsuit brand’s page and they reposted her picture and the top two comments are about the entire thing being photoshopped and how it looks like her swimsuit is copy and pasted on, etc. Someone even said the sunset was photoshopped. She says because so many people are saying it that she’s going to stop posting. I don’t want her to stop, this is such an amazing opportunity. AITA for saying they look edited? Thanks in advance! \n\nTLDR: friend is kind of frustrated with me after saying her pictures look edited. Other random people online have said the same thing. AITA?\n\n",

It's funny and I think any normal person should be able to find the humor in the joke and know that I don't actually think she is physically bloblike. \n\nShould probably clarify that I'm referencing the classic horror movie from the 50s or whenever even though I haven't actually seen it.

      "description": "On mobile, apologies in advance. Also, this is kinda long so please forgive me!\n\nSo last week my friend bought me lunch. He asked if I wanted to go out for Chinese. I really didn't want to, as I am currently trying to stay away from junk food as much as possible (I'm going to basic training for the army in summer so I'm trying to watch my body). I politely declined, saying I preferred if we could eat in the lunch room of our school, which I know it's school food and all, but it isn't junk food for the most part. He began guilt tripping me saying things like \"Fine, I guess I'll just eat alone then\" and \"Wow, so you're really gonna do me like that?\"  I didn't wanna make a big deal out of it so I accepted. We went out to a Chinese place and got our food. Keep in mind I explained to him why I didn't wanna go out for junk food in the first place. He ordered a big platter for both of us. Not wanting to seem like an asshole, I ate as little as possible, but a decent amount. As we were leaving, he teased me for \"not eating enough\" and that if I wasn't that hungry in the first place I should have let him know. I kept quiet, but I was beginning to get annoyed. I promised to buy him lunch this week as thanks. Over the weekend, I talked to my mom about my little brother's situation. He's had his SSN stolen by someone for a while now and has no medical insurance because of it. He recently went to the hospital for shots he needed, and we ended up having to pay out of our pockets. We are a lower middle class working family. My mom is an accountant and I work Saturdays in a warehouse packing vegetables and cleaning, and don't get paid until wednesday. Keep this in mind for later. We have to cut costs because we don't make enough combined to cover the bill easily. I relayed this to the group chat consisting of my closest friends. My friend above is in this group chat and read my texts. Now, today, I go to my locker to get my things for my next class, right before lunch. He appears, and as I close my locker, asks where we're going for lunch. I tell him the lunch room. He gets confused and says \"don't you get your paycheck today?\" I feel insulted. \"Yeah, but I told you guys, I gotta help my mom out.\" He nods and says \"Oh. But you promised me lunch last week?\" At this point, i feel hurt and angry. In my calmest voice I say \"I did. But I also explained to you guys the whole situation with my brother.\" He looks at me and goes \"Oh right. Let's go then.\" he then hurried off ahead of me. He seemed distant throughout lunch today and only responded in grunts. I am beginning to question our friendship. ",

      "description": "I work in an office at a hospital doing research for a doctor (we’ll call him boss) there is another doctor that handles clinical research (calling him the man). The man also has his team of clinical researchers who are in med school. There is this college student (calling him Stu) who comes by once a week to help menial tasks. Stu actually works for the man, I do not work for the man but we work in the same department and speak often (good guy), somehow Stu ended up with me to do work. So I give him his assignment each week if we have any usually basic data entry stuff. I am just a guy supervising him that hands him the assignment and tells him how to do it. I have no firing ability or anything like that. \n\nThe man apparently told Stu that if there’s nothing for me to give him then he can just study on company time… Also sidenote, Stu’s father is a doctor at a different hospital but is in the same field as my department, Stu’s two older brothers have also gone through the med school and are involved with my department at my hospital. So Stu is a legacy with med school aspirations.  \n\nSo I have been working with Stu for about 8-10 months now and I have already formed my opinion on this dude. When he first started working with me he did fine and would complete his tasks. I had a new assignment that I needed him to complete basically setting up a research database. It was a lot of work but it would keep him busy. He was good about doing this for several weeks maybe a month then I noticed this thing is not getting done. Toward the end of the semester I noticed that he is pretty slack in that he is usually late or sometimes just doesn’t show up at all. \n\nSo he never finished his assignment and my boss was starting to ask for this to be done. Bossman was aware that Stu hasn’t been the best about things. I ended up having to take over the assignment as well as get another researcher involved to get this done. My opinion is that Stu’s college education comes first but when he’s here he needs to do the assignments I hand him first. If he can’t show up to my work then go do something else. So he’s failed my test at this point. \n\nHe goes home for the summer and I wanted to see more out of him this fall semester. When he came back for the fall semester I spoke with him and said what day/time works best for you? He says Friday at 2 pm. Great, this is the time I expect you to be here every week! I hand him another assignment, simpler and less work for him. Basically he’s not getting much work from me unless he can prove himself or boss tells me to give him more. Things were fine in the beginning, I didn’t have much work for him but it’s been picking up the last month or two. Almost every week he texts him and asks if he can come in…. Yes dude come in. Ok I can be there at 2. Yes dude, we agreed to this time. Almost without fail, 2 pm rolls around and he is always late by 10-15 mins. That’s fine, just glad you showed up and I hand him his assignment. Some weeks he does not bother to text me to let me know he is not coming in that Friday. Some days he comes in at 3. Whenever he’s here, he almost does the bare ass minimum that I ask of him. \n\nYesterday, Stu has been missing for several weeks and I never contact him to ask where he is anytime he does this….If he wants to be here and work he can contact me because I don’t really need this guy. I feel like I have to babysit this guy and this guy can’t show up on time. He texts me yesterday (Friday) saying “hey can I come in.” Me: Yes come in. Stu: I’ll be there at 3. Me: Ok but I’m leaving at 3:30. \n\n3 rolls around and there’s no sign of Stu. At 3:15 he shows up. I walk him over to where he can work in our conference room and there is a meeting going on in there. At this point, I think to myself he’s late, I don’t have a way for him to get setup, and I’m leaving in 15 minutes. I don’t want to go overtime and set this guy up even though he’s the one who caused this situation. Frustrated, I finally just say man I can’t get you going today, I’m leaving in 15 minutes. You have got to start showing up earlier at 2 like we agreed upon in order for me to get you setup. He understood and said he’d be here at 2 pm on Monday so I left it at that. \n\nThe thing is he uses my login info to look up patient records in order to do the work. I didn’t want to log him in to everything that’s in my name and then clock out 15 minutes later, leaving him with all of my info.  When my boss and I met regarding this arrangement, he asked if I was cool with him using my info (not really) but I didn’t want to create an issue. \n\nSo am I being the asshole for not getting Stu setup with work? I think he’s an alright guy but when it comes to getting things done as well as being professional, he fucking sucks…. I feel like I have given this guy chances but he just doesn’t seem to get how this job works with me. I simply cannot depend on this guy. Most of the time when you have a job you are supposed to show up at a certain time and if you don’t show up typically you get fired. \n\nI feel trapped because I can’t go to the man and say this guy sucks I don’t want him. I also can’t get rid of this guy which if it were up to me I would have done so. Maybe I need to do a better job of communicating to him my expectations.    \n\nSo am I being an asshole? How can I best handle this? I am trying to protect my ass and keep my job so I cannot screw this up. I feel like I should talk to my boss about this but I don’t want to create an issue even though Stu is the one who has created this. How can I do better and how can I do a better job of managing this guy? I’ve never had to manage a guy and I didn’t think it would be this difficult especially in a professional environment but then he’s a college kid who just turned 21 last week… I fail to understand why he fails to do this other than he is not interested in this. I’m 25 so I’m not that much older than this guy…. Any advice would be helpful or tell me if I’m the asshole! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nI have a guy that I supervise who fails to show up at the agreed time on Fridays. In short he is pretty slack in my opinion and I do not have the ability to fire or do anything with this guy other than hand him his assignment. After missing for several weeks, he texts me yesterday asking if he can come in. I said yes come in. Great I’ll be there at three. (agreed time was at 2 pm) Ok Stu, I’m leaving at 3:30. He shows up at 3:15 and at this point I’m annoyed because 1. Hes late, 2. I don’t have anywhere to put him 3. I leave in 15 minutes. I tell him dude you’re outta luck today, if you want to get work come in earlier at 2 like we talked about. He understood and said he’d be here at 2 Monday….. Am I the asshole? How can I do better at communicating and managing this guy? First time managing someone else. There’s a good chance he won’t be here Monday because in the past he has said he’ll show up on a random day and then never show…. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for all input! \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My (f28) SO (m33)and I have been together for ten years. A few years ago his dad was involved in a very serious car crash, for which he was at fault, and several people in the other vehicle died. \n\nThe case took a really long time to go to court, and by the time it did, we had moved abroad, meaning we weren’t around for the trial. My SO’s brother and sister went to court with their dad every day, and my SO always felt terrible for not being there. It looked quite likely that he would serve jail-time, but in the end he received a suspended sentence.\n\nAt some point during the trial, my SO’s sister (Amy) texted to tell him he was ‘going to be an uncle again’ but it was early days so they were only telling close friends and family. \n\nLater that week, I skyped my mum and she asked how the trial was going. I said SO felt bad for not being there, and even worse now because Amy is pregnant and doing a 300 mile round trip every day to be there for their dad. \n\nA few days later, my SO woke up to a text from Amy saying that what I had done was really out of order and now some woman she barely knows, knows she is pregnant. I honestly had no idea how she could have found out my mum knew, as they live in different towns, don’t know any of the same people, my mum doesn’t have facebook etc. I am also being 100% truthful when I say I did not think my mum knowing would be a problem.\n\nAnyway, it turned out my mum had gone out and bought little outfits for Amy’s other child and my SO’s brother’s kids and sent them to his parents along with a letter saying (amongst other things) that she was thinking of them in this difficult time and at least Amy’s pregnancy was some good news for them. Now I think I probably am the asshole here, but I cannot get past the fact that nobody said thank you to my mother. She is very reclusive and embarrassed by her lack of education, so I know she must have written dozens of drafts and agonised over the letter. She was heartbroken because she had tried to do a kind thing and felt like she had upset everyone. I am still filled with rage thinking about how sad she was. \n\nFurther info: Amy and her mum are not close, while I am very close to my mum and tell her everything, so Amy might not appreciate the fact that me telling her felt very natural to me.\n\nThis happened about three years ago, and I still have a very distant relationship with Amy and we have never talked about it. The reason I am asking now is because since then a lot of my close friends have become pregnant and been very clear about telling nobody before twelve weeks, and I am now realising I was very blase and cavalier about this.\n\nTl;dr - told my mum SIL was pregnant before twelve weeks, mum sent letter and present, SIL called me out of order and never thanked my mother.",

      "description": "A little bit of background information. My father started dating someone a few years back. She seemed pretty nice and my dad ended up proposing in 2018. Since then - and even before the proposal - they have broken up and gotten back together numerous times. More than I can count, and I’m sure I don’t know about every single instance.\n\nThey had a huge blowout around the holidays. Two, actually. To the point where I thought they were done for good. I was wrong and they’re back together, with their wedding changing dates as often as they break up.\n\nIt doesn’t sit well with me how horrible she makes my father feel. We’re not particularly close, but he’s still my dad and I think he deserves better than a relationship fraught with constant arguments. He’s a big boy, I guess, and he can make his own decisions, I just want to watch out for him.\n\nEvery time they would break up or every time my dad would call me absent and on the brink of tears because of something to do with their relationship, I trusted her a bit less and liked her less.\n\nRecently they got back together again and he contacted me asking me if I would write a letter of acknowledgment for her to get her green card.\n\nIt’s not that I won’t do the letter. I’m perfectly fine writing a letter with just facts – when they met, when they started dating, when they got engaged, where she’s from, plain facts – but it would feel disingenuous to write about how good of a person she is and how much I like her.\n\nMy father knows how I feel. We’ve had discussions about it, most recently as a week ago. I don’t know how heavily the immigration process relies on these letters of acknowledgment, so I don’t want to be the reason she is denied citizenship, but I don’t want to embellish and say she’s a wonderful person when I don’t think she is. If I give my honest opinion about her and her personality, it would basically be that I don’t think she’s a war criminal, pretty sure she would pay her taxes, and she can be nice sometimes if she feels like it.\n\nIn the end, I know it’s harsh, but I’m not personally invested in this whole thing. I would feel bad if she got denied citizenship because of a letter I refused to write, or a letter I wrote but didn’t support, but ultimately it has no effect on my life and the only thing I could foresee happening would be feeling a little guilty. That’s why I’m questioning whether I would be the asshole here.\n\nWIBTA if I didn’t write the letter at all? WIBTA if I wrote the letter but purely stated facts?\n",

      "description": "sorry, long post on mobile. \n\nso a little backstory, my grandma died in november from cancer and around the same time her husband broke his hip and had to be moved into rehab/hospice. they lived 9 hours away from us so my mom has spent the last few months getting their affairs in order (wills, finances, home care for grandpa). \n\nsince my mom was dealing with all this, she told everyone the funeral/memorial would be at a later date. i told her i’d go whenever it was. \n\nshe just texted me to tell me the official date of the funeral and i completely broke down. after i committed to go to her funeral, a close friend of mine’s dad died and i went to his funeral. i was never extremely close with him but it was the first funeral i’ve ever been to and i bawled my eyes out the whole time and felt as if i was making a scene and really felt uncomfortably sad and miserable the entire time and felt as if i was detracting from the ceremony. \n\nnow that my mom has told me the actual funeral date for my grandmother and i have actually experienced a funeral, i don’t feel as if i can handle going. i’d have to drive 4 hours home from college, 9 hours to get to my grandmas hometown, go to the funeral, and drive all 13 hours back the next day. \n\naside from that, my life has been a mess recently. my anxiety and depression are the worst they’ve ever been, my school’s counseling services are horrible and i’m barely getting the help i need. i’m falling behind in school and i don’t sleep or eat well. my roommate also just got a dog and we are trying to move soon and i am graduating in december. i have so much on my plate that i cry all the time anyways from stress. \n\ni loved my grandma so much, she was my best friend. she was very understanding and liberal and open and loving. it’s nothing to do with her. \n\nso, knowing everything that i’m dealing with that already has me in an emotionally fragile state, and knowing that funerals make me feel completely horrible, AITA if i choose not to go to my grandmas funeral?

      "description": "My dad and I have never been super close, he and my mum split when I was super young and we didn't have much contact until I was a teen. He seems to have always preferred spending time with my sister over me- organising coffee dates with her without inviting me etc... on top of that he has been rude to my partner for the whole time we've been together (eleven years now.)\n\nI started really getting the shits with him after my daughter was born, he had a tantrum at my sister about how rude I was for not calling him directly after I gave birth (I was in labour for three days. I was pretty wiped by the time she finally came) and since then he has just gotten more and more frustrating  to spend time with.\n\nMy sister has recently started dating a new guy, and has been less available to spend time with dad. He has taken to inviting me, my partner and our now 2yo to spend time with him- great! Grandpa time! However, invariably no matter what we're doing the conversation always comes back.to how my sister is a so slack/ for ignoring him. Today he straight up said she could get fucked after I jokingly said that getting upset about it wouldn't change anything.\n\nI'm tired of dragging my kid out to see him when he will probably ignore her because what he really wants it to bitch at me because he would rather be spending time with with my sister.

      "description": "Recently, i (25f) decided that I would dive headfirst back into online dating. I have a young child (~1) so i did not take this decision lightly. I made a few profiles on different sites and away we go. I made it very clear that I had a child in these profiles as not to waste anybody’s time. \n\nA few weeks ago I started to talking to a guy (30) on one of these websites. We exchange a few messages, he asks me out for coffee and I agree. We meet for coffee, it goes well enough and we agree to arrange a second date. We agree on dinner and a movie for next Saturday, I arrange the necessary childcare and done. \n\nThe other thing I should mention is that he texted me everyday between our first coffee date and what was supposed to be our second date on Saturday. I am not a big texter, I find it pretty exhausting and try to limit the amount of time I spend on my phone. I mentioned this to him on two occasions but it continues, so whatever no big deal we all communicate differently and he seems like an okay guy. \n\nFast forward to Saturday morning. I had plans during the day so was getting my little one and I ready for the day. He texts me at 7am, telling me he is looking forward to our date. At 8:30, he texts me and says his friend has called him about his girlfriend sounding pretty distraught, and that he never does this and he’s sorry but he has to cancel and could we reschedule? I say no problem, I understand and sure text me in a little bit as I have plans this afternoon anyways and we can figure it out. I’m a bit annoyed by this development as I’m not able to just make plans by the seat of my pants but whatever, I move on and have a good day. \n\nHe texts me two days later, asking if I’m good for next Saturday and we can just do it then? Unfortunately, I have no one that can watch my child that day so it’s not going to work. I had thought about it over the past couple days since being cancelled on and since this is a reoccurring theme (being bailed on last minute) I decide maybe it’s too early (and too complicated) for me to date and delete all my dating profiles. I text him this pretty verbatim (minus the part about deleting profiles) and apologize that the timing didn’t work out better. \n\nHe says okay, he’s sorry to hear that but understands. he then texts me two minutes later: “can i ask you something honestly? Are you really not ready to date or is it something I did?”. I respond with no, it’s not something you did, I’m just finding it too difficult to constantly coordinate my schedule with someone so i have decided that this really isn’t for me right now, I thought he was a nice guy and I’m a bit bummed out that again, the timing wasn’t better.\n\nHe then responds “well...okay. As a guy that’s a little frustrating to hear. If that’s truly how you feel, I recommend you get off dating sites. Again, no hard feelings and I wish you the best”. \n\nTo be honest, this is the straw that broke the camel’s back for me that day. I respond “Wow dude - keep your recommendations to yourself. I’m a person just like you that was just trying to get back out there. sometimes it takes a couple tries to see that something isn’t working. Sorry you’re frustrated but we went on one date, so I owe you nothing. Now it’s your arrogance that’s truly turned me off for good”.  No response back, I delete his number and move on. \n\nAITA for a) not making more of an effort to reschedule after he cancelled, and b) sending that last text to him in anger? ",

      "description": "Am I the asshole for reading messages my boyfriend left open, saying he doesn’t love me, when he refuses to tell me himself and would just continue having a shitty relationship instead of ending?\n\nopened up my laptop this morning (note, it’s my laptop, not his, i wasn’t using his private device) to find a chat open with a friend. My boyfriend is going off to them about how he hates where we live, only started a relationship with me because he was lonely and essentially doesn’t love me and cannot bring himself to tell me he loves me when I say it to him. \n\nThe chat was open on my computer when I saw this, I didn’t open it myself to snoop, but I will admit that I did scroll.\n\nI immediately started crying and put the laptop away. This has happened before, He has left things open that I saw, which caused issues, but it’s been hard for me because the things I saw make me feel like we shouldn’t be together. The first time was before we moved, and since we moved I thought a lot of things were better, so I’ve been giving it a chance. I know people can work through problems. \n\nThough I was trying to be quiet and in another room, I guess I woke him up because he started asking me why I was crying. I couldn’t say anything other than “things aren’t working out the way I want them to” because I couldn’t talk to him about what I saw. He must have guessed what happened because he started getting angry at me because I *violated his privacy*. \nThis is honestly kind of ridiculous to me because he would never tell me these things. He would never tell me he doesn’t love me anymore or that he doesn’t want to be with me. The only way I find out is on accident. These are things I think I deserve to know and I don’t understand why I’m the only one who has fault in this situation, when he is the one pretending he’s happy and not telling me how he really feels. He’s essentially lying to me, isn’t he? I give him everything I have and all I’ve been getting back is half a relationship. \n\nThis is a really hard situation because we moved across the country from all of his family so if we ended it I would have to pay to fly him and all of his stuff to his family. And we’ve been together for three years, we’ve built a lot and been through a lot. So I can’t “just end it”. \nCurrently sitting in the bedroom waiting for him to wake up cause he was “too tired to have this conversation” and we would finish it when he woke up. (It’s 5pm here)",

I love Sicilian food, so it's become a running joke with my family about how that's \"wrong food\" -- not REAL Italian food.\nFor those of your who don't know, Italy can be very divided and tribalist, with the mainlanders all hating each other but hating Sicilians more, and hating non-Italians even more than that. I've always thought this was funny, so I joke about it a lot. We share a language and a culture but still don't get along. It's the perfect argument against white supremacy in my opinion.\nBut when I told my friends via group text that I was bringing Sicilian pizza because my family \"wanted it out of the house,\" all hell broke loose. I had to explain the joke and the history behind it, but one of my best friends basically still accused me of being racist...towards my own race. Everyone else was telling her to calm down, that it was just a joke, but she refused, saying she had to speak up for those that had no voice.\nI was beyond hurt. I've never been accused of being racist before, and for one of my best friends to have such a low opinion of me hurts so, so badly.\nTo make it even worse, this same friend is a Latina, and she jokes about \"brown people culture\" all the time. \"Brown people are super loud, brown people are always late,\" etc. Every single one of the things she says is part of \"brown people culture\" my family does too, but when I tell her this she just laughs and waves it away saying \"just let us have this one.\" That's been so hurtful to me because it feels like she's dismissing entire parts of my own life and family, but she's refused to acknowledge it.\nI don't know if I can fully equate these things though. I made a joke that, looking back, was more mocking Sicilians than it was mocking the mainlanders dislike of Sicilians. She was mocking her own culture and people, although it does always seem like she mocks more than just her own nationality by saying \"brown people.\" I think I understand why she's upset, but there's a part of me that still believes it was misplaced.\nSince that initial fight, she has refused to talk to me. She says she won't have this argument over text and didn't pick up when I called. I don't know what to do and I don't even know if I was in the wrong here.\nAITA? ",

But it never worked out, and he started seeing other people.\n\nEvery time he would, he would date the person for a month or two, before something would happen and they would break up. Then he'd call me randomly out of the blue after me not hearing from him for a while and ask to hang out. He would tell me he hadn't called in a while because he was dating this other person (as he didn't tell me in the beginning so I never knew) and didn't want to mess things up. I can respect that, but also felt a little weird about it. This has happened a couple times.\n\nHe was dating this one person again, and I didn't hear from him most of November, all of december, and most of January until he called today. I almost picked up the phone, but didn't. Instead, I let it ring out to voicemail. I haven't called back, or responded to his texts. I felt a little shit that he stopped talking to me out of the blue, and so I moved on and I don't really know if I'm up for it anymore",

He arrived and everything seemed fine but several minutes later he stopped by what looked like just the side of the road to pick up two men waiting there. I asked him what he was doing and he said they'd called in and he was driving them in the same direction. I said I wasn't comfortable with that and he said he does this all the time. \n\nI'm a 22 year old, 5 ft tall girl, and it was already dark by this time so I really felt unsafe, it felt like a set up to be honest. I ended up calling my mom and telling her what was going on and where we were the whole way back. I'm not happy that they know where I live now either. She also felt it was extremely shady. I emailed the owner of the taxi service to tell them what had happened and that I won't be using their service again because of it. I haven't heard back from them yet but my friends think I overreacted. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I’m a young and naive person, in fact I don’t even turn fifteen for a while. So despite this probably being obvious and most definitely light compared to things here, it’s really eating me up inside.\n\nBackground: I’m a young super emotional girl, I’ve got really bad anxiety, mild depression and a history with eating disorders. But I’d like to think that part’s irrelevant. I have two younger brothers (11 and 8) and my mom has various mental issues, and physical illnesses(is that the right word?) as well. CRPS, MCAS, reactive arthritis to name a few examples. Obviously this is extremely frustrating for anyone, much less a mother. She can barely eat anything(as in she’d instead have a list of foods she can eat opposed to foods to stay away from, except nobody has a specific list.) and she can’t walk and instead gets around on a scooter because of the situation. My dad currently works 3 jobs to keep up with everything.\n\nSo, you know, that’s that... and that’s fine, she’s dealing with it. In fact we’re about 3 years into this, (dunno why we haven’t moved out to a floored house though) and despite its getting worse, she’s been good about. She just gets mad a lot and yells and stuff all the time, like a typical mother. It does push me to the point of tears hearing them but only sometimes. That’s just my own thing, everything she does parenting-wise is completely reasonable.\nYell and scream whenever someone does something you don’t like? Check. \nNever listen to anyone’s opinion? Check.\nConstantly complain about everyone’s incompetence? Check.\nThrow fits when things don’t go her way? Check.\nBelieve vaccinations are bad and essential oils are the cure to everything? Sadly... check.\n\nSo one night we were eating dinner, I had just got home from school, and so I was still kinda stressed and irritable, and it’s a typical night. I walk downstairs from showering to everyone(save for my dad) yelling at each other over dinner for either chewing too loud or staring at someone too long or something, honestly I don’t even know, I try and ignore most of it. I do count the outbursts though, to help with anxiety. Around my mom’s 20th outburst of our 45 minutes dinner(idk exact number, I lost count after I fumed over), I kinda snap and make a remark defending my little brother, against her. She’s clearly upset and after 2 or so back and forths decides to take my phone for a while.(didn’t say how long, but whatever) \n\nI disregard what she said, and continue to defend my little brother.(sorry little guy, I made a mess out of nothing) as with any time I argue, I’m making points while simultaneously crying. Eventually I stop arguing because I can barely talk and say some shitty things to her. Nothing super horrible, but it was rude nonetheless. Dinner was interrupted and everyone parts, everyone’s pissed, and I’m left sobbing at the table. She drops that whole thing later and gives me my phone back btw. I know that’s a weird convoluted petty/stupid example but it’s prominent in my head and whatever, as I said it’s killing me. \n\nNow, I have done things like that before. Sometimes it ends with her crying telling me she promises to do better(blatant lies) or alternatively her naming everyone a stupid bitch and calling our actions out as bullshit despite them dominantly being her own fault, even if inadvertently. Or faulting everyone else in her issues.\n\n\ntl;dr: My mom is in rough situation (crps, mcas, mental things, allergies, etc) and she’s struggling pretty hard and my family’s kinda at each other’s necks. Always yelling about petty things. But harmless, then I go in and talk trash about her for being agitating.\n\n\nSo, am I an asshole for unjustifiably snapping and being a jerk to an injured/struggling women I call my mother? I never yell at people, ever, and obviously I shouldn’t yell at anyone, especially people older than me, more so people that look after me. I shouldn’t have done it, any of the handful of times, but does it make me an asshole? ¯\\_(◕︿◕)_/¯ ",

      "description": "I'm 15, and I've been working hard to save up the money I get from my **very** low-paying job to finally get a PS4. My family never bought me and my sister a gaming console or anything similar, as my mom thinks that there's no use for any form of modern electronics other than a cell phone or tv, and my dad thinks we should buy it ourselves so we cherish it more. We have a very large and expensive flat screen tv in the basement, and since I don't have a tv of my own, I thought I would be able to hook it up to that and use it. I finally buy the PS4 and a discounted game from a nearby electronics store (that I could walk to), and when I get back, my sister delightfully exclaimed how excited she is to use it. Without context, it doesn't seem that bad, but my sister is known in the family for viciously wrecking every piece of technology she touches, intentionally or not. A couple months ago (maybe 4) she spent all the money she had saved up to buy an IPad, and wouldn't me even let touch it because \"she was the one who had paid for it, and it wouldn't have been fair.\" Now she was contradicting herself by expecting to use my new console, and I was even more weary to share seeing what she had done to her new IPad.  I remind her of the mentality she had months before, and she gets pissed and goes to get my mom, who tells me that she not only expects me to share my PS4 and let her use it half the time, but also be the one who buys games suitable for her (My sister's a couple years younger than me.) I refused to do so, and now have a still packaged PS4 hidden away in my room because if I try to use it it will instantly get wrecked by my sister.",

      "description": "Hi, this is my first ever post, so please forgive me if I did anything wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: So, in my band class, there's this one kid.  He's that one kid who doesn't seem to understand social interaction or context.  When he wants to talk to someone he jabs them while repeating their name over and over,  if he seems anything, like a game, he likes he'll just stare at it while asking dumb questions, cries when he doesn't get what he wants, etc.  What makes it worse is he has mumble-y voice to the point where you can't understand most things he says.  He's the kid who thinks he has friends, but in reality everyone just ignores him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, the story:  We're finally having a day off from our rehearsals. Me and a friend both brought a Switch to play on since we'd have free time.  We decided to play some Smash for the period.  Unfortunately, Switch's are like blood to this kid, and he's a hungry shark, so the second he walks into the room, as per usual, he instantly sets his eyes on the closest Switch, which would be us.  So there he is, leaning over us, staring into our screens, as I think anyone would think, it was annoying and focus-cutting.  After about a minute or so, he of course asks, \"Can I play?\"  Now, I personally have a rule: I don't let people I don't know use anything I own worth more than a pencil.  My friend, shares the same sentiment.  So we both individually say no, and explain why, and he says \"Oh...\" in a wavering voice.  So we go on, he still leaning over our shoulders.  It's hard to be yourself when you only act like yourself around people you know, so he was indeed killing the mood.  So we finished our match (he felt the need to say \"Oh!\" when things happened, or \"You DIED!\" when I lost a stock), and just weren't feeling up to it anymore, so we went to our single player story modes; he stayed.  After THIRTY more minutes of silent playing with him in the same leaning over our shoulders, in the corner of our eyes position, and him saying more irritating comments, asked \"Can I play?\" again, and we repeated our statements.  At this point I was about to turn around and say \"Can you please stop staring over my shoulder, it makes it hard to focus,\" although he fortunately left and went to stare at another's Switch before I could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, he was close to crying, and I know he (mostly from past experience with him) would've if I spoke up in the gentlest way possible.  So, would I have been the ass hole if I asked him to leave and he broke down.  Today, my friend brought his Switch and it happened again (he was extra heavy on the \"You DIED!!!\" and other comments) for 10 minutes (only because the bell rang). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one hand, I would feel like a jerk for telling him to go away, but he's almost been prodding me over and over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading if you got this far.",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to know if my friend still has feelings for her first love?",
      "description": "A friend of mine had a huge crush on another friend of mine for a solid 6 months. It was pretty obvious. I can only assume it was her first love from what she's told me. I had a rather large crush on her myself at the time (and still do), but it was fine and dandy. She seemed happy and being upset about something dumb like that would definitely have made me the asshole.\n\nSo, after those 6 months, I had heard she was taking a trip to Japan, so I asked her if she was excited or not or just stuff about Japan since I'd never been to another country myself. For some reason, we really hit it off and we started talking a little bit too much for our own good. During that, she told me how *something* had happened between her crush and herself that was hard for her, but she never described much about it. I think it was that he wanted to date her right away but her parents didn't allow her too until she was 18 + she just wasn't ready.  \n\n\nA few more weeks pass, I make a self-deprecating joke about something that had to do with love in some sorta way and my friend decides then is a *great* time to tell me she has feelings for me. I told her that I did too but I wasn't interested in a relationship simply due to the fact that I'm not ready for one. She agreed that she wasn't either and that we should just be friends, and that's why I'm still calling her my friend instead of something different in this post.\n\nI'm certain that she likes me, it's been a year since she's told me that and she does all the things someone with a crush on somebody does. That's not what I'm concerned about.  \n\n\nWhenever she mentions the boy that was her first love, it seems very vague as to what her relationship is with him. In a different conversation with her mother she got rather defensive about how \"she didn't like him that much in the first place\" but that isn't true, she did like him a lot and that's okay. When I have asked, the question seems as if it's avoided, which she does sometimes accidentally while continuing a different point and I've just had to nudge her in the right direction, but I'm still confused  \n\n\nSince I am her friend, and not someone she's in any sort of romantic relationship with, I feel as if I can't press her further about it since we aren't in that kind of relationship ourselves. I feel as if I'm getting overly concerned about something I can not even guarantee in the future. It's fine if she still has feelings for him, I just have no clue if she does and what to think of this whole thing.  \n\n\nAITA for wondering if a girl who's interested in me is also interested in someone else?",

      "description": "Ok. On mobile. Formatting. First post. Yadda yadda.\nOh and I'm southern. So forgive my vernacular. \n\nSome context: I'm 20, but live at home to go to school and work so it's cheaper. \n\nSo I am a nice person most of the time. It takes a lot for me to even dislike you, let alone hate you. That being said, I despise my mother's boyfriend. Frankly, I can't believe that my mother puts up with him but that's just me. He's a self centered, self absorbed, demeaning, holier than thou, \"I used to be a mechanic so I'm more of a man than you are\" jackass. Unfortunately, given that I work in my father's family business, not only do I see this guy at home, but I have to work with him to (Pops and Momma are still good friends and, unfortunately, my dad has a kind heart and gave her bf a job working for him.) Now. I've given him chance after chance, shown him respect, even been nice to him, what I usually get back is the equivalent of \"yea I hear you talking, but your too young, too stupid or not enough of a man to understand.\" So now. I discuss only work related things with him at work. And avoid him at home. I learned the hard way that conversation that do not include him are not off limits for his bad mouthing. So now I just leave a room if he enters it. It sucks I've got to do that in my own home but if it's the only way to avoid being talked down to or put down, it's better then nothing. Well now, Momma will be showing me videos on her phone or telling me something. And he'll come in the room so I'll leave. She says I'm an asshole for doin that, but if conversations without him included are not offlimits for his assholery, why should I give him the opportunity? I feel bad for doing it to my momma, but I'm tired of being treated like shit. Am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo begin, I would like to say that I do not hate my old boss. I was in graduate school studying science in a lab, and I really believe I would never would have had the opportunity to be in graduate school if he hadn't wanted me to work with him. That being said, we have some serious differences in mentorship-mentee styles.\n\nI don't believe he tries to make people feel the way that he does, but he can be very abrasive and says things to me that I believe are meant to be \"peers messing with eachother jabs\" where it hits me as just down right racist and has been pretty damaging to my mental health.\n\nFor example, once when he found out I went to Polish school growing up, he immediately asked me \"Is that an outhouse?\". He once went seven weeks without using my real last name, but a similar sounding name of a polish style deli from the area (he knew how to properly pronounce my name). He even went so far once as to put this deli name on our website listing me as his student with it. My real name was not included.\n\nHe did this every day four four years. During lab meetings from 4 pm-5pm he would come down. One coworker mentioned to me that he often liked to target me specifically more than others. It was hell. He used to call me nexus of disappointment, or ND for short. When I asked why he called me a Nexus of disappointment he corrected me saying \"I said Disappointment Nexus, I wouldn't use three words describing you when I could use two\". It was difficult to communicate with him at times. Its chipped at my self-esteem, and I actually started having panic attacks to the point where I can't do my research/writing my thesis. I quit the program. I'm actually in therapy now, and I've noticed during my therapy for the panic attacks, even though I've been out of the program for six months, ALL I DO is talk about my old boss and my relationship with him.\n\nPart of me thinks this just might be that graduate school is science is tough. Everyone has problems and I just wasn't good enough. Maybe I'm just projecting my failings during my research (my research projects were not going well), and I'm just looking for someone to blame. I don't know, but I do know that I hate my current job. I feel like my career has been derailed (I feel like I can't ask him for a job reference/recommendation since I didn't finish) and so I work a dead end lab tech position and I hate it. I feel under utilized since I do have greater skills, but I just press play on idiot proof instrumentation. I feel so fucking broken. It was my dream to get my PhD since I was a kid and now it just seems like its an impossible thing.\n\nI want to talk to the school and my former committee members and explain to them the depths of the feelings, but worry that again, the projection, and that its already done, and I'm gone. Maybe I'm just a bitter failed graduate student that is looking for someone else to blame. AITA?",

      "description": "My husband’s goddaughter passed away at the young age of 20 two years ago. We were all close, but they were especially close. We don’t have children of our own, so we considered her to be our daughter. He gifted her a teddy bear when she was a baby, and her parents told us shortly after her death she would still sleep with it every night since, so they gave it to us. It was a beautiful gesture. \n\nHowever, since the bear was given to us, my husband has become attached to the bear. Not only does he sleep with it every night, he carries it around the house. If he’s working in his office he’ll keep the bear either on his desk or his lap. If we’re watching a movie he’ll be holding the bear. I’ve spoken to him about it and he agreed that this is unhealthy behavior and he would like to change his ways, and for a moment he stopped sleeping with the bear. However we went on vacation shortly after, and as I was unpacking his suitcase, I saw that he had brought the bear with him. At that point, I just cried. I felt terrible for even suggesting that he should stop in the first place, since it means so much to him.\n\nHowever, it has been getting in the way. He used to cuddle me at night, and he’ll hold me for a few minutes, but then he’ll turn on his side and hug/hold the bear *all* night. In the middle of an argument we had last night (unrelated to the bear,) I snapped. I told him that him sleeping with the bear is totally inappropriate and creepy. I didn’t really think I meant that, but deep down, I believe there is some truth to that statement. In that moment he stopped arguing with me, turned over, and went to sleep. I believe he was crying for a very long time. I wanted to apologize, but I didn’t, hoping that this will finally get him to stop. \n\nThat being said, I feel terrible. I know everyone copes differently, but it’s been two years. I thought it would be over by now. AITA?\n\nTLDR: Husband is attached to the teddy bear of deceased godchild. ",

      "description": "(Sorry if this is long, I just really need to get this off of my chest)\n\nSo, to give some context, I met this guy around 2014 in one of my favorite online games, and we've been close friends ever since. At first we've just had a normal \"get together and play together\" relationship, but somewhere around early 2015 he started coming to me to talk about his personal issues outside of the game.\n\nHe'd often talk about being abused by his family members, especially by his sister, how he often gets betrayed by his closest friends, how he only finds solace in eating, how tired he always feels, and other issues which I won't spend too much time dwelling into. Since he was a person I deeply cared about, so I tried giving him advice on what I think he should do, and I'd usually tell him that he should see a psychologist to get professional help, since there's only so much I (an internet friend) could do for him. He promised me he would do as I told him to do.\n\nThis went on for a long while. As I've said before, he started talking about these issues in 2015, and he would continue to come to me for advice until 2018, where this incident takes place.\n\nSo one day, I was just casually chatting with friends over Discord, and I suddenly noticed a notification for a group called \"My last goodbye\". I curiously opened it and I found my best friend had made a group to say goodbye to all his closest friends before he killed himself. Now, this initially shocked me. He's shown suicidal tendencies before, but he has never done something like this. I paused for a second, and then I started typing.  \nI asked him if he ever took or at least considered any of the advice I've given him over the 3 years he'd asked me for. He said that he hasn't, and the only reason he promised me he would was because he didn't want to upset me. This infuriated me, as I felt that all of the time and effort I spent caring for him were a waste. Our entire friendship felt like it was based on a web of lies. I just couldn't forgive him for what he's done. I told him to fuck off and I left the group chat. \n\nAnyway, from what I've heard from another friend, he didn't die in the end, apparently the amount of Advil he took wasn't enough for him to die of an overdose (How coincidental). I blocked him on Discord and deleted all forms of communication I had with him, and called it a day.\n\nThis happened less than a year ago, but it recently resurfaced in my mind, and I started feeling guilty. I started to wonder if I was wrong to do what I did that day, and I needed advice from an unbiased third party, AKA reddit. So guys, AITA?",

I am in highschool, and my friend and I like to go to the school basketball games to kill time and get away from home.\nAt the beginnning of one game, my friend and I split up, as he wanted to hit the concessions stand, and I wanted to find a place to sit. I didn't see him for half an hour. I was getting bored with out him, so I went back to find him. I found him fuming at a redneck kid and the kid looked pissed. I went over to someone nearby, and asked what was going on. He said that the redneck kid had called my friends sister a n****r. He and his sister are mixed. I'm pretty close with both of them, so I was pissed. \nApparently, my friend had roasted the kid, and he got salty. Roasts became threats, and now they were about to rip each other apart. \nSoon enough they began to fight. My friend hit him in the face first, and the fat kid retaliated by hitting him in the temple. He was pretty hefty, and I could see it jarred him, and I figured he could use some help. I jumped in and kicked him as hard as I could in the side of the knee. As he collasped, I kicked him a couple of times, and his mom ran over and began screaming at us, and we booked it all the way back to my place.\nAfter the adrenaline wore off, I began to think about it differently, and how I should of just broke it up. \nAITA?",

      "description": "My husband and I went our for dinner last night at a trendy restaurant where the tables are so close we’re all practically eating at the same table. The place was really noisy so everyone had to speak loudly to have a conversation.\n\nThe couple beside us was on a first date, and at some point one half of the couple starts telling the most disgusting story about a vacation with friends where they all got food poisoning and there was one bathroom. And he was going into a he most graphic of detail as our food arrived. \n\nI hoped the conversation would just move on, but it seemed to trigger more stories on the topic and when he was done his dining companion jumped in with his own detailed vomit story. I tried to focus on the conversation with my husband but they were speaking loudly and the details were turning my stomach so I interrupted them and asked if they could change the topic of their conversation since we were eating. \n\nThey did change the subject - but awkwardly it became about how I was eavesdropping on them and how they felt they couldn’t talk freely since they were being watched. It was an uncomfortable meal and my husband was annoyed that I said something and made things awkward. He said I should have just excused myself for a few minutes if it was bothering me and the conversation would have changed (though our food had just arrived - I wouldn’t have wanted to let it get cold and had no idea when this topic would have exhausted itself!)\n\nAITA for asking strangers to change the subject of their conversation?",

      "description": "I go to a very large state university, where I work very limited hours (10-20hrs/wk, depending on the semester) at a department funded concessions booth.\n\nThis was my third semester working there. We operate on a fix schedule, meaning we all work the same shifts on the same days every week - me quitting really puts a burden on everyone else, and they’ve said as much to me. Needless to say, most of my coworkers (who I’d call friends as well) are pretty upset with my decision, saying it’s greedy and not taking them into account.\n\nMy reason for leaving is that my boss, an older woman named Julie, has recently developed some sort of vendetta against me; prior to our spring break, she gave the Thursday workers a list of closing procedures that needed to be done by the end of Friday. I do not work Thursdays, so I didn’t see this list until Friday, when I close with one other girl. The Thursday closers did nothing on the list, leaving several hours of cleaning to me and the girl I close with. On Friday, Julie came into the store and absolutely tore into me because the cleaning wasn’t finished yet, and as a result, implemented a lot of punitive rules that I feel are targeted at me:\n\n-Men with long hair (I’m the only guy who works there and my hair is roughly down to my neck) must wear a hairnet, while girls are allowed to tie it back. \n\n-All seating has been removed from the store (not sure how this is relevant to her reason for being upset)\n\n-I’ve taken on a ton of new, unpaid responsibilities for no extra money; I spent all of Wednesday and most of today building shelves for Julie’s office. The whole time I was assembling them, she was throwing very petty, emasculating comments my way (ex. I asked for a mallet to hammer some parts together, and her response was “What? You’re not strong enough?”)\n\n-Julie has been overall very mean to me and me only; a girl was half and hour late this morning and Julie waved it off. I forgot to wear my hairnet for ~15 minutes and Julie asked if I “even have a brain”.\n\nI’ve come to the conclusion that the way I’m being treated / talked to is not worth the money I’m being paid, so I emailed Julie to let her know I’d no longer be working for her. The email was very polite. I told all my coworkers that I was done, and the vast majority of them called me stupid / greedy / emotional / you name it.\n\n I understand why they’d be upset but I really feel that quitting was in my best interest, working for Julie was putting me in an absolutely foul mood every day and detracting from my studies. \n\nDid I make the right call?",

      "description": "I am involved in dog rescue. Occasionally, some members of our group fall on hard times and ask for others in the group to pitch in and help out. Most of the time it's when one of our dogs get really sick and vet bills get expensive.\n\n\nLast summer, one woman's husband unexpectedly passed away. Suddenly she found herself several thousand dollars behind on her mortgage. For a solid two months she begged everyone in this group every few days to help her so she didn't lose her home. Many, including myself, pitched in to donate to her in her time of need. None of us are well off, but everyone tries to help everyone else. Especially if it's for the dogs. (This is the only time I've ever known it not to be for the dogs.)\n\n\nA month after the deadline to get the mortgage current, which she did, she begins posting that she bought a new puppy for her grandson. An expensive puppy of the breed we work very hard to rescue, foster, conduct fundraisers to pay medical bills for and find forever homes for. I'm not gonna lie. I was a bit miffed at that. I don't make or have a lot of money, but she came across as nearly destitute, so I donated as I didn't want her to be homeless. \n\n\n\nI just learned that she found a life insurance policy that her husband had that she had been unaware of that she has now been spending on herself and her kids and grandchildren. This really made me angry that I donated my hard earned money and she barely even thanked anyone for.. and did not disclose the newfound insurance money or offer to return any of the donations voluntarily. So I sent her a PM letting her know how I felt. She immediately apologized and attempted to give me twice the amount that I donated. I refused, and said I would simply like back what I gave you, to which she insisted 1/4 more, which I agreed to after she wouldn't take no for an answer. \n\n\nThen, she creates a post finally thanking everyone who donated to her, and asking if anyone wanted their money back. She did not mention the insurance policy or that she had plenty of money mere weeks after she was pleading with everyone to help her. Now comments are being made saying, \"It was a gift! Keep what you need!\" and, \"I wouldn't dream of asking for my money back!\" She has commented that \"someone\" had asked for their money back which is why she was asking, not mentioning me by name, but making me out to be the bad guy. (For the record, I did NOT ask for it back. I told her that It hurt me to see her buying expensive frivolous things like a puppy that were not essential right after begging for donations, and it also hurt to find out she got a windfall and didn't mention it or the donations after the fact.)\n\n\n\nSo...

      "description": "Before you get your pitchforks out please let me explain. I'm currently a senior at a 4 year university and until recently I was living with my parents because it financially makes sense. It only takes me 30 minutes to make the drive to campus so I've been fine making the daily commute. Over winter break, a friend of mine invited me out to the bar for a few drinks. We've been friends for a good 4 years and he's also my old roommate freshman year. While we were having a good time and catching up he told me about his living situation. He told me how his parents pay for an apartment on campus but due to his grades not being so great, he had to move back home. His parents are Asian and super strict so that really didn't surprise me. After his parents forced him to move out they couldn't find anyone to sublease so they were stuck with an empty room. He then offered to let me move in for free since he can't live there. Thinking this was too good to be true I asked him if there was a catch. I was at least expecting to pay half rent or something but he said not to worry. Shocked by his generous offer I accepted. This was probably the kindest thing anyone's ever done and I was planning on doing something really nice for him over the summer. The next week I went to visit the place and met all of his roommates who were all super cool with me moving in. I then spent the next week packing and moving all my stuff over. It's been a month now and everything couldn't have been better until my friend who offered me the room texted me asking for rent money. I was a little taken aback by this and I really didn't know how to respond. I would have never agreed to move in if I had to pay rent because I simply can't afford it. Also I'm paying for my own tuition so I can't afford rent on top of my tuition payments. I would have just moved out but I already moved everything over. My bed, furniture, and clothes are all there. Also I canceled my university parking pass and spent money getting an apartment parking so if I move out I'm out a serious chunk of money since I have to buy my university pass again. I honestly think I shouldn't pay rent because he promised me I didn't have too. I'm going to tell him that I won't pay for anything. Is my roommate being an asshole for demanding rent after he promised that I could live there for free? Or was I just naive?",

He stares me down like I need to move, however there’s a cart to my right and the left is the endcap and I am completely blocked in. I finally just say excuse me in an exasperated tone and try to nose my cart to the left; he just looks me down but says nothing. Confused at the whole ordeal, I sort of just shake my head and go on, well his buddy with him had saw me shake my head and look confused so he said something along the lines of “Why you shakin’ that head, boy, better watch where ya goin’, boy” In a pissy hostile tone. Well this gives me a righteous indignation as I, a married man in my twenties loathe being called “boy” so I start trading words with this guy, saying that I said excuse me and I thought your friend was a rude ass, just kind of traded talk like that back-and-forth. Was this my fault? For some reason it still has me burnt up. It was an odd encounter. ",

The cat doesn't use a litter box because she spends most of the day outside and comes in when it gets dark/cold. \n\nThe problem I'm having is last year she was an absolute terror on the small critters around us. We live in a small suburban neighborhood, and all of our backyards are divided by chain link fences.\nJust about every day she would kill a bird or squirrel and it wasn't long before we just had no birds in our backyards. \n\nThe neighbors aren't happy. We've been told by multiple of them that they don't appreciate having a cat running around their back yards killing the birds that they enjoy having around. \n\nThis area has never had a problem with this as long as weve lived here and my dad's gf seems to not see a problem with it. My solution was that we could put a bell collar on her and that would serve as a bit of a warning to the animals around her.\n\nSo WIBTA if I ask her to either put a bell on the cat or keep her inside?",

      "description": "My friend roped me into being a co-logistics head with her for a college-wide event by the student council. I just finished organizing a two-day Valentine's sale for our organization and I haven't even had a day to catch my breath when I found out that work has started for the student council's event. \n\nHere's the thing: my friend fell sick the day before Valentine's (upset stomach, can't eat, keeps vomiting and pooping liquid). She's my org mate and I tried to understand she couldn't help with the Valentine's sale because she's ill and I actually wanted her to rest and feel better, so I took over all her work yesterday. She showed up halfway into the event long enough to see how we're doing and apologise, then immediately went back home. \n\nSkip to now, the head organizer had given us a deadline to reserve rooms by today. She came to school and we're both in our org's room waiting for our next class. I'm stressing out over the event schedule and availability of rooms so I'm trying to engage into a discussion with her about it. She claims though she's still feeling sick so I'm like, why did u even go to school but okay girl fine you can go nap. AND THEN while I'm trying to do the work that's assigned to us both, I see her laughing loudly and joking around with a dude in the room. \n\nThinking that since she's fine enough to come up with jokes, I asked her a question related to our work (\"do you think it's bad to hold the event in the morning?\"). She then tells me that she's sorry but she's still sick so she can't help me out at all. Inside I'm just, DUDE i'm just asking for your opinion, I'm not even making you do the heavy work anymore????? \n\nI didn't tell her that though because I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. But I'm so pissed because she'd tell me she's so sick she can't even think hard stuff, but she's fine enough to sit there in front of me snickering while scrolling through FB? I don't know man, AITA?

      "title": "AITA for breaking up with my [19M] long-distance partner [19F] for not wanting a Christmas present?",
      "description": "So, I've been in a long-distance relationship with my current girlfriend for the past six months (since June). We met abroad, having each won spots on the same scholarship to go overseas for a summer. It was an amazing experience and we really bonded straight from the get-go, which for me was astounding because I've never really succeeded with real romantic relationships before. One thing led to another, as it goes, and we ultimately ended up having sex several times over there (both of us were virgins) and we decided we would stay together after the trip ended, despite us going to different and far-away universities.\n\nAfter everyone got back home, things were really good between us. We would talk every day through text, Snapchat, etcetera, and would usually call each other a couple of times a week to catch up on school, work, life, etcetera. We had decided from the start that each of us was going to try and stick to the other, despite the distance separating us, but also that if one or both of us did want to separate, we would part amicably and remain on good terms (we have similar career goals and scholarship ambitions, so we assumed that we were going to see each other again eventually no matter what).\n\nThis system worked out really well for the past semester. I've never been happier, knowing that I have someone to love and who loves me for the first time in my life, and my academics and social life have really never been better. It's honestly like I've been living in a idealistic dream the last few months. Until recently.\n\nI should probably clarify a few things before going on.\n\n* Her family are all staunch Catholics, i.e., the no-premarital-sex type. She herself really isn't (obviously), but her wariness about her family being angry at her over having sex out of wedlock has made it impossible for us to openly spout our relationship -- e.g., on social media. At first I found this kind of fun, but for the last few weeks it has felt more like I'm holding in a lie that I want to let out but can't, and it's been irritating me more and more.\n\n* I am poor. Like, really, REALLY poor. So poor that I rely on refunds from my student loans to live. I know I'm sadly not the only one out there in this situation, but I thought it was necessary to mention. (I guess one of the perks of being in a long-distance relationship is that you don't have a whole lot of relationship upkeep.)\n\n* My own family is really small; it's honestly just me, my mum, an aunt, and an uncle, the latter two of which are very much 'detached', so to speak. So I have become reliant on being able to talk/vent to my girlfriend about a lot of things, and she's usually been really supportive.\n\nWith that out of the way, back to today. Or, rather, yesterday. I haven't celebrated Christmas (or, the secular gift-giving of the season) in six years, for various and unimportant reasons, but I've been saving up some money to be able to buy my girlfriend something nice. I took a trip to the local mall yesterday and had found a truly beautiful necklace that had a gem in the middle which was practically identical to her eye colour (lime-ish green). It's really spectacular, so of course I bought it. \n\nNow, I hadn't told my girlfriend that I was going to give her a Christmas present, so she probably wasn't expecting to give or receive anything, which I understood and was prepared to accept. But here's the thing: I don't actually know her home address, either at university or at home. When I texted her about it today, she just kind of... ghosted me. For like six hours. I thought, \"Well, maybe she was blindsided by this and is wondering how to say that she doesn't have a gift for me.\" I gave it until the end of the day (a few hours ago) and then texted her about it again. \"Thanks, but no.\" That's all she said.\n\nSo normally, I would kind of understand, I suppose, not wanting to receive something without giving something in return (Catholic social teaching I guess), but the way she has been acting the past couple of weeks has thrown me off too. She's been responding to my texts more and more often with one-word answers (or no answer at all), hasn't actually spoken to me over the phone in a week and a half, and has downright refused to give me some form of address that I could send things to for her (her birthday was a month ago and I wanted to send her a card).\n\nI had been getting weary of this sudden change in her personality and, maybe erratically, maybe irrationally, I just replied (in several pieces): \"OK, forget I asked. You know what, maybe forget all of this. If there's something else going on that you haven't felt comfortable telling me about, that's fine, but we made a promise that we would end things together if one of us wanted out. And I want out. I'm sorry. Good luck on your finals.\"\n\nShe hasn't responded in the three hours since I sent that text. I was worried at first, but I'm starting to feel more and more liberated than saddened, like a great weight or something has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm also going to be returning the necklace tomorrow. I just wanted to get her something nice, to mark the six-month anniversary of our relationship, which I thought was becoming serious.\n\nWas I in the wrong? Is there something I misunderstood? Am I the asshole?\n\nThank you for reading and happy holidays.",

      "description": "So I just got a new shelter dog and as it turns out she's pretty mean to other dogs (barks/growls/lunges). I got a private consult with an animal trainer and she advised I go to a nearby park where dogs are nearby so that I can start to desensitize my dog to others and generally make her more sociable. That's the backstory\n\nSo I am at the park having a picnic in a secluded area with my gf and the dog when out of nowhere a purebred St Bernard comes jogging up to our picnic and comes right up to me and my dog. I jump up to create space between my dog and the St Bernard and my poor gf is too overwhelmed to react or move at all. \n\n\nThe St Bernard seems friendly but won't give me or my dog personal space so I push it a few times and it just keeps walking back over to me still being friendly. My dog is terrified but also showing signs that she'll attack. Finally I hear a man calling the dog from about 15 or 20 yards away, but he's not really in a hurry. \n\nSo I address the guy, I'm talking loud and I'm being stern. I say \"Come get your dog man\". The guy starts walking over faster but while doing so starts to lecture me about being making a big deal over nothing. So I tell him \"It's an on leash dog park(author note: signs posted at entrance, $200 fine). Come get your fucking dog\". He then tells me that having a dog off leash is like going 5 over the speed limit and that I'm being ridiculous. And that there's a group of dog owners who all have well behaved dogs and they don't mind each other going off leash in this particular park. I didn't respond to any of that. He had his dog at that point and I just let him walk away without a response. \n\n\nWas my reaction appropriate? Should I have been more understanding? Thank you for reading this non-proofread mess.

      "description": "I occasionally like to troll the jukebox at bars.  For the uninitiated, I like to purposefully play bad/annoying songs on the jukebox to annoy people slightly, or at least make them look around and go \"huh?\".  My girlfriend and I occasionally walk to various bars in our general area on weekdays when we have nothing else to do.  When we go, I occasionally like to put on a dumb song because I think it's funny.  She gets mad immediately.\n\n\nHer stance is: \"we are trying to have a nice night out and you're being an idiot putting stupid shit on the jukebox\".\n\n\nMy stance is: \"we're at a dive bar up the street on a Tuesday night. It's not like we're at a 4 star black tie affair. Nobody cares, lighten up\"\n\n\nQuick note, I only play a dumb song once, not spamming it 20 times in a row. Besides, the bartenders can skip my song if they hate it that much.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I often watch my brother's doggos and they sometimes get poop in their buttflap fur, so I cut off the offending wisps of hair (sometimes with cemented-in poopsicles upon arrival). They also like to poop on the steep hillside in my yard, dragging their tail and long buttlap fur in the poop as they go. My own dog stopped having buttflap-poop issues since I properly groom/trim the affected area, and he could probably star in a Charmin commercial. After a particularly shitty incident that could not easily be resolved with a towel, bath, nor hose, I had to cut out a sizable chunk of his dog's lovely flowing rear locks and then evened it out somewhat (buttflap/tail hair only). My brother is quite displeased and consequently accuses me of having \"neuroses.\" He prefers his dogs' hair long and wants me to give the dog a bath each time this happens. However, that isn't always reasonable and poop-smeared furniture in my house is where I draw the line. ",

      "description": "This is my first post ever (and i’m on mobile) so i’m sorry for format issues. \n\nSome background: I met this girl who’s about two years older than me through my mom. our mothers work together and thought we’d be good friends. I’m adopted Chinese American, and she’s pretty caucasian as far as I know. For a while we used to be pretty good friends until recently when we just stopped talking as much as I have been really busy with schooling and extracurriculars. During this period she got a boyfriend who’s six years her senior. This happened recently on a very public discord server we’re both apart of. \n\nThe conversation went a little like this (almost word for word):\n\nMe = Me  S = Friend SB = Friend’s boyfriend.\n\nMe: Hi\n\nS: @Me eats dogs\n\nSB: @Me can vouch she eats dogs\n\nMe: I’m asian and yes I eat dogs \n\n(Was saying this guessing they were just trying to be funny)\n\nMe: That actually kind of hurts my feelings though\n\nSB: Fuck off you don’t have feelings you swine\n\nMe: nah man... that kind of hurts. I have three dogs and i don’t eat them. i’m not cantonese.\n\n(my father had told me only the cantonese eat dogs by their tour guide when they were adopting me)\n\nS: she eats cats too\n\nSB: can vouch she eats cats\n\nMe: S that really does kind of hurt. It’s really offensive when you put it in a public server too. don’t reinforce a stereotype.\n\nat this point my friend stops messaging at all. she’s very sensitive when i tell her off.\n\nSB: I mean... it wasn’t a stereotype. i eat cats too. you just happen to be asian.\n\nWhile this was happening i was in the car with my dad who i was telling this to. He told me to tell my mom which i did. She told me she was going to tell her mother. I didn’t mean to get her in trouble at all and now I fear she might become sad or depressed (like she has before when i’ve called her out) when her mother tells her. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my friend’s mom about her slightly offending me?\n\ntldr; My friend and her boyfriend were making racist comments towards me, and after multiple times asking her to stop she continued to which i told my mother who told hers.",

      "description": "I am a high school student, and have an extremely strict, hardass teacher who can be a bit on the unfair side at times. She announced yesterday that she was bringing a guest speaker to our classroom, a woman (and close friend of hers) who tours schools giving speeches on the dangers of drunk and distracted driving. This woman lost her young daughter in a drunk driving accident and is a severe burn victim, and my teacher told us ahead of time that her presentation will be an extremely emotional one, as she will describe the accident she experienced in detail.\n\nMy teacher stated that we all need to be on our very best behavior, and treat her with the highest of respect. She established that there will be **no** interruptions of her presentation tolerated; so that means no going to the bathroom and no tardy arrivals. She stated that she was locking the door at the start of class, and that any students who didn’t have the respect to show up on time would have to sit outside the duration of the period.\n\nI obviously planned on arriving on time to that class (as I always do), but was called up to the office near the end of the preceding period, and by the time I was let go we were already a good 5-10 minutes into the next period. I hustled over to my classroom and knocked on the door, and through the window I was met by a huge scowl from my teacher, a shake of her head, and a gesture to wait outside. I gestured to the office, trying to indicate that’s why I was late, but she turned her head away and ignored me. The woman giving the speech didn’t notice me, as she was very invested in her presentation. At this point, she was talking at length about the morning before she got into the crash, detailing emotionally the last few hours she spent with her daughter alive.\n\nIt was quite cold, stormy, and unpleasant outside, and I **really** wanted to get in. I understand my teacher’s rule, but think that it’s horribly unfair someone should have to sit outside in the cold if they have a legitimate excuse for being late. I started knocking very hard and loud against the door, rapping against the window, calling out, “Hey, I’m out here! Can someone let me in?”, and waving my arms around in front of the window. About 30 seconds later, the woman stops and says, “I think there’s a student out there. Can someone let him in?” Someone ran over and finally let me in, and my teacher flashed me another gigantic scowl. Fairly soon after, the lady continued her speech, and things went smoothly the rest of the period.\n\nAt the end of the class, my teacher scolded me for not listening and interrupting the speech giver, and gave me a detention even after I explained that I had an excuse for being late. I’m considering telling my story to the Vice Principal and fighting this detention. AITA?",

      "description": "So my mom has been retired for some years now. She lives on the other side of the planet with my younger sister.\n\nI noticed that lately my mom seemed kind of down in our chats. Not very enthused when answering, or taking longer than usual to answer. Usually she's a fun-loving and vivacious person but also has a tendency to fall into emotional ruts.\n\nI asked my sister about it and she said that mom was bored because there's not much to do in the area where they live. When my sister is free from work and school my mom plans fun things to do for them but for the majority of the time she's hanging out in the house. I got sad thinking about her just sitting around with nothing to do, and I asked my sister if she had any hobbies, to which she said not really. She plays her guitar and works out with a home program but nothing that eats up a lot of time. I suggested that I could talk to mom about finding some hobbies, and my sister agreed, with the caveat that I didn't tell mom about our conversation because she didn't want any drama in the house. \n\nSo I brought it up with my mom, and I thought it went really well! I broached the subject in a way that I thought would cover my sister (started with talking about how, since I work from home and don't go out much, I'd go crazy without my hobbies, then seguing into what she got up to, to which she replied not much), then from there I suggested different things for her to do that I know she's interested in (painting, joining a class at the gym) and offered to search online to help her find things in her area. I also offered to gather resources on topics she liked and send it to her so she'd have things to read about and learn. She seemed very receptive and positive about it and by the time the chat was finished I felt like a bonafide Good Son™.\n\nWell apparently I wasn't nearly as smooth as I thought, because my sister messaged me a day after in a huff saying that she got scolded by mom for snitching about things only she could possibly know about. My mom also said that I scolded her, which makes me feel bad because I tried to phrase things in a positive and friendly way and obviously failed. So now on top of worrying that my mom doesn't have a fulfilling life, she probably views me as a busybody. \n\nSo now, I'm kind of feeling like I overstepped and stuck my nose into a situation that I really don't know much about, or that doesn't concern me. On the other hand, I feel justified because an issue was communicated to me and I did the best I could to suggest ways to address that issue. What do you guys think?",

He knows my account so needed to make a throwaway for this. \n\nHis sister is 17, I am 24 and BF is 27. \n\nHis sister came to me recently asking for advice when losing virginity and a couple other things, and she made it really clear she was planning on losing it with her current bf. I gave her all the best advice I could and told her to make sure to be safe, etc. I went with her to the doctor to get her on birth control but also made sure to tell her to use a condom for the first few times just in case - don’t want any extra worries on her mind!\n\nA couple days later, she sends me a text saying it went really well but was very vague about it all - which I’m glad about, it’s her personal life at the end of the day. I told her I was happy for her and that’s it. The messages were very vague in terms of the actual experience, but you can definitely tell what she was talking about as she said she used a condom plus a whole lot of lube. \n\nBF found the messages on my phone and is LIVID. He’s been so angry at me, saying his sister’s life is not my concern and I should have put a stop to it and not encouraged it. He’s not overly protective of his sister, but I can understand the worries as the eldest brother. I tried to calm him but he is very upset with me, saying I allowed his young sister to have sex when I shouldn’t have. He went on a tangent about her being way too young (in my opinion, she isn’t. I also can’t dictate what she does and doesn’t do but he won’t listen to me), and talking about how I am such a bad influence for helping her. \n\nReddit. Am I the asshole in this situation or not? Truthfully I just wanted to help her out. But now I’m second guessing myself. ",

      "description": "When I was pregnant, I had made a few jokes about how my husband should \"find a girlfriend\" because I was too sick and uncomfortable to get in the mood. Except my husband SOMEHOW thought I was being serious and started sleeping with one of his female friends. They had a long distance friends-with-benefits thing going on for a few years until one of his friends told me about it. Of course I'm upset and all, but we decide to stay together for the benefit of our son.\n\nMy husband swears it's over, but wants to continue being friends with her. He says since she lives on the other side of the country and he doesn't \"really talk to her that much anymore\", it shouldn't be an issue. While I'm all about putting the past behind us and moving forward, this woman has said a lot of pretty nasty things about me to my husband. She claims that I'm a terrible mother, too mentally ill to function, that our marriage is doomed, that my husband deserves better(which I'm sure means her).\n\nI do not think that it's at all appropriate for her to be friends with my husband, for either the sex or the disrespect. In NO WAY do I want to punish him by controlling his friendships or social media. I truly want to heal our relationship and grow from this admittedly goddamn shitty situation. But I don't think it's possible for us to heal while her toxic presence is still tainting our interactions. Am I the asshole for telling him he needs to block her and cut her off?",

      "description": "My mother is on an extremely tight budget and I had the idea of purchasing her house as a way of helping her out with more money each month and also to keep the house in the family. \nI’m the only sibling who supports myself and so if the house was left to all of us it would probably be sold and the tiny price divided among us. That wouldn’t be much and wouldn’t last my siblings long as they both do drugs. \nMy issue is this: my siblings are constantly draining my mother of every extra dime she has every month, to the point that I regularly help out with the bills when she’s broke. I certainly don’t mind helping her since I can afford it but I take it as a slap in the face when she turns around and gives my brother (who was jailed for abusing my dad in his 70s) money which enables him to continue his druggie lifestyle  without consequences. As far as I’m concerned she needs to cut the cord or he will never get his act together. \nWhen my dad died she promised him that the life insurance money was for her alone but it was gone within a year (she was giving the brother money and paying for him to order frivolous things) and we are back to the same cycle: I cut her off because I find out she’s giving him money, she promises she won’t, I help her, I find out he’s leaching again. \nThat background was to say this: Am I the asshole for wanting to put a clause in the contract to buy the house that no funds are to be given away/brother is to get no “help”?  I know that no matter how much her income is increased, she will be broke on the first of every month if my POS brother isn’t kept from milking her. \nThe house is no prize and needs serious repairs, that I have been making as needed and afforded, but there is no profit in acquiring it. Financially it will be a liability but I want to keep it in the family and help her at the same time.\n\nOn one hand, what she does with her money is her business, but on the other hand, I always pick up the financial slack when someone uses her. I’ve been advised to take over her finances as a way to protect her but that feels like an insult to her. She’s an active 76 year old with a sharp mind still but she’s a pushover. ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to see my sister on the anniversary of her son’s death?",
      "description": "Some backstory:\nTL;DR: my sister has been milking her son’s death for sympathy and pity points in arguments for 2 years, even let his dog die so she could get more sympathy.\n\nDuring my nephew’s life, my sister showed little interest in him. She would threaten to kick him out when all he wanted was for her to spend time with him as much as she did with her younger kids. She told people multiple times she wished he wasn’t around so she could “get some peace and quiet”, to the point where she actually begged my mum to take him from her, but not the other 3. The amount of times he would come to me, sobbing, that he wished she’d loved him was heartbreaking. All he wanted was love and understanding, but no one seemed to give him it. She encouraged her younger children to be cruel to him. They’d all ignore him, be violent to him, and call him names whenever he spoke back to my sister, and she didn’t care.\n\nWhen he got diagnosed with diabetes when he was 17, on my 18th birthday, my sister suddenly started “caring”. She would make him do his insulin shots in front of people - she did this at my birthday party, he wanted to go to the bathroom and do it in peace, but she wanted him to stay there to “make sure he was doing it right”, all whilst she accepted all the sympathy offered towards him. After a while, people stopped offering her sympathy, and she lost interest in her son again. \n\nA year later, after he’d seen me go off to university, he decided he wanted that, too. When he told my sister that’s what he wanted, she mocked him and told him she wouldn’t support him in doing what he wanted to do. He did it anyway, and a day after he’d gone to uni she’d removed his bed and any belongings he’d left behind, and threw them away. He’d gone to the same uni as me, and I told her “but he’ll be back home again at Christmas, we can’t stay there” she said “well he can have the couch before he goes back”.  He didn’t end up coming back for Christmas. He only made it 3 months until he died, alone, in his uni bedroom, 2 years ago today. \n\nWhen he died, she suddenly started acting as though she were the most attentive and caring mother in the world. She would refer to him as “my blue-eyed boy”, a name she never referred to him as when he was alive. She would post about him all the time, which slowly became clear it was attention and sympathy she was after. \n\nI know that, as shitty as she was, she is still his mother. Of course she’d be devastated, especially as she was the one who found him a day after he’d died. I admire how she knew something was wrong, in all honesty. He hadn’t been on Facebook in over 24 hours, something very unlike him, so she went to check on him. So I guess she wasn’t all bad. But I still seethe with anger whenever I see her post yet another status about how he was her world, as she simultaneously threatens her other kids with homelessness if they put a toe out of line, encouraging them to bottle up and hide their emotions, so now it’s coming out in drug abuse, running off to other countries, and her youngest son is now refusing to go to school at all - she’s encouraging that, it means she can keep him under her longer if he has no friends. \n\nShe’d used him as a weapon all his life, threatening people with not being able to see him if they did something she didn’t approve of - like my mum saying she didn’t trust my sister’s husband as he was engaged to someone else who’d just had his baby when he left her for my sister, never wanting to look after his other son again. My sister revoked all access to my nephew, didn’t even let my mum see him when he was born. She even told my mum to come see her at the hospital, then left before my mum could get there and refused to let her into the house. It got harder to do that once he got older. We were inseparable, so he’d ignore her when she told him he couldn’t come see me because she’d have an argument with my mum and decide she didn’t deserve to see her grandkids. \n\nWhen he died, it became very apparent she was going to use him as a weapon again. When she caught me smoking, she’d say “what would ryan think?” (He also smoked, sometimes with me). If she was ever losing in an argument, or when she was called out on her shitty behaviour, she’d start crying and say “you don’t understand! I’ve lost my baby!”. \n\nI had an argument with her early this year. We were planning my mum’s 60th birthday party, a surprise for her, and me and our other sister were sorting out everything, whilst she just had to get people’s orders for the restaurant. She was in a shitty mood, and I had jokingly called our brother a nob. Not the harshest thing I’ve called him, and he has said a lot worse things about all of us. She immediately starts on at me, calling me a lazy bitch and yelling at me for being mean to my brother, a man almost 20 years older than me and who didn’t care if I called him a nob. I told her to calm down, and that she was taking things way out of proportion. She said she was stressed, and that she didn’t want to go to my mum’s birthday party anymore and I said “we’re all stressed, but it’ll be worth it when mum sees the effort we put in, so calm down and stop being selfish”. That set her into a tirade of insults, and her only rebuttal was that I was being unfair calling her selfish after her son had died. I got angry and called her out on using my best friend to guilt me into backing down over an argument she started. And that ended our entire relationship. \n\nWe stopped talking for months. She made my fiancé’s life a living hell at work, causing his mental health to deteriorate which lead to him needing time off for stress under his doctor’s orders, which he was subsequently fired for. She bitched about me to everyone, sending the texts I sent her but conveniently cropping out the texts that made her look bad. All this time, I was petrified she’d delete me off my nephews Facebook - which she’d done to our sister to punish her for doing drugs. I use my nephews Facebook to message him when I really miss him, so losing that would have be agony for me. She finally tried to start talking to me again back in the summer because I had lent her £200 for an operation on her sick dog. I didn’t want to make amends, I just don’t want a dog to suffer because of an argument between me and her. It didn’t matter in the end, as she let my nephew’s dog, a gorgeous black lab he had loved and cared for until the day he died and who loved him and pined for him when he didn’t come back from uni, suffer for months and months. She had a tumour on her belly, but she kept her hidden enough that by the time we saw it we knew it was too late for her. We tried to get her to take her the vets, but she refused, and Maisie died a few weeks ago. Of course, that meant my sister could post about how “Maisie’s with Ryan now, our precious little girl 😢😢” on Facebook. \n\nMy problem:\nToday we’re meant to be spending the evening at my sister’s. I don’t want to be around her and her hypocritical grief and her desire for sympathy. I want to mourn him on my own, away from her so I don’t cause an argument or spend the entire day seething with anger. I can’t forgive her for the argument we had this year, I can’t forgive her for treating my family like shit, and I can’t forgive her for neglecting her dog in favour for the 4 others she has. I told my mum I don’t want to go, and my mum is angry at me, saying I’m selfish for not wanting to support my sister on this tough day. I’m happy to be civil when I must, but today I cannot. Today I don’t have the strength to push that all out my mind. I just want to cry for him in my own time and in my own space, away from her.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "For context, my wife is a rock emotionally and handles a lot. Some days though she gets overwhelmed and goes for a drive. I have come to accept this even if at the beginning I was a bit concerned.\n\nWell a couple days ago we were at a Walgreens when police were seen arresting a guy. It was someone my wife knew. They used to work together before the man was let go for drug and alcohol abuse. As he was arrested and handcuffed for shoplifting and physically assaulting an employee. My wife talked to him and I knew she was dissapointed in him. On our way home I ask if she wants to talk about it and she says no.\n\nSo yesterday I felt like I should do something for her, so I took a half day as a surprise and decided to cook a beautiful Porchetta roast for her. I had everything ready but she wasn't home. So I figured, no big deal she's probably just going for a drive. So I texted her 'Hey. Know yesterday was a bit rough but I got something at home that I think will help a bit. Any idea of when you'll be home?'\n\nShe then calls me and says that I'm an asshole for asking when she'll be home. Usually if this happens (and it is extremely rare btw) I just wait till she gets back. Maybe I should've known better. She came home at 10 PM and ate some of the Porchetta but she's not talking to me. Should I go apologize or wait for her to realize I'm not the asshole here?",

      "description": "Last summer I (20M) got into a fight with a friend(21M), it started small but somehow we both started to bring up old stuff to make our points more valid ( not a good idea in hindsight). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt started with me telling another friend (19F) all the bad things he said about her behind her back, while being nice to her when she's around. He would call her a slut, say that if I paid him €10 he would get me 1 min with her after he had a go with her and other things like that. I thought this was weird because a few years back he pulled me aside and asked if I still had feeling for her (I had a crush on her a year before that for about a month or two), I said no and he replied with:'Okay, so I can try to get back with her right?' After three weeks I got sick of it and told her.\n\nHe found out I told her and started saying the frienship is over, because I don't respected him. In his words i should've told him I don't appreciate this and I should've given him a choice: \"Either you tell her and apologise or I'll tell her myself.\" A fair point, if only he practised what he preached. He was in the same situation before, but on my side of the story.\n\nThen he said he wasn't that surprised since he Always knew I was 'a bit of a snake', because I would always gossip with the girls of our friend group (True, for some reason we always go that way). I would never have his back in a fight (True and false, sometimes I'm neutral and sometimes I pick sides). I wouls refuse to lie for him or somebody else (True, I don't lie to my friends if they ask me something). \n\nHe asked why I had such a problem with him and this made me say all of it at once out of anger, I was done with him because:\n\n\\- He lied about how I ended up kissing a girl ( My first kiss and he took credit by saying he asked her to, I knew he was lying because it happened at the house of my female friend and she asked the girl about it.) ( By itself not worth mentioning, but it really made a dent in my selfconfidence).\n\n\\- He made a joke about me cutting myself,  something he knew I did a few times recently ( He wants to become a psygologist btw). I used to talk to him about my depression alot and he even pointed out my cuts once when we were alone, so I know this wasn't just some random command.\n\nAt first he denied it all, then he was drunk so he can't  remember meaning it is my yes vs his no and his final defense was  he was drunk therefor not himself.\n\nThe next day one of our friends who was there that night said that on the way home he kept saying that if I ever mention him saying that selfharm joke again he will beat me up and that he doesn't mind if I actually do it.\n\nWeird because the next day he would text me saying he was so sorrry, and wanted to how he could fix it. He only tried to talk it out once, at a friends birthdayparty, so I said 'Not now'. ( He also asked me if I could pick him up and take him to the party, I said no.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this started because I wanted to tell a friend how someone really thought of her.I feel like I should atleast try to start again with him, but I just feel so done with him. I feel manipulated, like he tried to guilt trip me. My depression got worse since this fight and I start to feel like I did it myself, because I did something I maybe shouldn't have done. Am I the asshole or is the friendship really over? Maybe it's both ,you tell me.",

He has always been pretty controlling of others.  He told me I need  to \"respect my elders\", \"he raised me better than that\", \"I don't understand why you have a grudge against her and don't want me to be happy\".  I directly asked if he thinks she has a right to be at *my* wedding, and he said yes.

      "description": "I'm an Indian. Here, to have a decent life, you have 2 options: engineering or medical. Both have pretty tough enterance exams for a select few good colleges and are in the top coveted competitive exams in the world and I'm giving the engineering one. It's called JEE for those who want to do further research.\n\nI was in a relationship for 2 years, before she broke it to me that she's leaving for Canada. She wanted to long distance it and I happily agreed. There were several pressing issues that we had to tackle though: \n\n1. Time zones: it's literally on opposite sides of the globe, so we could talk freely at like 12:30 at night for either side. Combine that with our school timings and tuitions and self study time, and I had to stay awake till 1:30 every night and wake up at 5 every morning whenever we would talk.\n\n2. Parents: her parents were chill about this relationship, but I intentionally did not tell my parents because they're very serious about me studying and will remove any distraction that comes my way. I knew telling them would mean that I wouldn't get to talk to her, as a result I could not chat with her when my parents were around.\n\n3. My exams: this one should be pretty self explanatory from the first paragraph. Add to this I'm not very good at this, my interest lies in coding and software development, but I have to do 2 years of first year college level physics chemistry and math for 11th and 12th even though I'm no good at 60% of the net portion.\n\nIt's almost the end of these 2 years and now 4 years for our relationship, and our time to talk was getting more and more constricted. I genuinely tried my best to spend as much time as possible, but even with that, it was boiling down to about an hour every 3 days. We used to talk for more than 2 hours twice a day at the beginning of the long distance phase and even more when she was here with me. \n\nShe told me yesterday that things weren't working out, that she needed more time from me. She even pretended to go out or be busy the last 2 times I stayed awake for our talking time.\n\nWe ended it amicably, but the fact that she told me that she thinks she's not my top priority now, and that my exams are not as important as her, sorta irked me. I understand that I went wrong with not giving her enough time, but my hands were tied. There was literally nothing I could do. Was there anything I should have done?\n\nI'm new to this subreddit, if I've done something incorrect with the post itself, please do tell, I'll remove it and put up a fixed version.",

      "description": "Backstory: My Grandpa and Grandma were the \"kids were to be seen, not heard\" variety when I was growing up. Every memory I have of them as a kid was one of two: \n\n* Excuses for missing something important I invited them to (championships, awards, events, bring grandparents to school day, etc...) with the exception of my High School graduation, which they were there, said congrats and left. It kinda felt more like they felt obligated rather than wanting to be there.\n* Being told that I was everything wrong with my generation. I spent too much time playing video games (hilarious since they always had the same old movies and TV shows playing). In addition, I needed to get outside more, despite being active in sports (see again the above TV hypocrisy)\n\nWell fast forward, Grandpa based a few years ago, and one of my aunts moved in with Grandma, she's not doing great. She's not in bad health per-say but it's getting harder for her to take care of stuff.\n\nWe visit 1-2 times a year and she's always commenting on how we need to drop by more, how she misses us and wants to see us more.\n\nI've been told I'm being heartless but I'm married now, I've built a life for myself, which I feel she's chosen not to include herself in my whole life until now. I don't hate her, I am happy to visit 1-2 times a year, but I also feel like she doesn't actually care about me, she wants me to visit so she's not lonely and couldn't care less who it is.\n\nWell there it is, AITA? Am I being petty and selfish with my time, or are my bi-annual visits more than fair?\n\nI wait my judgement with an open mind.",

      "description": "I recently lived in a 3 bedroom house with my 2 of my friends.  As part of the lease, we were supposed to mow the lawn once a week, so to make it fair we would each mow one week on a rotation.\n\nOne of my friends left and the remaining friend's girlfriend moved in.  Once she moved in my roommate informed me that only myself and him would be rotating mowing.  \n\nI totally get trying to be nice and taking the shift for your girlfriend, I even understand asking your other roommate to share the rotation.  I was never asked if I would share the rotation, my roommate just told me that's the way it had to be.  This actually became a point of contention between us (his girlfriend never actually said anything to me about it and she made no indication that she even cared).\n\nHad I been in my roommates place if I decided that she can't mow and I wanted to get help from my roommate I would've asked him, fully prepared to accept her shift if refused.  My roommate got no say in whether my girlfriend can mow, why should he pay the consequences of my decision?\n\nI made my case stating that had I been asked instead of told, I would've been much more receptive and he made his case basically that she's a girl you have to do manual labor for her or you're a jerk.  An additional statement he made was that she cleaned up around the house as well which was true, but to me there's the shared lease responsibility (mowing), then there's just general living with people (cleaning up the house).\n\nThe thing that really got me was that I asked probably around 5 people about it and they all said ITA.  I still feel like I'm NTA pretty strongly.\n\nI recognize the whole thing is petty.  Ended up just not mowing on her turn because I'm stubborn AF.  The grass got hilariously tall.",

      "description": "\\[We're living together.\\]\n\nI was super dead tired today, so tired that I fell asleep as soon as I came home from school. We always discuss things we (usually I) make for dinner the day before and share the recipe/dish we want to make with each other. (We planned on making a Indian potatoes with chickpeas today. It has 5 ingredients and tbh...it's not hard to make. You basically toss everything in a pan and add some cream afterwards...) Now I was SO tired (just finished and mandatory 20 page assignment yesterday) that I fell asleep at 3pm and slept till 10pm. We I woke up he was super mad at me, he told me that there would be no dinner today, because the potatoes aren't cooked through yet. I then asked him whether or not he has been cooking potatoes first before he tossed them into the pan (low-medium heat) with the other ingredients.  I did say that it's a pretty known fact that (unless stated otherwise) one should always cook the potatoes first. \n\nHe went from mad to being straight up terrifying, he told me that I should have told him. (The recipe sadly didn't state it explictly) That I would be the one at fault. That I now successfully fucked his diet. That it was my fault that he is ending up hungry and that I wasted 2 hours of his time he could have used to do something better. He also told me I was supposed to answer if he asks me something that being asleep is no excuse. When I said \"Sorry... I was sleeping.\" he kicked his chair over and proceeded to continuously kick and step on it for about 30secs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo....AITA? I do have to say tho, I didn't do a lot these past months due to depression (and then having to catch up one months worth of school) and he has been helping me out more than usual lately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: My bf failed to make dinner and blamed it on me.

      "description": "Over the weekend I got accused of being an asshole and that I've betrayed a friend. I have a group of friends that have all been friends for close to 3 years. Recently (about 3 weeks ago) my friend Alex and I attended an event together and have started seeing each other since then. She's a ton of fun and we've always gotten along really well. I am overall really happy the direction its headed, however since we are in the same friend group we have agreed to not let on that we are seeing each other quite yet. There were no previous relationships involving anyone in the friend group. We've made it a point to not really be flirty or overly touchy during this time. \n\nWe both decided that getting other parties involved would complicate things and why cause drama when we aren't sure if its going to be a sure thing.  Given other dynamics and our friend group's love to make things difficult this made sense. Up until last night this had been working out fine. \n\nLast night Alex and I decided to go to the bars. Our plan was to potentially meet up with our third friend Chuck and some of his buddies. After being blown off for a couple hours by Chuck, they finally showed up hammered. Immediately Chuck begins to ask a bunch of questions about the two of us loudly in a crowded bar. We laughed and brushed it off, but he continued to isolate and separate us. Not wanting to deal with it in the bar we both denied anything happening, albeit a bit differently. He then spent the rest of the evening saying how happy he was for us and how it was cool. He would occasionally make sexually suggestive comments and gestures. Then he started getting pissed about it and saying stuff that didn't really make sense. I thought we ended the night fine when Alex and I left though. \n\nToday we've exchanged a bunch of texts and I've apologized for not being straight up about it, still he feels betrayed and like he had to manipulate both of us to get it out. Also that we wouldn't have told him if he didn't do that. \n\nI guess where my head is that a relationship is between two people, and I shouldn't have to define it to a third party especially in bar with 200 other people. Is it bad to want a bit of privacy or do I have the responsibility to tell everyone? I've been clear that none of this was meant to hurt him and that we wanted to be on the same page before telling other people. Also that I value his friendship and that I would never intentionally do anything to jeopardize it. I realize I shouldn't have blown him off and instead said we should talk later, but AITA for not telling him sooner? Any advice for moving forward? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR I started seeing a mutual friend. A third friend confronted us in a crowded bar and we initially denied anything going on. He made comments all over the place, but I thought we were okay that night. Today he says I owed him to tell him sooner. AITA",

      "description": "My gf and I are both 21 and have been dating for just over six years. I currently live with a friend for a bargain of a rent price and she is still living at home with her family. \n\nI have a car that is going to inevitability become a money pit. I’m cutting my losses and selling it, and as an enthusiast I’d like to at least get something I’d still enjoy. I’m not splurging out - found a car normally valued around $10k up for sale for $6.5k (which I can talk down further) because the owner doesn’t realise they’ve been majorly over quoted on some simple repairs. \n\nAnyway, my gf wants to move out of home but not move in with me now because she only wants to live with the two of us in our own place. Also, she doesn’t want to move out together until I have *x* amount of money in my savings as a feeling of financial comfort/ safety net. Now this all doesn’t bother me too much, but I am admittedly going to have to dip into my savings a bit in order to get this car I’d like and touch it up. \n\nAs a result, it might take a bit longer until we move out together. She tells me that she supports any decision I make and ultimately it’s up to me of course - but also keeps banging the same drum on how it makes her sad and that she feels like I’m choosing a car over her. It does flick my guilt switch pretty hard. I’m thinking about just finding a beater for the mean time to try and make the best of both worlds - but it’s hard to let go of this car I’m looking at. \n\nI rarely put my own desires ahead of people, but this is sort of how I see this situation:\n\nShe could be living with me right now, but she’s created parameters stopping that from happening for herself. Instead, she wants me to save more and live somewhere to pay more rent than I currently am.\n\nShe’s also quite self aware of the fact that her mindset is stopping her from being able to get what she ultimately wants (living together), yet I feel like a dick for upsetting her because we won’t move out just quite as soon as we could. I feel like a bit of a dick in this scenario, because I do want to move out together and would love to have our own place despite paying a little more and I feel like getting this car would show otherwise. \n\nHowever I also don’t feel like my desires are unreasonable - we’ll still move out together most likely within the year and I will also get the car I really want. \n\nSo Reddit, if you made it through all that faff, WIBTA for buying a car?",

      "description": "Throwaway account. Originally posted in r/AITA and I deleted the original post and reposted here once I realized this is the correct subreddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened to me back in high school. One of my classmates, let's call him Tim, was this really innocent, sweet-looking school kid. He was an average student, was deferential to teachers and adults, and was generally liked by the popular kids in my school. Tim was about 5'2'' in height and had a generally pleasant appearance/demeanor. He was a bit of a class clown in that he'd make jokes in class and was generally regarded as this fun-loving, do-no-wrong kid by many.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't meet Tim until high school (he had gone to a different elementary and middle school in my town) but it was no secret that Tim was a cancer survivor - he had brain cancer when he was in elementary school and sported a buzz cut all throughout high school that would accentuate this large scar (possibly scars?) on his scalp. A good number of kids in my high school went to elementary school with him and remembered him going through chemotherapy and would frequently tell anybody who didn't already know that Tim was a hero for beating pediatric cancer. Tim had achieved this cult hero status by high school and it was cool to be friends with, or friendly towards, Tim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, on the other hand, was pretty unpopular. I wore hand-me-down clothes from my much-older brother and had really strict parents that didn't let me go out much, so I was socially awkward. I was nice (or I think I was?), so people generally left me alone, but it wasn't unheard of for people to openly bully me for being the weird guy. Tim decided to piggy-back on this general sentiment of making me a punching bag, and openly ridiculed me in front of his popular friends. In private, he started hitting me (main example I can think of was him hitting me pretty hard with weight room equipment - always when the PE teacher wasn't looking, so the teacher didn't believe me). He started picking on the few friends I had and even turned some of the friends I had against me, because it became cool to make fun of me because Tim did it. Being my former friends, I had confided some embarrassing information to them and they therefore had even more fuel to add to the fire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my best friends, Sarah, stood by me and quietly endured the insults he lobbed at both me and her until our junior year of high school, when her mom died. Her dad took her out of school for a month because it really shattered her world. During that month, Tim continued to taunt me and would say really messed up stuff, like asking me if I missed my friend, who was at home missing her dead mom. Sarah finally came back to school and it was pretty clear that she was still going through a rough patch. Tim saw her distress and asked her if \"she missed her mommy\", then cackled with laughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally snapped and socked Tim so hard in the face that he fell backwards onto his back. He started crying and ran and told the teachers that I had punched him. I got sent to the principal's office. The principal called my mom and told her that I had \"punched a pediatric cancer survivor\" in the face and that she needed to come get me because I was going to be on a one week suspension while the district considered expelling me from school. My mom was pissed off at me because she had to take unpaid time off work to get me (remember, poor family), and all the teachers/principal/classmates told me I was an asshole for hitting someone who survived cancer. Tim's mom came in screeching at my mom about how I probably gave her son a concussion, and a condition for my eventual return to the school was to write him an apology for hitting him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr My high school bully, who survived pediatric brain cancer, bullied me and my friends for years. He finally goes too far by insulting my best friend's dead mother, so I punched him in the face. AITA?",

      "description": "There is a bit of a back story to this. So originally I placed an order a few months ago on Uber Eats, when the delivery guy got here I was brushing my teeth and didn’t immediately here the door bell. He might’ve waited a max of 5 minutes. When I got to the door he was not only rude but extremely threatening. He questioned me aggressively “What took you so long you know I’m waiting?” It was hostile and actually odd. Never been in a situation where I thought an employee was a danger or something. I then made the comment “Hey man, sorry I kept you waiting I’ll throw in a couple extra bucks” genuinely trying to be nice. He proceeds to make me uncomfortable. I can’t really describe the situation but it wasn’t just him being mad about waiting, he actually felt like a loose canon and he might hit me or something. He then leaves, but instead of tipping him I said screw that, left him nothing and went on about my life. \n\nA few months goes by and that brings me to today, I made an order on Uber Eats and what do you know he is my driver. The last time I saw him made me so uncomfortable I almost canceled it, but he was to close and decided not to. He gets to the door and I know he remembers me but a split second before I opened it I thought I’d be polite. I said “Thank you sir.” He sort of just shoves it in my hands and doesn’t say a word. \n\nI contacted Uber and asked them to blacklist him from coming to my house. Never asked for a refund or anything like. Just want to be able to order food without that turd coming here again. Oh well. \n\nSo AITA\n\ntl;dr Uber Eats driver was a dick, contacted support and pretty sure he doesn’t work there anymore ",

      "description": "I wasn't sure if I want to post this here or in relationship advise. I think that it makes more sense in this sub since I want to get perspective on if I am the asshole and should change or if I'm validated in being mad.\n\nI rent a room from my bfs mother. He still lives with her, so technically we kinda live together.\n\nNow I often experience him being super selfish (from my POV). He won't use 30 min of his time to save 2h for me and generally doesn't like to get out of his comfort zone to do things I ask him to.\n\nI dearly love him and I do believe that he also loves me and this relationship is super important for me, so usually when I'm pissed at him I try to communicate to him the reason why and if he refuses to admit that it's his fault (I can't remember him admitting it a single time), I just back off and try to calm down on my own and stop being mad. Even when I demand an apology I won't get it, so if I don't talk to him first we'll probably wouldn't have talked ever again.\n\nNow today he got home 2.5h before I did. Knowing this I asked him to prepare dinner for us. Imo it's reasonable in this case. He doesn't reply to me for the next 4h after I asked him, so I just assume he saw it and will prepare something.\n\nI get home and... Nothing. His mother is very apologetic and says she didn't know I'd be home at this time otherwise she would've prepared something. She made some rice pudding though, so I can have it if I want to.\n\nEven though she cooks for all of us most of the time, this time she clearly stated she doesn't have the time and we should take care of it ourselves. Shouldn't be a problem when my bf is home at 3PM, right?\n\nSo at this point I am already pissed. I go into his room and he is in front of the computer. I ask him why he didn't make dinner for us, to what he replies that he didn't have dinner himself and his mother made rice pudding anyway so I can just eat that. He also says he didn't have time because he had to work on his written proposal for a project.\n\nThis made me even more mad as I know that 1. He probably started 15 minutes before I came and slept/watched series until then and 2. It's not something that takes a whole evening, so he could have made some food and then started with his work. He also knows I'm trying to lose weight and after not eating the whole day, a load of useless carbs that will make me full for 30 minutes isn't something I want to eat.\n\nIn the end I made myself some eggs, nothing for him because I really don't see why I should work on dinner when I came home after 12h being away, and then I just ate downstairs and not in our room and planned on cleaning after it to get my mind off things.\n\nWhen he came into the kitchen he ignored me, as if I wronged him, and went to bed afterwards (at 6:30PM). So I guess this work of his wasn't this time consuming after all.\n\nHe didn't talk to me and I refuse to cave in and talk to him. I am so tired of being the bigger person all the time.\n\nSorry for this wall of text. I just really need to get it out of my system and I would also like to know if I am overreacting and being an asshole or if my anger is justified.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": " \n\nMy Grandma is 84 has Meniere's disease, depression, and high blood pressure. I live with her and my uncle lives on the property in a trailer (20-acre property, we don't see him much). I go to all the doctor's appts and take notes because my Grandma \"doesn't remember\" what they said, until I show her the note then it's an \"I didn't want to remember what they said\". Needless to say, she isn't big on doctors.\n\nThe doctors out here aren't big on me either. I've pointed out every time we go to her GP that blood pressure has to be taken after 10 min of sitting down with feet flat on the floor (and not needing to go pee, not having eaten in the last 1/2 hr, and so on). Every time we go in they assure me that they take it twice and take the average. I point out that when one number is WAY OFF the average will also be off. They get mad, I get mad, Grandma gets mad. Rinse and repeat. At home **and** after 10 min of rest at the doctor's office her BP is consistently 120/60. Two weeks ago they called and said that 4 months ago (I was away and asked my uncle to take my Grandma to the doctor) they asked that Grandma come in twice a month for BP monitoring, my uncle wasn't in the room and my Grandma \"forgot\". I'm on her HIPA and make all her appts so I made an appt for later that week and not an hour later we got a callback, the office refused to talk to me. Grandma still refuses to wear her hearing aids and just said \"yes\" and asked me to call back to figure out what it was about. I called back, found out that the doctor doesn't want me at ANY of her appts, and pointed out that every single appt that she has gone to the last 2 years has been made by me, and pointed out that before me my Grandma was notorious for canceling or not showing up to any doctor appts. They agree, but her doctor doesn't like me. I pointed out that because I was on her HIPA that it is my right. Again, they agree, but her doctor thinks I'm bossy.\n\nThe doctor thinks I'm bossy not just because of the BP, but also the Meniere's disease. I told her about the ENT's diagnoses, and that my Grandma HAS TO wear her hearing aid and glasses. Her GP said, \"your granddaughter is just being controlling, don't listen to her\". 2 months later Grandma fell and the EMT's agreed that is was the Meniere's disease. I called her GP and explained that she fell for the 4th time that year and she owes me an apology and should update her records to include the ENT diagnoses. I did later have the ENT fax over her records to her GP, but the office really should have done that already. I filed a complaint that time but when my Grandma found out SHE was PISSED and said I had no right.\n\nAITA for filing another complaint against her doctor despite how Grandma feels?",

      "description": "Okay, so generally I am strongly against ghosting people and would prefer to confront the person in order to preserve the relationship or, if ending the relationship, give the other person closure. In this case, I think ghosting is the route to go but am unsure and want to avoid hurting anyone as much as possible. \n\nSo, last year, when I was in high school, I became friends with Jenny and Bruce. We all vibed off each other really well and just generally had a fun time together. Jenny, however, began to do things that bugged me. She'd be very passive aggressive, straight up ignore you if she was upset sometimes, and be manipulative. She could also often be emotionally draining to be around. While I am willing to support a friend in need, when it was just me and her alone, she'd turn the conversation to her personal problems nearly every time we spoke. She was beginning to be too much for me, but I figured maybe it'd pass.\n\nAfter we all graduated, I wanted to continue hanging out with her and Bruce because we all had fun together. For the most part, it was a decent time. But I found that she kept doing more and more things that irked me. Eventually, I realized I was going to my other friends complaining about the things she'd do, and that's when two things hit me: A) that I sort of dislike Jenny, and B) that that's a pretty shitty, asshole-ish thing to do. Friends shouldn't be complaining about you behind your back, and friends don't act like they like you to your face when in reality they sort of dislike you. Jenny and I aren't very close anyway, and we don't text on the daily or anything. In fact, we rarely text or talk outside of hanging out with Bruce at all. I think if I were to ghost her, she probably wouldn't notice too much. I should also clarify that by ghosting, I wouldn't lose her number or anything. I would still respond to a text if she sent one, but I wouldn't be initiating any conversations, and I certainly won't be hanging out with her again. Also, if she were to ask if we were still friends or why I'm not really around anymore, I'd give her an honest answer. I just want to make sure that this approach of, just kind of... not initiating anything... makes me a dick or if I should confront her straight-up and be honest now.\n\nTL;DR: Became friends with this girl, realized I sort of dislike her and decided I don't want to be her friend anymore. WIBTA if I don't make any more efforts to be her friend and silently let her go, or should I tell her straight-up that I am no longer interested in being her friend?",

      "description": "I have known a guy since 2006 and in 2017 he landed a 10 week contract gig in the city my wife and I had just bought a house in. With a spare bedroom we agreed to let him stay with us for a total of $1000. This came out to about $400/month. We had a few issues such as him thinking he could eat our food and use our toiletries but that we settled and when he moved out we thought things went alright and offered him to come back if the chance provided itself.\n\nQue a few months later when has another contract job. Enough time had passed that my wife made the spare bedroom her craft room but I rarely used my office so I figured he could crash in there, again at $400 since he wouldn't have his own place. He goes to sleep at 8PM when I go to sleep at 11PM, I adjusted A LOT to respect his privacy but whatever, he is a friend, right? When he came up he had nothing but clothes and his computer desk so I bought a futon that I had wanted in there for awhile as well as clearing off some shelves for him. We also agreed that he would pay an extra roughly $50 month to cover food and toiletries. This started informally with him occasionally covering groceries when we went shopping but I noticed one month he didn't pay anything because both times we went shopping we bought a lot of food. We settled this by making rent a firm $450. In all this time $400 and then $450 was a \"family chipping in\" rate. He used our everything just as if he was family. Internet, streaming, TV, etc, it was included.\n\nAs his initially 3 month contract got extended to 4, 5, and finally 6 months I decided that it was time to give him his own room. He was a bit reluctant to make us shuffle stuff around but when his contract got made into a permanent deal I asked if he planned on moving soon, he said no, and we made it happen.\n\nWhen he got his own room we had an issue where he thought he could take the futon, bookshelves, and everything else he was using in there, of course not as I paid for all that and actively had plans and used it. After he was in his own room he began to further regress to a previous version of himself that drank heavily and overall didn't engage me or my wife. There are a lot of issues beyond what I can write in 3000 characters but it got rough.\n\nWe decided to charge market rate of $600 + $50 for food and toiletries. We gave him two months of the old rate if he wanted to leave and one month of the current rate before increasing if he wanted to stay. He decided option C, leave before March was over with.\n\nI am bothered because I wanted to help him out. This dude is making over $2.5k/month, has no expenses, and was basically taking advantage of me. He thinks he can either go full work from home in a contract job which will kill his future prospects or find a place up here for himself but rooms run for $800 starting out.\n\nAm I justified here or just and asshole?",

I told my girlfriend she couldn't come unless she's better by tomorrow, because this could end very badly for my mom.

      "description": "My girlfriend’s close friend, Mary, is getting married next summer and my girlfriend and her friend Julia are going to be bridesmaids. To begin with both Julia and Mary told my girlfriend that I have to wear a suit because it would be inconsiderate of me not to, and every other man will be wearing one. I’m not sure that it’s true though that every other man will be wearing one, since there isn’t any official dress code for the wedding. I told my girlfriend that I didn’t want to wear one because I’m a student and suits are very expensive – She understood me and thought it was ok. So, I told Julia and Mary that I don’t want to buy a suit because it’s too expensive for me. Mary does understand me to some extent, but she still thinks it’d be best to wear a suit in order to fit in, but otherwise she wouldn’t mind if I didn’t wear one. But Julia doesn’t understand me at all and seems to think a suit is the only acceptable thing to wear at a wedding, and that I have to wear a suit in order to fit in and be accepted by the others. But since I’d only be buying it for the wedding, I think it’s a waste of money. I told them I was going to be wearing something nice and that I of course wouldn’t show up in sweatpants or something. But it seems like Julia thinks that a suit is the only acceptable thing to wear at a wedding. I would respect if the bride told me I had to wear a suit, but I don’t feel like spending money on a suit just to fit in and to satisfy one of the bridesmaids. I understand that you can’t show up in just anything and you have to look nice, but I don’t understand why it’s so important for her that I wear a suit. Would I be the asshole for not wearing a suit to the wedding? ",

      "title": "AITA For Cutting my Daughter off Financially but not my Son?",
      "description": "Some background here, my daughter is 22, son is 19. I grew up in a very poor family my parents brought in maybe 30k together growing up so I never got anything or asked for anything. Started mowing lawns and shoveling snow at 11 to help out with groceries and save and I have been busting my ass everyday since to get rich. I paid my way through college and I'm very blessed to say that I'm wealthy now. Because of this I wanted my kids to never experience the hard shit I had to go through as a kid being so poor and never having anything. \n\nAs a result my daughter is spoiled as can be, like think of those teen girls on my sweet 16 type of spoiled. I realized this is my fault and my wifes because ever since she was a little girl I got her whatever she wanted no matter the price. Benz for her 16th bday, designer clothes since she was like 13, designer bags, trips to exotic places, credit card with a 5k limit she maxes out monthly, paid her tuition for 4 years, bought her a condo after she graduated last spring etc etc. \n\nMy son who's 19 has never really asked for much, sports fee's/equipment, consoles, other electronics and he only wanted a Honda when he turned 16 and he still drives it. He also works part time and I gave him a CC with a 1000 limit which he doesn't come close to maxing out but not bad. I'm happy he's a hardworking level headed kid and I see a lot of myself in him, he's a go getter and savvy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where the problems start with my daughter, she graduated in June with a BA in Psych and has never worked before. I bought her a condo downtown as a grad present and I keep nudging her to try and find a job but she's too busy trying to become a model on instagram so my wife says. Around xmas time a few weeks ago I told my wife I was cutting her off almost completely except for 1k a month allowance. No more 5k credit card limit and coming to mommy and daddy whenever she needs cash. My wife said what about our son, you're not gonna cut him off? I said no because he has worked since he was 16 and I barely have even given him anything in comparison to his sister. Plus he's in college still so I pay for his tuition. My wife was not pleased with this and said a Dad should not do this but I was adamant about teaching my daughter about the real world. I sat down with my daughter and she got super mad as expected and insulted me a lot, I almost cried after she left. I've given my life to make money to make my family happy and to hear that from my daughter made me so sad. But I knew I still had to do this for her own sake, so I took away her card and gave her 1k cash and told her to come see me at the end of January for another 1k. I told her to get a job and that I would pay for a career coach and everything to help her. She was mad and didn't answer me other than calling me a bad dad and an asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit AITA?",

      "description": "So a few years ago, I was a freshman/sophomore in highschool. I was going though a major depression and was having panic attacks weekly so I basically stopped going to school, and got into homeschooling.... however the principals of the school didn't tell me teachers what was happened to me and just took me off the roster. This made most of the teachers and my friends that I didn't know outside of school think that something bad/fatal had happened to me.\n\n So basically I, for the most part  was MIA to my teachers. One of these teachers is Mr. J. Mr J was one of, if not my favorite teachers in highschool. He teaches/teached Latin. Mr.J was always pressuring us to continue taking Latin until Latin IV, so the class would have enough students to actually have a real class. (Without me it would've been like 3 students I think?)\n\nAfter I finished the year I vanished, I took a year off and came back for my junior year. Coincidentally, Mr. J was in the library where I was registering for school. Mr. J comes up to be a politely asks what happened to me a year ago. I told him my story and he asked if I would be continuing Latin. I said no and I apologized. He said it was good to know I wasn't dead.\n\nCut to my senior year, I kinda want to join the Ultimate Frisbee team but Mr.J is the coach. My best friend who used to be the best player on the team, is heavily pressuring me to join, and honestly, I want to.....but Mr.J is pretty icy, basically giving me the cold shoulder whenever I talk to him, responding as little as possible. I'm fairly certain I've offended him by not continuing Latin but honestly I have no idea. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not turning off house lights?",
      "description": "My stepdad’s biggest pet peeve is when people leave lights on, and since I was a kid, I’ve been the worst offender. Now, I’m 24 years old, and I’m living with my parents for 6 weeks while I’m in-between leases. \n\nI can’t honestly remember neglecting to turn off lights when I leave the room when I was a kid, but I’ll take my stepdad at his word and agree that I probably wasn’t good at it. Now that I’m adult, and I’ve grown up with my stepdad making comments about lights being left on, it’s something I’m extremely aware of especially at my parents’ house, so I always make an effort to turn them off. \n\nUnfortunately though, I am not perfect, and I still leave lights on — never for an extended period of time but they’re still on. Now that I’m back at my parents’ house, I’m reminded that my stepdad’s comments about the lights are very annoying. \n\nHe never asks me to turn off the lights. Instead, he’ll turn them off and say something like “There’s a ghost in your room!” or “The ghost in ______’s room strikes again!” This happens about once a day, and each time I have to take a moment to recollect myself because it gets me so irritated. I feel that if my stepdad asked me to turn off the lights, then I would probably end up being better at turning off the lights because I would be forced to “clean up” after myself. Because my stepdad makes passive aggressive comments though, it just ends up making me resent him. The last time he made a comment I told him “Y’know, I think I might have gotten the best at turning off lights that I’m ever going to get, and all your comments do is make me dislike you.” Again, I feel like I’ve gotten a lot better at this admittedly bad habit, so not only do I feel these comments are unnecessarily condescending, but I also feel that they’re a mischaracterization of me. \n\nMy siblings and I all agree that his remarks are annoying, but when I’ve talked to my mom about it, she shrugs and just says “it’s his house.” My stepdad refuses to acknowledge that I’ve gotten better at turning off lights and side-eyes me whenever I mention that this bad habit isn’t so bad anymore. I understand that not turning off lights is wasteful, but they’re never on for such a long period of time that it could ever amount to anything wasteful, and I feel that it’s such a minor and unintentional transgression that if he doesn’t want to ask me to turn off the lights, then he shouldn’t make the passive aggressive “jokes.”\n\nAITA for feeling that my stepdad should stop making passive comments about my bad habit of leaving lights on?\n\nTL;DR: I forget to turn off lights in the house, which is my stepdad’s pet peeve, so he makes passive aggressive remarks at my expense.

      "description": "So long story short I moved back to my home state to live with my sister and her family because my Dad has cancer.  I moved here with my fiance (we are living in the guest room) under the premise to take care of my dad and take him to his hospital appointments.  I gave up a 70k job in NYC to do this.  My dad was typically the one to take care of the kids, (toddler and elementary school age) but obviously can't as effectively under his conditions.  My sister and her husband go to work for most of the day as well as my fiance who just got a new job out here.  This leaves me as a glorified babysitter, having to pick up, and drop off kids to school on top of taking care of my Dad and take him to his appointments.  When I don't want to do it I feel like get a guilt trip.  It feels like I got bait and switched to take care of the kids instead of my dad.  It feels like my sacrifice is being taken a bit advantage of.  I feel like I have no time for myself or any way to make a living as I'm trying to get a new gig out here.  I basically ruined my career path I had going and my very comfortable lifestyle living on my own to move in with family and essentially have no job other than taking care of everyone.  It's affecting my mood, psyche and relationships with everyone in the household.  When everyone gets home I don't even want to congregate with everyone because when I do, everyone just brings up stuff that I have to do.  When I bring up frustration about this the insinuation is that I am being selfish, lazy and I should just deal with \"life\".  Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have antisocial personality disorder. I lack the same morals as regular people, and in the past I have engaged in regressive behavior.\n\nThese are all facts that I accept and am now regularly receiving therapy for, which was first suggested by my parents. There has been serious conflict throughout my life with my parents about my behavior and sexual desires.\n\nI have done everything they asked of me. I have moved out, I have an amazing career, I have my own apartment and my own car, as well as a girlfriend who satisfies my every need.\n\nThey still refuse to accept me back into the family as a full member. They don't do this directly but indirectly. I was not invited to either christmas or new years. My mother coddles my less successful siblings and showers them with affection and it enrages me.\n\nNot to mention the fact that this rejection is sabotaging my therapy as I have had more regressive thoughts this past week than in the past 4 months. I am fuming. Since my father works in the same business circle as I do (different companies, same field) some fuck heads have been messaging me asking if I enjoyed my families new years celebration without knowing I wasn't there.\n\nDespite all my faults I make more than my father did at my age, and have a life that puts both of my siblings to shame. My girlfriend is an immaculate beauty who is completely compatible with me. I have been more or less an obedient son my entire life. Especially in recent years since I went to therapy.\n\nAITA for being angry that they are rejecting me, their only successful son? Despite me doing exactly what they asked? ",

      "description": "So this guy (I'll call him A) was a super close friend of mine as a kid, but as adults we've vastly grown apart. Since we left high school 4 years ago, we've literally only spent time together once, and only keep in touch on social media. We don't speak all that often and when we do speak, it's incredibly forced. We have nothing in common and it's just really awkward. I've also noticed an undertone of racism in some of what he says to me sometimes - I'm Muslim and South Asian, he's white. For example, after the Manchester arena terror attack he sent me some messages basically asking which side I was on, as if he thought it was possible I'd side with the terrorist. That's not the only low-key racist conversation but it's the worst one and the one I remember most clearly. \n\n\nThe other layer to this is that, A is just really not a great person, morally. He's got some kind of addiction to affairs I guess, in that he exclusively sleeps with/dates married people. He's ruined several marriages, including ones where kids were involved. His current girlfriend, who I'll call R, was married when they met. R's husband went away on a business trip, and when he came home all of his things were in boxes and A was living in his house. Since R owned the house, her husband couldn't argue and just had to leave. \n\n\nIn his affair with R, and in ones before it, he's always told me about it in such explicit detail, as if he's bragging that he can get married women. He mainly comes to me for validation. He tells me why he's justified in his affairs, and gets angry at me if I tell him I think he's wrong. Hearing about what he was doing to these people really affected me to be honest, cos it was just so immoral. One of his past \"girlfriends\" was the wife of his close friend, and their kids were his godchildren, and he would use babysitting the godchildren as an excuse to be in their home and sleep with his friends wife. The affair ruined that marriage and those little kids lives. \n\n\nAnyway, the AITA part is: I'm just really tired of A. He's become someone I don't align with morally, and we really don't have that friendship connection anymore anyway. But he keeps pushing it. He's been talking about me meeting R for a while now, as if we're still really close and I *have* to meet his girlfriend. I feel awkward and don't want to flat out say no because that makes me feel rude, but I don't really feel like spending time with them considering what they did to R's husband. I really honestly don't get why he keeps forcing the friendship; it's blatantly obvious that we have nothing at all in common and aren't close anymore. \n\n\nAt the same time though, dropping him makes me feel bad. I went through some tough patches with mental health in high school and he was the only person who stuck by me, so I feel like I owe him some loyalty in our friendship. \n\n\nIn summary, we aren't really compatible friends, we're different people, and when we do speak he tells me about things that I just can't side with him on, but gets angry with me if I don't validate his shitty behaviour. If the world was perfect, I think we would just slowly drift into our separate lives. But he's adamantly keeping in touch and keeps trying to make plans with me. AITA if I turn all these plans down and dry-reply him til the friendship fades out? ",

      "description": "Recently my car has broken down and I don’t have the money to get it fixed yet. My partner was unemployed until this week so they’ve been driving me to work, which is only a 5 minute drive from our house. However, earlier this week they started a new job (delivery driving). On Wednesday, which was my partner’s second day of work, I found out I am scheduled to work an event this weekend (Friday-Sunday) 45 minutes away from our house.\n\nI texted my partner about it immediately and asked if they would be able to drive me. I told them I would prefer them to drive me so that I can work my scheduled shifts, but if they couldn’t I would work it out with my boss so that my hours would change and I could catch a ride with him. They told me that they would know their schedule by that night. I then told my boss that I would know by that night if I had a ride.\n\nAfter work I asked my partner if they would be able to drive me. They said they hadn’t yet been given hours over the weekend. They also said that someone had asked if they could work on Sunday and they had avoided giving an answer because of the possibility of having to drive me. I said “I told [boss] that I would know by tonight if you could drive me, so he’s expecting an answer tonight. I’m going to tell him you can take me. Is that okay?” My partner agreed and so I told my boss.\n\nThis morning I was barely able to get my partner out of bed to drive me, and they expressed that they’re mad that they have to drive me 45 minutes away this weekend. They have not been asked to work, but they’re worried that if they are it’ll look bad for them to have to work around my schedule. My point of view is that I gave them ample time to back out, told them I had a backup plan, and they turned down an opportunity to work even though I told them it would be okay if they had to work. Because of these things, I’m irritated that they’re mad now. Am I wrong?",

Sorry in advance that this is a long one. \n\nSo back in the March of 2016, one of my older sisters who we will call K, offered me a job to babysit her kids/my nephews. Since I wasn’t exactly out of my shell yet and being the hermit I was, I accepted. The babysitting thing was part-time and $5 an hour was a pretty sweet deal while her husband worked and she was busy with college. There were two boys to babysit, T who was just a baby at this time and P who was a toddler still in diapers. \n\nFast forward to my sister’s graduation which took place in May that same year. Yes I know a couple months isn’t accurate for someone in college but she had been going a year or two before she asked me to be a babysitter. She just decided to use me instead of the other person towards the end, I now get why.\n\nI had June and July to myself. No more babysitting, but still no pay. I never got paid on time and eventually they let it build up to where I was at $1000+. I would bring this fact up but get told each time by everyone ‘They are family, they will pay you’ and bull crap like that. August up to December I had to myself as well, she wanted to be a stay at home mom for the time being so she could spend time with her kids. I get that I guess, but once again I received NO pay. \nA few days before Christmas, I dropped my Surface Tablet and it broke, I was in tears but thought to myself I would use my babysitting money to help replace it with something new. With it being an older model that isn’t even made anymore, I couldn’t repair it without really dipping into my pockets from this fancy repair place. \n\nIt was now August of 2017, and surprise surprise  I still haven’t seen any money. My mom felt bad for me, she felt like I had waited far too long to get paid. She was right. Instead of waiting longer, I came forward and told K I wanted to be paid. She didn’t pay me and instead told me she would buy me a new tablet if I forgot about the rest of the money. I reluctantly accepted, only because I was so desperate to draw digitally again. In the end, my mom had to be the one to buy it because my sister wouldn’t. My mom never got that money she was owed.\n\nNow let’s move to September of 2018. K decided that she wanted to start working and so she did. I don’t know why but I accepted the babysitting job and quit my real job without realizing the changes that came with babysitting. I wasn’t even a babysitter anymore, I was a god damn nanny.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I love my nephews dearly but my sister did everything wrong. Discipline is something they never did and still don’t. No spankings, the corner is a joke to the kids as well as time out. T is still a bit young, currently being almost two. P however is three. I start babysitting T at 8am while P attends a preschool until 3pm. Then I watch both until K gets off work at 4:30pm or sometimes 5:00pm. Here’s the layout of my setup or routine, which I don’t agree with at all.\n\nMonday - Friday ; 8am - 4:30pm/5:00pm\n\nPay: 2$ an hour but they just give me $20 a day no matter what; even if I end up being woken up earlier than usual to watch them or I end up watching them later than 5\n\nWhen P doesn’t have school, I get paid an extra $5 for him. \n\nI brought up the fact I do not like this, and I gave up my real job for this. Here I am deadnamed, spit on, bitten, hit and just disrespected in general by the kids. I’ve tried teaching them something as simple as ‘Deadname isn’t my name anymore, it’s this now.’. They picked it up but my sister got annoyed and said how she doesn’t like me confusing them. I get criticized all of the time by my family on how I’m lucky to have this job and no real job will call me a different name and etc. I’m wanting to quit, and I technically did already.\n\nMy sister cried to me, saying that if I quit she’d have to quit her job cause they can’t afford it. With a heavy heart I took the job back but quitting is still on my mind. I feel conflicted. My mental health isn’t great here, and I’ve had days when the dreadful feeling is enough to stop me from eating. Overall, I’m not happy being here. \n\nAlso, I’m aware I don’t really have a say on claiming my sister K didn’t raise her kids right but I do still have an opinion.\n\nI’m still stuck with this job.",

      "description": "So I recently began dating someone I have had feelings for for a very long time. We've both liked each other since highschool but it has always been the wrong place or the wrong time. The problem is her brother is a very close friend and he doesn't seem to be okay with it. He hasn't come out and said it but he barely even acknowledges my existence anymore. The two of them have been arguing a lot lately too and while he won't say it I feel like it is because he feels betrayed. To add some context I met this girl first and then him through her. It's always been obvious we liked each other. Her parents even reacted with \"Well it's about time.\" I know he knew and it never bothered him until we actually started dating a few weeks ago. Am I the asshole here or does he need to get over it?",

      "description": "My roommate is pretty sensitive to a lot of things - noise, dirt, things being out of place, etc.  I moved in recently. He is generally a pretty nice and reasonable person, but I definitely feel like I walk around eggshells on him because he is definitely not one to not express when something is not how he likes it- which is fairly regularly.\n\nI’m a bit of a night owl and sleep late, and also shower at night. In part (but not primarily) because morning showers are more likely to get in the way of other people’s’ work commutes. This roommate’s room is right next to our bathroom, and as a result can hear when I shower in the bathroom. I don’t feel like I should switch my entire schedule around for him— perhaps augmented by a feeling that he otherwise dictates much of the apartment’s ongoings— but I also recognize that being a light sleeper is not something you can help.\n\nAITA for wanting to keep my shower schedule? Should I just shower a bit earlier? Or should I just try to keep the noise down in the bathroom as best I can? Trying to be reasonable but stand my ground as an equal roommate in the house.\n\nThanks!",

      "description": "Fairly self-explanatory title \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: Every time she gets her period she gets really emotionally needy. Like if I'm not with her 24/7 then she gets really sad. She also gets annoyed by EVERYTHING. She'll go on facebook and read someone's profile and they're too extroverted for her so she gets annoyed for the next 3 hours. Everything I do is always wrong and makes her mad, so she gives me the silent treatment. I let her have space and it makes her madder, but when I try to comfort her and ask what's wrong she gets upset that I am pestering her. She also gets very \"depressed\". She's down on herself cuz she doesn't get straight 100% on every assignment. She is self-diagnosed depressed, but absolutely refuses any type of help when I lightly suggest it. It is so emotionally draining to be her therapist for the week when its little problems that set her off like her roommate saying her homework is hard, and my girlfriend gets mad cuz her homework is harder cuz shes in engineering. \n\n  \nWe are both 19 and have been together for a little over 2 years, and she is my first girlfriend so I don't know if this is something that is usual for girls or specific to her. I know her hormones are the cause of it, but I always think of breaking things during the week. I didn't do it the first time because we are both on the same sports team and that is drama I don't want. Every time after I remind myself that I made it through the last time, so I can make it thru this one. I spoke to some friends and got mixed responses, some saying I'm the Asshole for \"leading her on\" and some say that what I go through is normal. \n\n  \nI'm just really conflicted because I absolutely don't want to lead her on or anything, but I don't know if these thoughts will ever dissipate.

      "description": "Throwaway, because reasons. Also, mobile. Apologies if needed. \n\nSituation is complicated, but I'll try to be as to the point as I can. Buddy of mine (let's call him Arthur) has been dating this girl (let's call her Carol) for a few years now, sorta on and off as they have their ups and downs. One big down they have is that Arthur tends to keep a lot of secrets from Carol. \n\nMy usual policy is to not interfere in others' relationships, so I don't usually ask to meet who friends are dating (makes it easier to not get into sticky situations) and even when I do, I don't try to befriend them, or interact with them without friends around. Now, you might call that a lot of negative things, and I will likely agree with you. I am not here to win nice guy, or 'nice guy', awards. \n\nProblem for me started when Arthur asked another buddy of mine (we'll call him Roy) and I to help him out. Carol had wanted to try playing an MMORPG and had asked Arthur to join her and her friends in doing so. He wasn't a big fan of MMOs, and knew that Roy and I had been looking for a new MMO to occupy our free time. So after a bit of begging on Arthur's part, and Carol herself talking to us excitedly about the game, Roy and I agreed. \n\nIf any of you don't know, playing an MMO as a small guild sorta requires members to interact with each other pretty regularly. So after a few months of it, I got to know Carol and her friends and them me. \n\nIt was around this time that Arthur and Carol started to have one of their down periods in their relationship. Carol had found out that Arthur had lied to her about going on a group lunch meeting just to meet another girl he apparently had a thing for before. When she confronted me about the lunch meeting, I (at this point, was unaware of any issues between them regarding this girl) confirmed details she asked about.\n\nArthur is understandably pissed at me for \"blabbing\", while Carol is pissed at him for lying to her when she confronted him before revealing I had confirmed the details. \n\nSince I'm friends with her friends, they told me I did the right thing by telling her. But mutual friends of mine and Arthur's tell me I'm a traitor for doing so. I tried to talk to Arthur to try to tell him to just come clean with her, but he has ignored all my messages.\n\nSo, after that mouthful... AITA here? ",

      "description": "Backstory: I auditioned last week for my middle/high school’s production of High School Musical. I felt really good about my audition, I sang really well for once, and I thought that my line reads were good. I was really hoping I’d get a Troy or Chad.\n\nGood news: I got Chad\n\nBad News: My sister got Taylor, the character’s love interest.\n\nSo I check the cast list, see my name as Chad, and am super excited. But when I see my sister as Taylor, my heart drops. Now, don’t get me wrong, my sister’s a great singer and actress, and she deserved Taylor. She was as good as anyone else at the audition, but she was in 6th grade, so I didn’t expect her to get the part. I wasn’t even concerned. The theater group chat I’m in is 20% roasting me (dicks but I love them so that didn’t hurt me or anything), and 80% “oh god that’s kinda fucked”. I talk to my parents about it, and then I text one of my three directors asking what the extent of their relationship is, and she says they have a couple of lines at the end involving it, but she’s “willing to adjust”.  Now just the fact that they have a romantic relationship makes me uncomfortable, especially considering most of the other people in my school have seen high school musical, so they’d know the characters are romantically involved, and know my sister, so I’d probably get insulted and shit for months. Either way, still willing to negotiate, Coach Bolton, a much smaller role, is marked as TBA and I’d be willing to take him, but I really would’ve liked Chad because we have a awards show in our area and it’s my last year I’ll be able to participate, I’m moving. Now about 20 minutes ago, my father calls from the play he’s in right now where two of the said directors are present. \n\nIt turns out they’d never even read the script for the play they’re directing or seen the movie. \n\nNow, I’m incredibly pissed. Who doesn’t read the script before casting a show? I’m so angry at this point I’m considering just quitting without hearing their other avenues. Is that fair? I really have no interest in dealing with people who had their first read of the script after the casting, and I definitely don’t want to be with my sister. So Reddit, WIBTA?\n",

      "description": "  \n\nI'm gonna rewrite this as short and sweet as I can\n\n\nA few months ago I lost my best friend after a long and close relationship, over..I dont even know..so I'll go over a timeline of sorts.  (Names changed for privacy)\n___________\n- Me and best friend(Bill) belong to an outfit of friends, important ones that'll come up later will be Pablo, Wilson, Tony, and Ike. Just like every other friend group we like to make fun of eachother, brutally. Over race, weight, social skills, etc.  \n\n- Bill and I are playing something on Xbox when I leave to go grab something and take a bit longer than expected.   \n\n- I come back to find Bill has left the game and is now in a party and playing with Tony and Ike. Tony's okay, but Ike is someone both of us dont like tbh, we tolerate him cos he's Pablo and Wilson's friend.   \n\n- Sent a message to Bill \"You ditched me for a Mexican and a wannabe fuckboi?\". Got a message back \"At least Tony and this bitch aren't breathing all heavy in my ear, ya fatass\" Laugh it off, continue life.  \n\n**2 WEEKS LATER**   \n\n- Some shit goes down and me and Bill are excommunicated from the group.   \n\n**4 MONTHS LATER**   \n\n- Get text from Wilson \"That sneak dis tho\", ask for clarification, he sends a screencap of the aforementioned messages between me and Bill. Text back \"Well, Tony IS Mexican and not really, cos I've called Ike that plenty of times\" also \"Why do you have access to a private convo between me and Bill?\", says he used to watch Netflix with Bill's account.    \n\n- Text Bill and tell him the situation and that maybe he should change his password.  \n\n**2 WEEKS LATER**   \n\n- Go out on the town with Bill, he drops me off and I get a text from Pablo (in the Xbox App) \"That sneak dis tho\", text back \"what? The Mexican, wannabe fuckboi thing\" get a text back \"Sorry, you must have the wrong account\". Realized I got baited for a vulgarity report.  \n\n- Not long after I get a text from Ike, \"fuck you u fat stupid bitch dont be talkin shit bout me cuz I have friends that u dont. Fuck u fatboy\"  \n\n- Microsoft must've been hungry cos they jumped on that shit within hours, like it was the last piece of pizza on the pan. I get a 2 week suspension for racial insensitivity and cyberbullying.  \n\n- Call support and explain that these people used to be my friends and we did this all the time, and they just baited me for a report out of context. They tell me a suspension needs to be on record for this but for some unknown reason it gets knocked down to a 2 day suspension. Feeling a bit sour I also whisper in their ear shout a truly vulgar message I got from somebody just a few hours ago. I know they aren't gonna do anything about it, buy I felt better telling them and imagining that they would. Finally, text Bill the situation and go to bed.  \n\n- Next day Bill comes over with something I left in his car, and pulls me into the hall, he says \"lose my number and dont talk to me anymore, I dont want to be friends with someone like you\"  \n\n- break down in the hall as my mom texts Bill and asks him why. Bill says he thinks I'm a bad person, and an asshole. I text Bill and ask for an explanation, Bill says I'm a shitty person, I should've just let it go, and I should've never talked shit about them behind their backs. Even though he did too all the time, when we were all friends and we weren't. Because we all knew we did, and none of us gave a shit. And none of us ever said anything we wouldnt say to their face.  \n\n**A WEEK LATER**   \n\n- Text Wilson about the whole situation cos me and him, out of everyone, are still kinda \"good\" or neutral at least, and come to learn that Bill went behind my back about a month after our excommunication and made amends with all them and started hanging out in secret. I wouldnt have given a shit, but I at least would've liked to be told that he was tryna make things right with them.    \n\n___________\n\nSo....AITA?\n\n\nTL;DR best friend broke up friendship for something I said about some ex friends of ours, after also saying things but then making up with them without telling me.

I have very few friends, and so I try to hang out with them as much as possible. Unfortunately, a lot of their schedules are mixed and hard to pin down. \n\nSo I tried to invite one of my friends to hang out. She couldn't, and we settled on a \"Maybe next time\". A few days later, no follow up on friend one and hanging out, I decide to invite a different friend out to a dinner. My treat. Friend says yes, and we start planning. Friend one texts me after I set plans with friend two, asking if we were still hanging out the next weekend. \n\nNow honestly, I would have invited friend one. I love her dearly and obviously want to hang out with her. But I don't have the money to treat more than myself and one other to a dinner that costs $50+ (I'm on freelance work, I don't get paid much and haven't had a job in a while). \n\nApparently, it didn't matter what I said anyway. Because friend one and two were talking behind my back about how rude I was to not have friend one in mind while planning a dinner. \n\nWe settled on going dutch, but I'm still upset about it. What does it matter if I invite one friend and not the other? I had no obligation to hang out with friend one. I'm upset that friend two would tell friend one in the first place, because who goes and tells another friend that they're being (not purposefully) excluded? \n\nI love both my friends with all my heart but I feel like they don't realize that I can invite one friend to something without the other NEEDING to be there.\n\nAITA for not thinking I did wrong in inviting one friend and not the other?

      "description": "burner account because I know I know people who've read these, at least in the past, but here's the story--\n\nMy husband(41M) and I(34F) are expecting our first child in March, and after a lot of research and discussion, we've decided to have a home birth and only go to a hospital in case of emergency. My MIL(65F) has been supportive and involved from the very beginning, and I definitely appreciate it, since she's an hour's drive away while my parents are across the country. However, she's also very sensitive to rejection, whether it's real or imagined, and I know I hurt her feelings when I told her that we're planning for the labor and first few hours to be just us, our midewife team, and the baby. No neighbors, no one from church, no friends, no family, not even her, until we've had some time as just the three of us.\n\n(my perception of) her side of it: She gave birth to two children (including Husband) at home and has experience. She loves us. She wants to support us and help out while we're occupied with Having A Baby. She wants to be there for her grandson's first moments.\n\nmy side of it: I'm worried that letting her into the house will open the door for other well-wishers before we're ready for them. Since they live so far away, my own parents won't be able to meet him in person for at least a week. She might want to bring my SIL, who is great, but not experienced, and will be just another person. Our house is small-- it's not like there's somewhere for anyone to wait that isn't right in the middle of everything for who knows how many hours while I yell and moan and have contractions. I feel like it's one thing to wait in a hospital waiting room for a nurse to bring you in, and another to wait in the living room while I'm a wall away. My MIL is also very happy to offer advice, and I don't want that while I'm busy with a baby. Last one, which is a little petty: she &lt;i&gt;loves&lt;/i&gt; posting pictures to facebook, and I don't know what she might choose to show people that maybe I don't want them to see.\n\nHusband has promised to keep her updated with texts and phone calls, and let her know as soon as the baby is born to come see him. I appreciate everything she's done/is doing in the months leading up to it, but I don't want her literally, physically there while I'm in labor. AIAH?",

      "description": "I love my wife, but she is not small. I mean she is only about 5 feet tall, but she's 140lbs, which is pretty big for someone her height. She's curvy, yes, but has a floppy stomach and flab on her arms and thighs, etc. \n\nLet me be clear: I have never cared that this is the case. I love her. I'm attracted to her. She has healthyish habits, I think she just sometimes overindulges in things like beer and ice cream. She's definitely not an alcoholic, but beer calories add up. I would prefer my wife be somewhat fat than be someone who is obsessed with staying 90lbs (not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just my preference, all bodies are good bodies and all of that). \n\nSome of my friends and I were over watching a game and shooting the shit, and it turned to dating. I'm the only married guy among us. One of the guys just started dating a new girl, who also happens to be rather fat (my guess is like 5'6 175?). The subject came up about her weight, and the guys razzed him. I chimed in and said I thought the girl was cute, she's really nice, and the guys in turn told me that I didn't get to comment because I was a chubby chaser, as evidenced by marrying my wife. \n\nI laughed along with this and said \"Yeah, (Wife) is pretty big too, huh?\" But wouldn't you know that was when my wife had come home from the gym. She heard it, passed through the room to make the point that she was there, and left to go upstairs to do girly shit. \n\nLater on, she approached me and told me it was hurtful, and that I'm an asshole for letting the guys call her fat. I argued that she knows she isn't thin, she's never tried to hide it, she's not ashamed of it, and that I love her as she is, so why does it matter? This isn't an end-all-be-all fight, she's already over it, but was I really an asshole for just shooting the shit with the guys and being realistic?",

      "description": "I moved in with my girlfriend a few months ago and she has made it pretty clear she doesn't like guns. I took her shooting to see if she would warm up to it but after firing one shot she was in tears and I felt horrible for even trying. \n\nThe only time I'm ever able to go shooting is when I drive 2-3 hours to my brother in law's place where he has multiple acres to shoot at and I only have the time to do that maybe once every few months. I love shooting and would love to go to one of the ranges near me to shoot but want to use my gun and not have to rent one. \n\nI tried talking to my girlfriend about how I would make everything completely safe keeping my gun in the house; keeping it locked up without ammo, not even having ammo in the house (I don't need it for protection just recreation), even keeping it locked away with the barrel locked in a separate location. \n\nI tried explaining to her that there's literally no way a gun could hurt someone unless it's loaded and that I would never keep ammo in the same house as my gun but she still wouldn't listen. \n\nShooting is a great stress reliever for me and while I can obviously live without my gun I really don't like only being able to go shooting by driving hours away on my weekends. \n\nAITA for wanting to keep my gun in the house?",

I could only see their lights flashing in my mirrors, which was very distracting and annoying.\nBut when I drove into a street from which I knew that it would have a speed limit of 30 instead of 50km/h after 300ish meters, I saw my opportunity to piss them of and drove extra slow.\nThey suddenly honked and as I looked, they turned right on the small cross road we were crossing at that moment.\n\nNow I feel bad because I braked far too early (but not very harsh) and could actually have caused an accident, but to my defense, they drove so close, I couldn't see his indicator. To this day I'm not even sure if they even were indicating at all.\n\nSorry, if this isn't that entertaining or anything, it just still bugs me to this day. Thanks in advance!",

      "description": "So hey, first post ever. Neat. Also, long post incoming\n\nSome context: I'm a high school senior (17F) and have been friends with a group of people since I was a sophomore. I kinda made the friend group and it expanded until junior year. I used to really really love and appreciate all of these people (I still do mostly) but after I went to a program over the summer and made amazing friends there, I realized that my friend group at home aren't the nicest. Another thing was that someone in my friend group also applied to this program in another subject but didn't get in.\n\nMy birthday was a few days after I came back from the program, so I invited both my friend group from the program and my one at home. I thought since everyone had similar interests, they would all get along. No. That did not happen. Everyone left and I got blasted on our group chat for bringing these 'outsiders' into a party that was just supposed to be a hangout with the close friend group. Alright. I'm kind of a coward (you'll see later) so I just shrugged it off and didn't mention it to them again. When the school year starts again, if I even mention the program, most of them (5/6 of them) get angry about it. Also, they always kind of make jokes about how everyone but me in that group is pretty (I'm not saying that I'm necessarily a person who tries to look good, but I wanna be pretty too lmao) and kind of assume that I can be the butt of jokes. Alright. They also all like to act as if one girl in the group talking to guys is a big thing since they all end up liking her (another thing is that they also blast me for being able to talk to everyone but never actually want my help in meeting new people). I'm the most outgoing, so I really try helping them talk to people like teachers and even other students. Great. I'll admit that some of them are really smart and have way better grades than me, but I really don't care because it's second semester and I'm graduating. What really upsets me is how they never acknowledge anything I do and always brush me off. \n\nThe thing that made me want to write this was something that happened a week or two ago. There was a show at school that's the highlight of this semester so we all wanted to go. My childhood friend who goes to another school wanted to come so I was like \"sure\". Usually there's a huge line to go in but there's also food so we stop to get it then go to meet up with the friend group. I walk over to where they're standing in line to say hi and cut in (as we usually allow each other to do). In this first instance, all they do is turn the other way and ignore me. I'm like \"aight\" and go stand further back with other people. Then, I'm waiting by the bathroom when they brush past me without any notice. I usually would be fine if they hadn't seen me but we made eye contact. \n\nMy other friends tell me to ditch them, but if I do, I'll be alone and I'm really not in the mood (yeet, ya girl's a coward), although I'm going to go to college and not talk to any of them. Am I the asshole for not wanting to be nicer to them (I've kind of been distancing myself) and/or not telling them how I feel about what they're doing?",

      "description": "This happened a long time ago in college, but I've been thinking about it lately.\n\nI changed high schools junior year and met a friend senior year (let's call her Ann) that ended up going to the same college as me. Before that, I had gone to a small K-12 (we'll call it Nerd Academy) where most of us had been there since the beginning, so we were really close. Quite a few of my friends from that school ended up going to the same college as well.\n\nI spent most of my time with Ann, but I would still get together with my friends from Nerd Academy, especially on the weekends. This seemed to piss Ann off that I didn't invite her to hang out with us. She had met some of them in passing, but nothing more. Nerd Academy get togethers overwhelmingly involved a lot of inside jokes from our time at that school, and I don't think Ann would have enjoyed being a part of them and I honestly didn't want to be spending time during them explaining everything to her so that she would understand what we were talking about.\n\nAnn didn't have a friend group that I didn't also know, so there wasn't really a similar situation on her side to compare to. Our friendship mutually ended after about a year for a lot of other reasons, but the fact that I was hanging out with other people without her was one of her main grievances. \n\nI understand that I could have made a greater effort to include her and let her decide for herself if she felt comfortable with that friend group, but some other incidents generally made me feel like she was just jealous and controlling. One such event was a Saturday morning where I told her I would go to this class at the community center with her so she wouldn't be alone but changed my mind maybe 3 minutes later because I realized I had an assignment due. She went anyway and I invited a mutual friend of ours over to my place to study. The friend posted something on Snapchat that indicated she had been over at my place, and Ann saw it and flipped a shit at me for \"bailing on her to hang out with someone else\" even though I explained to her that we were just studying together and had hardly spent 15 minutes of 4 hours goofing off.\n\nSo, what do you think? Was I being insensitive and excluding her? I've never taken issue with friends of mine hanging out with friend groups that I don't know and not inviting me but I don't want this to happen to another friendship if it turns out most people feel differently.",

      "description": "Hello Redditors! \n\n    In my country, after finishing high school, everyone takes an entrance exam in order to get into an university. And there’s this kind of a “tradition” in my country where the boys who manage to get approved get their heads shaved.\n    Me and all of my friends already scored enough to get to college, so everyone shaved their heads, and now every one of them is looking ugly as hell.\n    I’m the only one who didn’t shave. Mostly because I don’t want to look ugly. I’m already really self conscious about my looks and always gets picked on, probably cause I’m the one who talks most in the group, even though I’m really shy...\n    So here’s the situation. Two week ago when they all were shaving their heads and even though I told them I didn’t want to, they said they would do it anyway because “it’s a tradition bro” So I went home earlier that day in order to “escape” from them.     \n    And this week another friend received his results and also got approved, so we went to celebrate it. He shaved his head and this time they were like “you’re not escaping this time dude” so they shaved one, they tried to hold me and do it against my will. So I started to throw kicks and punches in order to make them stop (it was like 7 dudes trying to immobilize me). It worked and they seemed to get over with it.\n    But now they keep making comments (in my presence) about how I was being a bitch about it or how they’ll do it anyway, and other stuff like that. \n    All of them have kinda admitted that they regret doing it but don’t care because it’s a “tradition”.\n    \nAm I really being the asshole here for not letting them do it? I already told them before we got our results that I didn’t want to do it and they still tried to do it...\n\nTLDR: friends want to shave my head. I told them I didn’t want to do it and they still tried. So I fought them in order for them to stop. Now they saying I overreacted and was being a pussy.",

      "description": "So I'm in this dilemma where I want to leave for the weekend to visit my boyfriend and his family, and maybe have some fun before the semester starts. I've been working at my internship since the new year, and it's been going well. So initially, I asked my Dad if I could take a trip to MA (the state), and he said no. The reasons for this (and I told him, I'm not asking for money) is because it's not my car and I might crash it on my trip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo understandable. It's not my car. I don't feel it's fair because I'm biased but I know that logically, the car doesn't legally belong to me, and I don't pay the insurance on it or the car payments. So I'm okay with that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy solution to this is to either pay for a train ticket or a plane ticket (I checked, they're about $200 roundtrip). Again, I'm not asking for money, I will use my own to get to the train station/airport (depending what way I decide to go, which is most likely by plane) and for the ticket cost. **Would I be the asshole if I told him \"I'm going to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ on Saturday morning.\" and then just left?** \n\nI do want to just mention that this trip is something I don't necessarily need, but I want to go because of my sanity. I know the next few months until May is going to be hectic for me because I'm taking hard classes, I'm interning, tutoring, volunteering for VITA and for a Vietnamese community fashion show, etc. I just want a small break and I'm not asking for charity from my parents. \n\nI'm scared though because they could kick me out if I go on a trip that doesn't concern them. Or decide to trash my room. Or decide to pull funding from school or even help me in the future. ",

      "description": "My fiancée tragically passed away a few months back. I'm currently in the process of sorting various matters out. Two of these are the Mortgage and Life Insurance. \n\nI should firstly make it clear that because we weren't married and had no children I am not next of kin, her parents are.\n\nI discovered today that because the way the Mortgage was set up, I am due to inherit the full mortgage debt to pay back but only half the house, the remainder of the house will go to her parents. This is frustrating for a number of reason, firstly when my fiancee and I set up the Mortgage I recall being asked this question and I don't believe that is the option we chose. I can't prove that so it is what it is. Secondly, the house is hers and mine, no-one else's.. We designed it from the ground up, everything in it is hours of work by us, to now have to share that seems wrong. Thirdly, I truly dont believe this what she would have wanted, it certainly isn't what I would have wanted for her but they're spinning it as \"If this is how she set it up, she must have wanted us to get the house.\" And finally I got on really well with her family, I feel this has made the relationship extremely difficult to maintain. \n\nI'm not sure if it's relevant as to whether IATA but her family are well off, a lot more so than myself or my family. They're not stinking rich but they have a large portfolio of properties and money just isn't an issue for them. I'm by no means struggling, but I earn enough to pay the bills and that's about it.. I can barely afford them now I'm paying them alone.\n\nAlso, possibly relevant possibly not.. every single asset of hers has gone to her parents and I have not said a word. This is the law and that's fine. It probably equates to around £20,000 in total, I have not asked for nor received a penny of this and I am completely comfortable with that fact.\n\nNow, we had joint life insurance which means I'm due a payout equal to the remainder of the mortgage. To me, this is my money to do with as I please. I paid the premiums to cover my mortgage in case the worst should happen, which it did. My solution is that I either give her parents half the money we've paid off the house and they sign it over to me or we sell the house and share whatever money is raised. Either way, I keep the life insurance money.\n\nTheir solution is that I pay off the full mortgage and we share the house 50/50. To me this is completely out of the question, why would I pay for them to own half of my house. But am I just being extremely selfish keeping the full amount for myself?",

      "description": "So my family is strange in the ways. My parents are split and my mom who is single works for most of the day. Because of this I come on my school bus to my grandparents who are very kind and caring. I spend more time with them in their house then my moms (doesn’t mean I love her less). Now here’s the thing I’ve been noticing: she treats me differently with her parents around apposed to how she treats me without them around. One example of this and the most recent one is that I made a minor mistake in school about a teacher I dislike. I’ve complained and vented about this teacher before to my mom and she agreed with me for most of the time so this surprised me. While talking and explaining how this teacher was unfair, my mom blurred in very sassy-like saying how the student should listen to the teacher no matter what. Then, she looked at her parents as if she was looking for some sort of agreement or approval. I was confused, shocked, and felt kind of betrayed. Next, my mother started lecturing me on how teachers sometimes have a rough time with students and that it can probably get annoying (my mom is not a teacher). My grandparents then agreed with her slightly although my grandfather didn’t seem much in agreement. I stormed off into my room later that night once my mother and I were alone and yelled at her saying that she acts like the way kids do when they treat others differently when their friends are around. \n\nSo people of reddit, Am I the Asshole?",

We even have a sign that states “Do not leave personal belongings in the kitchenette. We are not responsible for lost items”. I stay at work pretty late so I see the night janitor come in and clean. I noticed that he goes out of his way to wash the dishes and mugs, which isn’t a part of his job (our company only contracts them to do floors and trash so it’s our responsibility to clean up after ourselves). My coworkers must have noticed too because they have since stopped doing their own dishes and has been leaving piles in the sink knowing that they will be magically washed and dried in the morning. They even make comments about the “Mexican sucker” that’s cleaning for them. This has been on going for a few weeks now and my coworkers even have the audacity to complain about water spots on their mugs. So throughout the day when I find myself alone in the kitchenette, I take an item or two and toss them out in the building hallway trash so it can’t be found. We work in a building where we share office space with other businesses and there’s no cameras so I haven’t been caught yet. A coworker asked our manager about their items being taken, but my manager just reiterated the policy. I guess I am being petty, but my coworkers are trash and I don’t feel bad. ",

      "description": "The night before Thanksgiving I got a text at 11pm from an unknown number (UN). We had no previous text history in my phone.\n\nUN: “Hey so I'm moving out of [address] and they want me to pay this fuckin \"cleaning fee\" - your prorated share for the 4 months you were here is gonna come out to 11.50, can you venmo me?\n\nI looked up the address and realized this was the apartment I’d subleased back in spring semester 2015. I responded.\n\nME: “Sorry, I'm not paying that. I moved out over 3 years ago.”\n\nUN: “Nah dude I totally get that - I'm just as frustrated as you are. I just don't think it's fair for me to pay for the 4 months I didn't live there.”\n\nI didn’t respond. 40 minutes later..\n\nUN: “Yeah so you're contractually obligated to pay your part. It sucks but that's how these leases work, I'm paying my 56 months worth, you gotta pay your 4 months.” Attached was a cropped screenshot of a lease clause that read: “Landlord may deduct reasonable charges from the security deposit for (a) damages to the Property, excluding wear and tear, and all reasonable costs as associated to repair the property; (b) costs for which Tenant is responsible to clean, deodorize, exterminate, and maintain the Property.”\n\nI haven’t responded and will not be paying that $11.50 to a person whose name I don’t even know to clean an apartment I lived in three and a half years ago. AITA?",

      "description": "So yesterday, I get a random message from a number saying \"Hey, how's life? :) if you even remember me haha\".\n\nI don't recognize the number right away, but on my end there is a conversation to scroll up to from two years ago. Turns out she was someone I matched with on tinder, and chatted and exchanged numbers and made plans with - and she was in contact right up to literally the last minute of the day we had plans, she ghosted me literally as I was getting ready and showering after having come home from work. Not kidding, just a couple hours earlier she was responding and discussing plans.\n\nSo not only was I shocked she remembered me, but thought it was bold and ballsy that she messaged me after what she'd done. So I told her that, asked what happened to her. She claimed she didn't remember doing that and apologized at first, then said she \"made some bad choices and ended up in a bad relationship and finally realized her worth and got out\" and also mentioned that it was \"probably when her life was blowing up and her son's dad went to prison and a bunch of stuff\".\n\nSo I accepted it and forgave her at first, chatted a bit more - but then we realize that apparently when she contacted me, although she somehow still had me in her phone, she mistook and thought I was someone else she knew with the same name - which explained a lot.\n\nSo following that I jog her memory a bit as to who I actually am (I didn't mention tinder before) and bring up highlights of our conversation, once again reiterating what she did. This time she sounded a little less remorseful and apologetic though - \"yeah, sounds about right, I probably did the same thing to other people, life got crazy\".\n\nEventually I gave a little more detail to help pinpoint who I was until she finally remembered. To which she said \"yeah, so I might have come home then and not bothered cause I was gonna be moving soon\". That's it, no apology, just shamelessly using that as an excuse as if that's normal.\n\nSure, she doesn't know me and she's just one person and this incident wasn't something that affected me greatly in any way, but I was shocked with her complete sociopathic lack of compassion in her words, how she sees basically anyone she doesn't know as disposable and therefore okay to do that to kind of like the \"#wastehistime201x\" meme a while back. She didn't seem to even understand that what she did was shitty, just kept deflecting it with \"there are bigger things in life\" and \"it's weird to be upset about something so insignificant\". But no, it's not about not being over it, it's the apathetic attitude she has about it.\n\nSo, I told her that I guess if she does stuff like that on a regular basis, the stuff that happened to her that she mentioned is probably karma.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So last year, what happened was I had a tussle with a guy I was co-TAing with. He's one of those guys who doesn't take kindly not being the one in a position of seniority. Because the main lab coordinator is my advisor, I'm the direct point of contact. So sometimes I will update the co-TAs with something my advisor mentioned but hadn't yet told them. That guy was a friend until that point...so what ended up happening was I updated the co-TAs and that guy basically responded with \"don't tell me what to do.\" I said \"uhm...I'm not telling you what to do. I'm being a messenger. And I won't hesitate to report you. Consider this your warning.\" Then he responded very rudely, \"you know why people think you are stepping over? Every time you talk you underestimate everyone. How dare you say 'consider this your warning.' My point is I'm all for collaboration but you need to respect others. It doesn't mean everyone's one cent needs to be the same as yours. Also, I'm very confident in teaching my lab better than you. Good luck.\" So I reported the thread to my advisor, his advisor, and one of the grad advisors. My advisor and his advisor set him straight, and the grad advisor printed out the thread and put it in his file. If it happens again, more serious action will be taken against him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's just the context. The thing is, I'm not looking to be BFFs with this dude. I just want this to be water under the bridge. I know he's a terrible person. I know he's a shithead. But I don't want enemies. He shouldn't be mad at me for reporting him. He should be mad at himself for having acted in such a reportable way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I thought of sending him an email basically saying that. Basically, \"I know I'm the last person you want to hear from, but I just thought I'd make a peace offering. We had a tussle last year, and I forgive you. I don't think you want to be my friend, and I understand, but I don't want to be enemies. I wish you the best of luck in your research.\" Would that be holier-than-thou-esque? WIBTA if I said that on a whim?",

      "description": "This happened two years ago and it still bothers me today. I was friends with this really sweet and beautiful girl. We were together for a year and a half. It was a small but amazing relationship and throughout this whole time I was at my all time low, nothing made me happy I was always gloomy and had constant suicidal thoughts. She was so kind enough to stay with me through all of this and help me. I felt terrible because I was always giving off terrible energy and others around me would always be down. I could tell she was always down because of me. I've tried to commit multiple times before and during are relationship. I couldn't control myself I felt like I was truly insane. Being with her I felt a bit alive. My dad sent me to a mental hospital and I was there for about 4 months with absolutely nothing with me. Once I got out I started going to therapy. I felt overwhelmed by everything. I didn't want any physical contact I didn't want to see anyone I didn't even speak. I decided to break up with her because I was so scared of myself I couldn't even love myself how am I supposed to love someone else. I felt terrible for her she had to put up with me and then I had to break her heart but I felt like it was better than continuing a one sided relationship. I told her I wanted to fix myself and get better before I continue a commited relationship. I was scared I would have killed myself and imagine what that would do to her. So I ended it off and she never spoke to me again. I tried getting in contact with her now because I am at a much better place in life. I've broken out of my shell and fought my problems. I love life now and I'm so grateful for it but I truly miss her. I just want to apologize to her once more and let her know that I'm doing well because that would mean a lot to her I believe. I still regret my decision I felt like it was selfish and disgusting of me. ",

      "description": "So let’s start from the beginning. This kid is a known shit head and no one likes him for various reasons. Like plenty of reasons cause he’s a douche bag. Our amazing web design teacher made an assignment that was “create a logo // thumbnail for said friends YouTube channel. We will have an impartial judge choose the winner.” That kid also said he’d give $30 to the winner if he liked the design as well. I spent more time than necessary to get an A so I’d have a higher chance of winning. I made him the thumbnail, and it won, and he liked it. We agreed and shook hands // swore on something we consider higher than swearing on god that he’d pay me for it. I told him he’d have to pay me first, but he refused, saying “I need to upload the video tonight”. I agreed cause he had swore and we shook hands. I sent it to 2 of his emails and he confirmed that he got them but if refusing to pay me. This sounds like the obvious answer of he’s the asshole, but here is where it gets interesting. Since he doesn’t want to pay me he’s going to just not use the thumbnail and not pay me. He’s justifying it by not using it. I still think he should pay me because he paid for a service, I provided said service and he was happy with it. Also once I got all pissed at him and my friends were backing me up cause he swore on what we regard as higher than swearing on god, he swore again and I thought it was a done deal. I texted him about it and he just kept on saying “I’m not paying for it” over and over again. I know it’s hella petty, but AITA?",

      "description": "Greetings everyone. Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nForgive me if it turns out a bit long.\n\nSo, a bit of background.3 years ago I decided Im gonna change my career and become a programmer. after attending a coding bootcamp my friend told me i can join her startup (startup was based in USA and she is a senior developer there) as one of the 3 interns. The startup was struggling so the employment was not guaranteed. I was just happy to be learning and doing something I actually enjoy.\n\nThe CTO was personally teaching us and we learned a lot. Unfortunately my savings ran out and i informed my friend and the CTO that i had to find a job . They understood and we parted on good terms.\n\nI did some freelance jobs which wasnt stable, but was better than nothing. 2 months after i left the startup got funding and hired one of the 2 other interns. since the company was based in US, their base salary for a junior exceeded the local salary 5 times.\n\nAfter a year of freelancing and instability, one of my other friends who was in the coding bootcamp with me told me that their company has a vacancy. i applied and after a grueling interview got the job. The founders were trying to hire people that would stay with them for a long time. they werent sure about me, that i \"wouldnt quit after a couple of months\". My friend reassured them that i needed something stable. Which is true, i dont like frequent change and needed stability.\n\nI thought i would stay in that company for more or less a long time. The atmosphere and environment is great and bosses are decent. The only downside was the pay, but since it was stable and enough to pay the bills and leave a bit of spending money, i cant complain.\n\nFast forward 3-4 months. 2 weeks ago my friend from the startup tells me that the other intern they hired (who was getting 5x my salary) quit. I was surprised but paid no mind. Today that same friend asked me if, hypothetically, i would be interested in working with them, implying i'd get the same salary as the previous guy.\n\nSo now im conflicted. i dont want to get ahead of myself but i have a feeling that the work offer is likely to happen. I had a friendly chat with the CTO 2 days after their guy quit and among other things he asked me questions about my employment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be perfectly honest the thing that is making me consider is that the salary is so high. I wouldnt be considering leaving if the prospective salary was 2x my current salary. but 5x makes a considerable sum. Part of me wishes the offer never comes so i wouldnt have to make this choice. But another part of me wants to earn more than i am currently earning.\n\nWIBTA if i quit my current employment 4 months after being hired and knowing that the people who hired me were wary of this thing happening, in the first place? I dont want to be selfish and be someone who \"chases money\", but i also dont want to look back and regret missing this hypothetical opportunity.",

      "description": "My dad is a big cigar guy. Cigar aficionado magazine, smokes one or two a week, and knows his stuff.\n\nDuring family gatherings like Christmas and weddings he always makes a point to take out a box of cigars for all the guys to smoke. I have about a dozen male family members that all come outside to smoke and everyone enjoys it. \n\nLast night I was at my cousin’s wedding where my dad brought a box of cigars with around 30 cigars and left them outside for all the guys to take. \n\nAt the end of the night, maybe 11:30 I was outside and noticed there were about 12-15 cigars left. I thought to myself “no one is going to smoke these, they’re just going to get thrown out.” So I brought the cigar box inside to take home. My dad noticed this and told me to leave them outside and I argued with him that no one will take these since they’re outside and most of the guests had left. I took them home anyways. AITA?",

Got a new job recently with a traveling company doing repair in industrial environments.\n\nAt this new job there is a guy who has been doing this for a long time, but hea kinda dumb. He is a nice guy though. The problem is that he smells terribly like body odor. I mean you can smell him 6-7 ft away. On top of that he's a close talker and loves to look over my shoulder while I'm filling out paper work. I really can't even stand it anymore. Everyone else calls him stinky behind his back (I don't cuz that's fuckin rude) and I feel bad for the guy cuz like I said he's not a piece of shit. Also, most of us dont shower in the morning because by the time you leave you're covered head to toe in dirt. I mean I put deodorant on in the morning so that I'm not stinking up the plant when i start sweating. \n\nSo WIBTA if I told him his odor is offensive?",

It was funnier then but anywho... Now that we're at year 6 I've been hoping for an engagement for a while, about 2 years. We've discussed it and he agrees it something he wants. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought recently maybe he sensed my growing desire for marriage when my 19 year old sister announced her engagement 3 months ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought last night would be the night, we had great weather, I was intoxicated by breadsticks and he was acting like he had some big surprise for me. Now, I've always been the more in depth gift giver and tbh the only gift I've come to want is being asked to marry him. I don't give a shit about a ring, I just want the question to be asked. Instead he reached in his pocket and gave me a Sephora gift card.... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe knows my reasons for wanting to get married, the main one is my dad. I am super close to my dad and in the last year his health has declined a lot, we know due to his weight and other issues he probably has only a couple years max left. I want him to see me get married. I've been saving for this wedding since I was little and I want it to happen sooner rather later so he can be their. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI brought up marriage to my BF this morning and he said \"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gave myself an ultimatum. If he doesn't propose come my birthday in June I have to stop waiting and leave. I'm 27, I want to start a family soon which he is on board with, but my god, I don't want to be old fashioned but I want to be married before I have a baby. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like a dick but I also feel like standing up to what I want is important.",

      "description": "My friend (F50) retired early a couple years ago and decided to write a novel. She considers writing to be her passion, but never really sticks to any one thing. She did write her novel, but then decided to self-publish because she didn't want to handle multiple rejections from big publishing companies. She paid about $5,000 to publish the book and had all these dreams it would be turned into a movie and she'd be on the Times' Best-Seller List, but nothing has really happened with it and she now has a bunch of boxes of books in her basement. She wants to turn it into a trilogy but has stalled partway through the second book.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (F35) have also now written a novel and it looks like it will be published with a large publishing company. Would I be an asshole if I published it, maybe with a pseudonym?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main reason I ask - and I hope this doesn't come off as conceited - is that I've found relative success in my career and have accomplished a number of things I'm really proud of. Although she doesn't commit as much time to it as she could, I know my friend considers her novel to be her baby, and I don't want to show her up and kill her creative spirit by publishing. I'm thinking about publishing under a pseudonym and not doing any promotion (like a book tour) for the novel, which I really want to see made. This way I know I've still accomplished this, but I don't have to worry about her finding out and getting demotivated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think? What should I do?",

After I do some quick cleaning and put our 2 year old son to bed I decide to eat. I heat up a plate of food, while he is sitting in the kitchen. We go sit down in the living room to watch Netflix and 10 minutes into a show he gets up angrily and says he’s hungry. He then says, “thanks for asking if I’m hungry” and I apologized and said I didn’t realize he had not ate yet.  He goes and grabs himself a plate, comes back and says that he was trying to be nice and wait for me to get home so we could eat together. He doesn’t always wait for me to come home so we could eat and when he does he will usually say that he waited for me or something. But not today. I asked if he was hungry then why didn’t he say something when he saw me making a plate. He got even more angry and said I’m now turning it around on him and making it seem like it is his fault. I told him I’m tired and hungry and I just want to come home and relax, I don’t want to argue or feel like I have to analyze a situation when I get home so I know what to do and ask if he’s hungry. He said I’m making myself the victim. Now he’s in our room watching Netflix by himself.

      "description": "My buddy is in a really fucked up abusive relationship, I’m honestly worried he might commit suicide because he’s so depressed and posting things on Twitter that really scare me. His GF doesn’t hit him but she’s psychologically a manipulative beast from hell that eats souls etc etc. The backstory isn’t really important here ok.  \n\n\nSo unfortunately, Hellbeast was my best friend for several years before I found out about the abuse, and this means all of her friends are also mutual friends with me. When I cut her out of my life and never speak to her again, they will undoubtedly wonder “what happened between you two?”\n\n\nArguments for answering that question with “because she’s fucking evil, let me tell you everything”\n\n1. If one of my friends was like her, I would 100% want someone to tell me instead of letting me naively invest several years into the friendship. I wish someone had told me about her when I met her.\n\n2. If I don’t say anything then she’ll probably make up some lie that makes me look like the bad guy. Ok I have zero evidence that this would actually happen but she IS a hellbeast so... \n\n\n3. Deep down, is there some evil part of my soul that wants her life to suck because she deserves it? Mayyyyyybe. I was previously in an abusive relationship where someone treated me exactly the way she treats her boyfriend, and I will 100% admit that this is probably causing me to project and colour my perspective on the issue.\n\n\nArguments against telling people the truth:\n\n\n1. It would make me an asshole. Why stoop to her level and say hurtful things? Why not take the high road and give a mature response like “we had a difference in opinion, I respect the fact that you’re her friend but I don’t want to be invited to events she’s attending” . Why try to end the friendships of someone I’ll never talk to again, who cares if they’re her friends? It would just be mean and vindictive of me to tell everyone who knows her, bad things about her. \n\n\nOr... *would* it make me an asshole? You decide reddit! ",

      "title": "AITA for wanting proof of my (29F) boyfriend’s (33M) seemingly outlandish stories about his past after two years of dating?",
      "description": "Okay, let me start off by saying that I love him, and I have no concerns as to whether or not he’s a good person. We are both single parents and I see the way he treats his son, as well as mine, and I know that he’s a solid guy deep down. Here’s the problem:\n\nIn the last two years of dating, he’s told me some pretty outlandish stories about his past, and while I ignored concerns about how true they were at first, now I’m getting seriously concerned that he’s been telling tall-tales. One of the stories includes how he was able to buy his house— apparently he went to Mexico and made a bunch of cash as part of some illegal activity then decided to “go straight” and came back and bought a house. I don’t know, I was instantly kind of suspicious that he was lying. When I looked up the name on his property, his mom’s name came up. He said that he put it in his mom’s name when he was getting a divorce from his ex, so that she couldn’t try and claim the house. Alright...makes sense, I suppose. Maybe my paranoia is taking over, but I feel like he’s lying about it for a number of reasons. And there have been other strange stories that I’ve really doubted but my kept my mouth shut. Is it rude to question him about his past? I don’t care if the things he’s told me are true or not, that’s really not my concern. I’m scared that there’s something actually wrong with him if he’s indeed lying about such strange things.\n\nAlso, he’s a complete hermit. Other than spending time with his kid, he sees no one else. He doesn’t have any friends, at least that I’ve met in two years. And I’ve only met a few of his family members briefly once or twice. I feel that sometimes you can judge the validity of a person by the people they keep around them— get affirmations that they are who they say they are, etc. I can’t do that with him though. \n\nI asked him for proof of going to Mexico the other day and he said he lost his passport awhile back. Then I asked him for any shred of proof of his stories and he blew up at me. Am I the asshole for even questioning his past and demanding proof? What if he’s telling the truth? Does it even matter is he’s lying? It’s in the past, after all. It’s just all so odd and I feel like I need to know at this point, especially after two years. I honestly can’t tell if I’m in the wrong, or protecting myself and my kid from a reality blow in the future when I find out he’s been lying and he’s like a sociopath or something. Honestly, my gut is telling me that they are lies that he’s told out of insecurities, and they aren’t malicious in nature. He’s a good person. Should I just drop it?\n\nUgh. I’m losing my mind over this. Any input would be appreciated. If I’m the asshole and I need to stop questioning, then I want someone to call me out. ",

I took inspiration from Princess Tiana’s dress from The Princess and the Frog.\n\nI was telling my friend all about the forest themed wedding plans with dark browns, dark greens and light greens with the outfits and green roses and while lilies everywhere.\n\nShe asked me where I got the inspiration for my dress and I told her Tiana’s dress. She then started bombarding me with hateful words saying I wasn’t allowed to use her for inspiration because she is a black princess and I am very much not black. I’m Norwegian. I have bright blonde hair and grey eyes. I also literally cannot tan. \n\nSo I got mad and told her I wasn’t trying to be offensive, I just loved the design of the dress and wanted to recreate it. She told me I was being a bad friend by not listening to her. We haven’t talking since and I don’t plan on talking to her again but I have to know, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Alright so, I typically don't give a flying titshit about other people but it was kinda different last night. I suffer from insomnia and i get angry when im lacking sleep (which is why i got a punching bag in the backyard), I wanted to sleep just because the night before i had anxiety before my MRI scan and couldnt sleep. Anyway, I heard music, loud, bassy, shit music (fuckers were listening to \"rap\", bitch where the tech n9ne at.\n\nAnyway, i called the cops coz it was after 11pm and its illegal to play loud music that can be heard in other houses, filed a noise complaint, waited 30-40 minutes, no change in result. So i said fuck it, the cops here are useless cunts so i'm gonna handle this shit myself, and if i get into a brawl, then fuck it i can't give enough fucks right now.\n\nI walked down the street that was playing the music, this was at 2am on a sunday, the time thingy for noise is 11pm and i think 8am, so it was already in the naughty zone of time. I found the street, looked at the mailbox for the number so i could specify the location for the police if the useless fucks wanna become useful for once in their shitty lives. \n\nAlso, i live in australia, we get shit cops too guys.\n\nAnyway, i banged on the garage door, not super hard, enough to make the whole thing shake and i think i left a dent, either way, the music turned down, i smelt weed and i said \"well, that's typical\" then i heard this young chicks voice go \"HELLOOO... and thus started this conversation.\n\nThem: You don't just knock on the door and not say anything, how dare you, are you still there?\n\nMe: Yeah i'm still here.\n\nThem: Who are you and what do you want?\n\nMe: Well, for one, i'm not the cops so you guys can keep smoking it up, but you guys have been playing some loud music and i can hear you 7 houses down. \n\nThem: But its a sunday we have to party\n\nMe: Hey, i get it, i totally do, and i'm not trying to stop that party, all im saying is that the musics a bit loud, some of us have things to do in the morning and all i'm asking is to turn it down.\n\nThem: Okay fine we'll turn it down but we won't stop drinking and partying\n\nMe: Hey, as long as i don't hear it in the comfort of my own home, then that's fine... I already called the cops on you guys a few weeks ago due to loud noises at a bad time, and i don't wanna do that again.\n\nThem (this time, a guy): then don't you cunt\n\nMe: Well, as i said, i won't, unless you do it again, some people have lives.\n\nThen i walked off, the music wasnt heard as loud as before, it was mission success, but i kinda felt bad, these people were young, and i'm young myself (only 24) so i understand the whole wanting to party and stuff on a sunday morning, but i probably ruined their night and i feel bad.\n\nThis probably is a very tame post compared to other posts here, but i'm generally a person who loves conflict, but hates it as well (random fights in the street? fuck yeah i'd watch that.... but random bashings of someone who doesn't deserve it, bruh i'm gonna kill someone soon)\n\nThank you for reading, and have an amazing weekend &lt;3",

      "description": "So, a few months ago I had been talking to this guy on a dating app for a while when he asked to meet in person for dinner. I didn’t have any qualms about him per se, but I instantly felt anxious about the whole situation (first date in a long time, and first date ever with someone I had never met, let alone off a dating app). Still, I agreed to go and meet up. \n\nThe date was okay, he didn’t wow me but we had an okay conversation, and was nice enough. We just didn’t have a spectacular connection and not that much in common. \n\nHere’s where I feel ass-holey about the whole thing. He insisted on paying for the meal (just meal, we didn’t get drinks), and I let him. When we left he followed me to my car and hugged me and might have tried to kiss me if I let him, but I panicked and let go and got in my car. After the date the next day he messaged and said he had a wonderful time and would like to see me again. I resisted the MASSIVE urge to ghost him but didn’t and said as politely as possible that I didn’t feel like we hit it off and didn’t want to see him again. He then unmatched me and blocked me. \n\nSince I am not used to dating strangers, AITA for not giving this nice enough guy a second date after letting him pay for my meal? I feel horrible for letting my anxieties get to me and dumping a nice guy who obviously liked me, even though I didn’t feel much for him back. \n\nTL;DR Nice guy took me on a nice date and paid for everything and I rejected him for a second date and I feel horrible about it. AITA? ",

      "description": "One of my close relatives passed away recently and it all happened quite suddenly. I will be the first to admit that I haven't really started processing it and I don't really think I'm grieving properly just yet. I'm not in denial, I know she has gone but I'm still in shock and I don't know how to feel. \n\nHowever a lot of my other relatives are taking her passing particularly hard and are posting a lot of RIP messages on social media. While I understand they want to express their grief, I've always felt it was weird posting these things on social media because a) my relative never really used social media and b) she'll never see it. \n\nMy brother has gone a step further and changed his profile picture to a photo of my relative that has died, and I feel a bit uncomfortable about it. Everytime I get a message or notification from him, her photo pops up and it always takes me a second to realize its him.  I feel guilty every time I see it, not only because Im not grieving properly for her, but also because we just talk normally to each other and don't spend every minute talking about her. It just generally makes me feel guilty and weird everytime I see it. Its like getting a reminder on my phone everyday that she's gone. \n\nI want to let him grieve in his own way and I don't want to upset him even more as he is (understandably) sensitive at the moment. He was closer than I was with my relative, but I'm finding it difficult to see her photo everyday. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I asked him to change his photo/stop posting on social media because it makes me uncomfortable?\n",

My ex was close with her sister and we all ended up being part of the same group of friends and would regularly hang out together. This lasted about 2 years until I broke up with my ex, however we had an 'its complicated' breakup that lasted another couple years where we remained friends and would occasionally hook up.\n\nDuring this time I continued being friends with my ex's sister and we actually grew to be very close friends from supporting each other's troubles during this time. \n\nOk then a year ago I had a big fight with my ex and we stopped talking to one another or being friends with each other... But I didn't stop being friends with her sister as she is one of, if not my closest friend.\n\nSo just a few days ago I got a random call from my ex who asked to talk. When I met with her she told me that me being in her life made it so she had trouble moving on, and wanted me out entirely and asked if I can stop hanging out with her sister. She already asked her sister the same thing and she refused saying she wasn't going to give up a good friend just because my ex wants her to. I sided with her sisters argument and said I wasn't going to end my friendship with her sister, but I would be willing to make changes like trying to avoid going to parties if I know my ex would be there.\n\nSo now I'm thinking maybe I really am making my ex's life worse by still being friends with her family and being a reminder there in the corner...

I’m not on the schedule yet so I was told I would receive a call last night regarding me working today. I did not receive a call and assumed I wasn’t needed, I stayed up and got drunk instead of going to bed early. I get a call at 7:30 this morning that woke me up, I ignored it. 15 minutes later I get a text asking me to confirm that I can be there at 10. No. Absolutely fucking no. If they had told me this at 7:30 last night, absolutely would have been no problem. If I say yes today then they will call me and wake me up giving me no notice all the time. What they did was annoying and I’m not going to reward it by giving them what they want. Am I an asshole for not being grateful for the time? Are they assholes for waking me up expecting me to be there in 2.5 hours? I returned the text saying I already made other plans and they haven’t responded. Now I’m feeling bad, but should I?",

      "description": "My (38f) husband (41m) has suffered with alcoholism and addiction for a number of years. He entered rehab last year and has since been clean. It's not been easy, for either of us, but I am extremely proud of him for his hard work.  \n\nI stopped drinking in our home when it became apparent he had problems with alcohol.  While he was in rehab, I cleared all the wine glasses etc out of our house.  While pre kids (we have a 6.5 and 2.5 year old) we did drink together a lot, since having them my drinking had gone right down anyway, but there had always been wine in the house and I would typically have a glass or two Friday/Saturday night. Never having a glass of wine at home since then is a bit of a downer, as obviously it's nice to unwind with a glass after a rough week, but it's 100% worth it to support my husband in his recovery and it's nothing to the changes he's had to make in his life.  And I am definitely feeling the health/lifestyle benefits of cutting my drinking right down.\n\nNow what I have NOT done is give up alcohol entirely.  He knows I'll have a glass or two with some mum friends every so often on a Friday evening.  On Saturday, I went out to a friend's birthday party and as I seldom drink any more, I was pretty hungover the following day (I still got up with the kids, pulled my weight around the house etc).  I don't drink when I am with him, even when we are places where other people are drinking, as I don't think it's fair.\n\nNow he has never accused me of being an arsehole, and I don't REALLY want to give up drinking entirely. But I am sure it's not easy for him when he knows I've been out unwinding with friends over some wine, and while I don't NECESSARILY think I'm TA, I feel a bit of a nagging sense of guilt for drinking.  But equally I don't want to lie to him about drinking as that's not healthy!  I hope this does not read as a validation post as I think people would be justified in telling me I am an arsehole for this.  AITA for not quitting drinking?",

      "description": "So I have this girl added on Snapchat that lives a couple towns away from me, she was very nice and we talk everyday, we had a 9 day Snapchat streak, because we talked everyday. So I work overnight, and she works in the afternoon so as far as seeing each other goes we barely can, but we both were off yesterday which was Thursday AKA Valentine's day\n\nso this whole week we were talking about meeting up to go get some ramen noodles on Valentine's day, and we agreed for 4 p.m. there was a state of emergency in my state 2 days ago that made it so my dough didn't ship in until 4 am, so I had to stay and bake everything at my job and left at 9 am, when I would usually have to leave at 5 am. you would expect me to be tired and pissed off, but I'm actually happy when I'm leaving work because I have plans to hang out with this girl later.\n\nSo I go home and fall asleep, and I wake up to her giving me a snap saying she's sorry that something came up and she's out with her friends right now. She said she can hang later, and I told her oh yeah that's fine let's hang out when you get home. So she gets home around 6 or 7, and she sends me another snap saying that she's busy once again, that's something came up at her house. This honestly ruined my day.\n\nI looked forward to hanging out with this girl for such a long time, just for her to seemingly blow me off. I took a nap and woke up around 11:30 p.m. and realize that she didn't text me to hang out at night. What transpired happens in my previous r/rant post. In the comments of that post you'll find what I sent to her, somebody told me to send her how I truly feel, so I did. I told her that I understand her situation, that I know things come up but we had a plan to hang out and I told her that it ruined my day that we couldn't hang out, because it's not like we can hang out everyday.\n\nShe was asleep so I didn't get a text till a couple hours ago. And she was having none of it, she didn't necessarily tell me I was a horrible person, but her whole demeanor changed. I could tell she didn't want to talk to me anymore, she vilified me for no reason. she basically told me that she didn't want to talk to me anymore.\n\nI told her how I felt one more time, how I wish she would just fucking tell me what's going on instead of being so vague, and then I removed her as a friend on Snapchat. I feel like I didn't do anything wrong, however my mind is conflicted, I screen recorded all of our snap conversations, and I will post them for further clarification if need be. I just don't know how.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Last Saturday my girlfriend (well call her J) decided to break up with me, the breakup obviously wasn't pleasant, but it was by no means nasty. We had been together about 4 months and were pretty serious about each other. We would spend practically all day together and text into the early morning. Later that saturday J sends me a text to make sure I am alright, because she still cares about me. I tell her I'm alright, but the only way I can move on, is to find someone else, to which she says okay, we stopped talking for the rest of the weekend. \n\nThe next day, I feel lonely and just overall broken, so I took to tinder, I ended up getting a couple matches, including K, who I got to know and she is really cool. We have a lot in common, and get along real well, so I ask her out, she says yea and we tried to find a day where we both can. I felt pretty good, and went to sleep.\n\nYesterday, I was at home and recieved a text from her, asking about a friend giving her a ride, after no response from him, I end up giving her a ride. We talked and had a good time, which was the opposite of how I thought it would be. She ends up asking me for a ride home after, to which I agree, later I pick her up, and we go to talk. She takes my phone to put on music and finds that K sent me a message, she goes to check what its about, and gets a little jealous, but we end up moving passed it and talking about other things, including possibly getting back together. She ends up holding my hand while I drive home. That night, she texted me asking me about K, and is asking me why I'm talking to her instead, we talk until around 11:30 and then she says goodnight.\n\nThis morning, I said goodmorning to J, and after I ask how she is she said, idk. When J says idk, it usually means something is wrong, I was pretty sure it was about K, but she wouldn't respond to anything I said. I tried to talk to her in the hallway, she said she was alright, after that, the only thing she would say to me was, go talk to K, just go talk to K.\n\nMy friends say I did nothing wrong, except for one who says I moved on way too quickly, and am trying to hurt her.

      "description": "Without giving away too many details, I am a grad student at a large university. Occasionally, I attend university sponsored recruiting events. In this situation, the event was at a bar. \n\nThe co-worker in question is very active in the feminism community. She always seems to be in situations where a guy is acting creepy, like she's had guys show up unannounced to her house, she's had guys say really inappropriate things to her in public, school, at the gym, getting catcalled etc. We all support her, but I think the general consensus in our group is that the degree and frequency of her experiences is certainly an outlier.\n\nSo, we're at this event, and a guy approaches us. We recognize him as a university employee. He's had too much to drink.  Uncomfortable, but harmless. After a few side-eye glances from the 3 or 4 so people in the group, we slowly excuse ourselves, well all of us except our co-worker in question. I KNOW that she's sober, because she drove home, so alcohol isn't a factor. But she insists on talking, and even flirting, with this guy. We tried multiple times to pull her away, to get her to go to the bathroom, to pull her into another conversation, but she insisted on continuing the interaction, stone faced.\n\nShe just kept saying \"I'm fine, don't worry.\" He tries to put his arm around her, and she pulls away, clearly saying that she doesn't want to be touched, but then agrees to go to the back of the bar with this guy to play pool. Another attempt to pull her away, \"Seriously, I'm fine. I can handle myself.\"  She persists to stand there and continue to interact. We sent the event organizer over to ask if she would like to help counting tickets, and she again declined.\n\nLater, she walks out of the bar and starts ranting about how uncomfortable she was and how that was totally inappropriate and it was sexual harassment and how she needed to file a report with the university.\n\nSo she files the report that Monday. A few classmates submitted statements corroborating her claim.\n\nTo me, it seemed like she hung around this guy a bit too long that night, with multiple opportunities to leave, and multiple people attempting to intervene, with her waving them all off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think she baited him. I know it's terrible to say, but I what I saw was not a natural reaction to being harassed. What I saw was a calculated measure to solidify a harassment claim, and an eagerness to insert oneself front and center of the \"Me too\" movement. I'm not saying the guy isn't a scumbag, but I think that with her continued interaction with him it was clear that his physical advances weren't entirely uninvited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't know that submitting a statement of my own to the university will help things. I'm getting tired of hearing about her \"experience\" recounted \\*ad nauseum\\* among other women in our cohort, as if she's won some type of award, and I think I want to call her out. WIBTA?",

      "description": "My dad and his current gf fight a lot. He doesn’t have any feelings for her but doesn’t want to breakup with her and seem like the bad guy since she has nowhere to go (her parents and daughter lost their homes in the fires in Paradise). She’s constantly lying about stuff and making my father pay for her car payments, insurance and phone bills. As well as taking bills from his wallet to buy cigarettes.\n\nShe starts huge arguments and tries to bring my 12 year old sister and myself into their arguments to agree with one of their points of view. We always choose my dads cause she never makes any sense. We suspect that she’s doing some form of drugs because sometimes she’ll come back from a drive and be acting all jittery and not making any sense.\n\nShe’s also put my indoor only cats in danger by leaving the door open at night time and allowing them to get out. We live across the street from a large area of empty desert filled with coyotes. They could have been killed but she keeps leaving the door open when she goes out to smoke. \n\nAll of this has caused my dad major stress. And despite being a 5’1” 106 pound girl, I’m protective of my 5’11” 260 pound dad. I’ve seen him in toxic relationships where I begged him to leave and he finally did. \n\nBut no matter what I say, he keeps saying that she can stay in our house even if they don’t act like a couple. My father hasn’t shed a tear since my high school graduation and she recently has gotten him so stressed during an argument that he’s gotten choked up. It breaks my heart when my dad is hurt. \n\nMy grandparents love her though despite what she does. They think I should stay out of their business and just let him handle it. They say it’s adult business even though I am an adult. \n\nSo AITA for wanting my dad to break up and kick her out already?",

I trusted them with all my heart and told them all my secrets, and they did the same thing to me. Grade 5 comes, and suddenly we’re not in the same class. I was all alone, while A and B were in the same class. We started drifting apart, and from what I’d heard, A, B and C became really close friends. C was the popular bitch you had in every grade. I didn’t think much of it at the time.\n\nSo one day I go to school, and I see them in the hallways. I say hi to them, but they act like they didn’t see me. I thought that hey, they were probably busy and so didn’t think much of it. So I go to class, and suddenly everyone acted like jerks to me. I was constantly bullied, and even the teachers hated me. I wasn’t that bad of a student either.\n\nTurns out that A and B had spilt all my secrets to C and C started spreading them and some other rumors, and basically turned the whole grade against me. I was miserable for the rest of primary school, my grades started slipping terribly, and most importantly, I was lonely.\n\nPrimary school finally ends, and I go to high school, only later did I find out that it’s the same high school as A and B. Suddenly, A and B comes up to me, and asks for my forgiveness. But I don’t want to forgive them, am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: My closest friends betray and bully me, only to ask for my forgiveness which I don’t want to give, AITA?",

I’m pretty sure she was planning to drive, considering we took her car there.\n\n2- We are both under the age limit (both over 18, under 21); yes I know that’s pretty stupid, but I never imagined her to be such a such a bad drunk. Plus I didn’t want her to get noticed by the staff and potentially get in trouble for being under age.\n\n3- I didn’t feel right letting her go to some guys house considering the state in which she was and be potentially taken advantage of.

      "description": "So my brother decided to have a surprise get together for his wife and enlisted my help in setting everything up. My brother mentions to me the day of, he's inviting his wife's 'best friends' in his words who I know are clearly not. A little context. My brother's wife is partially white while 90% percent of his friends are black including us. No particular reason, just environment. Obviously I don't care about any of that. Also she is from another country and moved here to marry my brother. She had zero friends upon moving here, so naturally she became 'friends'  with my bros friends.  \n  \nAnyways, some of his friends are a bit ... racist, I believe at least.  They don't think they are though, because they are black or at least not white. They constantly make jokes about her being white, and it's literally the topic of every joke, which she is ALWAYS the bottom of. I hate how they act, and it get's very uncomfortable sometimes, but she half-heartedly goes along with the jokes and puts herself down to get along. These are grown people who choose to live this way, not much I can do. I try to respect boundaries.  \n  \nAnyway my sister in laws, 'best friend' when she first met her, went on a racist tirade about how she couldn't say the word picnic because it's racist and totally spazzed out on her in front of everyone. She's not the only one and not much has really changed since then, and these are my brothers close friends. It seems to me she just associates with them because of my brother. After a particularly bad incident not too long ago I had enough of his friends behavior. So, for the first time when my bro said he was inviting these people, I told him these are not really good people to invite and clearly not friends with my sis. in law, because of said reasons. He got pretty mad and basically told me I should just mind my business. Anyways, these 'best friends' of hers didn't even show up to the party. So, reddit, am I the asshole for trying to help?",

If I told A , in my mind I thought it was fair to tell B too.\n\nAfter that A told me it was a good salary and was very happy for me. \n\nB messaged me \"what are you boasting about\". No emojis, no message after that would suggest it was a joke. \n\nAfter that I told B why I told her the details. She did not apologize for saying what she said. \nShe blamed for her feeling bad about the difference of salary between her position and mine. Everybody knows there would be a major difference between her working in the city were we studied and salary in the capital city, so it should not be a shock.\n\nAlso she told me that it is unfair that she works hard to be the best student and anyone (who does not work hard) can go to the capital and earn more.\n\nSorry for a long post.\n\nTLDR; told my friend what my salary would be and she bashed me for boasting, implying I did not deserve it ",

      "description": "\nAbout a month ago I approached my manager with concerns regarding my work schedule, as it had started to affect my performance in school. Being a senior in college is tough enough as-is, but I had been working between 30-35 hours a week and it was putting a serious strain on my ability to get work done and wake up for class on time. My average week would usually have me working on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I’d occasionally get one of those days off, but considering I’d be in class every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday (yes, I’m taking a class on Saturday right now and it’s awful) I found making myself unavailable on Mondays and Wednesdays to be a necessity as the semester went on.\n\nDespite me communicating this to my manager, I’ve been scheduled nearly every Monday and Wednesday since. Maybe I was misunderstood, but I thought I made it clear that I would not be willing to work on those days as they made it harder to prioritize my class work. In order to clear things up, I approached her at the start of last week and made sure she had my availability in writing. Unfortunately, the schedules for the next 2-3 weeks had been made and I noticed I was scheduled every M and W on the calendar. I reluctantly agreed to work the shifts as scheduled in order to reduce the strain on my coworkers.\n\nThis leads us to today....\n\nI received a text from my manager out of the blue yesterday. She informed me that coverage had been found for my shift today and that I didn’t have to come in. Perfect, I was ecstatic. I’ve got a number of projects due later this week, so having the extra time to work made my life a lot less stressful. I informed my group mates that I’d be working on my portions during the time off, so they’d have time to review them before submission, I set aside the time to focus on my work, and I felt a wave of relief in knowing I wouldn’t be bound to a drive thru for one more day this week. I finished up at work yesterday evening, went home with a smile, and noticed that I had received another text from my boss about an hour after I had gotten off. Apparently, my coverage had canceled on her and she wanted to make sure I could still work today. Great.\n\nNow, normally, I’d agree that if you’re scheduled to work, you’re responsible for that shift. If coverage cancels, that still falls on you to make sure that someone is there for your shift. However, given that I shouldn’t have been scheduled in the first place AND I had already been promised the day off, I’m seriously considering not showing up today. In fact, what I’d really like to do is; go in at my scheduled time, collect my tips, tell them I’m not working today, and putting in my two-weeks at the same time. I can’t stress enough how fed up I am with work as it is and this seems like a great opportunity deal with that...\n\nMy question is: if I decide not to work today, AITA?",

      "description": "Backstory: my friend is very liberal and I am very conservative. Despite our differences we get along great. However when we get into arguments about politics, he loves to interrupt and use fallacies to back up his claims and it’s exhausting to call him out on it every time he interjects. \n\nSo we had a particularly hot water subject come up and I said “look, I will only get into this if you promise not to interrupt. If you interrupt I will smack the shit out of you.” And he said “okay cool.” Not 15 seconds into my schpeel he interjects with “okay but...” and I slap him across the face. All of a sudden he gets mad and starts yelling at me for getting violent.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nAnd in case anyone’s curious we’re good, stuff like this blows over all the time. ",

      "description": "My sister, Grace, has autism. She's high functioning, but severely lacks in social skills and self awareness. She is prone to meltdowns, has difficulty taking accountability for her wrongdoings, and gets frustrated easily - making schoolwork a nearly impossible feat. Since I spent the most time with her, I started to figure out how to effectively communicate with her, and even made progress in toning down her temper. When I was around, even before I was a teenager, she knew how she was supposed to behave, she seemed to be developing steadily, and she cared more about school and learning.\n\nI moved out about three years ago, and moved states a little over one year ago. My parents absolutely weren't ready for that, they're super protective of me and have openly said that I am their only chance of having a \"normal daughter.\" I've always gotten good grades, been \"mature\" for my age, and am going to be the first person in my family to have obtained a college degree. Additionally, I took care of Grace. I effectively raised her. She was, and continues to be, a stressful child - so much so that I developed severe anxiety as a result of having to care for her, and have full blown panic attacks when I hear children crying. For those reasons, I was the one who was sent in to calm and punish her, my parents never wanted to.\n\nNow that I'm gone, Grace is being...enabled. Our parents are so afraid of her leaving them too, that they no longer punish her. The worst they do is take her phone when she has failing grades, but do nothing to help her understand the material. When she throws tantrums because she wants something, they always cave and give it to her. She doesn't make her own food, wash dishes, fold clothes, and even still has my mother pick her clothes and check to make sure she's washed all the shampoo out of her hair. She just turned 16. Most days, she sits inside all day and watches YouTube, eats junk food, and actively avoids showering, brushing her teeth, and leaving the house. I've forwarded my parents countless phone numbers, addresses, websites and so forth with resources for her, so they can help her *become a person* \\- but they're content just letting her continue to stagnate.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm asking is: **AITA for knowing all this and not going back home?** I keep watching her get older and somehow act younger than when I saw her last. She still \"baby talks\" and calls my parents Mommy and Daddy. Her peers are getting jobs and drivers' permits, and she's sitting inside asking me how to use a microwave. When I was \"raising\" her, she was only slightly behind her peers in terms of cognitive and social development, now it seems like she may never catch up.",

A full family was saying goodbye.  \n\n\n\nThere was no room to back up and they were completely blocking the path, for something that I felt could have been done inside the restaurant we just left, rather than after half the family got in their car to drive away. \n\n\n\nI honked.

      "description": "Buckle up folks because this is a long one. \n\nSo about 2 and a half years ago I reconnected with a girl I met online from canada that really seemed to click with me, we shared alot of personal interests, links, etc. She was in this on off thing with another guy and living with an abusive father. She sends me a nude which causes the on off guy to flip out on me over Skype and I not wanting drama backed off for awhile but something about her hooked me like a drug. We start talking again and she says she wants to be with me and builds up the idea of a dream future. I'm into it naturally but she seems really avoidant of making our status known to anyone which is fine, shes got that weird ex right? So I message a mutual friend and he blows up and starts a shitstorm of drama because she was evidently sexting him, the ex, and making plans with me. I have alot of drama in the place I'm living at the time and see red flags so I deuce and end up in another relationship that I rapidly lose interest in but hang around because it's better than where I was before (I am the asshole for that I know) \n\nJump forward 6-7 months and she starts messaging me on Skype again and we reconnect as friends and I tell her I still think about her and flirt a bit, a week or two later she sends a picture of her wet panties to my Skype while I'm at work and current gf sees it at home and almost kicks me out making me homeless across the country from family so once again seeing a red flag I block her on everything, 4 months later current gf cheats on me when I play fallout 4 after it comes out for 3days so I say screw it and deuce. Being in a bad place mentally and stuck moving in with parents again because my car died in a flood and I didnt have much money, i cant stop thinking about Canada girl so i unblock and message her, shes moved out of her dads, broken things off with the ex more completely and now has an american trucker friend paying for her apartment while she is slowly slipping into depression from abusive father and ex(he had been visiting her a few times at this point) we hit it off again and trauma bound over childhood stuff (toxic abusive mother and constant fighting as i grew up with step dad) and one day she just vanishes for 18 hours and I panic because shes had several prior suicide attempts. I call numerous people trying to figure out if shes okay including a guy who she hung out with irl sometimes, he flips out on me and tries to tell me to go find an american girl so that sets off a weird flag... she calls me a short time later with a black eye and mad I contacted her friend up there (I somehow ignored alot of red flags) \n\nSuddenly she drops a bomb on me, her dad showed up and hit her \"accidentally\" because she wouldn't hug him and she also breaks down and informs me of just how abusive he was when she lived with him. In the following month she spirals out hardcore, trucker friend lost job, she isnt working, food runs out, shes starving slowly to death, suddenly starts acting really strange and informs me she ordered helium to off herself. I call a crisis team immediately because I've fallen hard at this point and I've lost several friends to suicide so its terrifying to just let someone go through that, cop and psych lady show up, ask questions, she convinces things are fine and they leave. She panics after because she self medicated for epilepsy with weed and didnt want to get in trouble but she also cancels the helium order.\n\nAt this point she starts disappearing on me again but I dont give up because I'm terrified she'll off herself. Turns out shes talking to abusive ex again, so I in my infinite wisdom, somehow get roped into a 3 way relationship for the sake of getting her away from stalker father and not ending up homeless or starving to death. Trucker guy also has job again at this point and wants to help too (hes her friend of 15 years who has always been hung up on her but she refuses to date because shes not into him) \n\nSO the first 3 months of the 2 year shit saga begin... I fly up, the other 2 drive up a week later, I help her get her passport renewed, clean up her apartment (which is a disgusting wreck, she was letting her dog shit on the balcony and it was like 4 inches thick but I was in the army and a plumber at one point so fuck it, shes been through some fucked up shit, I'll clean the place nbd) she meanwhile fucks me like crazy and ignored her ex and tells me she just roped him in to help get this all done (hes already been a sleezebag, I moved in with him shortly before going up to Canada and his place was a shithole too and I guess I have a bleeding heart) and shed drop him after. So first we drive all the way to trucker guys hometown with ex guy trying to sexualize her and grope her every chance he got despite her trauma and her not initiating and obviously being uncomfortable and telling him to stop.\n\nAfter a weird argument there with her being pissed with everyone but me; me her and ex continue to his place against everything she had told me before, basically I end up having 2 or 3 threesomes minus the fact the guy gives a weird vibe, her and ex start having arguments that spiral into insanity and end with her locking herself in the bathroom and self harming(no shame, just stating for clarity) and only allowing me In to calm her down, he knocks her up but we dont know it at the time (I'm sterile from birth because mom smoked and drank while pregnant, its caused 2 other relationships to end which is why I got tested because having a kid wasnt working out) and she starts getting really sick he takes her to hospital while I'm at work and i get a call saying he \"lost her\" she freaked out and had an argument and let her walk off in a major city by herself in a delirious state and she gets lost and almost snatched but she goes knocking on doors and a stranger helps her back. A day or two later upset at him, she goes through his laptop and desktop. First she finds out he cheated on her with 14 other people and then she finds 10 gigs of .... well some shit you just cant fucking unsee. It's all I can do not to kill the bastard and I feel sick af about everything, she blows up his Facebook, he comes home, immediately wipes hard drives and destroys computers while we pack up and gtfo.\n\nQueue Feb of 2017, it's already been the most insane shit I've ever been apart of in my life, but she has me hooked and convinced we need eachother. We move up to Trucker guys hometown and he helps us get set up before she starts getting really sick again (we hadn't been eating well at this point because money got drained away by her \"needing\" weed, bills and ex guy being literal garbage) so we take her to a hospital there, she finds out shes 3-4 months pregnant and insists on abortion because it's ex guys kid and hes a pedo. I personally do not support abortion myself but I do believe in your body your choice. We end up going to the wrong clinic and it gets botched, she almost bleeds out but makes it, recovery is long and I spend the next few months keeping the house somewhat clean (I've been the only one cleaning since this started) and we have a backyard now so I lax on walking the dogs. Meanwhile with no vehicle I've found a job 1.5 miles away from the house at a mcdonalds and it's the best I can do but I'm walking there and back every day and I start losing steam on keeping up with the housework solo while she recovers for the next 3-4 months evidently, in this time I catch her flirting with other guys online and lying to me about things, she also caught me apologizing to my previous ex in secret because with what I've let go at this point, breaking up with her and deucing seemed pretty shit.\n\nShes not getting periods at this point, something is wrong, not pregnancy, some super rare shit where uterine tissue turns into bone and it blocks the way. So she has to have another surgery around this time last year, they fail at fixing it and retry (successfully) a few weeks later and she has to have a catheter for a week, in this time period she told me shed leave if I didnt let her have an open relationship and I caved because I have problems and we've already been through so much and she still talks about suicide. I say it's okay as long as I'm informed/involved and she starts acting shady. I had work the day of the first surgery and I came home and had a weird feeling after some recent arguments about her suddenly telling me shes poly and how I'm not meeting her needs (but she doesnt want to have sex at this point because pain, ex, trauma, etc.) And I find out shes been lying to me about video chatting with a guy who bought her a vibrator and she was sexting him the whole time and logs prior to her getting me to agree to the open relationship thing (meanwhile i have no desire to pursue anyone else, I have enough to deal with) so I send her a text saying \"we need to talk\" and she flips out and says I'm a piece of shit for causing her anxiety when she just had surgery and it turns into the first of many terrible arguments where she turns everything around on me. Christmas eve me and trucker guy have been making trips to Colorado to get her weed, the red a horrible blizzard, hes a dumbass and I warn him to slow down and we get into an almost fatal wreck with the trailer of a semi, trucks totaled, hes fine, I have bruised ribs from bouncing off center console (get a Ford f150 if you wanna feel safe lol) we have to jump through some hoops but we make it home in time for xmas, a few days later shes picking fights about me walking the dogs or doing housework because she just had surgery but I'm still going to my new job at a phone store making more money and supporting us both with bruised ribs which is agony in and of itself, fast forward (there's alot of fights she starts over minor shit ",

      "description": "Before you judge me, here’s some context to the situation\n\nI have been sick with a cold for two days, and I haven’t been able to see my gf of 4 months in that period of time. I’ve also been feeling a bit down because of my cold, and that caused me to be a bit cranky, especially today.\n\nMy gf and I have both made it clear that we feel awkward when we receive gifts without any occasion or anything to give in return, and to be honest, I feel guilty a lot when this happens\n\nSo I was sick today, I’ve been laying in bed all day and I couldn’t go to school. Lately I’ve been feeling cranky as my eyes were burning and I was just done with the world at that time. Then, my gf announced that she was making a gift for me, and I tried to be as excited as I could make up, considering I wasn’t feeling receiving a gift, and not wanting gifts in general. She didn’t buy it and obviously knew something was wrong. I tried to make it sound like I wanted the the gift but in the end I had to tell her that I wasn’t interested in it given the situation I was in\n\nShe then got emotional about it and, although she tried to make it seem like none of it was my fault, and it was hers considering I didn’t typically enjoy getting gifts, but I still felt like a dick about it, and I could tell she was upset, which didn’t help at all. I tried telling her I was sorry and I should have accepted the gift considering she took the time and effort into making it from scratch just to show that she loves me and cares for me, but it didn’t help the situation at all.\n\nShe recently went to bed and I sent her an apology text to show her that I care for her and I felt that I was in the wrong.\n\nI sincerely believe none of it was her fault, but I still don’t know if I’m to blame for the whole situation.\n\nSo, AITA?\n",

      "description": " AITA: This may not be the right feed, please redirect me if I have posted wrong. I am a grown, married, employed and a self supported 39 year old, just getting that out there to start with. When I was in grade school my parents divorced, it was not amicable. My father had an affair and left, we had little contact and he did not pay much in the way of child support, we did live near each other but there were many hard feelings from the divorce and my mother was and still is a very vindictive, grudge holding, negative person 30 years later, yes that's right 30 years. Both my parents remarried and my stepfather was a wonderful man and treated me well, very little was said about to my bio father and anything that was said was basically to the tune of how awful, sinful, evil, etc he and his family are. Fast forward, my stepdad passed away a while back and my mother is still angry, bitter, tired, sees everything as against her and on and on, my bio father and I have reconnected and began building a relationship and its been really nice. I know that what happened in the past 30 years wasn't always right but I'm not going to live my life and hang onto so much bitterness, spite and hate, I have cousins, half siblings that are nice and a step parent that is very nice also. We have kids in the same school and activities and as happy as he's been to reconnect it really makes me sad it took this long and as happy as he seems it really doesn't make sense that he stayed so out of touch, which makes me think a lot of it was my mother and her attitude, she has always been controlling and manipulative and I have realized this as I have grown and had children of my own. When she realized we had reconnected she flat out told me I had disappointed, betrayed and hurt her and how could I do that to her with the way he treated us? Newsflash--its not all about her and I explained to her it had nothing to do with her at all (wrong answer its all about her) and she now pretty much refuses to do anything where she may see him. She walked out of sporting events where we spoke to each other and refused to come to birthday parties for the kids if he was there. I actually don't miss her presence that much because most of my life she has put me down, criticized or controlled everything she can. My husband and friends have been supportive of me and I guess I just need some other opinions. Am I a horrible daughter? I am grateful for everything she has done for me and I have tried to see it from her side but at this point in my life I'm letting old stuff go and moving on with the positives. ",

      "description": "Ok so here it goes, I(20m) work at Starbucks closing down the store about 4-5 days a week. Now there’s this other dude there let’s call him Ben(19m), who used to work at the nektars juice bar next door to us. When he got hired we all thought “awesome, someone who’s already been working making drinks should fit right in here”. \n\nWe were then consequently warned by some of his old coworkers that he was a very lazy employee and that he sings while at work. When I first heard this I didn’t think it would be too bad but holy shit these people were not joking this dude will be singing the most random rnb melodies and the top of his lungs ALL DAY. At first everyone tried to be nice and just kind of ignore it but it’s really hard because he will only sing if you’re in his vicinity and he’ll kind of look to make sure you heard. Then we tried dropping hints saying things like “dang Ben you really do song a lot” but he would never get the point and I think he might’ve thought we were encouraging him. \n\nSo this goes on for about 4 months to the point where I dread every time I have to work with him. One day maybe about 2 weeks ago we are working together and if you’ve been to a Starbucks you know that we have this new cloud macchiato drink and Ariana grande is the ambassador for it, so because of this we have a new playlist on the music that is 65 of just her songs. So Ben, being a flamboyantly gay  teenager that he his, knows every single lyric to every song on the playlist and was going hard as a motherfucker on the singing. Keep in mind we are in the middle of the high school rush, I’ve been on bar by myself for about 4 hours at this point, and it’s just me and him on the floor because my manager is on his thirty. In a fit of frustration and annoyance I turned to him a very aggressively said “Hey Ben would you PLEASE chill on the singing??? Like sing in your head or under your breath, that would be fucking GREAT” and went about my business making drinks. He seemed a little taken back by it but mostly stopped. \n\nI kinda felt bad about it because I’m a musician myself and I never want to put anyone down or make someone doubt themselves, but I also don’t bring my guitar to work and play as loud as I can every chance I get!! I really only felt kinda bad until he started doing it again probably twice as often as before so I had to tell him again to stop the other day and he and my manager(who is basically Bens best work friend) seemed to be pretty upset by it. Now let me just say this, for all intended purposes Ben is a super nice guy that I get along with for the most part. It’s not like I hate the guys guts or anything we get along pretty well for the most part, I just can’t stand his singing! Am I the asshole here?? \n\nTDLR: Starbucks coworker won’t stop singing in my ear at work so I snapped at him and told him to be quiet",

The thing is we were actually in a discreet friends with benefits relationship and we went apart, but we were still friends. \n\nThe only person ever I told about my secret  relationship is N because I really trust her. I am not really okay with her still shipping K and I together and telling our new friends about how we constantly fight but still have a thing with each other. (She never tells people about we were friends with benefits but she jokingly tells people she ships us) but I took it as a joke and don't really mind it.\n\nMy friend N is in a commited relationship with her boyfriend. She is very insecure about people always think that she's cheating by having fun with guys. I know that she just likes hanging out with guys platonically. I told her before, if she knows that she is not guilty, then she is not. She doesn't have to justify herself to other ignorant people who doesn't know about her relationship. If they want to think that she cheats, then let them be. There is nothing to hide in front of them. I know she loves his boyfriend very much and would never do such things.\n\nSo today, N, K and I invited this new guy (J) to hang out with us. She, like those days, told J about her ship for K and I in front of all of us. I myself knew that she was joking and was totally fine with it. When J was leaving, N wanted to send him off, I jokingly ask whether they want to kiss. Then N was so pissed off and went back home. K told me I was too far for saying that.\n\ntl;dr: Am I the asshole for jokingly told my friend who has a boyfriend to kiss a guy we just met even though she told that guy about my ex fwb and I are meant to be together in front of us which is highly disrespectful?",

      "description": "I promise this isn’t a shitpost. \n\nLast weekend, my SO (21M) and I (21F) were taken out to dinner by an older family member of his. This was at a semi-upscale chain restaurant, not Olive Garden but very similar. After looking over the menu, I decided to order a $12 personal sized pizza. Wood fired pizza is one of my favorite things ever so I wanted to try theirs. Cue snickering from my SO and his relative. Okay whatever, I expected some lighthearted teasing since they know I’m a pizza addict and his family loves to tease over silly things. A little annoying but I’m more than used to it by now.\n\nLater that night and for the next day or so afterwards, SO’s family member kept texting him things like “(my name) should have more respect” and “if you take her out for lobster she’ll just order pizza anyway.” Apparently my choice of meal really offended her? I genuinely don’t understand why it is such a big deal though. Their meals were in the ballpark of $20 each so it’s not like I ordered something pricey. To me, Americanized Italian food is mostly just different combinations of cheese, meat, bread, and sauce anyway so why my choice of meal is somehow inferior to theirs baffles me.\n\nMy SO is seemingly on the fence. I feel his relative may still be giving him a hard time about the scenario days later. He tried to get me to see the relative’s side and understand why that person sees it as a respect issue but also said he just doesn’t want to see me get bullied. I replied “why should I let someone bully me about my food then? that’s a middle school attitude and (relative) is acting like a special snowflake over it.” That might have been a little harsh but this relative is someone who criticizes the younger generation and constantly tells us we’re doing things wrong (cell phone usage, job hunting, etc) yet gets their panties in a twist over something as trivial as this. SO also thinks it reflects badly on me as being childish that I ordered pizza, but there was literally a whole section on the menu dedicated to pizzas (the regular menu, not a kids’ menu) so I figured it was fair game. I would probably even do it again.\n\nI’m of the mind that caring so much what someone orders on the menu to the point where it affects what you think of their character (within reason, i.e. nothing more expensive or complicated than what the host and/or the rest of the table orders) is a petty social construct and honestly don’t feel like I did anything wrong. Maybe this is something I should just take in and let slide since that person was raised in a different time though, or maybe there’s another argument for why it’s disrespectful behavior that I’m just not seeing yet. AITA?",

      "description": "Best friend and I (both early 30s) have been basically brothers for 20+ years, and him and his wife were together for seven years and married for four. This last year he got a new job which made him very conceited and would go out every weekend with his new workmates who are all...quite misogynistic. I definitely noticed changes in the way he would treat people and pulled away a bit. \n\nThree months ago he showed up at my place in tears saying he made a big mistake and his wife was leaving him because she found a thong under the bed that wasn’t hers and an email between him the workmates joking about hiring hookers. He swears up and down that he never cheated on her and never would and he was so devastated I had to believe him. His wife left him in the middle of the day without saying a word, just divorce papers and no one knows where she left to. \n\nHe was so broken and spent a lot of time talking to us about it, I know he really loved her and was totally blindsided but the situation also looked so bad from her end. We did our best to comfort and be there for him. A few weeks after all this, he stopped hanging out with us as much and started hanging out with his work friends a lot more. His attitude did a total 180, he wasn’t sad and moping around anymore but cocky. He got on this kick about how she probably elaborately set him up to leave him for another guy and pin all the blame on him because he got his friend to watch her at her work and she was eating her lunch with a guy. He suddenly started dating this new girl - my wife and I were pretty surprised but trying to be supportive asked him about her and he said, verbatim ‘she’s a butterface but always down to bone’. The new girlfriend started posting about them on Instagram in his hot tub that ex wife got him as a wedding gift with a caption that said ‘my hot tub, my man, my house now’ with the laugh emoji. Of course this got back to ex wife and she went absolutely psycho on him, telling him things so terrible I can’t include them in the post, trying to screw him as much as possible in the divorce and selling the hot tub in the middle of the day while he was at work. \n\nSince this he’s been terrified of running into her and he’s convinced she’s going to mess with all his stuff or him or his girlfriend. He’s been begging me and my wife to let him stay with us for a few months while he tries to find a new place. We have a guest room but honestly don’t want him there. My wife is in a VERY stressful masters program and I want her to have as little stress as possible right now. She is getting really sick of him because he doesn’t take any of our advice. I want to help him because he seems like he’s headed down a dark path and needs me but I also would lose my mind if he lived here. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I told him he can’t stay with us? ",

      "description": "Sorry about the wall of text.\n\nSome background: I'm a 25 year old bisexual cisgender woman. I've been out for about 8 years now and have been actively involved in the local LGBTQIA+ community. While I've never been in a serious relationship with a trans person, I've had friendships and casual sexual encounters with both trans men and women before. Generally speaking, if you're attractive, healthy, in decent shape, and we get along well, I'm happy.\n\nI have a profile on a popular dating app and a really pretty lesbian (we'll call her Claire) sent me a message last week. We hit it off well and when I was reading her profile, it said, \"Cisgender woman\" as her gender. She was definitely my type physically, and after we flirted, sent each other sexy pictures, etc. we set a date to see each other on Friday. Date went well, we had a fun night at a club, and then we went back to Claire's place. As we're walking back from the subway, we were talking dirty to each other and given some of the stuff I said, like I couldn't wait to taste her pussy, etc. it was pretty clear what my expectations were at this point. As we were getting naked, she unzips her dress and I see she's wearing pads on her hips, a waist cincher, and when she takes off her panties, she has a penis. I didn't care about any of that beyond the fact that this whole time I thought she was a cisgender lesbian and that she had never once mentioned that she was trans, even after what we were saying to each other on the walk back from the subway. I've never had a trans partner hide their transgender status from me before, and to be honest, I was hurt that she hadn't said anything earlier. She saw that I was surprised and goes, \"What? Something wrong?\"\n\nI stammered a bit because it was unexpected and said, \"N-no, I just didn't expect-\" and I could see her get REALLY mad. \n\n\"What's wrong? You're obviously pissed! Spit it out! Are you one of those TERFs?!\" (trans-exclusionary radical feminist, basically a feminist who believes that transgender woman are just men and can never be a 'real' woman).\n\nObviously there was no salvaging the night at this point and said, \"No, I'm not, your profile said you're cis, so I wasn't expecting-\" and Claire screams at me that of course it says she's cis, she can't say she's trans for her own safety, that I don't understand what it's like being trans, that people have threatened to kill her, that she needed to know she could trust me before she said anything, that I was privileged because I can say I'm bi on a public dating profile and not risk someone wanting to kill me, etc. I tried to defend myself by saying that I didn't care about her being trans and that I was just surprised, and she accused me of lying, saying obviously I care a lot or I wouldn't have said anything, that I had been lying when I said I was excited to go down on her earlier that night, etc. After our fight, we're both upset, in tears, and she tells me to get dressed and get out.\n\nThe thing is, I know she's partially right: I'm not trans, I don't know what it's like to be trans, all the social issues that come with being trans etc. I also can't help but be upset that she never once bothered to tell me, even as we were walking to her apartment from the train station. I totally get not being up front about it with a stranger, but if we're going home together and you trust me enough to be alone with you in your apartment, why wouldn't you say it then? I felt like if she couldn't be up front with me about that, what else wasn't she up front with me about?\n\nAfter the weekend, I log onto my dating app, and there was a message from Claire waiting for me. She said she's sorry, that she overreacted, should have said something, etc. and that she wanted a second date to make it up to me. The thing is, I wasn't interested anymore as I felt like I couldn't trust her. I declined, and she called me a transphobic piece of shit and blocked me on social media and we haven't spoken since. \n\nQuestions that have been rattling in my brain the past couple days: Was it wrong for me to feel hurt for her not telling me her trans status before we went home to have sex? Am I being ignorant? Was I in the wrong for turning down another date after she apologized? Should I have given her a second chance? AITA in this?\n\n**TL;DR Went on a date with a woman who said she was cis on her dating profile. She's transgender and I didn't know until we were getting naked at her apartment. We had a fight over it, she apologized a couple days later and asked for a second date, but I didn't think I could trust her anymore and declined.** ",

No one else in the company is \"capable\" of doing our jobs, atleast not on the spot and without a few month of training.\n\nNow to the real story: three weeks ago my coworker told me that he has a new job starting at 1st March, but he does not intend to tell our company till the last possible day (we have a 4 notice period) but that he will submit vacation for the last 3 Weeks of february before that, so that our boss approves his vacation and he does not have to deal with all the \"handing over shit\".\n\nFor me that wouldve meant, i have to do all our shit for the whole february, there would be no time for him to hand over his work stuff to some temporary staff. The next months till we have a replacement would not really be nice for myself. \n\nHe had no ear for my situation and there was no way to talk him out of his \"plan\", so right at the and of january i told my boss about the situation. After that my boss declined his vacation and forced him to documentade all(!) of his work stuff until the end of february. \n\nFor my coworker it was pretty obvious that i told our boss. I can understand that he thinks AITA. But right now even all our other coworkers also think i am in the wrong here and treating me like i am a \"traitor\".\n\nWhat do you think about this? AITA?\n\ntldr:\nMy coworker chose to leave our company and leave me with a shitload of workstuff. I told my boss about it. Now all of my other coworkers think i am a traitor because my (leaving) coworker did not get his vacation and will have a february full of documenting lots of stuff.\n\n",

      "description": "I stopped talking to my mom 4 years ago and recently stopped talking to my dad. I stopped talking to my mom because she would lie about me. For example, my mom and my dad separated and my mom called me trying to get me to extort my dad for money (for her). When I refused, she threatened to call the cops on me for fraud that I did not commit, so I told her to \"go ahead\", hung up and haven't spoken to her since. She has then gone around telling family that she has no clue why I'm not speaking to her and that she did nothing wrong to deserve my desertion. The truth is my mom has been threatening me as a method to control me since I was a child. In fact, she used to threaten to 'off herself' as a means to control me and when I was 12 she actually attempted in front of me.  \n\nMy dad has recently gotten back together with my mom and has started trying to manipulate me. He \"bought\" me a vehicle for $500 but I insured it and HE drove it (he couldn't insure a vehicle because he has too many fines). He got speeding and parking tickets with said vehicle (which was under my name) and did not pay for them. The vehicle broke down, my dad brought it back to my place where it stayed, broken down in my parking spot. My landlord told me to get rid of it if it's not working. I told my dad. Nothing. His fines went to collections and went on my credit report, ruining my credit score. I'm trying to save up to buy a house and keeping a good credit score is paramount. So I call an autowrecker, who pays me $500 to take the vehicle away, just enough to cover the fines. I pay the fines off.\n\nFast forward a few months and my dad shows up wanting the vehicle. I told him that I sold it to pay for the fines he got. He's angry but doesn't say anything and leaves. He and my mother then go and tell my entire family that I have sold his car out from under him and took the money.\n\nEdit: I have stopped talking to them. My family thinks I am the asshole and is pressuring me to stop \"being a bitch to the people that raised and loved you\". Honestly... I don't feel like they love me. I feel like they are using and manipulating me. But perhaps I'm being selfish and narcissistic?\n\nAlso - my dad JUST messaged me again after months of not talking me - asking me to insure ANOTHER vehicle! I don't know what to do...\n\n",

I am incredibly new to this and it's very difficult for me to keep the hang of it. If i do make a mistake, please correct me. I want to learn. i don't know if my age has to do with anything but I am a sophomore in high school, I am 16.\n\nSo my current girlfriend came out to me as transgender the other day. She is now a boy and now my boyfriend. I am sorry if I use the wrong pronoun by mistake, I will try and read over and try and find if I make a mistake. Anyways we've been together for a little under a year now and I love him a lot. this is a lot for me to handle but I really support his transition and i am proud of him for being so brave to tell me. I love him literally with all my heart. if I could marry him right now I would, it doesn't matter that he is now a boy. But last night I actually had a weird thought: does this make me gay? because he is a boy and i am dating him.\n\nSo I brought this up with him today and he said yes I am gay. I was very confused because I have never liked guys before, and I still don't. I feel like this is a special case? Maybe it's not. I don't want to make him feel like he is any less of a boy just because he was born a girl, but I also don't really feel... gay. So he brought up the term bisexual, and I said no that isn't it either. I told him that I think I am straight, but I love him and he's an exception. He got very mad at me and wouldn't talk to me even after school. I've tried texting him but he won't respond, which is weird because almost every night we have really long text conversations.\n\nShould I try and be gay for him? I don't think I could ever date a boy (other than him) and I am not sexually into guys like that. I am fine with gay people I just don't think I am one, or even bisexual. I really only have ever liked girls except for this one situation.\n\nI don't want to leave him because I love him, but I don't want to identify as gay. He wants me to identify as gay, but I am straight, I think. I feel like he is an exception. \n\nAm I being an asshole for not identifying as gay? Is it transphobic? I am sorry if it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, I appreciate it.",

The guy above me moved in a week or so ago and since then he has been on and off playing really loud music. \n\nLike, I’m 20. I understand why you would want to play loud music but ffs this is an apartment building and if I can make out the words of your music from the floor below you I feel like that’s too loud. \n\nThe other day his music was so loud my boyfriend could hear it over his shower. I went upstairs and on my way up I could hear his music still in the hallway outside my apartment, in the concrete stairwell, and on the hallway outside his apartment. I had to knock a couple times before he even heard me. I told him his music was REALLY loud and he apologized and explained he had just gotten his internet since he moved in recently and was texting it out and said he would keep it down lower. I thanked him and returned to my apartment. \n\nA few hours later the music starts up again, still incredibly loud. I called the building manager and made a noise complaint, explaining how I could even hear his music in the practically noise proof stairwell and they told me they would send security up to talk to him. \n\nNow it’s two days later and there is loud music again, granted a little quieter than before but I can make out the words to the song still. I kind of feel like it might be a dick move to complain again but this is an apartment building where lots of business people work and a lot of us have to be up at 4 in the morning. Am I being an entitled bitch here or would I be justified in complaining again? ",

      "description": "Hello, \n\nThis is my first time posting. Please don't get mad if I break rules that I do not know about.\n\nA little bit of background:\n\nMy gf (29f) and I (34m) work for the same employer at the same location and we have similar work load. After work, I usually go over to her place before I head  home. Another piece of information is that she is easily stressed; it can be caused by going on vacation, not finishing a book before the due date, or complaints at work.\n\nNow the basic story:\n\nI went to her place yesterday and I started finishing some work that we both have to complete independently, this is not a collaborative project. We just need to have it done by late next week. When I finished, I celebrated because I was glad that there is one less thing that I have to worry about for the weekend. I celebrated by singing a happy tone. However, she was in the same room and was bothered by it. She told me to stop but I did not because I was happy. After couple more seconds, she changed her tone and got mad at me by not speaking to me for the next hour. After an hour of that treatment, I just left her apartment because I feel I am not wanted there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMTA for leaving?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I guess like everything a little backstory and context helps. I have been with my wife for 3 years now I love my wife, she is with out a doubt \"the one\". \n\nShe has a group of friends that she grew up with and went to middle and high school with and she still has remained good friends with a lot of them. I think they are a wonderful group of people and generally everytime we get together it's a great time. They are a very welcoming and hospitable group and I had no problem falling in on friendly terms with a lot of them. The majority are over/out for dinner monthly.\n\nI have slowly started to notice that almost everytime we get together a subject (almost always jokingly brought up) is another one of our friends ( let's call him Jeff ) who has a, as some have referred to it \" the biggest dick they have ever seen\" \"not big, like freakishly huge\" \"you have your regular virginity, then your Jeff virginity\" type of endowment. \n\nThat being said it just seems like everyone in this group has some kinda fetish-worship about this guy and his hog, like I mentioned before, the jokes and stories they all share about different times they themselves have had sex with Jeff, or times they walked in on Jeff having sex with someone. I pointed this out to my wife after dinner Saturday about the cult like worship and her response was. \" I mean it is freakishly huge *laughs*\"\n\nMy problem with a lot of this is more complex than the way that everyone seems to obsessively talk about this guys hog. Some of it stems from the fact that my wife had a \"FWB\" relationship with him for a few years. ( 10 years ago, long before I ever met her) A lot of it I feel comes from the fact that everyone is comfortable OPENLY discussing this man's sex life.\nMaybe this is where I start to sound prude or like a baby but I don't openly discuss the kinds of kink my wife and I are into. I feel like everyone just being so nonchalant about discussing the first time they saw Jeff naked or the first time they saw Jeff fucking some random chick at a party is just.... too much\n\nThe whole thing just feels weird to me, with all of the different factors adding up, sometimes it just makes me reluctant to even agree to go out to dinner because at the end of the night regardless of where we go or what we do at some point this subject is going to be brought up and yet again I'm going to be forced to either confront the idea that my wife had sex with this guy for years or ignore it.\n\nI have tried to talk to my wife about it but at the end of the day, if the tables got turned I don't see any of it happening much less being so accepted. I would be mortified and embarrassed to sit across the table from an ex girlfriend as everyone else traded stories about having/seeing her having sex.\n\nTL;DR\n\nAITA for slowly over time wanting to exclude myself from group plans with my wife and her circle because of the constant inappropriate joking subject matter about her ex-bf/fwb's massive endowment",

But me I don't even feel sad. Honestly I kind of feel happy that she no longer has to deal with her illness. But I don't know. Listening to my sister cry and me not even feeling sad made me feel like a sociopath. And it's not even like we weren't close. I was basically raised by her in a sense. She had alzheimers and at one point she even thought I was her son. Point is I did love her. But I don't really care that much that she died. My way of rationalizing this is that I already knew she was gonna die so I don't know. I feel like it would be the same if anyone else in my family died. Anyone else experience anything like this?",

      "description": "So I’m in college and once a week I play pickup hoops for a couple hours in the gym with a bunch of guys from college, there’s always some familiar faces every week where we sort out teams and play 5 on 5. \nNow there’s a guy there regularly (let’s call him Ben) that takes the games way to seriously. He acts like the teams coach, always gets way too into it, screams “Fuck” anytime he misses a shot ,is always visibly frustrated whenever we allow points and complains over every bad play then points fingers whenever a guy gets scored on. \n\nI’ve never had any problems with Ben in the past even though he’d give me the occasion critique or two about marking my man on defence and I’m no star player by any means and He is definitely a better player than me but I play pickup for fun with some of my friends and whoever shows up that week. \nWhile I do play my best to win some days, on other days I play more laid back in terms of effort and at the end of the day win or lose it’s not the NBA finals so who cares. \n\nThat brings us to today where we’re playing 5 on 5 and Ben’s on my team. We get off to a good start and win our first game that goes up to 11 and there isn’t a lot of noise from Ben so alls well and good but in the 2nd game the other team players better and then the jabs from Ben start to fly in. He asks me who I’m guarding in a condescending tone even tho I am marking someone and sure I’m not playing lockdown defence but I’m still trying, this goes on for a while with my man scoring only twice off putbacks when I was on him, what can I say the kid hustles for them. \nOf course I get all the shit from Ben more so than any of the other players even though everyone including Ben gets scored on. At this point I’m getting irritated and during a play with me chasing my man around the court Ben bitches to me saying I’m not marking anyone again and this sets me off so before I can even think my mouth opens and I yell at him to Shut the fuck up and add that he’s fucking insufferable. After this he quiets down and we go back to playing and it gets slightly awkward but we finish up the game and he doesn’t say anything to me for the rest of the day but I did feel bad about raising my voice at him cause I’ve had history with yelling on the court. So tell me AITA for telling my teammate to shut the fuck up \n",

Now I saw a post asking for a Discord (which he said he didn’t want to do) and he commented saying not to do it. Now I was inspired to make a joke, so I commented that eh should get a PornHub account. Pretty simple right? So I assumed no one would see that. So as a joke I made a post about it and went to bed.\n\nCome the next day I woke up to being banned. Now I thought this was hilarious so I made a post on my fan sub (creates months before the official) about it (I also appealed to the mods and they muted me). It did fine but the Youtuber saw it but took it seriously. Come today he has made a post on Twitter about it and now I’m being spammed by people telling me to Fuck off and taking it seriously.

      "description": "TLDR: depressed friend flaked out on every meet up I tried to arrange with the whole friend group for a year and then told me that I'm not enough of a priority to hang out with \n\nI've had a small circle of close friends since high school, only 4 of us in total and we've had a pretty fun 4 years together, but its been 4 years since most of us graduated. Even though we have a group chat, I felt that we were drifting apart for quite a bit. We only used that chat to complain about people (which is fun and all but it was literally just us complaining about everything). And recently I ran into a bit of a rough spot with a friend in the group that I was the least close to (will be called Sara). (the other two in the group will be called Joe and Hannah - Joe is very close with Sara and Hannah generally is best friends with everyone)\n\nSara is a year younger than the rest of us and was having a hard time adapting to university, failing out of programs and has a difficult family life. I understand that it's difficult for her to dedicate emotional energy to other people right now but I haven't hung out with all of my friends together since early 2018/late 2017 because we were all busy and live far from each other. The last 3-5 plans I tried to make with the whole group ended up falling through as Sara or Joe would call in last minute to say they couldn't make it. Joe would always say that he would go and then last minute back out saying he slept in but Sara would generally just say that she couldn't make it, which was fine with me because I get that she's depressed and lethargic and probably feeling bad already for not being able to make it.\n\nHowever, I'm planning to leave the country in March for a couple of years so I really wanted to celebrate Christmas of 2018 together as we are all just hitting young adulthood and we probably wouldn't be able to meet for a while. I even told them that I felt like it would be the last time we would be able to hang out together. I asked everybody when they were available and tried real hard to make it work out for everyone and ended up on a plan to meet on December 14th without Sara as she said multiple times that she could not make it as she was planning to leave 3 days after finals for vacation. I was really excited to host for my friends because I hadn't seen them in a long time and even wrapped up gifts and even planned to make pasta for the first time with them.\n\nA couple of days before the 14th we ended up in a bit of an argument, at least that's how I understood it from my POV. It ended up me saying something like \"I keep trying to make plans because I worry about you guys and we are friends but it's always me making the effort to go to you guys and set up meetings\" which is pretty rare for me because I don't like being vulnerable with my emotions and my friends know that. To which Sara replied something like \"Well I make the effort to go to see my \\[other friends who live further than me\\] because I love them\". It really hurt me to be basically told \"I don't care about you enough to make the effort to see you\" when I've continuously made the effort to try keep her and everyone else in my life despite the distance because I really care about them and I thought they knew that.\n\nI had texted Joe on the 13th to make sure he would remember to come and even texted Sara to extend the invitation to her in case she could make it, to which she replied \"maybe\" (so I bought her a gift too). The 14th rolled over and only Hannah arrived (it wasn't too bad as I live with a friend and so we just ate a lot of pasta and played video games). \n\nI haven't spoken in the group chat since, but I have had short convos with Joe and Hannah.\n\nAm I the asshole for not talking to Sara anymore? I've been feeling guilty for a while, wondering if I'm not being understanding enough or if I took things too harshly. I know a year isn't that long of a time to meet up with friends and it's hard to line up schedules as adults but Hannah is graduating soon, probably going to get a job far from us, and I'm moving across the planet so I wanted to see the whole gang together for one last time.

      "description": "So I [19M] just got out of a 2 year relationship [19F] about 3 weeks ago. The breakup was a mutual decision and it seemed like a very mature and adult seperating. Over the past few weeks I've started to move on and I have gotten back out there, so to speak. Anyway, my roommate had a little get together in our dorm room last night and a few lady friends came and my drunk ass decided it would be a good idea to post a selfie with them to my snapchat story. At the time I didn't give it a second thought (I actually don't think I had any thoughts for that matter). But, a few hours later, my ex-girlfriend starts subtweeting the living hell out of me. Her tweets read \"Welp that hurt. Awesome!\", \"so nowwwww you wanna post on snapchat okay lmfao\", and \"tell me there wasn't a motive to posting that LOL wholeeee new person.\" And then this morning a friend sent me two posts she made on her finsta last night where the captions said \"when u think u had a nice mature breakup with ur ex but turns out he's a fucking prick\" and \"have fun with ur other bitches because I taught you everything u know...how my pussy taste.\" I just want to know did I really do anything to deserve that? I didn't post that selfie to hurt her feelings or make her feel jealous, I was literally just plastered and having a good time. Anyway, anxious to hear what you guys think!",

      "description": "So I've recently found out a friend I've had since high school is 1. gay and 2. has a crush on me. I literally had no idea until yesterday when I was chilling at her place like we do sometimes after class. We were sitting next to each other on the couch watching a movie and she was leaning her head on my shoulder (I thought it was just friendly though). Then out of the blue she was like \"you know (my name) you're really beautiful.\". I turned towards her and was like \"thanks?\" I mean we compliment each other all the time but the way she said it was just different. Then she leaned in and suddenly kissed me. I was so shocked I didn't do anything at first and then when I realized what was happening I pushed her away and I was like \"wtf was that?\" out of shock. She told me she has loved me for a long time but was scared to tell me because she was scared that I would react the way that I was reacting. I was like \"you know I'm straight though?\". She was like \"yea I know but you can't control who you like\". I pretty much had to reject her right then and there. Keep in mind I've talked to her about guys I'm dealing with all the time so she knew there was no point in trying to get with me. She was always single but she said she \"didn't have time to date because of university\" so I didn't think much of it, I never suspected she liked girls, let alone me. It got so awkward after that, that I had to leave. It's crazy to me that she has felt that way about me for so long but pretended not to.\n\nI honestly don't think we can be friends anymore. I liked being friends with her but this changes everything. I can't act the same with her knowing that she likes me, I'll always second guess everything she says and does. I'm considering blocking her off everything and cutting ties but I'm just wondering if this would make me a shitty person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to be friends anymore?",

      "description": "For a bit of context, I was bored one day and joined this roleplaying forum that's attached to a browser webgame. So I started a fantasy roleplay where I basically acted as the DM, describing how the world would react to a character and their actions. This was going on for a few days and I had a good 5 people who posted once every day, and I would respond at the start of the next day.\n\nOne of these roleplayers, let's call her Flan, had a character who was basically carrying wool to the town to be sold. I had a man accidentally stumble into her and her cart, causing her donkey to get startled and flee. I expected her to go chase it down but instead she just acted like the donkey was still with her character, at which point I made the man say a sarcastic jab at her in character and then she suddenly went into godmode and beat up this man in her response post. Since she wasn't following along, I put her character in jail firstly for beating up a defenseless man, then I told her to roll a new character and follow along to the story, or to just stop posting on my thread.\n\nShe then PMed me asking me to change the narration so that she would beat the man up for sexual assault (I don't know where this came in?), get back her donkey and sell all her wool. She was offering me a hefty some of ingame currency to do this and she said she wouldn't post in the thread again anyway(Something that I admit I didn't initially read when I sent my response). I responded verbatim with\n&gt;Nope lmao, get off my thread don’t waste your effort posting again.\n\nThen she attacked me a couple times in this game and sent me this message.\n&gt; you're not worth my effort, will let it go. Whatever I get it you don't like girls and don't want to play with me. I really would have given you a item to let me out graciously, but I guess it serves your ego to make other players look foolish. Enjoy that instead of my friendship. That is all.\n\nThere was more conversation after this but I'll leave it out for the sake of brevity. Am I the asshole here?",

Every single time I'm by his side making him food, getting him medicine, and making sure he's comfortable. \n\nWe have been together for two years, and have lived together for most of it. In those two years I have not once gotten sick, until now. \n\nIn the middle of my bartending shift this morning I felt terrible. Fever, sore throat, coughing fits, everything. On top of that, it was an overall shit shift with mean customers and terrible tips. \n\nI got home and told him how I felt and joked that I was finally sick for the first time in our relationship, and that it was his turn to look after me. He then makes a joke about me taking NyQuil, and passing out so he can go out. \n\nI take medicine, fall asleep for about two hours, then he wakes me up to tell me he's going to the casino with a friend. I'm upset, obviously, but I can't stop him. \n\nAgain, he woke me up. And because I'm extremely uncomfortable I can't fall back asleep. It's been 6 hours and I'm still awake (3am here) and he's still at the casino. I call him, he doesn't answer, and texts me \"take more medicine. Please don't bother me\". \n\nI'm furious. AITA for thinking he should be at least NICE to me right now? \n\nTLDR: boyfriend has been at the casino for 6 hours after waking me up while I have a fever",

I’ve told him a few times in the last few months that I plan on surprising my kiddo by letting her choose our cat.

Wasn't intentional, but came out that way.* What do you mean why, because I don't want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The class starts to 'ooo' (I'm not sure how to correctly type this, but they were basically instigating)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nT: *says flusteredly* Well if you don't want to go then no one will go, we'll stay in class a read until the end of class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: I don't think that's fair to everyone else, **I** don't want to have to write it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't respond and just gets the book page ready to read. We listen to the audio and of the book. She starts it from the SmartBoard, and we start off reading. Since she started it from there we can see how long the audio clip is. When we reach the end she doesn't say a thing, but gets up and changes it to the next clip even though we wouldn't be able to finish it and get about 3 minutes into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can see some looks getting thrown my way by a few students, probably thinking like \"did he really just get the whole class out of writing a note for kindness week.\" Now I know like 95% of everyone in that class couldn't give a shit about writing a note to be kind and wanted to just not read the book (even though we aren't even reading it, we just half to follow along which is super easy to do) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any of them truly cared about kindness week then they would go on their own time to write a note.",

      "title": "AITA For acting bratty towards my dad over his family?",
      "description": "Firstly, I just want to mention this will be a very petty post. I've (20F) always had issues with my dad's elder sisters acting catty/bitchy towards me. This has been happening at least since I was 8. It's actually fairly common in my culture for the women in a family to act nasty towards the female in-laws. My dad's mother and sisters were downright abusive to my own mom during the early years of her marriage. They've now started treating me in a similar manner, because I'm my mother's daughter. They've never been physically abusive, just verbally. \n\nWhat bothers me is my dad never tries to defend me. Every time I mention that one of his sisters said something insulting to me he'll act defensive and not want to listen. Recently he's started turning the blame on me and getting irritated whenever I mention any more instances. I should mention I'm not a picture perfect daughter either, I only have university a few days a week, so for the remaining 4 I've made a habit of sleeping in until the afternoon. I also don't do as much housework as I should and can't cook any traditional dishes (As a girl, knowing how to cook and clean is important in my culture). This isn't relevant to my aunt's remarks as whenever they stay to visit (they live abroad), I always wake up earlier and make an effort to do more housework, so they've never actually commented on these things. My dad's argument however is, since there are issues he has over my daily routine, he doesn't really wish to defend me to his sisters. \n\nMy dad's claimed that I'm just getting overly sensitive and to brush it off. He's right in that I do get offended easily and take things to heart, however regardless of that, I don't feel as if I should have to deal with family members making nasty remarks to me. The main issue is it's gotten to the point where I don't want to be around them, one of his sisters is actually arriving tonight to stay for a month, so I made out as if I had a lot of work to do in the library just to get out of the house. He was unsurprisingly very irritated over this. I also mentioned I'd be staying in my room for the majority of her time here, to this he was also angry that I wasn't being sociable towards her. My main question is, am I justified for disliking my aunt's and refusing to be around them or am I acting sensitive?",

      "description": "Throwaway. I \\[30M\\] am in the weeds with my GF \\[27F\\] and need some external validation/asswhuping.\n\nLong story short we have been dating for 5 years, we met online and she moved to my city after college, have been living together for 4 years. I love this girl and think I could marry her some day, but I do not have my shit together at the moment (serious MH issues, depression, et cetera) so I do not want to force my crap onto another person. She works an office job, I am not doing anything at the moment (depression like I said) but I 100% pay my own way through my parents. Honestly this is kind of an issue between us at the moment because I get so stressed and down (ironically) about not having a job but we end up talking around and around in circles about it. She is quite materialistic and I think deep down me being such a loser bothers her.\n\nANYWAY about a year ago she starts talking about maybe starting professional school (law school). I am kind of taken a back by this because she loves her current job but trying to be a supportive BF I say 'ok sweetie if that is what you want to do then follow your dream'. Didn't expect her to do anything with it but before I know it she is studying for LSATs and applying to schools and just really throwing herself at this. It is kind of shitty for me because she already works full time and then goes to study for hours and hours and we never really get to spend any time together even though I am at home by myself all day. Then she starts applying for schools and is constantly pressuring me to commit to a city or a state but I can't because I don't have a job and don't even know what kind of career I want to do. I don't want to bum from my parents forever but at the same time honestly I don't know and with depression and stuff like that it is really hard. So I just say again 'well sweetie do what is best for you, I can't make a decision for myself right now' which is the truth.\n\nFast forward to now and she has several offers from programs around the country, and is again pressuring me to commit to a location and asking about financial aid and whether we want to be in joint housing et cetera and I just DON'T KNOW! So I say again 'look, I really wish I could give you an answer here, but until I know more about my situation you are just going to have to do this yourself'. So she goes and picks the school that is THE FURTHEST AWAY (literally a 15 hour drive from the city we live in, where I am from). I feel this is almost deliberate because she is tired of having a depressed loser boyfriend who can't take her nice places because of money, and that she is trying to break up with me by proxy almost. I tried to confront her about this and she just says that we can do long distance but I can't help but feeling that she is trying to leave me behind on purpose.\n\nSo am I a paranoid asshole or is she putting our relationship on the line for her job?",

      "description": "Both of our families live in Texas, and we currently live in rural California with our two kids. I'm the only one who works, and bring in about $50,000 a year. My dad is financially well off and has flown me out for week-long visits a small handful of times over the past three years. I'm going again in January because he's being sworn in as the mayor of our home town, and he'd like me to be there. I've always gone for significant reasons.\n\n- To surprise my mom on her 50th birthday. She bawled like a baby, said it was the best birthday present she's ever had!\n- To attend my dad's retirement as chief of police. I was there for his academy graduation 20+ years ago, so it was significant in a \"full circle\" sort of way too.\n- To support my 20-year-old brother who checked into rehab on the opposite side of the state. Seeing his dad and brother really helped him. \n\nAgain, all significant occasions and never just for the hell of it, at least in my eyes.\n\nMy wife is pissed because I don't tell my dad no, which she thinks I should, because \"what kind of man leaves his family behind?\"\nShe also thinks he should instead fly everybody out, never just me... even though it'd be four times as expensive for him and our daughter has to go to school. We also have pets that need to be taken care of, and boarding them cost a good few hundred dollars last time we all visited.\n\nIt'd be one thing if I were spending our own money for these occasional solo trips, but she's basically saying \"I don't want you to go unless your dad pays for all of us to go.\" The frustration is understandable, she wants to see her family too, but the sense of entitlement to my dad's charity and her \"all or nothing\" attitude is a bit ridiculous. The guilt-tripping too, but whatever.\n\nIf her parents offered to pay to fly her out (or all of us like she suggested my dad do), I'd be 100% okay with it. Driving has been suggested, but that's a damn long drive and I wouldn't have driven myself to attend the aforementioned occasions. If that were the case, I'd have driven us home for Christmas every year. So for those reasons, I don't think I'm being one-sided (or an asshole) by accepting my dad's generous offers.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

She usually returns 100-200 than try to play it off saying she has it tough raising us as a single parent. I would be fine with just gifting her the money if it was to pay for rent or bills, but it was to help her sister and friends pay off debt which just got me even more pissed.

If you fail to return 100% of my money by the given date I will cut off any contact with you.\n\n2 weeks ago my aunt called me asking me to lend her $1.4k since she needed to pay off her debt to her aunt. She told me she'll pay it back by the 22nd. I told her if she doesn't pay me back I'll cut off contact so is she sure she wants to set the date on 22nd? Why not move it down a few weeks to give yourself more time. She promised she can give it back by then. Today's the 22nd and she only managed to pay me back 400. I told her to keep the rest, just never contact me again and I blocked her on everything.\n\nAm I the asshole for cutting off contact with my aunt over 1000 dollars?",

One night when we're playing mini golf, I was getting cocky and then went down big and was getting visibly frustrated. Out of pity and too cheer me up, my friend bet that I wouldn't hit the impossible 18th hole and if I did he would clear the wager and buy me a Cinnabon. I miraculously hit it and my friend was stunned and we agreed that I would just take a bite from his Cinnabon because that seemed fair. When it came to night time and we were buying our buns, my friend handed me the box and let me take the first bite. I used my fork and stole the center part (obviously the best part) for my bite, which he took great offense to. He was pissed at me for the rest of the night because I apparently broke the unspoken rule of Cinnabon etiquette. Am I the asshole for taking advantage of someone's nice gesture and robbing him of Cinnabon's delicious goodness?",

      "description": "I have about 15 years of work experience and am paid well, and while not management I am in a high level skilled position.\n\nI sometimes order lunch if I'm busy or if it's snowing out or some such.  Maybe 1-2 times a week.  I work on the 41st floor, and the delivery person ends up leaving the order with the reception downstairs.  Now, the mail people who work for my company bring up the food orders to the professional service people's offices, and I presume they do it for admin people and everyone too.  The first time I ordered, I went down to the lobby to get it and met the mail person on the way up bringing me the order.  He said, oh no we bring these up.  So I said ok.  And thereafter, any order just comes straight to my office by a mail person.\n\nMy boss, is slightly paranoid and very concerned with appearances.  He noticed one day that the mail guy had dropped it off, and he said, oh getting the delivery like management eh?  and I just laughed and said, well I tried to go downstairs and they insist on bringing it up.\n\nSO, maybe a month later, he brought it up again, implying that I should tell them not to bring it up, in case one of the partners sees and complains to HR.  Now, I am pretty sure that everyone who orders food gets it delivered, not just partners, nor would they care anyway.  He seems to think otherwise, but I just said well I've asked them not to bring it up and they still do.  So he said he'd talk to the manager of the mail and see if he have him stop doing it.\n\nI don't really care either way, but it's bugging me.  I do think he has some personal issues (personality wise internally), but he loves my work, we get along great, getting a raise, no complaints.  He just wants me not to have food delivered up so he can keep up with his imaginary appearances with partners.  Meanwhile, partners don't even know who I am.\n\nSo I'd apparently be the exception at the whole firm (not that many people get lunch delivered but I get hankerings for food that isn't a nearby walk so I guess ordering 1-2 times a week is more than others in my floor).  Am I the asshole for getting food delivered ? ",

This person will reach over and obnoxiously knock on my desk and they'll wave their hand in front of my face to get my attention.\n\nI asked this person to please stop and to just IM me if they need anything. This person obliged for a couple of days but now they're back to knocking on my desk/waving at my face for attention. \n\nI can *feel* this person looking at me when I glance over from the corner of my eye. This person constantly comments on what I have for lunch and interrupts my work so they can small talk me to death.\n\nThis person is also significantly older than me (and most of our department) and I get the feeling that this person is lonely (unmarried) and just wants to be friendly but this person is making me uncomfortable.

      "description": "TLDR: Scroll to \"yesterday\" at the bottom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimeline:\n\n3 years ago: My sister, her boyfriend, and their 2 sons (ages 5 and 2) were living in section 8 apartment in North Carolina, due to both of them having zero credit, and both being irresponsible people. They never cleaned the apartment, which lead to terrible smells and filth.\n\n2.5 years ago: My father (lives in Florida) decides that he is going to help them **get a house**, because he \"can't stand the thought of his grandchildren living in section 8 housing.\" He takes out a $230,000 mortgage from the VA and buys them a nice 2,400 square foot house in North Carolina. With the agreement that my sister and her boyfriend will financially contribute to the mortgage payments \"once they both get on their feet.\" Since that time, **they have never once honored the agreement** to financially contribute to the $1,700 monthly carrying costs of the house. My father has been paying every bill for the last 30 months.\n\n1.5 years ago: My sister and boyfriend no longer get along. There is substance abuse and domestic violence going on at the house. He moves out into his own apartment 30 miles away. My sister and the kids remain in the 2500 square foot house, my father continues to pay all the bills. \n\n6 months ago: My father has multiple heart operations and his health starts to significantly decline (he is age 80 now). I decide that he can no longer live alone in Florida (there was no family member within 1000 miles of him). **We decide that my father will go live with my sister**, since the house has 2 extra bedrooms, with the idea that he will continue to pay the bills (has a good pension thankfully), and my sister can \"keep an eye on him.\"\n\n4 months ago: I move my father out of his house and drive him to my sister's - **we arrive in NC find that the house has become derelict under my sister's care.** Cockroaches, overflowing toilets that have ruined flooring, filth and grime everywhere, broken doors, holes in walls, etc. The house was derelict. Keep in mind now, that my sister has no job, and has my father paying all of the bills. Yet she cannot even keep this house moderately clean.\n\n3 months ago:  **we decide that my sister cannot manage the house and it needs to be sold.  Unfortunately, in the condition that it was in we would have only gotten $180,000 for it, despite my father owing $210,000 on the mortgage.**  As a result, **I move into my sister's house for 6 weeks and do about $15,000 worth of renovations (completely free of charge) so that this house can be sold at an amount that will cover the outstanding mortgage.** My sister didn't lift a finger to help me once during the entire time I was there working on the house.\n\n2 months ago: I leave the house in mint condition, ready for my mother to hand the house over to a realtor to complete the sale. My sister and children go live with my mother (because my sister was actively drinking and cannot be trusted to raise children alone, let alone not destroy the renovations that I have done on the house). My father (health failing) goes to an assisted living facility and hands me power-of-attorney over his estate. I move back home to be with my fiance and get on with my life.\n\n\\--------------\n\nYesterday: I get a phone call from my mother to let me know that:\n\nA)  my sister has gone to a 1-year alcohol treatment program (not the first time this has happened - usually she checks out of there in a month).\n\nB) my mother has decided **not to sell the house, and to instead have my sister's ex-boyfriend move into the house that I just renovated so that he can raise my sister's kids (who are currently living at my mom's house and are too much to handle - ages 8 and 5 now).** Furthermore, my sister's ex-boyfriend **can only afford to pay $1,000 a month out of the $1,700 monthly carrying costs, which means my father will be picking up the rest of the tab from the nursing home** until he dies (then I don't know where the extra $700 will come from). Furthermore, she never consulted me before making this decision (despite me a) being power of attorney over my father's estate, and b) busting my ass for 6 weeks free of charge to repair that dump that my sister and her kids destroyed.)\n\n**My concern:** I left that house in mint condition 2 months ago, ready to sell so that we could pay the bank back the $210,000 mortgage and be free of this burden of a house. If my sister's ex-boyfriend and those kids destroy the house again, I wont be able to sell the house at a high enough price to cover the outstanding mortgage, and any inheritance money will go to pay the bank. **I've suggested to my mother that the ex-boyfriend and my nephews just go live in a condo that he can afford instead - she responded that is impossible since he has no credit. This house is the only option.**\n\nMy question: Am I being a selfish asshole here? And if not, what would you do if you were in my shoes? Thank you.",

And I’ll write from the viewpoint of him to make it easier for everyone to understand. (May be biased as I believe he is NTA but just want some others viewpoints)\n\n\nTo begin, my daughter has not been the best person, always getting in trouble with no regards towards me and my wife and what the repercussions could be. She also has a 2 year old son that goes to daycare and whom we occasionally watch on the weekends, sometimes all night because she doesn’t want to come home. \n\nRecently, what prompts this post is that the CV shaft on her car, that I bought her so that my grandson would be safe, went kaput. Therefore, we had to take it to a mechanic and get her a rental car, because she needs a vehicle to drive as she has a full time job. \nTurns out, within just a couple of days of driving the car, she smashes in the rental car’s bumper by backing into someone. She had no care in the world and took no responsibility. She told my son that I was overreacting. Initially, I wasn’t that mad. But then she made it worse. \n\nYesterday, she had the day off but still took her son to daycare, which is fine because it’s $135. Instead of doing what I told her and take the car to the rental place so they could inspect it, she goes ahead and screws around with her friends, one of whom has a history with theft and breaking and entering, and never goes to the rental place. Even better, she left her son at the daycare until 4:30 when she was supposed to pick him up by 4. \n\n(This part is going to be a little fuzzy because I was woke up by my parents arguing, so I don’t know the entire story) \n\n(And just some background we live in a legal state, and both my parents smoke marijuana, my mom more so) \n\nThis morning, I woke up to discover that my pipe, and some of the marijuana that my wife and I share had been stolen from us. This threw me off the edge. It escalated to my wife and I getting into a huge argument over me wanting to change the locks on the doors and kicking my daughter out. My wife is taking my daughters side because of her 2 year old son. \n\nI’m sick and tired of my daughter taking no responsibility, and treating me and my wife like crap. I’m also thinking of the future because I do not want to show up to my house being robbed by one of my daughters “friends” down the road. \n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA for kicking my daughter out? What should I do? ",

      "description": "So, I join this discord server about a particularly niche subject at random. I introduce myself and so on, try to be civil, etc. \nThe conversation gets going, I try to fit in, I just casually share my opinion about things, and this person, who happens to be the server owner and me get into a discussion. I normally have no issue being disagreed with but throughout the conversation it’s always “LOL, you haven’t seen (x) and are here arguing with me?” Or “most people want (x) and this guy wants (y)??”. I grit my teeth and keep trying to make it a conversation or debate but he keeps grating on my nerves. Eventually I say “I’ve gotta be off, seeya”. I spend a few minutes and realize I’m not having fun there, so I quietly leave the server. He messages me saying “really? You left the server because people disagree with you?” Before I manage to explain to him that his tone makes me feel unwelcome, he blocks me. To be honest this whole exchange left me in a sour mood. So, am I the asshole?  ",

We used to talk about stuffs as a part of casual conversation and somewhat he seemed like a good person. But lately all he can talk about is sex. Yes! he playfully asks sometimes why I am single for which I clearly don't know the answer. But it got worst. All he can talk about when we see each other is about his sex life and how I am missing out all the fun. Whenever he talks about this stuff as a virgin IDK anything else to talk about it. I just add a comment to it. So basically I started ignoring him. He always checks out girls passing by and comments on them in a sexual manner. One day he will find out that I am avoiding him. But that is not the matter. I just wonder who is the AH. Am I too immature for having a conversation with this guy? Is sex is all adults talk about?",

      "description": "Throwaway because I don't want people to associate this with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened a bit ago, but I feel very morally conflicted about this, so I want to share it here, so the internet can decide how I should feel about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll provide background. I'm 21/M, in college, and my primary friend group (not anymore) is all girls, the same age. We often got blasted together, both smoking and drinking. I had been spending time with this group for about half a year, and we got along so well. However, there is one girl, who I will call S, who made a few obvious advances towards me that made me feel uncomfortable, but I let it go because I didn't want to lose out on the friendships I had made.  I mentioned to her that it made me uncomfortable, but she never stopped making the advances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, one night a few weeks ago, I got EXTREMELY drunk. Probably drunker than I had ever been before. The night was great for a good bit. Lots of fun all around. But then someone brought out weed and I got sooooooo tired, and so did everyone else. Most of the girls lived together, so they started going to sleep in their rooms. I was laying on the couch, saying that I was going to pass out there. However--and this is where things get kind of... weird-- S insisted that I come sleep in her bed with her. I refused over and over again, but she kind of dragged me into her room. I couldn't walk because of how crossed I was, so I guess I just went along with it. This is the last thing that I remember. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to the morning, and she seems angry at me for some reason. I think nothing of it, writing it off as hangover quietude. But then I start getting texts from her, saying that we needed to talk. I meet her for coffee at a local shop, and she told me that we had sex. I'm kind of taken aback. I'm not remotely attracted to S, and would never want to have sex with her. Plus I don't remember it. I don't say anything, and she follows it up by saying that I'm a huge asshole. Apparently, before we had sex, I made a face that she interpreted as me thinking she was fat. I apologize and try to move on, still in disbelief about what she told me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to the next day, and my friends text me saying that I'm a dick and they don't want me around anymore because of how I made S feel about herself. I'm shocked, honestly. I wasn't even conscious for this supposed event.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's why I'm putting this here, I guess. Am I really the asshole for this? I can't help but feel like a horrible dick about it, because now these people whom I valued don't even speak to me anymore. I tried explaining it to them, but they all took S's side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "A few days ago, I snapped at my mum and my sister. Not like, a small snide comment. I, for lack of a better term, erupted. It all started in 4th grade when I was diagnosed with anxiety, specifically, around the concept of death. I literally couldn't be in the dark because it would make me imagine how permanent death is and how immanent it is for everyone. Around this time my mum and sister had learned that a song they both really enjoyed, which was solely based around the inevitability of death, would send me into a meltdown. Looking back, it was actually causing me to have a panic attack. But my family kept playing it, because they KNEW it would upset me and they thought it was hilarious. They both knew I had anxiety but they didn't understand just how terrible it felt for me to be stuck in tears in the back of the car whilst they sung it out loud on purpose. \n\nFast forward a couple of years and they both recall the song whilst cleaning through some old CD's in the garage. They bring the song up with me in a joking manner. Talking about how terrified I used to be of a little harmless song. I told them I didn't find it funny, that they knew I had anxiety. They scoffed and told me to toughen up. \n\nThat's when I snapped, I flew off the handle and told them how much I still resent them both for putting me through that when I was just a child. It went back and forth for over an hour before mum called me some choice expletives and told me to fuck off. \n\nI'm writing this from my friends place and my family isn't letting me go home until I apologise, but I'll be damned before I apologise for anything that I said.

As these were two bratty, maybe 10-13 year old kids they just laughed at me and kept shooting. I then walked up to the kid and grabbed his gun and he got scared and promised not to do it anymore.\n\nHowever when I was walking home again the other day I found the same kids shooting at the same dog again. I therefor got mad and walked up the kids and grabbed his gun again. However this time he just laughed and asked me what I was going to do about it.

      "title": "AITA for wanting my mum to give me her tax statement for my benefits claim?",
      "description": "So for some context: my boyfriend (almost 19m) and I (18f) fell into some issues surrounding drugs the latter half of 2018 - hard drugs such as methamphetamine and heroin. Two days before Christmas my mum searched my room (something she has never done before to my knowledge) and found needles etc. She flipped out, proceeded to take my phone and look through everything on it, which included nudes and things I would have kept private. She also locked me in the house for a week straight, not even allowing me to go into the backyard. When she did let me out again, it was on the condition I would go and break up with my boyfriend. I didn't and we maintained contact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver time she found out and begrudgingly accepted I would continue seeing him. Since she found out both my partner and I have been clean. She now restricts our time to a sleepover at his house once a week (he is not allowed within my home) and occasionally seeing each other for a few hours. I know she is being more than generous letting me see him at all. We have had plans to move out in place since September of 2018 and this is still our goal. I have been open with my mum about my intentions to move out in a few months and she has seemed fine with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for the assholey-ness: in the middle of January I spent hours applying online for the benefit program my country has in place for young people undergoing tertiary studies, which allows for a payment of around $250 each fortnight. When my application is accepted, I will also be given $2000 in a student loan to help me buy textbooks, pay bills etc. My application has not been lodged because my mother needs to provide a tax statement of her income to prove I qualify for it. Until she does this I cannot lodge the application and as such will not be able to receive any of this money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my mum what she had to do when I applied, and she said she needed to see her accountant to get the statement and would do so in a week. Time goes by and nothing. I mentioned it to her around two weeks ago and she said I never told her I needed it or that I needed it urgently. I ask her politely if she can do it as a priority, as even with it my claim may take months to process. She says she'll do it; still nothing. I sent her two texts today asking about it and she ignored me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am beginning to think that she may be withholding the last thing I need to apply in order to stop me from accessing the money and using it to move out. She met with my bf today and said to him that until we move out he cannot see me any more than he already does. I have a job but it is not enough to save up and I could really use the extra income to help me get out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; now recovered drug addict daughter needs mum to provide tax statement so she can claim benefits and student loans. Mum keeps putting it off and I'm suspecting she's purposefully putting it off to prevent me leaving home. AITA for getting upset?",

      "description": "So my boyfriend he has very low self esteem issues and for the 50th time in the last two months we’ve had a fight on how he’s not ugly and all that shit\n\nWell half the time is just him shitting on himself and me saying “ok” cause anything I say it’s immediate met with “lol I’m fucking ugly”\n\nToday was the last straw, cause yes I don’t like myself either and here and there I’ll shit on myself. We start arguing and he says I just need to “change my mindset” when he can’t do the same for himself and he starts saying how I never look that the positives of myself and I only see the negatives and how I need to change my mindset (even though sometimes o do appreciate myself I even tell him that hey I like my jawline if I feel good or I get excited about my incoming facial hair)\n\nI tell him he’s being a hypocrite (as he starts saying all of his negatives and never any of his positives during the conversation) but he keeps telling me that he can’t change his mindset and how he has no positives (even though I’ve told him that he does and here’s what they are multiple times)\n\nSo as he continues on his self deprecation spree  I tell him I’m done and to have a nice day at work later or whatever and I just ignore him. \n\nI go and check my texts for a second and I see he’s said “it’s not a good idea to leave and ignore me”  and “it’s cool I’ll just overdose”but I’m already too angry to really talk to him and me talking him will honestly make me blow up more. \n\nAm I the asshole for basically ignoring him for this? I know it seems all out of sorts but I just need time to cool down and not be pissed at him. ",

      "description": "So im in an area where there's a lot of rednecks, latinos and blacks. The latinos and the blacks here don't really like each other and there's gang violence and usually the rednecks aren't too fond of them either but they mostly keep to them selves. Unfortunately this spills out into school and everyone hangs out with people of the same race. I'm actually white (Portuguese, Italian, French) but a lot of people think I'm latino cuz of my dark skin and i like to speak spanish. Anyways one day this group of black girls who i've never really liked walk up to me and say \"What the fuck are you doing here you bitch ass beaner? The taco shop is down the street\" and they all laugh and walk away. This girl got an athletic scholarship to an ivy league (she's very good at volleyball and she's got alright grades too) and she came from a poorer household. She was going to be the first person in her family to ever go to university. I remember she posted some drama online on a  instagram account my friend is following and doesn't have her name explicitly in it so she screenshots all of that and find a post 3 years ago on Facebook saying some racist stuff about latinos and white people. I screenshot that and send it to Penn state and my school's admin. She got suspended from our school and lost her shit and posted it all on social media. Her university at first was skeptical about my claims and evidence i sent them and apparently weren't even going to do anything until her reaction which then proved to the university that she did in fact say those racist things. Not only did she lose her scholarship to the university with the scholarship but she got rejected by all the other top colleges and is now going to community college. ",

      "description": "More context is of course needed bc my title is a little strange.\nI have a hair appointment in a salon that’s located in the busy part of my cities downtown area. I finally found a space after driving around for half an hour and I park. I’m only a quarter of a block away from the salon and the parking meter doesn’t charge too much. Right behind my space is a fire zone(? English isn’t my first language). I’m a little happy about that Bc I can’t parallel park or get out of tight spaces without feeling flustered. My hairdresser calls me as I’m parking to tell me she’s gonna be late bc of an accident on the freeway. No biggie, I’ll just chill in my car so I don’t have to pay for a longer stay. Then comes the man who I’m gonna  refer to as culero. He starts settling into the fire zone and jumps the curb, i think to scare me or Bc his trucks to big idc. I look back and I notice he’s glaring daggers at me. I ignore him Bc he’s obviously already moody and not gonna understand I’m waiting on my stylist. He stays in the fire zone( while almost bumper to bumper with me) for 5 minutes until another car pulls out and he finally parks. He stomps out of the car and starts walking back in forth on the sidewalk. I don’t acknowledge him bc like I mentioned, he seemed pretty moody/irritated. Am I the asshole for waiting in my spot so as to not pay a higher toll(?)?  I wanted to tell him I was waiting on my stylist but he seemed irked I wasn’t giving my spot up.",

      "description": "Ok so since I was around 6, my parents have been divorced. For you to get more context, I will say that my dad proposed a divorce settlement involving child custody for my brother and I, who gets the house, etc. It was a reasonable offer, but my mother refused it and demanded full custody and many other unreasonable things. After spending much of her savings (10s of thousands) on lawyers, she ended up getting exactly what my dad originally offered. Shes the typical r/entitledparent. \n\nShe fed me loads of bullshit about how my dad was evil and hated us, all while I was going to my dads every two weeks for the whole weekend; bring the naeve 7yr old I was, I believed it. She constantly argues with us on stupid stuff and refuses to accept she is wrong. I am currently a few months away from GCSEs and I feel as  if she is negatively impacting my mental health as I am finding it hard to sleep and she doesn't respect anyone. It's all about her. She also occasionally hits my brother and I and is just in general horrible to be around. Despite this, she can be nice and reasonable and of course there is filial love. She does care about my brother and I, but she can't see what she's doing to us. \n\nAt this point, I want to move to my dads in order to have a calmer peace of mind and to be generally in a better environment, although I'm scared about what will happen to my mum as she is unstable and of course am worried that she'll do harm to herself if she loses her children, as she is single and is at a job she hates and has been diagnosed for depression in the last year or so after her mum died.

      "description": "ok so a bit of back story real quick; me and my buddy lets call him \"Conner\" have known each other for 9 years and have been roommates for 4 years. last march we moved into a new apartment, closer to my job and his collage, and since it's a bit more expensive and we have an extra room now Conner asked if his friend who I've only met maybe twice before could move in with us. i didn't have a problem with this, the guy seemed cool the couple of times i'd seen him and they wen't to the same collage so it looked like a good deal all round. it wasn't.\n\nso moving day comes and me and Conner are already unpacking our things into our rooms when, let's call him josh, calls Conner asking when the truck was coming. we were a bit confused but sometimes miscommunications happen so Conner drove over and helped move his stuff. now the problems started when josh gets to the apartment drops his maybe 5 boxes in his room, starts looking around and complains about the colour of paint on the walls, there being no balcony, him not getting the biggest room etc. but the real problem was when he came into my room (the biggest room) takes one look at my iguana and has a conniption fit.\n\nmy iguanas name is Sir Gregory, he is 5 years old so as you can imagine he's pretty big. but conner had told josh not once, not twice, but five fucking times that there would be a giant lizard in the house, even sent a picture. this is also why i have the biggest room, because i needed the space for gregs tank. but josh apparently had never seen an iguana and wanted him gone, when we told him that greg is not going anywhere he started talking about how im crazy for keeping a \"crazy fucking gator\" and that greg would \"kill us in our sleep\". he did eventually calm down but never tried to warm up to greg. things were fine for the most part after that until we met joshes girlfriend, lets call her Britney because she is the living embodiment of a briteny. josh and britney would do one of 3 things whenever she was over, they'd a. have very loud arguments b. have very loud sex or c. just be really obnoxious in other ways. this isn't even mentioning the times josh would invite people over at 1am or would eat or take things that didn't belong to him, i will admit there were a few times i was a dick to him, didn't remind him of something, called his girlfriend a cunt, purposely didn't grab things at the store that he wanted, didn't drive him to his class on my day off after he woke up 2 hours late.\n\nbut my boiling point was when stole my car for a day to go to some concert. after the entire day of talking to the police, calling around and panicking on how i was going to get to work, josh walks in tosses me my car keys and tells me that the tank was empty. i'm not ashamed to say i lost my absolute shit. i told conner then and there that i wanted him gone as soon as physically possible. \"i don't care where he goes but i don't want him here!\" this of course led to a fight between me and josh, he called me a bitch, said he  how puts up with greg, said that since i didn't drive him that one time i owed him my car for awhile i have no right to be pissed\". conner told me that im over reacting and that \"it's just how he was brought up\" and \"he just doesn't understand and to put up with it\"\n\nis there something im genuinely missing?  like he didn't sell or destroy my car which is good but really?",

      "description": "I know , dumb. And I know, very common. 4 year relationship, we're both in our early 20's. Basically got dumped, badly. like he initiated sex and than immediately dumped kind of badly.  Absolutely humiliated. Got told right after I've been lied to about how close he'd been with a coworker. All the physical and emotional shock had been hard to process. He left me for who he cheated on me with 3 weeks later.\n\nHow he dumped me has messed me up more than the cheating itself, and I've had waves of angry texts swerved at him every few months. We'll talk it out, I end up apologizing more than him and started to blame myself for our relationship failing. This would happen in a cycle and i stopped. Months passed when I've become more self aware, and just got pissed that I myself take so much blame. I had a huge fight with him, walls and walls of text, accusing him for not being affected by this at all and not even feeling guilty. It felt cathartic, i'll admit it. I told him how much counselling I've had to go through, how it affected my work last year, how I hate everything is fine for him and I had to deal wit the consequences of his actions. I've been doing better in general, but for some reason I just show my worst to him.\n\nHe finally admitted to feeling guilty and regret for what he did, but he says to not talk to him again because I've been using \"emotionally manipulative words with malice and accusatory behavior\"  (intended to make him feel hurt and guilty, like, i guess so?). Fair. After finding out he has felt even a shred of remorse, even though i clawed it out of him, I feel a bit better and don't have the need to reach out again?\n\nI feel like an asshole because I've been constantly saying intentional hurtful things for one action that he did, which he seems like it wasn't his intention to hurt me this bad. I've also started to feel shit for being called emotionally manipulative. Am I really the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

One an individual belonging to the group camped right next to us had puppy that was tied up to a pole, unattended. It was really cute and wanted to interact with anyone that passed it by. As I passed it by I decided to pet it - I love dogs. All of the sudden the owner (a male in his late 20's) came running at me, yelling \"back away from my dog!\" I feared for a second that he might get physical. I immediately backed away and apologized. He then continued to berate me saying \"Is that dog your property!? Is that dog your property!?\" I apologetically said \"no, I'm sorry\" and reached out to shake his hand and said \"are we cool?\" He refused, so I walked off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I know that he definitely overreacted, but AITA for petting his puppy?

We fell out when I started going to a different school, and then got back into touch when we were both teenagers thanks to Facebook. We started talking every once in a while, and by that I mean commenting on each-other’s Facebook pictures, or statuses. Well, a couple of months ago, said friend announced she was engaged and was getting married the following month.. I received a Facebook invite to the wedding, but didn’t RSVP or say that I was attending. I didn’t see the need to go because, 1.) I really didn’t talk to her.. Sure we were friends at one point, but now we were Facebook friends at most. 2.) I did not know her fiancé, had never met him, didn’t even know his name. And 3.) I just don’t do weddings. They make my anxiety flare up for some odd reason. I know it’s weird, and I can’t understand it. \n\nAnyway, the wedding comes and goes and the next thing I know I get a ranting Facebook message from my friend that says, “How dare you not show up to my wedding when I kindly invited you. Thanks for putting me out. You could’ve at least let me know you weren’t coming, or brought a gift. I was counting on you being here and went through time and effort for this.” I never responded to her message, and still haven’t. \n\nSo, I’m still sitting here a month after she sent me this message, still wondering if I did anything wrong.

The usual. \nMe (33F) and my husband (39M) \n\nSo I’m a SAHM for our 4 kids (11M) (9F) (5F) (4M)it was only 2  years ago  I was able to start staying with them full time when my husband got promoted. Even though we can afford for me to stay home we still do have to budget for our monthly expenses . This involved pretty much cutting out eating out entirely which left me cooking at home. \n\nI’d like to think I’ve taken this with stride and i have pretty much a set budget and a decent amount of key recipes that all my kids will eat with little fuss while staying in budget. I can prep lunches for my husband and our two oldests. All relatively easily. \n\nBut my husband recently went on a ‘journey’ with food. He’s been vegetarian for about a year which was fine because everyone else just got a little extra meat on their plate. \n\nHe’d been talking about going vegan for a while now and how everyone he follows online says it’s changed their liv s and how they’ve feel they’ve made a difference blah blah blah\n\nNow I’m supportive but I tell him I can’t do it. The three youngest barley touch the food I make now and the oldest are somehow even pickier . I can’t introduce a whole new menu for just him (the budget would be the same). Besides I’m inexperienced with vegan food. My “signature dish” is lasagna with beef and cheese up the wahoo’\n\nI tell him this and he blows up how I’m an asshole for not trying and I’m part of the problem blindly supporting the meat industry and what’s the point of him working so much so I can stay home if I can’t even do this for him\n\nI don’t want to waste a whole grocery trip on food the kids and I won’t like. But he’s not an unreasonable man who would demand something that he didn’t truly believe in so AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So I’ve been dating my boyfriend (Let’s call him Ryan) for 2 years almost. His brother’s girlfriend (let’s call her Michelle) I’ve never been close friends with. I’ve been kind to her in general these past year or so but I don’t know her personally at all and quite frankly never cared to. She’s been dating Ryan’s brother for three years. \n\nI’m at Ryan’s and his brother and Michelle are over. Ryan takes a call at one point and I’m left alone with Michelle in the living room. Out of nowhere she starts talking about Ryan. She starts saying he’s the most manipulative person she’s ever met and that he’s not a nice person. She goes on about how she thinks Ryan is lazy and how her boyfriend does so much more productive things than Ryan. At this point I’m just dumbfounded at how she thinks she even has a right to talk about my boyfriend like this when she always acts so nice to him? And especially since it’s her boyfriend’s brother.\n\nSo I tell him later on what she said because it’s evident he shouldn’t trust her if she hates him this much. He says he never really liked her much anyway (she’s quite narcissistic and genuinely rude to people I’ve noticed).\n\nLater on Ryan tells his brother just inquiring if he knew Michelle disliked him. His brother then confronts Michelle about it and she goes on a psychotic text rant at me threatening me that if I ever open my mouth again there will be an issue. She claims that she “can’t respect me and barely tolerates me” and also that since she’s known them longer than me that I’m “turning her friends against her” She also blocks me on all of social media. \n\nShe’s 25 years old and I’m only 20 (we’re both college graduates as are our boyfriends) it’s ridiculous she’s acting so goddamn immature. As I stated before, I care about my boyfriend and was never there to be her friend at all. \n\nWas I the asshole for telling my boyfriend not to trust her? Should I have just let it go and not said anything? ",

      "description": "Almost 4 years ago my best friend was a stay at home mom of 3 (1 girl 2 boys) when her ex-husband forced her and the children out of the marital house.  With little money and no place to go (her family lives too far for her to legally move the children away from dad) I let her and the children move in with me on a verbal agreement that we would split the mortgage costs once she got on her feet.   \n\nUnfortunately, between day care and basic living costs, she never made enough to give me much, if any, money.  For reference on average she hasn’t even made enough monthly to cover rent on a place big enough for the 4 of them (if she didn’t live with anyone)... but of course it’s too much for any kind of assistance.  Currently, she is unemployed again (she is interviewing), but she never finished college which is limiting her traditional income potential.  \n\nI want to tell her to figure something else out as I want my space back and I am just done with this arrangement.  At this point, while I don’t think she means harm, it has cost me a lot in simple wear and tear on my home.  Additionally, it ads stress to my home and puts my own son in uncomfortable situations.  The overall arrangement provides minimal benefits to me in any manner.  \n\nWith that in mind, however, I feel like I’m kicking her and 3 kids out into the street if I ask her to figure something else out.",

      "description": "A little bit of backstory: I had a small group of friends in high school (I was 16 at the time). They were always getting in fights with each other and I was always the one getting both sides of the story to resolve it. One day two of them were ganging up on me because a guy they both had a crush on had a crush on me although I had a boyfriend. My boyfriend (now husband) trusted me and didn’t mind that me and him jokingly flirted with each other. But my 2 friends thought my boyfriend was lying and too shy to bring it up. Which isn’t who my boyfriend is.\nI know, it’s all high school drama but I basically told the 2 to F off and I didn’t want to be their friend if they were gonna be over dramatic assholes. \n\n\nFlash forward to me being 20. That’s a distant memory and I reach out to them again. The guy mentioned beforehand isn’t in the picture anymore. So I reunite with the 3 of them that still hung out after they all graduated. I meet 2 of my friend’s boyfriends and 2 new people (so there were 8 of us in the group chat in total, including me.)\n\n\nIt went great for a while, and we would all hang out whenever we could, even if a couple of people from the group chat understandably couldn’t make it to the events. \n\n\nFlash forward to around the end of October 2018. I was working 10 hour days (7 am to 5:30 pm, Mon-Fri) at work to help prepare for our peak season, which was starting in a month. I wasn’t allowed to have my phone on me during work hours except for our two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute break. After work, understandably, I’d be extremely tired and felt more like watching YouTube or mindlessly scrolling through apps instead of putting effort into trying to hold a conversation with 7 people.\n\n\nOne night, I’m getting push notifications from the group chat where one of my friends (will be referred to as N(19)) is sending multiple messages, one after another, seemingly freaking out over something. Come to find out, they’re jokingly losing their shit because for the first time in their life, they went to a party and didn’t end up in a bathtub one way or the other. \n\n\nI jokingly said to them in the group chat to go back to where ever the party was at and put themself into a bathtub. That’s when N told our friend (will be referred to as Jak(20)) to come pick them up so they could get into bathtub. I was kinda confused but brushed it off as Jak living the closest to N and N not having a car. \n\n\nWeeeeell, come to find out the party in question was Jak’s birthday party. I was confused and said that I wasn’t aware that Jak had a birthday party that night (which had already ended) they said they invited me via the group chat and that they had been planning the party the night before and that morning. (Again, I’ve been too mentally/physically exhausted to chat with the group)\n\n\nI wasn’t mad at the time, I was confused and broken-hearted that my friends planned a birthday party, invited me, and then when I didn’t show up not reach out to me. Personally if I invited my friends to a birthday party and one of them didn’t show up, I’d shoot them a message asking if they’re coming/if they got the invite/if they were alright. But I didn’t get a single message or text or phone call. \n\n\nSo once I was able to gather myself, I calmly explained to the group that I was hurt that no one reached out to me to make sure I was coming or make sure I was okay. I told them I would be worried if I invited a friend over to hang out and they didn’t show signs of coming. What did they do in response to this? Nothing. Changed the subject. Barely even acknowledged what I had just sent them.\n\nSo without saying anything else, I immediately left the group chat and tried to distract myself so I wouldn’t cry. The only people I could really call my friends who I thought cared about me to me just proved that they didn’t. \n\n\nI have to give a few of them credit though, Jak texted me the day after I left the group chat and apologized that I didn’t see my invitation and offered to hang out when we both had some free time. But just between us, I don’t want to hang out with Jak alone. Jak is dating my then best friend (Will be referred to as Jas (20)) and the only time I hung out with Jak was when Jas was with us. (And one day Jak messaged me on Snapchat asking to see my tits. I didn’t know if he was joking or testing me or whatever, but I didn’t. I was engaged soon to be married at the time and he knew that. So I wasn’t gonna chance a 1-on-1 day with him) \n\n\nAlmost a full 24 hours after I left the group chat, N added me to the group chat again and said sorry, but I immediately left again. \n\n\nThis next part needs a little backstory as well: Everyone in the group chat lived in Indiana but Jas in the summer of 2018 had to move to Florida with their mom since they were financially reliant on their mom. (I don’t blame them, they’re autistic and can’t hold a job due to it. I have nothing against them being autistic, I’m just explaining why a 20 y/o is still financially relying on their mom). Every now and again Jas will fly up here by themselves to hang out with their friends. \n\n\nJas had messaged me on October 16th saying they were here in Indiana for a little bit. We made plans to hang out on the 27th and the party mentioned beforehand happened on the 22nd. The 27th came and went and I heard nothing from Jas. \n\nOn the 28th I texted Jas saying “Soooo... any reason why our plans to hang out yesterday were cancelled without a heads up? Not to be a bitch I'm jw” No response. 13 hours later they message me through Facebook messenger and asked how I was.\n\n\n*Buckle up, children*\nI asked them if they got my text and they said their phone had been dead for the past couple of days because their charger stopped working. Then apologized for the party saying that it was mentioned a few times and on the day of. \n\n\nI sent them a whole wall of text saying stuff like “I’m pissed because during the entire party no one reached out to me once” and “You know you’re the only person in the group who I think actually cares about me so no one trying to contact me proves my point that no one in the chat cares” and “You can’t convince me after that happened that any of you care” and lastly “I’m almost never in the group chat and when I am it’s only for 10 minutes at most”\n\n\nJas brought up that Jak texted me and N added me back to the group chat and that I ignored both of them. I acknowledge that yes, those 2 things happened and my reasons that I ignored them (stated in this story beforehand). So Jas then claimed that people tried reaching out to me and that I was pushing all of them away. \n\n\nAnd I asked Jas AGAIN why no one tried to contact me while the party was happening if the people at the party claimed to like me. That’s when Jas told me that the party lasted an hour and it was all of them sitting around a fire just hanging out. \n\n\nIn response to that I still said it was still a planned event that I obviously wasn’t aware of and I wasn’t important enough to them to be reached out to and that all my supposed ‘friends’ were hanging out without me. \n\n\nJas had been in Indy for 12 days now and I brought up to him in that same message that I hadn’t seen him once. To which he responded with “dude if you wanna fuckin hang out message me i messaged you when I got here” \n\n\nI responded with “You guys made plans to see each other and then when I didn’t show up y’all didn’t do anything and we made plans to hang out the 27th and that day came and went and I didn’t hear a single thing from you.” \n\nSurprise, Jas had forgotten we had made plans, but just so happened to message me the day after we had plans... hmmmm... \n\n\nJas said “We did????” and brought up the fact their phone was dead again or else they would have messaged me so I send them a screenshot of our plans we made and asked them how I was suppose to know his phone was dead. \n\n\nJas then tried turning the conversation around after that asking if I wanted to hang out that night or the next day and I made up some bs excuse to say no. To which Jas responded with “ok. lemme know. sorry ive been garbage and the whole chat thing is a huge mess and it’s a lot.” \n\n\n\nAfter all of that, I stopped replying to them and I haven’t heard anything from any of them since. I feel like an asshole for getting angry and shoving everyone away, but I also feel like my anger was justified. Everyone in the group chat knew that I’ve been overworking myself and it’s been effecting my mental health (anxiety &amp; depression). Personally, no matter what the length of the party, you’d think the thing actual friends would do is reach out to you while it’s going on and make sure you’re okay, especially if apparently you care about the person who didn’t show up and know their mental illnesses were acting up.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: My friends had a small party that I wasn’t aware of without me, didn’t bother reaching out when I didn’t come, and I got mad and cut ties with them only to later have a small fight with one over text.

      "description": "When someone doesn't live in the same city as I do, to the point where I can regularly spend time with them in person, I mostly stop hanging out with them and interacting with them over digital messaging platforms.   \n\n\nI've had a few friends call me out on this, saying that I don't respond to their messages and text back and that I'm a shitty friend. When they say this I usually just apologize and tell them that I'm pretty overloaded with stuff and replying takes a lot of mental effort for me. I tell them that I care about them, and if they really needed something I'd be there for them, but that I don't want to spend time messaging online and that it doesn't really work with how my brain focuses.  \n\n\nI don't work well with this idea of being in constant contact with people. I don't like using messaging apps for anything other than planing to meet up with someone in person. I don't have a lot of patience for small talk. I don't find it meaningful or fulfilling. My job involves either constantly interacting with people, managing conversations, and building/maintaining relationships or it involves deep, intellectual, isolating work,  neither of which make it easy to catch up with people on background during the work, and by the end of the day I'm pretty spent socially. I tend to work all my waking hours, and when I'm not working I'm spending time with people in the city.   \n\n\nI have a good, strong set of friends and I make friends easily with new people. People generally think I'm a pretty nice, kind person.  \n\n\nIt's bothered me for a while that I've gotten this feedback from other people. Is it fair for them to ask for this from me? I understand they want more from me, but shouldn't it be okay that I simply can't give them that and that it's not what I want for myself? Am I doing them wrong by letting this happen? ",

      "description": "or starters, I'm a male in his mid twenties and until today I was engaged to a woman also in her mid twenties. \n \nWe have been through a lot but lately she has been belittling me and not handling her expectations. Back during Christmas she left me while we visited my dad's side of my family. A week later we made up and she announced our engagement. She had been feeling unwell and we found out she was pregnant. I'm nervous and unsure about wanting to be a father buy I've told her I will support her. I've been struggling with depression a lot, I think as a result of her leaving me back in December and my medication no longer working for me. I've started hanging put with friends 4 times a week because seeing my fiancee stresses me out. \n\nLately I have not been able to care about us as much as I want to. She's repeatedly bossed me around and told me that I should sleep early or eat better because it will help me. She has tried repeatedly to make me see my psychiatrist, but I'm busy. She struggles from depression and she functions differently. I just wish to be alone right now, so I traveled out to see my mom and I've been staying at her place for a week. Last night my fiancee called to say she felt very depressed and she was afraid she would hurt herself. I was angry and told my mom how I felt. She said that my fiancee was being selfish and needed to back off because she was trying to manipulate me. I decided to call her and see what was wrong. She pretty much told me that she was very depressed and needed me to come back home. I told her I needed to think about it some more. \n\nThis morning she texted me and told me that I needed me to come home and start doing things to fix our relationship or she would leave. I told her she was being selfish and she was only pushing me farther away. About an hour later she called me and I  was ignoring her because I was out getting dinner with my mom. She called my mom thirty minutes later and I told my mom to ignore her too. Eventually she messaged my mom and asked her to tell me to please give her a call. My mom was mad at my fiancee and she told her I needed some time to be alone and I would come home when I was stronger and such.\n\n My mom also told her that she was making this all about herself and being selfish because I have a right to spend time away from her if I need it. Because my mom has been supportive of me seeking time away from my fiancee, my fiancee accused her of \"setting me up to fail\". When I lived with my mother I had a history of sleeping in during the day and going out at night. My mother was the same, it is how I was raised and I trust her because she also suffers from depression. I know my mother would never do that and she was outraged that my fiancee would accuse her of being a poor parent. She told my fiancee to fuck off and that she would make a terrible mother to our child. I was also outraged that my fiancee would accuse my mother of being a bad mother. I've decided that I will ignore her for the time being. I'm very depressed and I do not want to talk to her or even think about her. Tonight I'm spending the night watching a movie with my mom. My mom has agreed that it is for the best if we block her for tonight at least and put away our phones. \n\nTLDR: My fiancee wants me to go home while I'm visiting my mom. My mom thinks my fiancee is being a selfish and manipulative person. I've decided to ignore her for the time being. ",

      "description": " So I am a bit steamed right now. I belong to a cloth pad/diaper anti-scammer group on the book of faces. I log in today to see a post marked with just a name and continued number four. So I look through the comment section to see wtf is going on. Turns out the first post is the seller herself making a post after being alerted to drama on another group about the issue in question and trying to let people know what was going on and to set the record strait. There were about 17 comments on that post. Shortly after that, another post with the users FB profile was posted and the bashing began. They started 3 different posts about this and each one had over 300 comments. Some were actually the seller trying to explain what happened and be an adult about the situation in general. I was kind of ticked off about it because I strongly dislike bullying of any sort. Then they started demanding things like the seller post screenshots of their PayPal and bank accounts to prove that they were in the negative. WTF. I couldn't hold my tongue anymore and made a few comments saying that the seller was being harassed and bullied. I also said that if they were so keen on seeing other people's banking information that they should post theirs as well. That shut a few of the main instigators up, but then I had people insulting me and bringing my vagina into this whole conversation as well. One of the big rules of the group is \"no reporting to anyone outside of the group\".  I did not comply. After another hundred or so comments came in, I hit the report button on all three of the bashing posts for bullying and harassment. I'm not sorry, but am I the asshole?",

      "description": "o there is a local dj duo who are in my town. They seem like cool people and their music is alright. Theyre best friends and are well known in my area for djing. I am friends with one of the DJs (B) and he asks me to go to his shows regularly.\n\nThe issue is I used to be involved with the other DJ's little brother (M). M kept flirting with me and sending me nudes while he had a girlfriend who he never posted about on social media and never told me about.\n\nThere was no way I wouldve known about her. I sell snapchat nudes from time to time and put M on the subscription list. (I keep my face and identifying features out of the shots). I also asked M if he was single he said yes. When I found out he wasnt i. Confronted him over it. He said since I was sending him nudes I was sexually harassing him and he never cheated on his girlfriend. M always responded to the nudes with a sexual response. Never said no and paid. I know im gross and scumy for that. M is the brother of one of the Djs and friends with the other dj.\n\nI asked people who knew him for info on his girlfriend and one of them told her. She said it was a problem with him in the past and they like the Dj group but dislike his brother. He's well known to use the semi-success to brag about it. He blocked me from everything I was immature a sent him a message saying someone told his girlfriend and to be more respectful to women. He responded by saying if I showed my face to any local events he'd beat the shit out of me (im a girl btw), and he'd ruin my name in the scene since his brother is big in the scene.\n\nNow M is known for being trashy. B is a cool guy and really wants to see me at his shows. B knows I sell snapchat stuff. I want to tell B what happened. I suspect B already knows M cheats on his girlfriend and is trashy. But I feel like id be causeing too much drama by bringing this up. This is honestly the 4th time in a month ive had to out a cheater and I'm tired of the drama and shitty people. Im thinking about lying and telling him im busy or maybe just telling him the truth. Which is I dont want to go because your bandmates brother threatened to beat me up and I think their crew is trashy. I feel like if I told him the truth I would just cause more drama for him while he's going through a rough time.\n",

      "description": "I recently moved in with my boyfriend (after dating about a year). The problem is that he has two large labs that sleep in his bed every night. Now, I like dogs. But I probably don’t qualify as a dog person by Reddit standards. Anyway, sharing a bed with them is too much for me. The hair, drool, etc is just not want I want in my bed. \n\nAnyway, my boyfriend apparently thought I would get past this when I actually moved in. He was wrong. Right now the dogs are out of the bed but I know he has them in there when I’m not home (I travel for work frequently) and I can tell he’s trying to ease them back in permanently. (I now have to kick them out every night because he doesn’t do it). My boyfriend will then try to rationalize and say he’ll keep them “on his side”, like that’s going to work. \n\nI really love my boyfriend and I get that relationships mean compromise. I don’t mind if the dogs are in the room but that is as close as I want to be.  \n\nIs it so awful to want a bed that’s animal-free? I’m starting to feel like Cruella or something. ",

MP keeps telling me they love me which of course usually im happy to say back and have shown my love and affection for them a lot and for a long time, showing patience and understanding when they may be going through something too, as one should. We don't live close to each other, so a lot of our conversations are over text. MP texted me and kept being lovey dovey and saying I love you, the usual stuff, (she knew I was in the blues at this point), but then I told them, \"don't feel bad about it, but i don't really want to say it back right now\", because my mind was not in that mental state to just say it because I was thinking about other things. Ofc I could have just said it back for the sake of it but I didn't want to, because then it's meaningless to me. They just replied with \"ok\" so I said \"I'm sorry\". They're clearly pissed and haven't messaged me since.

Last night I was feeling hurt about something that happened and needed to talk with him about it. His mom drove him to my house this morning so he could drop something off to me. I wanted to talk to him about last night, but my roommate and her boyfriend were sitting in the kitchen and my other roommate was sitting on the couch right by the front door (we have a really small apartment so you can hear everything that's happening inside. I asked him if we could step out onto the balcony so we could talk and he said yes. I basically told him about how I was feeling last night and that I wasn't super happy with the way things were going, but that I wanted to work on it together. He left and continued the conversation over text. It was tense, but civil, until he scolded me for having the discussion with him on the balcony because it made him feel \"like a dog\". I keep asking him how I could have done it differently, because in the past he's been upset with me for not voicing when I'm not happy with something he does (which is totally understandable and I'm working on it). My question is, did I treat my boyfriend unfairly? Was there a better way I could have handled the situation? Was it wrong of me to talk to him about it on my balcony? I just want to make sure I avoid this situation in the future. Thanks!",

Over the past year I’ve been having a relationship with a girl we will call her g for short, has issues with substance abuse. Both legal and illegal. The illegal being opioids.\nI have been going through the same issues.\nI would like to say I’m doing well, stopped almost all opioid use except for last weekend I relapsed and took a anti anxiety medication for the purpose of getting high. I’m sure we can all guess which one. So to the point. G and I went out on a date that went terribly. It involved both of us using aforementioned opioid and G drinking but me smoking weed. At the end of the night I was out $300 for an Uber ride, dinner, and games at Dave and Busters. This isn’t a problem, I planned on paying for everything just to\nClarify. This morning I wake up to 23 missed calls and her asking for her money back for the opioids I took because of how I treated her last night. The argument last night was over not letting her drive her car and having to leave it an hour away due to us being ducked up. So here’s how I’m the asshole, I walk to her house, crumpled up 6 20, because that’s what she said I owed her, and threw them at her feet on her front lawn and broke up with her. So yea really the question is how much of\nAm asshole am I? Let me add that I know leaving your car far away from home and having to pay for a ride there the next day sucks, but IMO that’s better than killing someone on a long drive home. Sorry if this was too long winded \nTL/DR threw money I owed and broke up with her after treating her well for a long time and ending it in a real immature way ",

      "description": "So my girlfriends birthday is today. We are both at work, but texting back and forth. She hints to me over text that she wants me to come pick her up and take her out to dinner tonight. I then tried to figure timing since we currently are an hour apart (she stays at my place on weekends and her place during the week since it’s closer to her work) and tell her I’ll figure something out. She’s says it’s okay, we don’t have to go out because she knows it’s stressful for me and just appreciated the thought. I responded with okay because I really didn’t want to do it and I would just take her out on the weekend like I had originally planned. \n\nFor some context, I work 60 hours a week, 6 days a week. My only day off is Sunday. She wouldn’t get off work until 6:30pm and I would likely meet her at 7:30. She doesn’t have a car so I’d be the one driving to her place, to dinner, back to her place, and then back to mine. I wouldn’t expect to be home until 11pm at the earliest. I have to be up at 5:30am tomorrow. We’ve been dating for 5 years and I haven’t missed celebrating any birthday/anniversary at this point. Not celebrating on the exact day is also pretty common for us since we are both rather busy.\n\nI don’t plan on saying anything to her directly about it, but I was curious for my own thoughts if I am the asshole in this situation for not wanting to do it. If she really wanted me to take her out I would, but it really is a big inconvenience for me so I was relieved when she said we don’t have to. Am I the asshole for not wanting to take her out or being relieved because she we don’t have to?",

The way this works is each month tenants get sent a slip to take to the post office, pay the rent in cash, and then hand the blank slip back to the university. Because of this, my friend who already moved back to his home country got away with not paying rent for half the year.\n\nI thought this was just plain dumb. The thing is, I can afford to pay the last month's worth of rent, but having such a big loophole makes me want to just save myself the money. My friend on the other hand didn't pay because he didn't have cash and the university wouldn't accept credit or bank transfers. \n\nOn the payment due date I just walked into the office, handed in the blank slip, and when they assumed I had paid I just walked out. I feel morally conflicted as technically I cheated them, but at the same time it's difficult to feel bad for making a public university lose a sum of pocket change. If my dorm was privately owned or something, I don't think I would have felt the same. If anything I kind of want to blame the university for having such dodgy management in the first place. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n",

I said that that was racist, and they said it wasn't because you \"can't help who you're attracted to\". \n\nThen I reminded them that he said he had no problem with sexual attraction towards us, he just wouldn't DATE us because we are what he sees as \"low status\". \n\nThey didn't say anything after that and just changed the subject.\n\nThe two girls I was with said that it was racist too, but that I shouldn't let it ruin my night.\n\nAm I wrong for saying they are racist? I understand that attraction is attraction and that you can't control it, but to be attracted to someone, to like their personality, and to turn them down because you perceive their RACE as low status is both classist and racist.",

      "description": "I’m housesitting for my parents for a few months, so I thought I’d do them a favour and clean and reorganise the pantry. Their pantry is huge and overflowing - you can’t find anything, so mum will buy double-ups of everything because she doesn’t realise she already it. \n\nThere was stuff in there from 2003. There was rotten dried fruit, rock-hard marshmallows, and 7 open bags of fruit cake mix (my mum doesn’t even bake anymore!). There were loose gummy lollies that were unrecognisable. There were 11 bags of open rice.\n\nI only cleaned out stuff that was well past expiration and unusable, which was about 1/3 of the pantry. There’s still enough food in there to last them at least 6 months! But mum acted like I’d killed her cat. She was SO upset that I’d thrown out “perfectly good food”. I think maybe she’s embarrassed that the cupboard was out of control. But I did it as a nice surprise for her to come home to - not to imply she’s a bad housekeeper. \n\nAs a side note, I’m on good terms with my parents, we’ve never argued. They also told me REPEATEDLY that I could eat/use whatever I wanted while I stayed, mum even offered to do a grocery shop for me before they left.\n\nSo AITA? \n\n",

      "title": "AITA For Thinking My MIL Is Insensitive About Possible Miscarriage?",
      "description": "Last fall, I suffered a miscarriage. It was a really low, depressing time right before the holidays for myself and my husband. We have one daughter who is healthy and amazing, but I have polycystic ovarian syndrome so pregnancy and fertility hasn't always been \"easy\" for me.\n\nAfter the miscarriage, which occurred between 7-8 weeks, my mother-in-law gave me one of those \"everything happens for a reason\" lines. It was annoying at best, ignorant and hurtful at worst. I've been part of my husband's family for 11 years, so I know not to go to her for empathy or validation in just about anything -- but that line pissed me off.\n\nThis year has been especially crappy for our family (job loss, lack of health insurance, and illness in the family) so we didn't begin trying to conceive again until recently. I have suffered from generalized anxiety since the birth of my daughter three years ago, and was very nervous I'd miscarry again.\n\nEarlier this week, my period was due. I began lightly bleeding a handful of days prior to it being due, which made me nervous. Early periods + PCOS usually don't mean anything good (in my experience). But I had a feeling I might be pregnant, even though it's insanely early -- I just know my body. I took a handful of pregnancy tests that all came out positive (this was Monday). I called my doctor because I knew I'd been bleeding and was panicked I was having a chemical pregnancy. I felt triggered, scared, stressed, and emotional.\n\nI had my hcg levels tested on Monday (again, this would have been the day my period was due - very early on if pregnant). They were low. The nurse who delivered the results said she thought it very well was a chemical pregnancy. Naturally, I was devastated - sure, it's early, but it's still a heartbreak. It took me so long to feel ready again, and my worst fears were happening once more. It's a lot. My husband told his mom what was going on (I really wish he didn't, but I never told him not to and... well, it's too late now). \n\nShe had the same \"oh it's so early, thank god it happened now and not later\" reaction. I tried to ignore it because that's just who she is, and I was too emotional to give her the reaction and confrontation I wanted to. (Side note: my best friend's dad passed away tragically over the weekend and I've been trying to be a support to her all week, so my emotions are not at all stable).\n\nFast forward to yesterday morning, TWO DAYS after finding out I'm likely having a chemical pregnancy again, and she texts me and asks me if she could borrow our old pack 'n play for her husband's grandson (whom she's never met and doesn't give a shit about, but is visiting for the holidays). She said \"since it's just sitting in the garage\" she didn't think I'd mind doing it. \n\nLady, do you REALLY think I want to be rifling through all our old baby stuff RIGHT FUCKING NOW? I told my husband he needed to respond to her because I was gonna lose it. \n\nHe did, he handled it really well. Called her out for being insensitive, etc. She got pissed off and stopped talking to him and hasn't apologized to either of us. \n\nAm I being an asshole here for feeling so upset? How do I handle seeing her for Christmas? I can't NOT address this, but I don't know how to do it in a way that gets through to them and doesn't make me look like a jerk. \n\n(Additional note, upon further bloodwork it appears my hcg levels ARE rising a decent amount, but we won't have confirmation on anything for another week or more - so, still very stressed out and emotional.)",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I met a year and a half ago through a dating app and at he time she joked that I had just made the cutoff in regards to what she is looking for in height since she set 6’0” as her minimum and I happen to be 6’1”. She also happens to be fairly tall (5’10”). \n\nSince we have been dating she would periodically say how she wishes that the height difference between us was larger because she feels that because of her height and stature that she doesn’t feel womanly enough when standing next to me. She does has self esteem issues that relate to how she thinks she is perceived because of her height/weight. I always tell her how much I love her and how beautiful she is which is absolutely true in my eyes.\n\nFlash forward to last night where we are hanging out at a bar and she is sitting down and I am standing up next to her. The stool she is sitting on is fairly low so her head is probably about 5’5”-ish from the floor. She jokes that she wishes that she was that y’all compared to me. I then proceed to ask her the hypothetical question of “If I were to magically become 5’5” tomorrow would you still date me?”. She responds with “I don’t think it would work out.”\n\nI got a bit upset since I thought that at this point in the relationship that regardless of the fact that we now live together and I treat her with kindness and love that it isn’t enough if I were to suddenly become shorter (in this hypothetical line of questioning). I know that she has issues on her self esteem but I always try to make her feel better and make her feel like the beautiful woman she is. She said that if I were to be shorter that she would feel “like a big gargantuan person and not feel like the woman in the relationship”. \n\nI think her answer also hurt me because I took it as “in the end of the day no matter if I give her the most amount of love or care in the world my height will always be the underlying factor of what keeps the relationship afloat”. I also have some self esteem issues where I wonder if I am good enough for anyone. Since me started dating I’ve been so happy knowing that someone actually does care for me but now it stings knowing that my height is a fairly large contributor to that. \n\nWe went to bed that night where she could tell that I was a bit upset over the situation and as a result was making her a bit emotional about the situation. I hate seeing her sad in any way but I too was feeling sad about it. I ended the night by saying “Well hopefully you don’t meet anyone taller than me because I may be replaced”.\n\nAITA for being a upset that my girlfriend holds my height above everything else about me as a critical trait to our relationship?",

      "description": "About a month ago there was this event where we got to meet people from different parts of the country. After the event I got a message on a messaging app from a girl from the convention. I ignored it because i didn't really want more people to chat to. About a day goes by and i thought of talking to the girl.\n\nSo after like, 2 days of talking it seemed like she liked me, but i never really got to notice her back at the convention, but she noticed me a lot and thought I was cute, which is why she messaged me in the first place. \n\nSome time later she asked if it was okay if she liked me. Since i didnt have an SO i said sure, then we started flirting and sending lovey dovey messages and stuff to each other.\n\nWe got to know some things about ourselves. She's an extrovert, going to parties, events, and basically anything where people go to. I'm  mainly an introvert, kinda boring at times but also kind of weird.\n\nAfter like 2 weeks her attraction towards me seems to be going away, but i didnt mind because usually in relationships there were just ups and downs, and i thought this was just one of the down parts in a relationship.\n\nI asked to meet up, she said sure and we planned to meet in a mall nearby. I waited for hours and realized she couldnt go because she had practice for a dance competition and a shooting for a movie project. I was really bummed out about it but I just accepted it since I didnt want to distrupt her schedule.\n\nWeeks passed and we havent even seen each other yet. She stopped calling me any lovey dovey names and I gradually stopped too. In my mind I thought this could work out despite what happened but what really hit the nail in the coffin is when she said that i was too boring and i should have more friends in my life. \n\nI felt kinda depressed but i just said \"yeah i know\" and thats pretty much it. We barely talked anymore and never reacted or replied except for a few \"haha\"s and \"ok\"s anymore.\n\nI didnt get to chat her for a whole day because I had a party, and after a party, i didnt really want to chat her anymore.\n\n\nShould i have told her something before i went away? I feel like i ghosted her and i feel really bad. I do still have some emotions and feelings for her and feel really sad that i dont know how to become better\n\nOne thing i like her about though is that she has a really liberal lifestyle where she could go out and party and hang out with friends whenever she wanted. i kinda also wanted to be with her to know how that would feel like since i'm just an introvert.",

Her eldest decided to remain with me, while her son recently decided to move in with her. The issue I have is she has spent the past year and a half living however she wants, I usually have had the kids. We have joint custody, and things are supposed to be 50/50, but it hasn't worked out like that. After she was caught doing what she did, she rarely saw the children and typically didn't pick them up on her days for a little over a year. Recently she has started to want to see the kids that are with me more, so she does pick them up on her days for a few hours, and then drops them back off. I honestly encourage her picking up the kids and try to help her out on those days as much as possible by being flexible. Now she has begun asking to pick up our shared daughters on some my days and I refuse. She says I am trying to keep them from her but I just want them to have a bit of structure in their lives. I also get told I don't allow the children to see her, but I just don't see it that way. I honestly enjoy my days with our shared daughters, we've built up a routine. I just don't feel I should have to give up my time at all, and I'm getting a lot of anger and guilt both from their Mother as well as her family. Am I being an asshole?",

      "description": "AITA for being annoyed at my boyfriend for not taking better care of me when I’m sick. So I’ve been sick for two days and still not feeling better. I really didn’t want much, just something to eat although it did require a trip to the grocery store. If I could, I would have gone to the store myself but it’s snowing outside and I feel terrible with a severe head cold. He got home from work at 7:30pm and I brought it up around 8pm. He had to workout before he left for the store and I’m really not sure what else he was doing around the house but it’s now 12:10am and he just walked in the door from going to the store. He asked why I wasnt asleep and I said it was because I was starving. He responded “that’s not a very nice way to say you’re hungry, I just went to the store for you in the snow”. Am I the asshole for being annoyed that it took him so long to get me something to eat when I’m sick? Maybe I’m just hangry... ",

My mother-in-law flew in from out of the country specifically to help us out with the newborn. Mother in law has more than pulled her weight; she cleans the house, she’ll make us food, helps with feeding the baby, changing diapers, etc. My wife’s duties are to feed the baby and change his diaper. The baby cries every two to three hours, so if she pumps, she can sleep a couple of hours while grandma and I supervise/feed the baby (mother in law has volunteered this idea). But my wife refuses to nap at all in the morning and afternoon. When he cries at night i’ll get up and just stand there while she and her mother change our boy’s diaper. Sometimes i’ll help out at night, but honestly it just seems like they've got all the bases covered already. I don’t generally sleep nights either, as i work the graveyard shift half the week. I do help feed the baby, bathe him, rock him to sleep and change diapers during the day. She makes me feel like an asshole if i manage to sleep at night and idk if she’s right or if she’s being a jerk because she’s sleep deprived.",

But there were many times when I (the DM) would prepare a whole session, read stuff on the internet to  create the one shot, and overall take a few hours preparing it. And then the player whose house we played in would cancel the day before.   \nSo I decided to ask them to actually confirm if their house would be available for it at least five days before. And when the day came, I asked him through the group chat we have and he saw my message, but didn't answer. Then, the next day, I asked the same thing to him and he did the same thing. Finally, two days before the day of the game, I sent the same message about four times, because if the game was going to happen, I needed to know. He proceeded to not answer, so I told him to quit the silence and at least say something, because he was being an asshole. He then proceeded to get very mad and quit the game as a whole. The rest of the party then also got mad at me for spamming him, and left the game to start a new one without me. AITA?",

When she left I inherited the car from her but its technically our car. My mom is at home and my Dad is retired so that means we have an extra 2 cars she could drive that I'm not comfortable driving. \nShe told me she needed to run some errands today and asked if she could specifically use our car, she is a much better driver than me and is capable in driving the other 2 cars. So I told her that she could use the car in the morning but when I need to leave for school I need the car, she offered to drop me off but that takes away my ability to chose when I leave school, and I normally like to stay after and talk with friends. So basically I ended up telling her that she could use my Moms car (which is far nicer than our car) and she ended up grudgingly taking my offer, but declaring she gets the car for any other times she comes back.

Us drivers make wages by delivery fee commissions and tips alone. It's really not a lot, min wage (8 some) where I am is low compared to cost of living, this is my second job. I make $5 out of 7.99 with the minimum delivery fee. We have a time frame of 10-15 to deliver but most of the time it's always sooner. If something is wrong with an order we are more than willing to go back to the pickup place. We do not touch your order by any means. This one customer lives close by to most of the restaurants we do so his fee is the minimum every time. He always places big orders and is on the 3rd floor with no elevator access. All customers are aware they can tip when placing an order online and such it's an option before you check out. I really want to know if I'd be an asshole if I made a comment next time I deliver just so he could think about tipping.

I am from a third world country and I speak four languages very fluently, one of them being English, even if it is not my native language. \n\nI was initially hired to work with my native market, but they soon found out that they just didn't have enough work for me, so they asked me to work on the Spanish, English and French markets since I have a near-native level on those languages. I accepted to do so and always did a good a job on whatever tasks they asked of me. \n\nHowever, they don't want their clients to know that I'm not English/French/Spanish because that would go against company policy and whet they sell to the said clients (i.e. native consultants). So they make me sign all my emails using my English/French/Spanish colleagues names, and those colleagues take all credit for my achievements. In the eyes of clients and most people in the company, I don't exist and I only act as an assistant to those guys, even if I'm a lot more qualified, if I work much harder and if I obtain much better results.\n\nJust now my boss told me that I will have to attend a meeting but that I can't let the client know that I'm not English. So she suggested that I walk into the room and tell them my name is 'Mary', from Wales, and that I am an intern and assistant to my English colleague from the UK. I refused to lie about my name, race and nationality and explained to my boss that at age 28, with a master's degree and 8 years of experience, I don't feel like having people walk all over me just because I am the wrong race, origin and nationality. She gave me a murderous look, reminded me that it's company policy and tried to guilt-trip me into thinking that I should be grateful that I get to ghost-work with my colleagues on this stuff, because I normally wouldn't be allowed to.\n\nIn short, AITA for standing my ground and reminding her that speaking a language and learning to do a certain job has nothing to do with race or origin, or am I just overlooking company policy and acting like an ungrateful brat?",

      "description": "This is going to be long. TLDR at the bottom, apologies cause I’m on mobile. \n\nSome background before I get started. I work long hours, around 7:30 to 6, 4 days a week, then a half shift on Saturday. There is only one other girl who works the job I do and works close to the same hours. I’ll also say this is the daughter of the guy who owns the business I work at. We’ve tried hiring other people, but the boss never seems to put it on his priority list. At times, there are days where only one of us is working during a really busy time, with no help and no relief for lunch. It’s shit pay, no benefits, and you see why I’m trying to get out. I work at a vet, if that makes any difference, and we are consistently very busy between the hours of 3 to close.  \n\nI recently decided to return to school after quitting young, and started looking around at my options in my interests, one of them being cosmetology. I found night classes at a local school that lasted from 5:30pm to 10pm from Monday to Thursday. This school is strict, and one minute late would be a write up, and three late days will result in expulsion. With this being an obvious conflict with work, I went to my coworker first, and she said she was fine with it as long as she got to leave early at the same time on days I didn’t go to school. Then I went to my boss. I had a long discussion with him before I committed to anything, as I feel it’s respectful to ask instead of saying “hey by the way, gotta go bye!” In the end, he agreed to let me go a little over an hour early in order for me to chase my dreams, with the condition that I stay long enough after I finish schooling to train someone to take my place. \n\nAll is good right? Not at all. \n\nThe week I started going my boss started throwing major shade. I’m always alone on Wednesday’s, and on this day we were ridiculously busy. He told me during lunch a certain coworker would come and relieve me at a set time so I could leave for school. He then proceeds to stick that person in a room with a client for FIVE hours after lunch. Ten minutes after I’m supposed to leave, he tells me how inconvenient it is, how I told him I could leave at 5:30 instead of 4:45 as we discussed. At 5, he finally released the girl from the room, and I was late to school. \n\nSince then his comments have only been in passing. However his daughter has been relentless. Constant comments about how I always get to leave early, how she has plans that she’s missing because of me, she’s always talking about how she wants to hire someone else but never does and drives people who want to apply away. Recently we were discussing how we need help for the summer because she wanted to take FOUR full weeks off, leaving me with no help, and vet techs to do reception when I leave on the days I have school. She told me she didn’t want to work a ton over summer and miss her vacations because I had to leave early all the time. \n\nI understand this, and I get it’s unfair that I leave all the time. But I asked permission from both of them on multiple occasions before I did this. They both agreed to this. And it’s not like I leave and do nothing, I am in school and learning until 10 every night, get home at 10:30, go to bed by midnight after I get all my house stuff done, and then I’m back up at 6 to do it all again. I’m tired all the time. I don’t get a vacation. I’ve never even taken a vacation in my three years of working at this place because both my husband and I don’t make enough for us to take week long vacations and us be ok financially. \n\nI’ll also note that this girl is also one who will go to the back and take naps, or go to clients houses and take naps for 4-6 hours out of the work day. She still gets paid for this time as she’s the boss’ daughter, and she does this shit all the time. She’ll leave at 2 on Fridays to go nap, or to go bang her boyfriend. Sometimes she goes to CrossFit, but will take a four hour nap before she goes. Or she’ll go out with friends and get back just in time for me to have 5 minutes to eat. \n\nI’m done with my whining, but AITA for going to school while still working full time? AITA for leaving an hour early, even though my boss and coworker has stated several times that it was ok by them? I feel like such an ass and such a burden when we’re extremely busy and I have to leave, so am I? \n\nTL;DR: My coworkers/boss resent me for leaving early to go to school, though I asked them in advance if this was ok before even enrolling for night classes. AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA for being frustrated at being given a job I didnt apply for?",
      "description": "Sorry for the VERY long read. But i feel like i need to say everything and get it off my chest. Im not going to sugarcoat anything but instead present everything about myself in the most negative way possible to try and present a non biased review.\n\nThis has been bothering me for months and has tbh has been making me quite toxic cause i got some very mild ptsd from this.\n\n\nBtw this is the second time im posting about this. I need to add some more details to clear several things up.\n\nBack in October of last year I got a job at a local farm that was hosting a fall festival. \nWhen I applied I was listed all the jobs I would be working at and was asked which ones I would like to work at. Out of all 12 I only excluded 2, leaving 10 I was eager to work at.\nWhen the Festival came around for the first few days I was given a VERY brief explanation of how things worked. Very brief as in a minute or so. \nThe first week I worked went by ok. I got to know the other employees and they were nice. I was introduced to all the jobs and attractions. As i had never worked there before I tried my best and imo learned quickly how to work everything from the corn cannon to the field trips.\n\nBut starting second week the owner, a farmer asked me to work a job that was not on the list: planting garlic. \nWhen I applied the listed jobs did not include planting of any sort. When I was at the interview i was not informed of any planting to be done. Only the jobs on the list, none of which involved planting any crops.\n\nNow this was his first time planting large quantities of it. I thought that it was fine cause I still had all the other jobs i was promised in the application to do. I actually was pleased because it let me be by myself for awhile and I have done it before.\n\nBut as the 3rd week came by I was relieved of all other jobs and given only this job; planting garlic, which again wasn't on the application.\n\n\nThat is what ticked me off.\n\n\nI had applied to jobs that I was perfectly fine with working 7 hours a day at. But planting garlic for 7 hours a day with just a few odd jobs here and there wasn't what I signed up for and for sure wasn't in my job description.\n\n\nTo make things worse i was planting it by hand and by hand I mean no tools whatsoever. The farmer gave me no tools to plant garlic other than, here's the kicker, a woodchip. It worked but a metal prong would have worked better.\n\nAfter seeing a few other people that did it for only an hour or two at a time I was the fasted planter there as I had experience planting it beforehand. \nI spent about 4-7 hours a day on my knees with no pads provided or anything planting garlic with a freaking woodchip. It was painful but at least the job was there and I did it well. The farmer even said so himself.\n\nI worked at that job but at the same time I asked about once per day when my knees felt like they were about to give out from kneeling for 4 hours straight if there were other jobs that needed to be done at the moment. Every time I was denied them and told to go back to the field and when i wanted a break to merely stretch my legs for a minute was told to hurry back to the field and get back to work. I was frustrated but remained diligent in my work.\n\n\nComing to the 3rd week the farmer and his wife had changed the way they spoke to me. They became quite toxic. I asked them if something was wrong. Nope. Every time I was told i was doing everything well. But I wasn't happy. I applied to work the jobs I was told, not this laborious, painful job that i wasn't even provided tools for even though it still paid. \n\nOne instance was when I needed to get a powerade as my 2 water bottles were depleted. I went to the concession stand to buy an extremely overpriced Powerade. When I asked for it she snapped at me, asked why i'm getting it, and just snapped back telling me to hurry back.\n\nNow to what has been bothering me. \n\nWhen I was told that garlic was the only job they had for me do I started thinking about a few things. \n\nNo.1 was pay. I didn't know how much I was being paid. I was told in the application i was to be paid from $7.25 to $10. As the other jobs were very cushy except for 2 others that I was rarely asked to do but still did (pick up trash and carry pumpkins) i wanted the highest rate of pay. Planting garlic was the most difficult and painful job there. But because I needed the money I kept on working the best I could.\n\nI asked how much I was paid a couple of times but the farmer and his wife refused to tell me, no matter how polite I was. I wasn't given my paycheck until the 4th week which really made my And as I had no clue how much I was being paid for a job I hadn't even signed up for!\n\nAnd No.2 was why I wasn't working the promised jobs that I applied for. \n\nOne day I decided to ask those 2 questions as well as ask for a raise if I wasn't told how much. \n\nThe farmer's wife came to me and told me because of several reasons. I wasn't working fast enough and because i was complaining a lot. Because of those reasons i was refused the $10 an hour I asked for. \nI was the fastest worker there. She had other people come to help me but only for an hour or so. She had me teach them how to do it. I got a full row done before even the fastest other worker got 2/3rds done.\nI listened to what she said, kept quiet, came home after my shift was over, and full on blew my top off at what she said. I calmed down and though what might have ticked her off.\n\nThe following reasons came to mind that may have given her reason to say i complained a lot.\n\nDuring the 3rd week i was relieved of driving the Toro, a small work truck that was used to carry around pumpkins to the sale stand. I was told instead to use these dinky little wheelbarrows. A little frustrated I complied. Later that week his wife drove up to me while I was carrying a wheelbarrow out to the field to get some pumpkins and she complained that I was only carrying one. She told me to load them up to over the rim AND carry 2 at the same time...over a field...A PLOWED FIELD. But the way she just snapped at me when telling me that made a bit cautious. She even threatened to decrease my pay over that. \n\nI asked why I couldn't use the toro. The farmer said didn't like how i drove it. He said i drove it rough. Well what was I to do? I was at a farm with bumps everywhere. The following weeks I asked if I could use the Toro once in a while and was every time denied. The only other reasons were because there was one time I was told to stack some hay in the pumpkin patch and he later told me he didn't want it near the patch and the other there was a day when it started raining heavily and I had to drive it back to the stand with a load of produce. Apparently later on the farmer told me he didn't want me to use it in the rain but he didn't want to tell me and i stead just told me to not use it at all. \n\n\nIll agree there. I should have used it more responsibly but at least i would have appreciated some rules about it instead of being given a wheelbarrow and have the wife just lay on me some very unreasonable requests and threaten my pay over it. \n\nOther complaints from her and him include: \n\nTaking too many breaks. I was given 1 total hour lunch break per day that i could use how I wanted. I decided to split it into 2 15 minutes breaks and a 5 minute drink break. That was for a 6 hour shift. Apparently that was too much for her. Even though she gave me the time she didn't want to give me it in peace. She constantly asked me if I was on or off break. \n\nUsing the bathroom too much: The restroom was about 200 yards from where I was planting garlic and I used it for once an hour or two for about 5 minutes.Surely that isn't unreasonable.\n\nInterrupting her while she was with other people:\nShe had the field trips set up by the minute. While learning how to run them I asked her several times AFTER she was finished talking to other people. She apparently took this is interrupting her even though i paid special attention to ask her when she was done. \n\nNot working in unpleasant weather: I think this is self explanatory. I told her I didn't want to work in 40 degree weather in the pouring rain with my knees all caked in mud with no raincoat!\n\nI realise that I was working at a farm and not a grocery store but what made me complain there was that all the other jobs on the list had the employees working under canopies. Mine was the only one other than the hayride that was outdoors not under a cover.\n\nAnd the last reason and what for me is the most important to sort out was asking her once a day for other jobs that needed to be done. She said that i was complaining by asking her for other jobs that needed to be done. \n\nThese are their reasons for not increasing my pay regardless of the work actually being done and quickly at that.\n\n\nFor the next 2 weeks I shut up and worked quietly and still as quickly at planting garlic and didn't bother them at all.\n\nSo AITA for being frustrated at not being given the jobs I applied for?\nI really want to know as I hate being a pain to others and would like to feel better about this whole thing.\n\nIf anyone has some things I could have improved or done please let me know. i want to learn from my mistakes\n\n",

SO, I’ve been working at this customer service job for almost three years now. I started talking to this guy let’s call Joe, who I worked with. After a few months working there he and I started dating. We dated for about a year, and I had made it VERY clear that we were not exclusive. I had just gotten out of a very serious relationship of 5 years and honestly just wanted his company. We kept our relationship very secret and no one we worked with knew. After a year of dating he started wanting more and I was honest and told him that I didn’t want to settle down and that it would be better if we weren’t anything more than friends. He had found out that I went on a few other dates while talking to him and started telling his best friend (which we will name Samantha) that I’m a hoe and that I cheated on him. I told him that we were never in a committed relationship and that he needed to stop spreading rumors. Now come to last month, Joe quit. And now Samantha has been spreading rumors at work saying that I cheated on him and that I’m a hoe and a horrible person for treating her best friend that way. I ended up going to management and telling them the whole situation and after analyzing the entire situation ended up putting Samantha on temporary leave. Now they’re talking about firing her because of all the rumors she said about me. Everyone is saying I went too far and that I should’ve just quit if I wasn’t happy. I actually enjoy my job but it was horrible coming into work and seeing her talk about me while I was standing right in front of her. AITA? Did I go too far?",

      "description": "I have this friend called Tom, he was diagnosed with very, very mild Asperger's at a young age. To people who don't know about it, he seems like a very talkative person, and likable too. It is only after knowing him for a while that you pick up some of the traits.\n\nTom likes to figet a lot, which is perfectly fine and doesn't bother me, except that he has no respect for other people's property. Whenever he gets his hands on anything (he plays with a lot of stuff without permission), he would figet with it in a way that's acceptable if the item was his own, but disgusting otherwise. \n\nFor example Tom would often lick/bite on my phone when I hand it over to him, blow his nose into my bed sheets after jumping in without asking, shove pens up his ear...etc my room is very close to the frontyard the bathroom is all the way at the back, so whenever Tom comes over he would just go take a piss in the front yard whenever he wants to. He would do similar things at all of our friend's houses and they all hate it. If he does these these thing to his own stuff I couldn't care less, I just hate it when he does it to my stuff.\n\nWhenever I confront Tom about this and tell them that it's disgusting, and asking him to stop; he would blame it on his Asperger's and says that he can't control it and it's not his fault. The thing is that I feel like he can control it if he wanted to - whenever he's at a more social event like at a party with lots of people he would refrain from doing these things because he knows that it would turn people off. I guess that since I'm a friend he feels more comfortable around me to let loose, and I don't blame him.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I excluded Tom from future gatherings at my house (not cut him off as a friend, I still would like to hang out with him, just not at my own place). I feel really bad because he is a really nice and likable person and that it's not entirely his fault that he does these things. It's just that whenever I have him over I get really annoyed by him touching my stuff and it really takes the fun out of things. ",

      "description": "Okay, so my friend and I have been friends for about 17 years, since freshmen year of high school. We don't see each other often due to my demanding work schedule that often requires travel, and the fact that she's a bit of a free spirit wanderer. She currently lives about 3 hours away from me.\n\nShe texts me on Wednesday saying she's riding to my city with her half sister \"for a job\" and wants to catch up and get drinks while they're here. \n\nOf course I'm down!\n\nOver the next two days, the conversation continues, I ask what part of the city she's going to be in so I can figure out where to go. She doesn't know yet, but casually mentions her sister has \"clients\", and she'll be in the car to kill time.\n\n... \"Clients?\"\n\nPlease tell me your sister does hair.\n\nNope.\n\nShe means CLIENTS.\n\nSo now I'm no longer interested in hanging out. Tell her it's dangerous and stupid and think it's a terrible idea. I was clear I didn't want to be around that kind of \"business\".\n\nThe day of, she texts saying she's in town, and about an hour later, I clarify I won't support that lifestyle and don't think she should either. I.e. I WILL NOT be coming to see her at _____ hotel while her sister \"sees\" some unknown number of \"clients\".\n\nShe's mad, says she isn't \"working\", just her sister, and she doesn't see what the big deal is.\n\nI explain to her when cops do stings, they don't just arrest one person, they (at least) detain everyone, and I'm not trying to be listed as an associate here or even have my plates taken down. You never know when someone is under surveillance in situations like this. I should know. I worked in Law Enforcement for 5 years. I've taken people to jail for this. I've rescued victims of human trafficking. She knows this. \n\nNot to mention the fact that my current job requires a Secret Security clearance that I don't want to lose because of someone I barely even know (her half sister).\n\nShe's not trying to hear it. Apparently I'm a bad friend for backing out of plans last minute, even though I was pretty clear I did not support what they were up to the moment I found out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for refusing to support or associate with a known prostitute? Or am I justified in choosing self-preservation over friendship?\n\nTL;DR Friend hits me up wanting to go for drinks. I initially accept the invitation but later back out when I find out she's hanging out with her sister while her sister has sex with men she \"met\" online for money. Friend is pissed.",

      "description": "This may seem trivial for some folks but this is so out of the ordinary for me and my girlfriend that I had to ask. I (23M) am in an intense graduate school program while my girlfriend (21F) is finishing her last year of college, and for 2 years we have been happily together and I do not see that changing anytime soon. Today, we had a conversation over text that was very strange for us as we are both very mature, we don't normally get angry with each other, and if we do its very brief and we tend work out our issues very well. Today I decided to tell her that I was going to be able to visit her during one of the weekends I have off, and this text convo ensued:\n\nMe: I think I am coming up on the 22nd of February, and leaving that Sunday afternoon\n\nGF: Really! Yay!\n\nMe: Have to leave early that afternoon though bc thats the weekend before my one final\n\nGF: Uhh then why don't you come the other weekend we talked about?\n\nMe: I might\n\nGF: I think you should.\n\nMe: I am still figuring it out, just saying what seems more logical to me\n\nGF: You're not going to be any fun if you come before a final\n\nMe: Forget that then\n\n\\*Here I am in class, being called on for a question, and I feel my phone blow up for about 30 seconds\n\nGF: You're going to be in total panic mode and should study\n\nGF: Babe honestly thats more important\n\nGF: And I don't want you to fail bc you should've studied more\n\nGF: Whatever ignore me thats fine thats the proper way to have a talk about things\n\nMe: I am in class ffs\n\nGF: Whatever you were responsive 5 mins ago\n\nMe: I got f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* called on\n\nGF: Okay\n\nMe: We can talk about it later. I don't know what I will do yet. Yes my final is important but I am looking more broadly at my schedule. It is also presidents day the week before which may work but idk yet.\n\nGF: Okay I was trying to think about you.\n\nMe: I know, thank you\n\nGF: really bc it doesn't sound like it. I get it (grad program) is hard but you snapped at me\n\nMe: You spammed me in class what did you expect! You gave me no time to respond before saying \"fine ignore me, you're a child\"\n\nGF: Well last I knew you were responsive\n\nMe: It shouldn't matter\n\nGF: I didn't call you a child\n\nMe: You insinuated as much\n\nGF: No I didn't\n\nMe: Well what else would you call that!\n\nGF: Maybe take it literally\n\nMe: Just being aggressive then?\n\n.... and that's it. She followed with \"have a nice day\" and we haven't talked since early this morning. This seems so petty but I feel like she overreacted. Please judge me with fire and fury. If you made it this far thanks for reading.",

      "description": "I apologize if this ended up being too many words!\n\nThis came up between my fiance and I over her wrapping presents for me but my sentiments apply to everyone generally.\n\nMy fiance had asked me about what kind of paper I wanted my presents to be wrapped in this past Christmas and I told her I've always thought it was wasteful personally to have wrapping paper that you just rip and throw out. I wouldn't mind if she or anyone else just gave a wrapped present to me or if I received one in any other way but if I was being asked about what I would like best my answer would be no wrapping paper at all. \n\nShe got upset at this and I offered alternatives, using a gift bag with some stuffing if she wanted to conceal the gift initially (I figured I could reuse the bag later but didn't say this in the conversation). I said I can understand why other people do and will give a wrapped gift occassionally (I like to use gift bags, or high quality bags or containers that I decorate and feel can be used after taking the gift out) but for me if I'm directly asked what I would like best for a gift that is for me, not wrapping would make me happier.\n\nShe said she didn't understand and cried a little, and I honestly couldn't understand what I had said that warranted it (I didn't yell or say any of it in anger and we were not in the middle of a fight). I eventually said I'd give it a shot anyway and she could wrap them. When the time came for me to open then later, I like to open them slowly without ripping the paper if I can and save them for a while as if I do have to receive them I like holding onto them for a while fo appreciate the effort someone took in wrapping it. \n\nShe commented on how long it was taking the whole time and offered to rip it for me which I declined. This led into another conversation about present wrapping and holidays ( she likes holidays more than I do but I make efforts to meet in the middle, like not going out valentine's day but planning a whole weekend away at a romantic cottage the next week) and I said what I already said in a calm manner and she got upset and cried again saying how she thought I was cold and mean and and an asshole about not being in the holiday spirit. I said I thought the holiday was about making others happy with your gifts and that included giving it to then in a way that was most comfortable for them.\n\nAITA for not just accepting this and getting into this wrapped present spirit? I felt I was missing something during both conversations as I was just so surprised by her reaction, her replies only being about how wrapping presents is how she always did Christmas and she didn't like this difference with me.\n\nTLDR: Fiance gets upset with me about not liking presents wrapped when asked, I agree to let her wrap them she doesn't like the way I unwrap them.",

      "description": "I come from a very broken home. I had a best friend (I'll call K) who I had been close to since Jr. High and had been friends with since pre-school. When things were getting bad, I would go to her house. I started going there every weekend, and even stayed during week days. I felt part of the family, I even saw K's mom as my own mom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nK and I had a falling out when we were in college, and when we did eventually make up, it was around that time that I wasn't able to pay for my own cell phone plan. I told her, call or text my boyfriend (now husband) to reach me, or she could try Facebook, but I wouldn't be as responsive as I was working my ass off trying to get thru my last year of college.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe few times we talked that year, I felt like I couldn't get a real conversation out of her. I asked 'hey, what's new?' and she would say nothing much, she had to get a new car as she got into a wreck. I freaked out, asked what happened, if she was OK, but she didn't make a big deal out of it and acted like she didn't really want to talk. She didn't talk about who she was dating, how the family was or anything, so I figured I should just concentrate on my projects so I can get the job of my dreams, which was a guarantee to get as long as I completed my projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths pass, and I decide to take a break and check Facebook. I see pictures of K in a wedding dress, and she is apparently getting married. I checked my boyfriend's phone, I checked my Facebook messages, and there wasn't any communication. It was too late to drive or get a plane ticket, so it was impossible for me to attend even if I had been invited. I immediately became heartbroken, we had always talked about being each other's maid of honor, would always be there for each other but I saw this kin to being abandoned or forgotten.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days pass, and I Facebook message her mom, and I tell her, Congratulations on the wedding, not sure why I wasn't invited but it really hurt to not be. I then explained that I would be cutting off all contact and I wished them all the best, and I appreciated her being there for me and how much the family meant to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother few days pass, and I see K complaining on Facebook about how I didn't reach out to her anymore and how it took 2 to make things work. This was always her go to saying, stating that both parties needed to communicate to make the relationship work. Several other people I was once friends with also complained that I stopped talking to them as well, and they didn't know why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't say anything then, and I haven't said anything for almost ten years (more than 5 but less than 10), until this post.\n\nThe only other conversation I had was to get in touch with a mutual friend of K's who knew my estranged sibling to tell them our father passed. No one reached out to me to tell me they were sorry for my loss or for any information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, long story short, AITA here, or justified?",

      "description": "Throwaway because my boyfriend is an avid redditor. I'm just hoping he doesn't browse this subreddit.\n\nMy boyfriend loves giving head. I'm not exactly sure why, but he's said before that he enjoys the act of giving (as well as receiving, of course). I'm not one to complain, he's also pretty good at it too. \n\nHowever, I hate giving head. I find it disgusting, and he doesn't really ask for it so I had no reason to tell him that before (plus, I felt like telling him I don't like giving head would take the wind out of his sails). \n\nRecently my boyfriend asked for a blowjob. It wasn't for a special occasion, but he asked nonetheless. I told him no, and gave him my reasons, and he seemed a little bit upset. I asked him if he thought he was owed a blowjob, and he said something to the effect of \"no, nothing like that. Just a little dissapointed is all\". \n\nJust a few nights ago, we were fooling around, and at the junction where he would normally give me head, he decided not to. I asked him why and he told me he just wasn't feeling it. \n\nLast night, I asked him why he wouldn't go down on me. To be honest, it kind of felt like he was distant and not as intimate as he normally was. I asked him why he felt so distant, and he shrugged it off. I asked him to continue giving me head in the future, and he seemed annoyed. I'm at a bit of a loss here. \n\nAm I the asshole for asking him to do this? I don't really understand what's changed. I feel like he feels like he's owed a blowjob or something, but I've clearly laid out my very reasonable feelings on the subject. ",

We've always struggled for money but we always make it work.\n\nRight now we are trying to get pregnant but after a year we are running some fertility tests and it doesn't look good, so we have started to talk about our options. I suggested we adopt, because IVF would cost about 5k and it would put her through a lot. She agreed.\n\nToday she started asking me about IVF again and what would I prefer. I told her that of course I would prefer to have a baby of my own, but it was out of the question, and then she told me about this money she has hidden away that would cover the IVF.\n\nI got really upset, not because of the money, but because she didn't trust me enough to tell me about it. She says that she does trust me, otherwise she wouldn't be with me, and I believe her. \n\nI don't have an emergency fund, and she seems to think that if she had told me about hers, I would have asked her to spend it on any of the tough times we've had. I would never do that. Whatever money we earn whilst we are together is ours, and whatever money she had before is hers.\n\nIt just upsets me that she doesn't trust that I would respect her decisions with her own money.\n\nAITA?

      "description": "Let me know if this isn’t the exactly right place, but I figured the discourse fit and I’d like another point of view. \n\nSo my gf a year and a half has become friends with a lot of her coworkers which is a great thing. However, I found it strange just how much she talks to one coworker specifically. This coworker texts her nonstop from the time she wakes up until she goes to sleep, even when we are spending time together. Anything short of the two of us getting intimate has her with her phone in her hands. I could be trying to cuddle with her or share an emotional moment and her phone is in hand texting this guy. I know there’s nothing sexual going on because my gf doesn’t turn her phone screen away when we are together so she has nothing to hide.\n\nHowever, this allows me to easily look over and see what he’s saying and I gotta say it makes me uncomfortable. One time he was talking about how he doesn’t understand fetishes, which looked to me like he was listing a bunch of fetishes and waiting to for my gf to say, “hey that one’s not that bad” so he can see what she’s into. Another thing I’ve seen him say is, “you wouldn’t hold it against me would you? Not that I wouldn’t want you to😈” (context unknown). My gf always segues away from these attempts but never outright tells him it’s inappropriate, despite my saying that he’s flirting with her. She just denies it and says they’re not like that. \n\nOne day more recently, she went out to dinner with her apartment mates that she lives with without inviting me (I have no problem with this as I understand the need for a girl’s night). I asked who all went along and she listed them off including this male coworker who is definitely not one of the apartment mates. At this point it became incredibly obvious that I had not been invited for some reason. I said have fun and told her I was going to bed. \n\nThe next day we had a conversation and I said I thought the way she treated this other guy in favor of me was inappropriate in my opinion and it made me feel insignificant when I would do anything for her. I said it made me feel bad that I didn’t get to enjoy time with her but this other guy who likes her too gets to be happy spending time with her. She told me I was being manipulative and making her feel bad for being with her friends. I believed this for a long time until recently when I noticed that I didn’t do anything manipulative. In my opinion I was just saying how I felt. In my opinion if you feel guilty for making someone else feel bad they aren’t being manipulative, maybe you acted in a way that you should feel guilty for? \n\nAm I the asshole here? I’ve tried to recreate this as best I can from my point of view. ",

      "description": "Context: I'm 28, she's 22. I live on my own, she lives with her parents. Her parents are immigrants from mexico so they are \"old school\" (their words) when in comes to parenting. They are roughly in their 50s.\n\nSo a while ago I moved away for school when we were 5 months into our relationship. We've been doing long distance and hit our 1 year mark last month. We're actually doing really good. I'm coming back for Christmas to see my family and her. Initially I wanted to just stay with her family while I visited her (she lives 3 hours from my own family). I was planning on sleeping in her bed with her at night. We weren't planning on having sex if they were also sleeping in the house cause that's weird; I just wanted to fall asleep with her and wake up to her. She asked her parents once, they said no (duh). I told her keep trying, maybe you can wear them down. If not, I said we'll just get an airbnb and sleep somewhere else. Problem is they get worried about her sleeping anywhere but her bed in their house. She's almost never been allowed to go to sleepovers, even past 18 years of age, except with her best female friend only. She convinced her parents one time to let her go on 5 day vacation with me once, but it was because I was moving and she wouldn't see me again for 6 months, and that was unheard of in her family.\n\nHere's where I need to know AITA. She doesn't want to disrespect/disappoint her parents by not sleeping in her house. I told her I would be disappointed and a bit mad if she let them dictate her life that much. I know it's only sleeping, we can literally go on a day trip and as long as she's sleeping in the house at night, they don't really care. AITA for not respecting their beliefs/culture/ect (they are from hispanic culture, so respect for family/parents is BIG) or do I have a right to be a bit pissed that she doesn't really want to fight this?\n\nIf you need more context, elaboration, ect, please tell me. I've never posted here before.",

It worked in her favor that I was fresh in the family and she was in for years.

I also did underestimate how much effort she would put into getting me out and how easy the others started to believe her. \nSo she upped her game and started bullying my daughter and told my 4 y/o she was unwelcome in everybodies life, annoying, ugly and not loved. My daughter told me later and cried a lot about it. \nWe broke off contact immediatly and I told my bf what this all was actually about. He was stunned at first, but based on the information given, knew I wasn't telling lies. He wants me to set the record straight, as right now I am still the bad guy who attacked SIL for no reason at all. \nAlso my BF is starting to miss his family.

      "description": " \n\nI  do a bit of part time work at the weekends cash in hand for a family  friend who runs a food trailer in town and have been doing it for a few  months now. Isn't much but it gives me something worthwhile to do on top  of my fulltime weekday job. We have a lot of regulars and a few weird  types that sometimes come across as either crackheads, alcoholics or  just the stereotype of chavs. One such feller who I'll call Jeff has  been a frequent customer/problem in the past who will often loiter round  the tables and be an annoyance from time to time. Jeff smokes without  ny consideration for other people who are still eating/drinking (and  while we can't prove it we've found bits of fag end butts/ash stubbed  out on our tables around the same time he's around), he's a bit foul  mouthed even when young children are nearby and my boss says he's seen  him drinking cans of lager sometimes even though he's been told not to.  Anyway, boss decided we're to stop serving Jeff if it keeps up.  Naturally, Jeff turns up the next weekend when it's quiet and sits  himself down on one of our tables to have himself a drink and a smoke.  Boss tells him tables are for customers only, Jeff moans and has a quiet  little word in behind my boss' back swearing and comes over.\n\nRemembering  what boss said, I told him we weren't serving him and to leave, he  argues with me demanding to know why to which I list off x reasons  (tl;dr he's a subhuman waste of space)  why  and say it's final, he can eat somewhere else as we don't want him  taking piss any more. In a bit of a rant Jeff throws the mostly-empty  can of lager he was drinking through the open hatch/window frame of our  stall which nearly smashes into my head. At this time I'm holding a cup  of coffee that was still too scalding to drink and instinctively throw  it at him which splashes into his face, Jeff screams and covers himself  up in pain and staggers off. I find out later in the evening that an  ambulance was called to town near our stall around that same time.\n\nMy boss has been OK about this as he thought Jeff was being a  twat but warned me he might try to cause trouble by involving the  police and so I should take a few weekends off until things quiet down. Someone else I know said I went a bit too far but honestly I wasn't the one who threw a metal can at someone's business. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I work in an industry that has been in a downturn the last few years. Ive been with them for 10+ years but  I'm burnt out and have had enough. I still enjoy what I do at times but between the corporate shit and lack of resources I'm over it. I've been looking for new opportunities the last 12 months but it's a small industry.\n\n Pay cuts, staff reductions, Capex freezes have occured about 3 years ago. The last 6 months work has picked up and it's gotten very busy, still no increase in staff to help with the work load. Last month even more work has picked up for the next 3-4 months, including some multiyear projects. We haven't been this busy in 5 years.\n\nI'm the manager of a department and the only one in the company that has my skill set and it is needed for this upcoming work.\n\nThis week I tendered my resignation and issued my 4 weeks notice as per my contract. I've had a few conversations with my direct line manager and their upset and disappointed. Asked why I didn't come to them sooner. What they can do to keep me all that jazz.\n\nNow I'm expecting a call from the big boss today with a please explain and wanting me to work for another few months while I wrap up projects and they can find a replacement and hand over. Like I said, small industry, it's going to be hard to replace me.\n\nI've already committed to a start date with the new company and have planned to spend time with my kids over the Christmas break between companies. Kids have 6 weeks off over Christmas, so this will be early to mid Jan just for a week between companies, so I don't really want to offer them this extra week - I value highly a good work/life balance.\n\nI feel like shit and the asshole for leaving these guys at a busy period when I know their going to struggle. I know it's just a job and I should just move on etc , fuck I've been dishing that out to my wife to get her to move companies, but I still feel like an asshole. I'm sure the other managers who I work with, and now will have to pick up the slack, who are already working 12hour days,  will also think I'm the asshole. Am I?\n\n\n(Based in Aus if it has any relevance)\n",

      "description": "My wife's mother is legitimate crazy. Ever since my wife and her siblings moved out her mother has been directing all of this crazy at her father. She accuses him of cheating and will try to pull her kids into it by sending them \"proof\" that she found which is usually an email sent by her or something like that. She goes off on him constantly about it and gets abusive. She doesn't even care that he just lost his mother and seems to be jealous about it. She is incredibly manipulative and lies a lot. Everyone wants her to go see some kind of doctor because they think she is sick. I feel like she is just desperate because she lost all control she ever had over her kids and is tormenting the father now. They are all really scared that it's going to cause her father to commit suicide so I tried to explain to her that if her mom doesn't want help and continues to do this something bad will happen and even though you might feel like a monster somebody needs to help convince her father that he should leave for the sake of himself. Her mother is slightly disabled (a stroke when she was 14 caused her to lose use of one hand) and hasn't had a job for probably 30 years. Is it really that bad to give up on people so toxic? I told her that if her mother can't take care of herself there are always women's homes available to help her, but that the guilt is part of the manipulation. Neither one of us is willing to house her because of this toxicity. Could someone please give me some advice on how I can help my wife with this situation?",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my boyfriend apply for a (potentially) bad job?",
      "description": "Okay, so my boyfriend, C, worked at a starbucks at our local grocery store about a year ago, and he HATED it. One of his friends at the time, J, was the one that actually recommended the job. It turned out horribly because they had no management, people were quitting left and right, J refused to work more than one night a week, and C ended up working 40+ hours during finals week (we are in high school). He was so stressed and in such a bad mental state that he just couldn't handle it and would complain and break down over it constantly. Eventually, J transferred to a different starbucks at a different grocery store, and C ended up quitting and getting a new job at a movie theater.\n\nFast forward to now. J started acting like an asshole, causing me and my boyfriend to have a falling out with him. In retaliation, I guess, he picks on/bullies me and C whenever he gets the chance. Anyways, today, for whatever reason, he told C that he should apply to the starbucks he is working at. He made it clear that he still only works once a week, that they wouldn't have to work together, and that the manager will hire him right away. A little while later, C gets a call from one of our friends working at the same starbucks basically saying that she's looking to quit, but that the manager will hire C on the spot if he applies today. This all seemed sketchy to me, but like a big neon thumbs up to C.\n\nWe get into an argument about this, and I say that if people are quitting and the manager will hire anyone on the spot, it's got to be too good to be true, and that it will probably just end up like last time. On top of this, I reminded him of how stressed and how adamant he was about never getting a job at a grocery store starbucks again. I also made it clear that working with J will be hellish, and if he really needs a new job, it's not that hard to find one.\n\n He replied by saying that he is in a better mental state now, can be stronger than before and quit if things get that bad again, and has work experience at a starbucks. He also assured me that he can ignore J, that this is a guaranteed job, and that he needs (wants) more money.\n\nI just think that there are always jobs hiring and that he can find one closer to home that pays even more if he took the time to look for one. There is no need to put himself through that much stress again. I'm also afraid that if he goes in to ask how many people work there, how many hours a week he'd have, etc., he'd get lied to.\n\nAm I the asshole for not letting him apply to this job, or is he a big boy who can made (bad) decisions on his own?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSummary: My bf worked at a terrible starbucks that didn't respect their employees, and his bully recommended they start working together at a new starbucks, even though the manager is hiring on the spot and people are quitting. It sounds to me like the beginning of round 2 of the first bad job.",

When I do get a few spare minutes throughout my day, I can really only spare enough time to quickly shove some food in my mouth and go . We each have a tiny cubby with our name on it to put our snacks / cutlery/ etc in.  I live alone and am in my early 20's. I try to be healthy , so i try to make my food last because it is more expensive .

A few times when I have to leave it out to take a client or go smoke , I will come back to a much smaller portion of food then when I left. So today I had enough . I was hungry. I was annoyed. I confronted her , sternly as she was holding my big bag of flavored almonds in her hand just digging right in . I asked her if she liked them , and where she got them from . She said found them in my cubby. I said \"know where I got them from ? Target. They're 8.99. If you want more you'll have to get them from there and not from my cubby. You need to ask before you take from now on\" She was not happy. She slammed the bag down and stormed off. She told my boss , and coworkers , and my boss thinks that I was an asshole to her mom and hurt her feelings .My coworkers also sided with her mom. My boss says it shouldnt matter if her mom eats my food , her mom shares with me \"all the time\" . And my coworkers tell me that I shouldn't have made a big deal over something so small . But I'm sick and tired of being stranded with no food at work.  So AITA ?",

I wasn’t! \n\nHe asked whether I’d be there today and that he wanted a favour. Since he got blocked out of his bank transfer system, he needed to transfer 50€ by todays date to avoid a fine and asked me if I’d do it for him. \n\nI agreed and said I’d meet him in 2 hours. \n\nI realised that my battery was about to die and since I only use Mobile Banking, I headed home and told him to send me the details and I’ll do it from home - Which I did\n\nA couple days later I asked/messaged him asking whether he was gonna pay me by cash or have his girlfriend transfer it to me as he suggested the last time. Got told that he sent my info to his Gf and she’ll do it. \n\nI went away for the next 3 days to visit a really good friend and completely forgot about it. Came back and was looking at my account and realised that I still haven’t received anything from this guy. \n\nI wrote him once again - one of his responses really hit my nerve.. then got called out for being cheap. \n\nNote: We aren’t like really good friends. We know each other because we have some classes together and only meet when our paths cross. \n\n[1st Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/yRur0oB)\n\n[2nd Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/TvpKMUw)\n\n[3rd Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/2XiKoeK)\n",

      "description": "  I was married for 15 years, and we had been together since we were 19. The last few years of our marriage weren’t great. We had gotten to the point where we would actively avoid each other when the kids weren’t around. \n   When he (let’s call him Mike) told me he wanted to separate he swore that he wasn’t seeing anybody else, but I found out a few days later that he had been meeting a woman who was also married at hotels a couple times a week. After a big confrontation I got a hold of his phone, did a reverse look-up on the number (paid for with his credit card of course) and contacted her (let’s call her Carli). \n    Carli immediately went on the defensive and got shitty with me. She suggested that this was my fault based on things my husband had told her, and when I asked her to leave him alone she told me that she wouldn’t be threatened or intimidated. So, I called her husband (let’s call him Ryan). I told him everything, and apologized to him for having to do this. He was actually really nice about it when I told him how embarrassed I was at their behavior (we both have children, and I was ashamed that I had to do something so trashy as to call him and tell him my husband was fucking his wife), and he actually ended up comforting me, since he had found out a couple weeks earlier and had already moved out. \n    Fast forward a few months later: my ex and I have been to counseling and have come to a place where we are able to communicate much better, and we have both come to the realization that we’re better off apart. I really like living alone (with the kids but you know what I mean) and we share the kids equally. He has continued to see Carli, and after talking things out with her we’ve actually become very friendly. We both have children similar in age, and we both have a child with autism. I can honestly say I wish them both the best. \n    During all the drama of lies and fights, I had texted with Ryan a few times, just because we were both going through the same thing and could talk to each other. He was really good to talk to. A few weeks ago he suggested that we meet when he and a few friends of his were going to visit a haunted house near me. Before we met I made it clear to him that I wasn’t looking to replace his wife, in those words exactly. It was a little blunt but I just didn’t want to make him think that we could just trade spouses and life would go back to normal for us, you know? He said that he totally understood and just thought that we could be of some comfort to each other. I kind of felt a little bad for him after I said that so I agreed. \n   What I did NOT expect to happen was to find him so freakin’ cute in person. He’s tall, tattooed, and smart af. He’s also really sweet. I invited him to come watch Evil Dead at my place the next week (Halloween!) and I kissed him before I went home that evening. Even though I liked him much more than I expected to, I wasn’t thinking much would come of it. I had been dating a little and had met another guy I really liked, but he works a lot and even though we both want to go on a second date his schedule is so crazy that it’s not set for another week or so. \n    The next week he came over and one thing led to another, and we ended up having sex for hours, and he stayed the night. The sex was a-ma-zing. He left the next morning and we have plans to see each other again next week. We didn’t talk about our exes, and the whole evening was great. \n    A few days later I let it slip to Mike (Ex) that I had gone out with Ryan and he freaked out. Not because he was jealous but because he thought that Carli would freak out when she found out, and he said that I was jeopardizing his relationship with Carli by seeing Ryan. I really don’t get why it’s a big deal, and he couldn’t be more specific as to why it’s a problem other than he’s her ex. I also kind of think it’s a little hypocritical for him to say that seeing as they both betrayed their spouses. He begged me to tell him that I was lying, and eventually I did just to calm him down. I don’t know if he believes me or not but he sure wants to. \n    I know this is a bad idea in general, but am I the asshole for doing it? I really don’t know. \n\nTLDR: ex cheated on me with married woman, so I slept with her husband. ",

      "description": "Backstory: My parents are divorce and absolutely hate each other. The divorce was a shit show and they often put me in the middle. In the divorce agreement that both parents signed it states that I would inherit the wedding ring from the marriage. \n\nSo now, I am in college and living in my own place away from my parents. I am trying to get all of my important documents together and I realized that I never got the ring. I know that my mother has it and she is getting ready to move to another state with a man who I do not like. So I called her asking for her to give me the ring so I can have it where I live. Since we are living in different cities I had to call her and talk to her about this. She stated that she is not giving me the ring UNTIL my father pays her child support (I don't know anything about this nor do I care. My brother and I are both 18 and older and so tired of both of our parents that we don't really pay attention to anything that has to the divorce). I told her that she is putting me in the middle and that the ring or any money I made from the ring would go to my father, however, she is completely refusing. As we were on the phone she let it slip about 'selling the ring' and I lost it and hung up.\n\nNow, I dont know what I am doing from here, I contacted my dad and told him the story as well as asked for a copy of the decree. But I do know that i'm not talking to my mom because of this. So AITA or does my mom have a point about this?",

      "description": "I was dating someone for about 2 months and everything was great up until this moment. We had planned to hang out on a Friday night. He was going to come over and just hang out and watch a new episode of a show we love. I got home and texted him what time worked for him and he said he wanted to hang out around 9:30 but then said he rather go out and grab a drink instead. I was okay with that. Around 8:30 he texted me and said he wanted to push it back until 10:30. I told him that would be okay but because of the time I wouldn’t be able to be out for too long since i had to be up pretty early the next day. I wasn’t expecting to start our night out that late. He asked if I wanted to just do another day so I asked him if he was free on Sunday and he said yes. I told him I didn’t want to come off flakey but wanted to be able to give him more of my time, plus I didn’t know he would want to push it back that late. I told him I would still be able to go out with him tonight (Friday) but again, I couldn’t be out too late.\n\nHe ended up texting me back and telling me to “stop playing games” and told me not to “martyr myself to please him”\n\nI was taken aback by this and tried to explain to him again that I wanted to be respectful of his time and still wanted to see him. He ignored my texts after that.\n\nThe next day I texted him asking if things were okay and he told me that he was upset that I “cancelled plans on him.” I apologized for making him feel that way but I told him again that it was later than I expected and he had only told me an hour before and his reaction seemed very hostile? He told me he didn’t want to talk about it anymore and I got upset because I wanted to be able to talk about things like that. He asked me what I was looking to get out of the conversation, saying that I made him upset because I cancelled and that I could’ve been more direct. He then told me that he didn’t want to have a “3 hour dr Phil session” with me every time we had a disagreement. That’s what really hurt me. I told him what he said was really invalidating when all I was doing was trying to tell him how I felt and not have an argument. He told me “the fact you think this is an argument says something, I’m just here chillin, do what you gotta do”\n\nHe then texted me the next day telling me he knows he’s an asshole and he’s sorry and he’s impatient but he could show me the “purest love imaginable”\n\nI didn’t respond to him and haven’t talked to him since.\n\nIve dealt with a lot of people gaslighting me and making me feel like what I’m feeling is invalid.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? Did I do something wrong to make him react like this?",

      "description": "When I first met my wife she was thin, pretty thin. Now after a few kids and years have gone by I'd say she's gained about 40 lbs? The thing is, she isn't obese or close to it (I would not be attracted to that). She was too thin, but it didn't really matter to me that much. \n\nAnyway, she hates her current weight. She tells me how much she misses being thin, looking at old photos of herself or mentioning it occasionally. She makes efforts, then goes back to not really making an effort. She would go to the gym with me then she quit going. \n\nAs time went on I realized, she looks much better to me like this, thicker. What made her pissed is, I said \"you know, you look better thicker, you look great with more meat on you, your ass and boobs are bigger now.\" \n\nI kind of squeezed her when I said it. She looked like she wanted to kill me literally, she called me an asshole and now won't talk to me (been over a day). Telling me that I'm so insensitive towards her etc. \n\nI'll be honest, I haven't apologized or anything or think I did anything wrong. I don't think I need to apologize. Yeah she's sensitive about her weight, but still. ",

I would say this is just me having a learning deficiency except that almost everyone in my grade is having the same problem.

      "description": "I have two aunts on my dads side and both are sort of old fashioned but the older of the two takes it to an extreme. When I was friends with her on FB I would constantly see homophobic or transphobic posts on her feed and then after I came out as queer were some posts about “accepting gay family” sprinkled in. She would constantly comment on posts of mine she disagreed with which is her right to do and I honestly wanted to block or unfriendly her but I’d be blamed for starting drama. One day she shared an article with very ignorant views and wrong information on top of being hella transphobic. I commented politely to let her know that the article had many problems with facts and one of her friends basically went on an ignorant rant about how wrong I was and lots of transphobic stuff. I tried being polite as possible but after an hour of back and forth I finally had enough, called the friend an asshole, and left it as that. Later on I was added to a group message on FB with my parents from my aunt saying I acted like a douche bag (her exact words) and she was unfriending me because of that. This happened a few years ago and now whenever she visits s for Christmas or Easter I’m guilted into going to see family knowing she’s there because my grandparents “won’t be around forever” (my mom’s go to) and to just ignore her. Last Christmas I was cordial and got her an ornament along with my other aunt and grandmother and she made a political comment she knows I strongly disagree with because she can’t keep well enough alone and my mother just tells me that I have to be the adult in the situation. There are many instances where she makes small homophobic comments during dinners and since it’s around my grandparents I don’t feel I can just tell her to shut up as I’m a “child” (over 21 at this point but I’m expected to respect my elders no matter what) I don’t have the mental or emotional energy to keep pretending I don’t want to scream or cry any time i see my aunt and very much would prefer to go completely NC with her but both of my parents guilt me by saying she’s family and that’s how she’s always been. \n\nAITA for wanting to cut ties with her for my mental health and emotional well-being?",

      "description": "So a couple of days ago my grandaunt (the sister of my grandma) passed away at 98 years of age. My mom is shattered, since she has always been very close to her aunt and visited her about 3 times per week. So the past couple of days have been very rough and emotional for her.\n\nMe (24F) and my brother (23M) on the other hand, didn’t see our grandaunt very often, probably once a year or even less. My grandaunt was a very complicated woman and she would criticize us a lot. She was also very religious and would regularly give us slack for not going to church (I’m an atheist). I therefore didn’t like her very much. \n\nBecause of her complicated persona and her old age, my grand-aunt didn’t have many friends or family. My mom is therefore arranging the whole funeral by herself. I will be surprised if more than 30 people show up tbh. \n\nAnyways, my mom will be speeching and she asked me to do the same, since ‘I am the oldest’ and also because there will probably be no one else to give a speech. I refused, and told her that I wasn’t even close to my grandaunt and I cannot think of anything nice to say. My mom was very disappointed, and asked me if instead I wanted to read my grandaunt’s favorite poem at the funeral, and that ‘it would mean so much to her \\[my mom\\]’ if I did. She showed me the poem and it was *extremely* religious, talking about God and Jesus and about going to heaven, etc. I told my mom there is no way that I am going to read it, since it goes against some of my core beliefs and I would feel like a hypocrite if I would (not only because I’m not religious, but also because I just didn’t like my grandaunt). \n\nNow my brother just called me a couple of hours ago, telling me that I should ‘stop being such a little bitch’ and just read the poem for my mom. He told me that mom feels very upset and also arranging the funeral on her own has been very rough for her, and that this is ‘the least I can do’ to show her that at least I care. I told him that ‘if I were dead I wouldn’t want someone I rarely knew to speak at my funeral’ and also that ‘instead of giving me a hard time you could also just offer to read the poem yourself, if you care so much’. But he counters that by saying that ‘mom specifically asked you’. \n\nI really do not feel comfortable reading this weird religious piece of text at the funeral of someone I truly disliked, even though I know I’d make my mother extremely happy if I did. Am I being an asshole? \n\n**TL; DR:  Grandaunt (my grandma’s sister) passed away and my mom asked me to read my grandaunt’s favorite (very religious) poem on her funeral. I refused, because I am an atheist and because I generally just didn’t like the woman. Overreacting?**",

We used to be in the same class at college, but now she studies at the local University and I do my military service, so the only time really have any freetime is from friday afternoon to sunday evening. So she tries to do all her studying during the week so she has enough time for us on the weekends.\n\nThe problem is that me and my friends have a regular Dungeons and Dragons campaign on Saturday afternoon, in which I usually don't participate in 50% of the sessions since i really appreciate the effort she makes to spend more time with me.\n\n\nSo about 3 weeks ago she casually mentioned some kind of miniature car race event she'd like to watch with me, which i didn't decline but also didn't agree to. We've never talked about it again and i forgot about it because i suck at memorizing Dates (which is why we have a shared Calendar) until yesterday when she wrote the event into the Calendar, to which i replied that i already agreed to play Dungeons amd Dragons with my Friends because i already missed the last session.\n\n\nSo now she's pissed that she tries to do all her work during the week, which i totally understand, but on the other hand I think it should not be as big of a deal to \"sacrifice\" 6hours of our time together to play DnD with my friends.",

      "description": "First time I've ever posted something like this so bear with me!\n\nSo for context my (long-distance) girlfriend and I have only been going out for a little over 3 weeks and today marks the first time we've really disagreed over anything and I think it's a little OTT. I really like her a lot but the relationship has moved too fast in one area for me;\n\nProbably only a few days into the relationship she started saying 'I love you' and since I didn't really know how to play off of that, I just kind of said I loved her too. I think this was the big mistake I made and the reason why I think I might be the asshole here. Let me explain\n\nToday we were talking (through texting) about how we thought we were getting on and we both agreed that we were going well. The only thing I mentioned was the fact that I was worried about the fact that we'd already been saying 'I Love You.' (As I told her, I never want any nice things I say to her to be disingenuous)\n\nTo me, 'I Love You' is like the best thing you can say to someone, but *no matter how I feel about her*, it would take some time before I was actually comfortable with saying it. When I say things like that I like to mean them and I always want to be genuine. She had already picked up that I was reluctantly saying 'I love you too'. I made it clear to her that I still feel the same about her as when I first asked her out, but she says that you should already be ready to say 'I Love You' if you're asking someone out. \n\nShe now has suggested that we take a break from the relationship until I'm ready to say it. (I probably never will be if this happens, I don't get how my feelings can develop further in this case). I told her we should talk about it on call later and she agreed. Results of this TBD.\n\nI'm actually quite upset that she would want to take a break over something like this and it has really made me doubt the longevity of this relationship if I can't be honest. So I need to know if I'm being an insensitive ass and overlooking why she's as upset as she is. AITA?",

      "description": "I have this long time friend, known her for around 7 or so years now.  The last two years, we've become neighboors so we hung out a lot.  Sometimes with a group, sometimes just the two of us.\n\nBecause of the oftenness of spending time with her, I've developed this crush.  So a few months back, I told her I liked her and I was surgically rejected.\n\nI cooled of for a couple of weeks (or maybe a month), and then we began hanging out regularly like before as if nothing even happened.\n\nfast forward four or six months, I gave it a go again.  I got the same answer. \n\nI'd like to keep in touch with this friend even if she keeps rejecting me.  I've come into terms that the chances of getting a romantic relationship with her is pretty slim, but I'd like to try and try until these feelings for her dry up because I thought that if I'm not gonna get what I want, I would feel less regret if I knew that I tried for it with all I have.  Because if I give it my all, I would never think \"what if I tried.  what if I just threw away my pride and actually gave it my all\".\n\nThe problem is, I've seen how uncomfortable she felt whenever rejecting me and I could see how guilty it made her feel.  I know that I can take getting rejected over and over again, but I'm not quite sure if I'm being fair to her for always putting her on the spot, knowing how guilt eats this person up (she's always been this guilt driven person who is constantly too nice for her own good).\n\nSo yeah, am I the asshole for always putting my friend up to the unpleasant task of rejecting me just so that at the end of the day, I'd feel like I gave it my all and not regret anything?",

      "description": "I was walking out of a Best Buy towards my car when I notice this guy standing right by my driver side door. I couldn't see what he was doing but I could see that his hands were raised to my window level, so he was clearly doing something to my car.\n\n\nI don't know how much it matters, but I have PTSD, so I naturally get very defensive when I perceive potential danger (whether real or not). I ran towards him. His back was turned and there was enough ambient noise that he didn't hear me approach. Once I was behind him, I shouted \"What the fuck are you doing to my car?\" very loudly.\n\n\nHe jumped from being startled and spun around. I was blocking his path so he stepped to the side. He pointed to my window and I saw he had left some sort of flyer wedged in my car window. He wasn't breaking in like I had assumed. Either way though, I was still in a very tense mood. He started saying something about this business service that he and his wife recommend and then he began walking away.\n\n\nI didn't bother looking at the flyer. I just pulled it off my window and dropped it on the ground. Yes, I know that's littering, but the way I see it, I'm not obligated to clean up other people's trash just because they put it on my car. After tossing it, I got into my car.\n\n\nI wasn't looking at the man any longer as I put on my seatbelt and then started my GPS up. I turn to the left to look out the window and I see that same guy approaching my car again. I open the door and tell him to get the fuck away from me. He stops and then goes to stand on a grassy divider in the parking lot. He's still staring at me as I start my car up and pull out of my parking space. As I start to drive off, I see him walk back to the parking space and pick up the flyer I had taken off my car. I didn't know that was what he was planning to do, but even if I had, I still wouldn't have wanted to deal with him.\n\n\nI know that I mistakenly interpreted his intentions as hostile and I reacted accordingly. Even though his actual intentions weren't what I had assumed, I still think he should keep his hands off other people's cars.",

They are all very close and share a lot of their lives with one another. I have a form of OCD called Dermatillomania that makes me compulsively pick my zits until they scab- gross, but it's something I work on. However, I'm really ashamed of it, and go to extreme lengths to hide it while I work to recover fully (I've made massive progress and am sure I'll kick it eventually.) \n\n\n\nMy boyfriend told all of the people he is living with.\n\n\nThis accompanies me saying I felt weird recently because they all were having long winded discussions about skin around me when I was in the room and it was always the one I suspected didnt like me.... he claimed they were unrelated. But now I found out today, like, confirmed, this girl hates me. And that my boyfriend DID tell all of them about my dermatillomania, yes. And I'm uncomfortable being around them because not only do they KNOW, they actively seem to be taking joy in trying to trigger me, and seem to think I'm problematic for having mental illness at all, and shouldnt be in his life. I'm glad he has friends he loves and I'm by no means saying he shouldnt be THEIR friend -- but am I wrong to not want to see them any more? Am I unrealistic? I dont want them analyzing every pimple and scab on my face every time I see them forever or feel like I have to put up with what I'm pretty sure is malicious to be accepted by the group. \n\n\nYes, I'm sad about the trust breach, but my bigger worry is that I'm the asshole if I say I truly cant see his friends again. At least this main group. Can we even date like that? \n\n\nPlease be gentle",

Recently I’ve started following youtube diys of transforming clothes and such. And Sometimes I’ll even buy a 3x large tee and have my mom bring it in a few sizes so that it hits me at my knees. \n\nI was in my local good will just browsing when I found this super cool tee shirt that had Spider-Man on it. It was a 3x so I knew it would fit me perfectly once my mom brought it in. However on my way to pay a rather large girl my age stopped me. (Call her B)\n\nB: Are you going to buy that? *she points to my shirt*\n\nMe: yeah I am. \n\nI’m not stupid and I know she was eyeing so I try to walk past her but she steps in front of me\n\nB: it wouldn’t even fit you why are you buying it!?  It’s  my perfect size and I couldn’t find anything else I liked here. Let me buy that shirt and I’ll help you find another one \n\nMe: I’m going to have it altered. Sorry but I already have it and I’m going to buy it. \n\nB: That’s  not fair! Do you know how hard it is to find plus size  clothes that aren’t expensive? Don’t be a bitch about it! \n\nHonestly I was sympathetic a little bit before she called me a bitch. But it’s not my fault that stores charge more for more fabric. And I shouldn’t be the one to have to sacrifice for it. \n\nI mention it in the gc with my friends and two of them said I should have just gave it to her and was being selfish. AITA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "First time posting on Reddit. I'd have never imagined this being my first post but I'm really conflicted about this one.\n\nI'm on holiday somewhere in South America. The first day here, I met a girl working in a coffee shop. I didn't notice her at first but then she asked me where I was from. This ended up in a really long conversation and me going to a party with her. Nothing to crazy until I tried some local \"moonshine\" and got fucked up. I remember she told me she was taking me back to her place, but ended up in my hotel (she says I refused to go).\n\nDuring that conversation, she told me she will soon start working as a flight attendant and she's really interested in visiting my city. I told her she was more than welcomed. I travel a lot because of work so in a way, we would have seen each other pretty often.\n\nI decided to spend my last two days here with her, since I've already seen most of the things i wanna see. We decided to do dinner on Thursday and then, the next day, I'd stay at her place and cook her something from my country.\n\nThursday comes around and we decided to meet in an Italian restaurant at 8. She showed up an hour late, completely drunk. We had dinner and went for a drink. During drinks she told me we couldn't go back to her place and that she just wanted to dance and then go home.\n\nI was a little disappointed, but it was ok. She then proceeded to take like a hundred pictures of me, flirt, kiss me and dance around me like it was a lap dance. I was a little confused but decided to go with it.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I kinda developed a crush on her. I told her that and she told me she didn't believe, that she was ugly (her words, not mine), that I probably was controlling and an abuser (this one hurt the most, cause I would never do something like that) and, as the cherry on top, she started making fun of my culture.\n\nNow, while I was really sad this happened, I understand that alcohol can make you do stupid things (boy do i know that), so I let it slide. She went back to her place and I went to my hotel. However, before that happened, she told there was other dude (fml, amirite?). She described him as everything she hated and thought I was, but she still liked him.\n\nThis last part made it for me. I was still sad, but decided I wasn't even gonna try anymore.\n\nHowever, this morning, she sent me a bunch of videos and pics of us dancing and kissing. I don't even wanna see them. I told her maybe it was best we didn't meet today, and to not look for me while on my city (if there's something i hate more that dating, is being used)\n\nI'll spare you the details, but she called all kinds of things and where can I stick my invitation. \n\nTruth is, I really suck at dating, and I can sense when something is bound to fail, but sometimes I just go with it and hate myself later. Here I'm just trying to at least avoid a couple of sleepless nights. But I did promised her to show her around my city and a part me feels like I'm acting out of pettines.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: how tf do you catch feelings for someone you just met a week ago? \n\nWell, attraction for me (at least) is a tricky thing. I can spend months by myself, not attracted to anyone. Then, out of nowhere, someone shows up and turns my whole world around, so this is not the first time it happens. Results have been mixed and I know I should do something about that, but one problem at a time.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA? \n(Thanks for reading)\n",

Long story short, I used to eat them during something that landed me with PTSD that Automoderator doesn't approve of. Yes, I'm in therapy but there are more pressing issues than getting myself to eat almonds.\n\nYesterday one of the cafes I frequent changed their menu. It's the kind of place where they have stuff on display. Some of the new stuff looked good, but I had no clue what was in it. This is the first time it has been an actual problem for me, since I usually stick to the same few things, and it got me thinking.\n\nI see a lot of people on reddit complaining about people without allergies/diagnosed intolerances wanting special food (mostly glutenfree things). I don't have any of those things. I asked about one of the things, the woman behind the counter didn't know and I ordered something else.

After we were seated we all ordered a drink and looked over the menu. \n\nAfter we placed our orders we all sat around making small talk over the chips and salsa (it was a Mexican restaurant) that were provided to us. I felt like the mood was a bit awkward, so I said “we should all do a shot”.\n\nSo when the waitress came by we flagged her down and everyone settled on a shot for the group to do. We got them and things really loosened up from there on out. \n\nWhen the bill came I noticed the waitress put all five shots on my tab. They were $6 a piece and the $30 came to more than half of my tab.\n\nSo I told everyone “Hey, she made a mistake and put all the shots on my tab” and everyone called me cheap since the shots were “my idea” and I didn’t want to pay for them. The waitress had no problem revising the checks so that everyone got their own shot on their bill. \n\nI didn’t force anyone to have a shot and I never said anything about paying. Also, nobody else bought any rounds. We all bought our own initial drink, food, and that was it. Nobody else offered to get another round of anything after the shots were done and we finished eating.\n\nAITA or did people just not want to pay for their shots?

      "description": "Some background, I work in a small store that is part of a major industry. It's half retail and half physical labor, and recently we got a new Manager here at the store. Let's call him M, and besides M and myself we have one other full time employee, I am part time *just* below full time. Basically I work enough hours to be there enough to live, but just little enough that the company doesn't have to give me benefits.\n\nNow, before M showed up we had a previous Manager with whom myself and my co-worker had no issues with at all. Previous Manager kept enough jobs moving through where we would hit bonuses and all around do fine monetarily. But i was asked to work Saturdays solo, since they both had newborns in the home.\n\nThis was fine with me, I jumped at the chance to get that 9 hour shift. The flip side of this is that I was off on Mondays, and over time Sunday and Monday became my days to take a breather. Before long, Mondays specifically became my time to go to CMA meetings in support of one of my close friends, who is recovering. This specific fact never came up with co-worker/ex-boss because, well, they never had any issue with me being off Mondays so I went about my business.\n\nFast forward to a few months later, old boss leaves the company, new guy moves in. Things begin to change in terms of, well there's more for us to do. I take on more duties (for no extra pay or hours, though they say \"you should've been doing this anyways), and the new boss who is money driven, damn near doubles the amount of physical work we do in the store. We work with paint, so we shift probably 8,000 gallons in a week, sometimes less, sometimes more.\n\nOne thing he consistently begins bringing up to me is having me work Mondays. I've refused flat out multiple times, for two reasons;\n\n 1: I'm going to support my friend, no matter what. This guy was there for me in a big way before he fell on hard times, so I will return the favor. \n\n 2: I would be working 6 days a week, with no extra hours at all.\n\nSee, he can't get approval for me to technically work more. So he wants to spread my hours out across the week so I'm there more days, same pay, less days off. It's gotten to the point where when I come back on Tuesdays, he'll say \"me and [co-worker] did x amount of work yesterday, because you didn't want to come in to work.\" Like he's guilt tripping me for having days off. \n\nI'm still the only one who works Saturdays, alone. Beyond this, there is a boss above him, who has even said (to the new manager, as advice about me/this, and I heard about it) that my \"days off aren't a garuntee.\" Which is just...disgusting, to me.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to do this? Also, I have talked with my co-worker, (with whom I helped keep the store open during the two week no manager period while the new guy was getting hired), and they have no issue with me being off Mondays.",

After highschool he tried to go to community college, and went for one semester before dropping out. Our parents are great and have done everything for us, they’ve provided a great foundation for us to succeed but he constantly sets himself up for failure.

He always thought everyone at our school was just assholes and everyone was against him.  It’s been a year now since he dropped out of college, and the only attempt he made at getting a job failed miserably after realizing working at a coffee shop was too hard for him. He has no sense of etiquette at the dinner table and has zero social skills. He doesn’t understand the concept of showering and shaving everyday, all he does is sit around, play runescape and eat food. He’s out on a solid 40 pounds since the summer. He constantly takes things from me and bursts into my room asking me to play games with him, even though he knows I’ve actually got important stuff going on and I can’t just spend all my time playing xbox. And what’s worse is that he and my parents act like I owe him my time and that I need to spend time with him because he “has trouble being social.” Why should I have to spend time with the loud, slob of my brother that is only ever in it for himself? \n\nAm I the asshole wanting my brother out of my life?

I have my classes do a project called Poetry Out Loud right before the holiday break. The whole thing is about memorizing a poem with 30+ lines and reciting it with emotion after around two months of preparation. This is done to help them with public speaking. So during one of my classes, three girls all recited the same poem. They all did great, but one of them didn't fill the room with her voice. The final scores were 98%, 98%, and 93%. After entering their scores in my online grade book, the girl with the lower score came to me and asked why she got a lower score. I explained to her that her voice wasn't commanding and didn't fill the room. That apparently wasn't good enough of an answer and she kept pushing. I told her that she got an A so she shouldn't be complaining. She then preceded to cry and run out of my class (this was during the lunch break, so she wasn't being disruptive).

      "description": "A few weeks ago, a friend updated their computer with a newer GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and they gave me their old one so I could work on building my own computer. I had some other parts, but long story short my new computer didn't work, and I put the GPU back into it's packaging. \n\nMy current PC isn't built for gaming, and so it's unable to play a couple games that my friends and I like. I've been using my brother's computer, but before he let me use it I've always made sure I had his permission. I've let him know what games I have downloaded, and I've not done anything to it without his OK.\n\nRecently, he's been trying to build another computer to act as a server. When I was working on my failed computer project, I told him he could use my current GPU, because I would be using my newer one. Servers dont really do anything graphics heavy, so an older GPU would work fine for building it. Of course my PC project fell through, so I still have to use my older graphics card in my current PC.\n\nCut to today, and I'm using his computer. I notice on his desk a few pieces to the packaging for my newer GPU, so I take a look around. I notice that he has installed my new card into the server PC he's building. He didn't ask my permission, he didn't even tell me about this. I would have been fine with him using my card, but he didn't even let me know he was using it. After I removed it from the server PC I texted him and told him that he could \"get his own fucking graphics card,\" and he told me to get off of his computer. \n\nTL;DR: My brother took my graphics card and used it for a computer he was building. I wasnt currently using the card and would have let him use it if he asked, because he lets me use his gaming PC. He didn't ask to use it though, so I took it out and said some rude things over text. He seems to have responded by not letting me use his computer anymore. \n\nAITA?",

We were pretty good friends and talked frequently, she got with another bloke (I didn't have a problem with this at the time) and told everyone that she was happy... what she told me in private is how he was a sexually abusive sociopath that gave her night terrors. I tried to get her to leave him and she inevitably stopped talking to me because of it.\n\nFast forward a year and I decided to message her again to see how she is, turns out she dumped him a few months after we stopped talking. So we started talking again and eventually our friendship grew into a kind of relationship without actually saying so. We made it official a little after the first kiss.\n\nDuring the beginning months I was with her, she was charming, funny and knew what to say in all the situations. But we would argue. Not often, about once a month, but after a few months they got a lot more frequent. Around the 4 month mark she started to agree to go on dates, then make an excuse not to go (ex. \"Im ill\", \"I'm on my period\" etc), now I wouldn't have minded if this wasn't a regular thing, but it got to the point where we made plan for a date, we would get all ready to meet up, and then she would literally just say \"im too tired sorry\" every single time.\n\nWhen I tried to talk to her about it she would burst out into tears and say how she doesn't know why she is so tired all the time, or ill. Then she would threaten to break up with me, saying how she is quote \"no good for anyone\" and basically force me to say \"No you're amazing\" or something along those lines. It got so bad that she once sent a message saying \"we're over\" then blocked me for 4 hours, just before unblocking me to say \"we are completely done, no matter what you say\". And then bait me into fighting for her. \n\nThe final straw was a few days before the break up. We had been planning to go away on this 3 day holiday to visit my dad. I was paying for the whole trip and we would be in our own flat. This was 3 months planning bearing in mind. We had been planning this for 3 bloody months. The day before we were meant to leave, she came round to my house and stayed for the night after us having an argument because she was \"feeling too sick\" to do it at all. I suggested that she just come round for the night and see how she is in the morning. When the morning actually came she said how she \"wasn't ready for a big trip like this with a boy\". Now, I could understand this, if it wasn't for the fact that the 'trip' was a 20 minute train journey, and she had stayed the night before with me. She went home and I left for the few days. After I got back she spoke to me about once a day for a few minutes. When I finally worked up the courage to ask why she said how talking to me is a chore and too much effort, so I just said I can't do this anymore sorry but its over, then I blocked her.\n\nNow what you have to understand is that my mind would be clear about this, and I would be guilt free - if it weren't for the fact that I promised her multiple times how I would always stay with her no matter what, and how I'm not like her ex (the sociopath). I promised that I'm wasn't using her like he did.\n\nTL;DR my girlfriend had an abusive ex that kind of messed her up and I broke up with her because she couldn't be bothered to do anything with me like dates or such.",

      "description": "Yesterday was my little brother's birthday, so my mom organized a little party only including our direct family and her brother's. My sister has been very distant from the family ever since she left home for university. However, whenever she does come home for someone's birthday or Christmas, she always drops off a couple of lottery tickets as presents before she heads off on her way.\n\nMy brother scratched off one of his tickets, and got a match. He wasn't too excited because we have won a few times over the years, but only actually got $5 max. He asked me to go out and redeem it because he wasn't 18 yet, and I was initially reluctant because we live out of town and the closest lotto is 30 minutes away. I told him I would go if he gave me half of what he won, and he agreed.\n\nI left to redeem the ticket, and I ended up winning $500, cash in hand. I was fucking stoked and rushed back home. When I told him and showed him the money, he was ecstatic. I handed $250, then he looked at me and said \"What the fuck.\" I asked him what was wrong and he told me to hand over the rest. After I tried to explained to him that we made a deal, he started getting mad and throwing a little tantrum. I tried reminding him that I spent almost $200 getting him one of those authentic football jersey of his favourite player, Neymar, but he was having none of it.\n\nThe rest of the family came over to find out what all of the ruckus was about, and my brother told our mom that I stole his money. I tried again to explain the situation, but he kept interrupting me and screaming that it was his lottery ticket, and his money. Our mom, stepped in and said that said that if we can't sort it out then she'll just take it, as she snatched it out of my brother's hands before attempting to do the same to me. I dodged her attempt and told her again that we made a deal, before she told me to give it. I yelled \"fuck this\" as I left and drove back to my college dorm a couple hours from home.\n\nAfter I got to my dorm was getting texts from my mom, brother, and a couple cousins telling me to come back home, or just saying that I was acting like a dick. I ignored everyone, but when I got a text from my sister (who I haven't really talked to for almost a year) which said \"I heard you won some money from my ticket\", I just replied with \"lmao, fuck off\".\n\nSo, am I really in the wrong for keeping half the money?\n\nTLDR: My brother won $500 off his lottery ticket after we agreed that we would split it 50/50. Now that he knows how much the ticket is worth, he wants to keep all of it.",

      "description": "So I (27M) was dating this girl (25F) for about a year or so, and I really loved her. I was really struggling with drugs &amp; alcohol, and one night while under the influence I slept with someone else. It actually happened several times over a few weeks. I didn't tell her right away, but when she did find out she told me she was breaking up with me unless I got help for my addiction. I refused at first, and she broke up, and I went on a four day bender. At the end of it, I went back to her and apologized and told her I knew I needed help and she forgave me and supported me through getting the help I needed. She also only believed it had happened once. Since I was essentially begging for forgiveness, correcting her felt like shooting myself in the foot and it also felt like a moot point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward two years--she found out it was more than one time. She is livid. I understand her point of view, but I also understand mine. She's saying our whole relationship is built on a lie--but if she can forgive one time cheating, is it so different if I did it many times? To be clear, I understand it was terrible, but it was also a horrible and dark time in my life that I'm unbelievably glad to be out of. AITA for not telling her from the start?",

      "description": "\nTo make this easier, I’ll come up with a name, let’s just call him Jim.\n   \nHe’s an online friend the same age as me, and we’re both from Britain, and this year our year group has some really “important” exams. Thing is, my friend seems to be studying or doing homework *all the time*, he has maybe an hour free time every day which I find ridiculous because I have many other friends my age from my country and while they’re all mostly revising and doing work, it’s not like its completely invading their life, and I still get to see them and hang out for longer than hour intervals, y’know?\n   \nAs well as this, I have a very big vendetta against the school system in this country, and he is well aware of this. Because of school and the way it works, as a person with aspergers, I have struggled immensely. I don’t know if trauma is the right word, but because of incidents with schools I’ve developed depression and anxiety. I can’t talk to any teachers or even consider home tutoring, let alone schooling because it causes me to have a panic attack and I just break down.\n   \nJim knows all of this, yet if I ever criticise the school system or suggest it’s less than good, he gets annoyed. I’ll just say something like “It’s stupid how much homework they give you” and he’ll get defensive. If I ever mention the school system is harmful he gets mad and says it’s not and that it’s all just me, and my fault for “being lazy and not doing what I’m told”.\n   \nI’ve asked him multiple times to please just stop talking to me about his school problems because it leaves a bad taste in my mouth and because if I ever dare criticise the fact he’s tasked with so much work he gets upset. I have lots of other friends who know I hate school and avoid bringing it up often so I don’t feel uncomfortable, but it seems to be the only thing Jim ever talks or thinks about anymore.\n   \nWe had a big argument a week ago because he was going on about exams again and I said that the people who run the schools are stupid or assholes or something like that. I don’t know if he agrees with me but is too prideful to admit he’s bending over backwards for a shit cause, or if he genuinely doesn’t see any problems because he has no problems, despite the statistics of school related depression rising.\n   \nI told him “I don’t want to talk to you anymore” and blocked him. He’s said nothing, despite being blocked for a week and me apparently being one of his closest friends. I’ve suspected sometimes that he doesn’t have so much work and that he just doesn’t want to talk to me but he convinced me it was just anxiety telling me that, but it seems clear he doesn’t care now so maybe I was right. I don’t know.\n   \nAm I justified in my anger, or am I overreacting? I just don’t want him to devalue everything thats happened to me just because *he* can fare well at school, and I want him to respect that I don’t want to talk about school anymore.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for one year. We were really close friends for two years, however she had a boyfriend during that time who she, according to her, felt stuck with and was neither emotionally, physically or mentally attracted to anymore. She ended up leaving him for me, constantly assuring me that she was over him months prior and that she felt nothing of the breakup. I knew this wasn't 100% the case but tread carefully anyway and let her lead the relationship.\n\nOver the last year, our relationship has become a bit emotionally and mentally abusive, with many red flags that we've been trying to work out. Mainly things like jealousy, gaslighting, being possessive etc on her behalf, towards me. Last Saturday, I couldn't handle the fighting anymore so decided to end the relationship. She didn't take it well and insisted that she was going to do anything to win me back. We'd been working through things during the week, until Wednesday when I did the stupid thing.\n\nI was suspicious that she was hiding something from me on Instagram. I knew she had her old phone in our house, so I did what any rational, trusting person would do (duh) and I charged the stupid thing up to have a snoop. I hadn't even gotten to Instagram before noticing her gallery app being an open tab, and noticing the photo currently open in the app. This led me to finding a folder of about 50 or so very x-rated photos of her having sex with her ex boyfriend. \n\nAs traumatic as that is in any circumstance, I understand that people have histories and things like this are likely to exist at some point. I'm personally completely against things like this, but can appreciate why people enjoy it.\n\nMy issue here is that she used this phone to contact me for 2 months before upgrading to a newer model. When I asked why she didn't just delete the folder when we started dating, she told me she had forgotten that it existed. There were certainly 5 different occasions which she accessed this folder while we were together, while she was telling me she loved me, that she wanted a future with me and would never do anything to jeopardize our relationship or my trust in her. \n\nAfter some pressing, she finally admitted that she kept it because, 2 months in to us, she thought she still loved her ex. However, has since retracted, and now keeps telling me that the photos were \"average\" and \"normal couple photos\", that the whole thing is stupid and that I'm completely overreacting and trying to find an excuse to leave the relationship.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\nTl;dr - I found out my girlfriend was keeping a folder of her own pornography on a phone she used while dating me, claims she forgot they existed despite sending me photos from the folder on 5 different occasions.

      "description": "Obligatory, this is a throwaway.\n\nI have been avoiding my dad at all costs. He calls almost 3 times a week and sometimes more. \n\nThe reason I avoid him is because I think I've been hurt enough by him. I have a difficult relationship with him. He was Jekyll and Hyde growing up. He rarely physically hit me, but he had no issue beating on my mom since I could remember, I would step in and he'd stop. They are separated now. He has a problem with alcoholism. He was also a good dad. He was openly affectionate and spoiled us when we were growing up. I think he tried his personal best. \n\nHe has psychological issues. To give you an idea of some of the stuff he'd do, I used to go out on walks at night. Maybe around 8 and I wouldn't go to far, just a few blocks down to a nearby park. I'd listen to music. I get that it's odd, but it was calming for me. My dad told me I was a prostitute. \n\nI struggled with severe chronic depression during my late teens. My dad would constantly tell me that it was all in my head and that what I had was laziness. \nI realize that he didn't understand my illness and in his own way he tried to help. But he made matters worse and yelled at the doctors for prescribing me antidepressants following my mental breakdowns.\nI learned a lot from him, from his mistakes, and from our conversations together. I know I need more therapy to work through this. \n\nI stopped needing my parents' help financially when I moved away to college. Anything I've asked of them since then, I've paid back. My dad's business closed down when the property owner decided to sell his property. My dad rented the space for his business. My dad struggles with paying rent and for his own basic necessities.\n\nMy brother lives with him and pays most of their bills, while my dad gets a few customers here and there that know him from when he had his business. I've given him some money and he's grateful for it, but he keeps wanting more. My oldest sister and my brother help him out the most. My second oldest sister and I do give from time to time. \n\nI call him on his birthdays and for Father's Day to wish him well. However, I ignore most of his calls when he calls.\n\nI know he's ill and his years of alcoholism have affected his illness to a higher degree. I don't know if I've forgiven him, sometimes I think I have, but other times I think I haven't. \n\nMy brother and oldest sister have asked me to contribute more money to help him. I reluctantly agreed. I don't want to help him. I don't know if that's justified and I feel extreme shame and guilt. I don't want my siblings to struggle with helping him either.\n\nI don't think I can mentally handle talking to him right now. I think I've run out of patience for my dad. I don't hate him or wish him ill will. I just don't want anything to do with him now. I feel selfish.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to help my dad in his time of need? \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So me and my ex recently had broken up. Within the last month or so.  I told him from the very beginning when he asked if we could still be friends, that I needed space and I needed time to get over him. He begged me not to block him and that he would not message me. Well that was a damn lie. He's been in contact with me almost every other day. Going between acting supportive and like he wants to help (I have a lot of medical issues and with that and this break up, depression and suicidal thoughts have been at an all time high) and then acting like a jerk (being passive aggressive. Telling me the Playboy smash tournament (which was part of the reason we broke up because I wasn't wanting to go with him. But even said I didn't care if he went alone) was on and that he was excited to go.) I asked him Everytime to respect my boundaries. I started just ignoring the messages because I didn't want to block him, I didn't want to be an asshole ex and didn't want him to worry about my health. Eventually I got tired of him liking all my posts so I set my account to private but didn't block him. He noticed right away. He texted me about it and I did not respond. Two days later I get a package in the mail.  Well several actually. Inside was a self help book for depression, a sunflower hat and sunflower jewelry (I love sunflowers) and a set of expensive bath bombs. I didn't order any of it but it was in my name and it was all stuff I've looked at in the past. Inside was several notes.  One said that he hopes this helps relax me. One said that he still cares about me and wants me to be happy. And the last said \"an early Valentine's day present\". This came with the earrings. I was, beyond pissed off. He wanted this break up and here he is not respecting my boundaries.  I went off on him and told him how fucked up it was to step up to this level just because I wasn't replying to him. He apologized and said he didn't mean it to be mean but that he felt bad and wanted something to make me smile. I don't believe it. He's not a bad guy by any means (well. He doesn't know how to handle emotions. He'd often laugh when I was hysterical and having panic attacks and call me ridiculous) but mostly wasn't too bad. But then he messaged my best friend. We were hanging out together and she posted on her story, a video of me watching TV while eating food. They had never talked before and weren't really friends. He threw a fit about me following his friends still, so I unfollowed them. Only to find that he still follows my friends. I went off. I exploded. Probably was an asshole and just told him everything I've been feeling and how much it's been hurting me and that now we can never be friends because he doesn't respect my boundaries. I blocked him on everything (he got mad and blocked me on a bunch of stuff first when I said I was sorry and that I would have to block him, because that's just who he is I guess). Was I the asshole for yelling at him? I just felt so much anger and needed him to know how badly this was hurting me and how much harder it was making this process. I feel like a jerk for getting mad and yelling at him (my idea of yelling is mostly just not holding back my emotions, which was just actually sadness about the situation). Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "My GF and I just got woken up to her friend blowing up her phone for a ride home. Her friend met some random at a bar earlier and took off to the casino with him. Her friend does this kind of thing all the time, and she has no license or car.  This was my one night this week to be home with my gf cuz of our work schedules. Her friend bailed on the guy she met and called until we woke up pleading for a ride home cuz she has no money for a cab. My gf goes thru this 2 or 3 nights a week and doesn't think she's being taken advantage of. I even offered to go get her tonight cuz the roads are snowy, but her friend toldher she doesn't feel comfortable with me driving her. I've never made an advance towards her or given her any reason to be distrust me. I only offered cuz my gf has to work at 6am and I'm off today. Am I wrong for telling her before she left to just leave her there and make her get a hotel room? My gf is pissed I even suggested her leaving her friend hanging. \n\nSorry if the thought process jumps around, its 1:15am and I'm sitting here half asleep waiting to make sure my gf makes it home safe.

We were going to live together in the fall next semester. We shared a friend group as he was friends with all of my current friends before me, so they all like him too. \n\nWhen I was 16 my best friend passed away due to leukemia and I was really depressed and down for a while and my mom used to constantly tell me to get over it and what's done is done so I'm kind of desensitized to loss and tend to get over it quickly. \n\n\nAnyway, after my bf died once of my close friends who I used to like was talking to me and said he was there for me, and I didnt' really need emotional support but we started talking and seeing each other 2 weeks ago. I told my friend about it today and she flipped and two of my other close friends texted me and said what I was doing was fucked up and it's too soon. And now I got a message from my ex-bf's sister telling me to never talk to her or family again and some other mean things (idk how she even found out).\n\nI don't know what I really did wrong, I never cheated on my ex, I did pay my respects after he passed, but it's like I'm supposed to wait some arbitrary amount of time until I'm allowed to go out with people again?\n",

She tells me she had kind of made plans with A, another friend of hers and she’s not sure if she’ll come. I like A a lot and I didn’t have a problem with it since I know she can’t get out much, but by Thursday, A hadn’t responded to J’s texts, so at about 10, she says she’ll come with me.\n\nNow at 1:30, J has a class with D, her other best friend. D is angry at me atm because I made a joke about her, to her, a month ago, never told me it made her mad, doesn’t act mad, just complains to all our friends about it. D tells J that she wants her and A to hang out today. Even though A still hasn’t said anything about showing up, J decides to go with her. \n\nJ texts me and lets me know. Since my day’s entire trajectory has changed, I decide to go home (I didn’t have a class, I was waiting to go with her) but I need to give her a key she left with me first. When I gave her the key, she apologized for the third or so time and I said “You’ve already apologized and made your decision. I’m gonna be melodramatic about it either way, so stop apologizing.” We said our goodbyes, and now I’m at home.\n\nTLDR: AITA for being a little pissed of that my best friend blew off plans to go hang with one person who hates me and another who might not even show up.",

      "description": "I moved to NZ about 14 months ago, when i first touched down an old friend (who moved here quite some time ago) offered to collect me from the airport. As she was one of the reasons I wanted to visit and had also insisted I crash at hers, I gladly accepted her offer, especially after a 28 hour flight. She was three hours late. And this is where the problems began.\n\nDuring the trip from Auckland to Wellington, which took three days, she insisted I pay for accommodation, petrol and food. I felt this was ok because of her generosity and also because I was jet lagged as hell and wanted as little fuss as possible. \n\nWhen we arrived I was then expected to cook for her (I'm a chef, but I actually detest cooking a lot of the time), to pay for more petrol and to share whatever groceries I'd bought. But more often or not, she would just take what she wanted regardless. Again, as she was offering me accommodation rent-free, I acted \"ok\" about this. But then my NZ bank decided to cock-up my money transfer from my UK account and it took a few weeks of yelling at both banks for them to sort it out. I had a reasonable amount of cash in my bank that had previously transferred just fine, but I watched it vanish due to her demands. She'd ask to go to the pub, but would ALWAYS \"forget\" her purse. She would kindly offer to let me tag along when she went to the supermarket but would then insist I paid for petrol. At the time I smoked, she claimed she had quit but would ALWAYS ask for a roll-up, one time I was running low of tobacco (I smoke hand rolled) so I politely explained as much. She stormed off in a huff and called me a \"selfish prick\"\n\nThen her flatmate told me that her friend had just had a room open up, and was happy for me to pay in arrears once my bank sorted it's shit out. I moved grabbed my stuff and food and moved in ASAP. I then got shitty messages from her demanding I bring half my food back because it was \"hers\". She was particularly irritated that i took \"her\" eggs. I told her no and she had a full-blown mental breakdown. Started acting the victim, bringing up stuff that had zero relevance to this drama she had created, and just generally making me feel worthless. The aforementioned housemate said she was genuinely unnerved by her reaction. \n\nThen it hit me. Her lateness ALL THE TIME. The fact she repeatedly spent forever getting ready to go out, typically trying to find her sunglasses (even though we typically went out at night), her neediness. The girl has some pretty serious mental issues. Maybe a combination of NPD and anxiety disorder. I decided to try and make amends. Her, her boyfriend, her housemate and I decided to celebrate Christmas together. I agreed to cook and we agreed to all buy one another gifts. I spent ages trying to get all three of them presents that they'd actually want. I bought the housemate a portable speaker as hers had recently broke. I bought her fella cinema tickets as he is a huge film nerd. I bought my crazy friend an expensive box of mixed cheeses and crackers (cheese is disgustingly expensive in NZ) as she adored cheese. \n\nShe bought me an egg-cup and bitched that I didn't get her a cinema ticket. An egg-cup she had found in a box outside a second-hand store. I know this because I was fucking with her when she found it. \n\nI pretty much made up my mind to get the fuck out of Wellington as soon as I could after that, which I did. But now I feel guilty. I've painted all of her bad points, but she is truly a wonderful human being, I've known her for 20 years and she has always been there for me and I feel that I should be there for her. Every time I see a message pop up from her I get anxious, and rarely respond with anything other than a few words or not at all. It's been about a year now, do you think I should apologise? Maybe just keep her at arms length? Am I an asshole?\n \n",

      "title": "AITA for not paying my friend to be in my short films?",
      "description": "Ever since I was in middle school, I've made short films because I have a passion for film-making and I've asked some of my friends to help act in them. We always had a fun time doing it, no matter how bad the movie ended up being. One friend in particular, Zack, has been one of my go-to actors and we've never had any issues making these movies.\n\nWe're in college now and we still make short films, but the past couple of months have been pretty tense and difficult. There was the first incident when I noticed that Zack didn't seem to be giving his all in one of his performances. I asked him what's wrong and he didn't say anything. That went on for a few days and then I decided to just ask again. He then tells me that he wants me to start paying him for starring in my movies. I thought that was a bit of an odd request. I don't pay any other actors and while I do make these recent movies more seriously since I'm older, there's still an element to them that's just for fun. I'm a college student. I can't afford paying someone a salary that he was asking. He was asking for $100 for every scene he was in and I told him that I can't do that.\n\nAfter that, we went inside my house and my mom popped in and asked how things were going. Zack responds by flipping her off. He got kicked out, but he came back the next day and offered an apology, which my mom accepted, but things between them are still tense. And after that, Zack just stopped caring about my movies. He told me that he wanted out, but we were halfway through the shooting of this film and it would be detrimental to recast and start over again. But I promised that once this movie was done, he wouldn't have to be in any films. \n\nBut a few weeks ago, when production was done, I told him and my other actors that we'd be screening the short film at a film festival in New York. I got all of my actors together and told them that I'd be flying them out to NYC on an all expenses paid trip. This is what I'd been saving my money for and everyone except Zack was excited. Zack's response was \"That's it?\" and he starts complaining about not being paid and having to be flown out to a \"dump\". Then he leaves and he starts saying under his breath \"Fucking waste of time.\" Now it's just a few more days until we got to New York and Zack has told me that he's not going. He says that I don't deserve him since I refused to pay him. He says that he needs money and he needs career security, but I told him that he knew from day one in middle school that this was just for fun and that he's dumb to expect \"career security\" from me. I told him to just start applying for jobs, but he claims that I owe him.\n\nWho's the asshole here? A few years ago, I actually caught Zack fucking one of my old girlfriends in my own bed and I was dumb enough to forgive him for that and now it would seem that he feels like he can get away with anything after that. But with this whole movie-making thing, I want to know who's in the wrong.",

Gf literally just plays with him and leaves all the responsibility on me.  We’ve fought about it a bunch.  She always claims that I’m not home and she does take him out.  If she really did he wouldn’t be shitting near the back door.  He obviously wants to go out. \n\nI never signed up for a dog.

      "description": "So I (F22) and my best friend (M22) have know each other for about three years &amp; usually get along really well. We met at college, and I just graduated while he is not graduating for a few more months. This is relevant because at our university, which is located in the Midwest of the U.S., drinking &amp; going out to bars/parties is a huge part of our “culture.” \n\nHe has OCD, as well as dealing with anxiety (I have anxiety too, which is relevant later) &amp; a lot of insecurities due to being bisexual but growing up very religious. His family does not know about his sexuality, he goes to great lengths to keep his school-life and family-life separate. I think because of his mental health, and having to suppress his true feeling for so long around his parents, he has a lot of repressed emotions. The problem being, when he drinks, he behaves erratically &amp; all those emotions come pouring out.\n\nAn example: last time we went out to a bar, he had about 7-8 drinks (over the course of 4 hours) and when I got him and two other friends to leave and go out to the car (I was sober, I rarely drink) he stumbled off across a snowy field and spent 10 minutes kicking snowdrifts, falling down, and yelling at the sky that he “deserves this” and he’s a “bad person.” \n\nThe past couple times that we’ve gone to a bar, he’s gotten upset with me that I don’t drink because I “bring the mood down” of the group. He will buy me drinks and then get upset when I don’t drink them (I did not ask for them). He wants me to drink so that I’ll feel more comfortable/free, because that’s how he feels when he drinks, but can’t seem to grasp WHY I don’t like drinking, which is that it makes me feel paranoid and I always have a terribly anxiety-ridden day the day after I drink. \n\nI don’t like being sober when he gets like this, but I think if I was tipsy or even drunk when he began behaving like this, it would be even worse, because I might not be able to calm him down/coax him to go home, etc.\n\nSo tell me reddit, AITA for bringing the mood down?\n\nTl;dr: best friend always wants me to go to the bars &amp; get drunk with him, I go but don’t drink/have one drink because a) drinking makes me feel paranoid and b) he behaves erratically when drunk &amp; I feel like one of us at least needs to be sober. He gets upset with me and tells me I have to drink because I am “bringing the mood down.”\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for preventing my roommate from getting a new dog to replace her dead one?",
      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons. \n\nHey guys, so I live in a 2-bedroom apartment with my two roommates, we'll call them Emily and Jane. We're all seniors in college and have been living in this apartment for about a year and a half now. This past summer Emily decided to get an emotional support animal after her bunny of 10 years died, only this time she wanted a dog. Immediately, Jane and I had our doubts because Emily can be very self-absorbed, lazy, and very questionably able to take care of an animal with as many needs as a dog. However, we told her we would be okay with it as long as she met certain basic conditions like walking it, making sure it doesn't disturb our sleep/other needs, cleaning up after it....etc.\n\n Fast forward to September when she brings in this puppy she got from a luxury breeder, and the next few months are--to put it mildly--pretty fucking hard. It took the dog an insanely long time to get potty trained, and up until last week she was still peeing and pooping in random areas of the apartment. But here's the big thing: this dog was NEVER WALKED. The dog was in our apartment for WEEKS on end without so much as seeing the outside, and regardless of how many times we raised concerns over this our roommate claimed that because it was \"cold\" it was better to let the dog get some exercise at home (which, by the way, means throwing toys around for her to chase in a circle.) \n\nAnyway, two days ago, after the 8 month old puppy was left alone in Emily's room for three hours, we all came home to find her having what we later realized was a prolonged seizure. By the time we got to the vet she had died. The vet later told me privately that it was no surprise this happened if the dog was never walked and was left alone often: anxiety and deprivation from stimulation can be easy seizure triggers that are fatal. Not only that, but when Emily called the breeder to let him know, he told her none of his other puppies had ever gone through something like this. \n\nJane and I thought Emily would be destroyed and we did everything we could to make it better. Imagine our SURPRISE when, after her mother flies in the NEXT DAY, they're talking about getting another puppy next WEEK from the SAME BREEDER. Her mother says Emily lost her emotional support animal and needs a new one to get through this. Neither of them seem to see that this untimely death is very much related to the way Emily took care of this dog. Jane and I are in shock. We absolutely do not want another dog to go through the life the previous one had. We just don't know what to do. AITA for preventing this from happening somehow? And how would I even do this? It's not like I can tell my roommate who is depressed that her dog died because of her.",

      "description": "First off we need some backstory, I am a quiet kid that usually does not stand up from himself. In my ELA class and Advisory I have a kid in my class that is really just a jerk, not a bully, but not a nice kid. This dude is pretty messed up and does not really do his work in class. We will call him K, because his name starts with K.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was reading my book and talking to some people in my advisory class, my advisory teacher is really chill and does not really care if you talk. She then told us that there would be a fire drill in a few minutes, so I put down my book. My eyes were wandering around, waiting for the alarm to blare, but then something caught my eye. I saw K was on his phone looking at a photo of a guy wearing no shirt and having googles on. He then scrolled down a little bit and the dudes butt was on full display.  I looked at his face because I was wondering if this was just something random in his Instagram fee, but K had a full blown smile on his face and liked the picture. He liked the picture, he liked a PORN picture in school! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would have confronted K about it right then, but the fire alarm went off. We went outside for a few minutes then came back, so I decided to confront him there when he was alone (I did not want to embarrass him, you never know, it could have been a meme). I went up to him and asked him why he was looking at porn in school and he denied all claims. I asked him if it was a meme, but he said he did not look at anything inappropriate. I kept on asking questions, but when he did not tell me anything I decided I had to put him on the hotspot, so I decided to ask him in front of his friends. When  K was with his friends he changed his mind and said it was a meme, so I told his friends how he already said it was not a meme. At this point advisory already ended and I had to go walk to my next class, a class I have with a lot of my friends that has a lot of time to walk (PE).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw my friends in the hall, and told them the story. I did not really feel the need to tell them it was gay porn right away, but whenever I found out he had a girlfriend I did. In PE I told all of my friends the story, they already knew K was messed up and a bit weird, but they never thought he would look at porn on his phone IN SCHOOL. I shared the story only to my close friends because I did not want to shame him in front of everyone, even though K makes fun of people in public all the time. But then I got an idea to extract revenge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got the thought of telling his girlfriend that he was watching gay porn in school. I have been thinking it over for the past few days, but I don't know if that would be a horrible thing to do. K is a jerk, but does he deserve possibly loosing his girlfriend?

      "description": "Tl;dr: GF went out with her friends. She then sent me videos of her dancing with two guys at someone's house. I got angry. \n\nSorry if I get a bit incomprehensible, I've got quite a lot of drinks in my system. I'll give you a bit of backstory:\n\nI've been with my girlfriend for a half a year. We knew each other for a few years but we started dating just recently. I've moved into her city for a university and we really hit it off. We've got a lot of in common, we like the same movies, we like to take walks, we have similar sense of humor etc \n\nThe issue of cheating never really crossed my mind since everything was great. Her family likes me, my family likes her and I'm even planning to help her brother build a PC as a kind of bonding experience.\n\nI never wanted to isolate her from her friends, so whenever she wanted to go out with them (a mix of male and female friends) I had no issue. But this Friday seemed a bit off.\n\nI've been out of town due to some family thing and she went out to a bar with her friends again. I've been working well into the night so I expected some texts or photos from her, as was the usual. She sent some things but around midnight she sent me goodnight message. I asked her if she was at home, she said no and that she didn't want to text afterwards. I've been okay with that, she's been drinking after all.\n\nAt around 2 am she sent me two videos on Snapchat. In them, she was singing and dancing with two of her male friends at someone's house. I didn't see anyone else in the videos, so I assumed they were alone in there. She sent me a message at 5 am that she was finally home and going to sleep.\n\nWhen I saw that in the morning, I got really angry. I didn't tell her though, even though I probably should. She even asked me if I'm angry and I said no but I'm pretty sure she can tell that I'm not ok since I haven't been texting her at all.\n\nAm I wrong to get angry in this situation?",

      "description": "Backstory: My mother bought me Minecraft (so I can play with my friends as other games were starting to get boring) and in return, I'm supposed to wash the dishes for a month. We have a dishwasher so I just rinse off any mess and put them in which makes it easier.\n\nMore backstory: My family is getting this rule out where you MUST rinse your plate (no need to see your dried up rice and other stuff) and if you don't, you'll be forced to rinse it off. Onwards to the story!\n\nSo this happened last night, I was just rinsing the dishes and what happened was, I saw two really nasty plates (they had food dried on them) and asked my mother who's they were. She responded by saying it was her and my sisters and at which point I didn't snap, but I told her off\n\nI said to her that if I'm dealing with this kind of mess, I'm not watching your dishes since this is a rule that has been enforced in our house and if I'm getting yelled yelled at for not rinsing my dishes, why should I give them the benefit of the doubt? She said that she'd start doing them without really paying attention (or she was and was cutting me off, I couldn't tell) and I said that, for this time, I'll do them but if I see that there is a mess like this, I'm not washing them.\n\nYeah so an innocent post for this and I've been wondering about it, note I'm a 15 year old male. (Yes I do play Minecraft, a game is a game and if I enjoy it, don't make me try to NOT play it) so in case my age helps decide a factor then hope it helps :)",

      "description": "My ex and I have been divorced for over ten years and he has had custody of the kids for the last six years.  I pay child support, and an never late and routinely pick up the tab for additional clothes and sports fees and other outings.\n\nTwo years ago my ex took me to court to get more child support, but he didn't figure on the judge ordering me to pay for the kids' insurance, which is exactly what she did.  The monthly amount I pay doubled, but my ex didn't get any increase.  As a matter of fact he now has to split copays and any thing not covered by insurance with me, including braces.  \n\nWhen this first occurred and it didn't work out in court like he thought it would, he told the kids that I had taken him back to court to try to pay less and that I convinced the judge to let me pay for insurance.  He told my daughter that her braces weren't covered with the new insurance and they were going to come \"take the braces out of her mouth\" bc of what I had done.  \n\nHe initially refused to tell me how much the cost of the braces were, and I advised him that the court order says I am to see a bill before I pay.  He then had the orthodontist's office call me to tell me the total cost.  We agreed that I would pay him half the monthly payment each month.  I paid him that amount (in money orders for proof) until November.\n\nIn November, I was short on time so I gave him cash instead of a money order, but also at that time I had another envelope of money to pay a different bill.  I slipped up and gave him the wrong envelope, with almost twice as much money in it.  He texted me and asked why I had paid him so much extra money.  I told him I had made a mistake and needed to swap the envelopes back and he refused.  He said I owed him for other doctors visits.  \n\n(My insurance offers several services for free, but he takes the children to a different provider and has to pay. I told him I wasn't paying for half that bc there is a perfectly fine free option and he chooses not to use it.)\n\nSo after this, I just started paying the orthodontist directly instead of him.  My children have berated me for not paying their dad the money \"like I'm supposed to\".  AITA for not paying him, and paying the provider instead?",

I told him I have no problem showing you if for some reason you want to see something but giving all my passwords was too much. Yes, we are in a relationship and don’t/shouldn’t have secrets, but am I not entitled to that small amount of privacy, even if I’m not hiding anything? \n\nHe’s done many questionable things in our past to break my trust but moving forward in our relationship i basically let it all go once I felt comfortable. I figured I wanted to be with this person so all I could do was trust he wouldn’t make the same mistakes and move on. Now, I know his passwords. Not because I asked for them, though. For 1) he uses practically the same password for lots of things and 2) he has asked me to log into —— to find something or do something. I don’t snoop. I made it a point not to because I feel like that’s unhealthy. I don’t want to become obsessed with know what he’s doing or who he’s talking to, etc. I give him his privacy. \n\nAfter explaining it was an invasion of my privacy, he managed to turn it around and call me “sketchy”, not understanding at all where I am coming from. I’m so incredibly hurt by this &amp; we’ve gotten into a huge argument over it. He is pushing his insecurities into me &amp; I feel like it’s not fair to me since I am so trusting to him despite his lies in the past but that trust is not being reciprocated.\n\nPlease, AITA?

      "description": "*(Disclaimer: Technically I did not \"pull\" it. It was one of [these things](https://images.by.prom.st/77608428_w640_h640_pozharnaya-signalizatsiya.jpg) with a button. Also, English is not my native language.)*\n\nI live in a large apartment building. One night last year, some genius three floors below me decided to have a cigarette in his bed. He barely escaped with his life. Had he not activated the fire alarm on his way out, people would have died and the building would be gone.\n\nThis AITA incident occurred a few nights ago. It was close to midnight. I was working on schoolwork when I smelled smoke. The scent got stronger over the next several minutes. I opened my front door and it was even worse in the hallway. Scared with that memory on my mind, I pressed the fire alarm and ran downstairs before calling the firefighters.\n\nWhen they got here, they smelled the smoke but found no danger. We had to wait outside in the cold for 2 hours. I felt a bit bad about putting everyone through that before a workday.\n\nAnd yesterday I was talking to my neighbour about this in the lift. He asked if I knew who pressed the alarm (I was one of the first people out). I told him I did. He called me a bitch and told me I wasted everyone's time. I talked to my friend later that day, and he agreed with my neighbour. My friend said I should have just left on my own if I was scared.\n\nPersonally, I would rather be woken up by a fire alarm than woken up trapped by fire in my room. Hearing their thoughts was a surprise. AITA?\n\ntldr I thought the apartment building was on fire but it wasn't.",

      "description": "I was at an early family Christmas party and there weren't many seats at the house. Everyone ended up having to share seats with each other. My sister happened to be sitting with me and I thought I could make a quick joke about her taking up too much space and that we would just laugh it off. \n\nI started off by saying, \"Geez could you take up any more room?\" then cut if off there and immediately apologized saying how it was only a joke. She replied saying that it wasn't very funny, therefore making it not a joke and said that I was making fun of/bullying her. I told her that something can be a joke and not be funny, which it was in this case, and she seemed to disagree once again. She said that if it really was a joke then I could say it to anyone and it would be funny, so I proceeded to do so.\n\nI looked over to my uncle and told him he is taking up too much space and everyone who heard started laughing, proving my point correct and hers wrong. This is the point where she left the room and an aunt came in and told me that she was crying. \n\n AITA for making a stupid joke that someone took seriously?",

      "description": "A bit of context. I am traveling in Australia at the moment and have been staying at a hostel in Melbourne for the last few months. Recently I managed to start a group playing Dungeons and Dragons, which is one of my passions. I taught a group of seven people how to play and we're running through a short campaign. I have put a lot of effort into preparing and running the game, regularly hourspreparing both my stuff and the players' (since they don't know the rules yet), as well as my own money on printing and dice.\n\nEnter my roommate C. C has been in my room for the last week or so. To begin with we didn't really talk much, until he invited me and two other roommates out for lunch (both roommates also players in my game and my friends). When we went to lunch it was clear that C was a very intense person, shouting and laughing incredibly loudly in a public restaurant, punching me in a friendly manner. He also tends to be a little domineering, he will go on loud rants and shout angrily if you interrupt him. \n\nOver the next week, his behaviour became increasingly erratic. He had a long rant about typical 'nice guy' stuff and shouted at me when I tried to cut him off. At one point he had a go at me and the other roommates for 'excluding him', which is maybe a fair comment but somewhat natural given that we have been in the same room for weeks and are close friends. He also regularly got in my personal space despite me asking not to. On Friday we played D&amp;D again and he turned up at 3, not having told me he was coming. I politely told him that since I didn't know he was playing I didn't have a character for him, but I'd be happy to make one with him for next time. He was visibly sad but accepted this. At this point I fully intended to let him play next time.\n\nYesterday, he again looked down so we asked him what was wrong and he told us his very sad life story, which I won't go into. Feeling sorry for him, I went out for lunch and had a pint with him. Alone, he was pleasant, if a little strange and the aforementioned obnoxiously loud. That night, we four had a few drinks and played some hands of poker. As the game progressed, C got worse and worse. He was as ever loud, but also rude, harrying people to take their turn while dragging his out as much as possible. After the poker, we kept drinking and his behaviour got worse and worse. He swore repeatedly at all of us, which is not something that bothers me but the two girls are kinda young and one of them took it to heart. He also made a pass at the other girl, despite being ten years her senior and her clear lack of interest (I feel some what fraternal towards these two girls as they are very young and kinda sensitive). I frequently asked him to chill out, at which he would apologise, and then quickly revert to form.\n\nMy concern is this: the members of my D&amp;D group are new to the game. Several of them have expressed concerns about playing with him, and some are quite timid. I already find it challenging to run the game as it's a large group and they are all new. C has already exhibited behaviour that suggests he would not cooperate or listen, would be domineering and rude. Furthermore, the one time I've played a different game with him was not enjoyable. AITA if I tell him that I can't let him join the game? Given he is clearly a lonely person with some legitimate issues of his own, will I just be being selfish?",

      "description": "So some context for you guys. My grandparents took me in when I was younger after my mum abandoned me. They gave me a home, fed and clothed me, and encouraged me to strive for a higher education. My father was never really in my life. So they not only saved me from possible homelessness, but they also became even more important to me than my parents ever were.\n\nThe 3 or 4 days leading up to the surgery weren't so hard for me. But, as the day grew closer it would pop into my head more and my depression and anxiety quickly dug in roots. I had brought it up multiple times to my girlfriend and my best friend the days leading up to this incident because they noticed an obvious change in my my overall demeanor. It ended up becoming a reoccurring topic that always ended with the typical \"everything will be alright\" from them which was very appreciated. But sometimes that's not enough you know? I work in the medical field which means I'm unfortunately aware of all the things that can go wrong before and after that invasive of a surgery.\n\nThe night before his surgery I could not fall asleep. My girlfriend, of nearly three years, was over at my apartment and we'd been lying in bed for an hour or so and all I could do was toss and turn. I got up because I needed to go to the bathroom and decided I'd lurk through Reddit to distract my mind until I was tired enough to fall asleep. At this point it's around 2am and my GF sleepily asks me where I'm going. I say I'm just going to the bathroom and that she should go back to sleep. I didn't want her to worry about me more since we had just talked about it, but I knew I needed space to just get my mind off of everything. \n\nI keep trying to get up and go back to bed but before I even reach my room my anxiety would peak again and I'd sit right back down. A few hours pass and my GF comes out of the room, looks at me like she's pissed, and says \"what are you doing? Are you even coming to bed tonight?\". I explain that I can't sleep because I'm pretty anxious, and that I just need some space to chill out before I go to sleep. I say she should just go to sleep and that it's okay. She sighs and goes back in my room. \n\nShe comes out less than 30 minutes later fully dressed, with all her things packed, and says she is getting an uber home. She angrily states it doesn't make sense for her to stay if I'm not going to sleep with her and if I'm going to be so weird. Needless to say I'm pretty pissed at this point. I (as calmly as I could) clarified that she understood why I was not coming to bed. She said she understood I was anxious and needed space but it was still weird and she didn't understand the point of staying if we weren't sleeping in bed together. \n\nHonestly still pretty hurt and we haven't talked much since she left.\n\nAITA? Any suggestions on what to do?",

      "description": "There is a lot of backstory and context to establish here, so if you don’t have time feel free to skip to the bottom.\n \n\nMy brother has been in a ton of relationships since middle school and me being the adoring little sister, I’ve tried to be buddy-buddy with all of them. Sometimes they weren’t around long enough for that, but I did my best to be as friendly as possible. My brother has been divorced twice now and he’s turning 28 in a few days. The most recent marriage was to my best friend, whom he all convinced was “the one” after knowing her for about 3 months. It was completely mutual, they had fallen in love, and he married her even though my mother straight up told him it was a terrible idea. I had suggested they try to wait until they knew each other better, but of course I was overjoyed that my brother and best friend loved each other. They married on April 1st and were pregnant about 3 months later. She had severe post partum depression, which I didn’t recognize because I had never been around it and I thought everything was fine. I don’t remember exactly the timing of this, but at one point a friend of my best friend (the wife) was having a really hard time with life so they let her move in to help her get back on her feet. I think she lived there for about two years, and after probably the first 6 months my best friend started trying even harder to help her friend get a game plan for getting out on her own again. It didn’t really work and it was clear to everybody that the friend had overstayed her welcome and wasn’t really trying to better herself at all. My best friend started asking my brother to help her with basically kicking the friend out, but in a supportive “you need to get your shit together” way. He always skirted around it and nothing ever happened. So all that to say that although the friend lived there for about 2 years, it wasn’t a welcome thing that whole time.\n\n \nFast forward to the summer of 2017 when my brother invited me over to “talk”. My best friend was not there, and neither was the friend that had been living with them. He informed me that he had been tricked into marrying my best friend and never really loved her, that they’d split up, and that the friend had moved out as well. Now, anybody that knew my brother at any point in his life would know beyond a shadow of a doubt that nobody makes him do anything he doesn’t want to do. Ever. I was heartbroken and confused. I called my best friend to try to figure out what was going on. She said that my brother had asked for a break so she had been staying with her parents for 2 weeks, since my brother wouldn’t have had anywhere to go if he had wanted to leave for the break (he’s basically hated my parents since he was a teen). She told me she still loved him with all of her heart and would do whatever it took to repair their relationship. I tried talking to my brother again about what had happened and all of the details, spent hours putting together a cute little slideshow of photos of them set to a song he had sung her at their wedding, begged him to find any spark of love he still had for her in her heart… I could see in his eyes and actions that he was done, and had been for quite some time. I got pretty darn angry at him and basically stopped talking to him. I essentially “sided” with my best friend after that, mostly because it was very clear that she needed my support much more than he did. She was heartbroken, devastated, utterly confused. The next year was a nightmare as he fought for a divorce that she didn’t want. My brother treated her like garbage, basically gas lighted her, manipulated her and everybody else. He was suddenly buddy-buddy with my parents and had convinced my whole family that my best friend was evil. And since I was “siding” with her, I was shunned as well. By no means do I condone all of my best friend’s actions – she made some very desperate and hasty decisions along the way – but it was consistently clear to me that she still loved my brother and ultimately wanted reconciliation. There was a final divorce hearing to split up personal property (my brother hadn’t let my best friend get anything from their house) and I knew my best friend was having a hard time, so I visited her at the courthouse for lunch. All I had intended to do was hug her, be there for her, have some lunch, and go back to work. The poor woman was crying and shaking and throwing up. I couldn’t leave her and in hindsight I have realized this was not the wisest choice. I stayed and sat with her family in the courtroom, opposite my parents. Things hadn’t been super great between my parents and I throughout this whole process, but of course that was the nail in the coffin. They stopped talking to me for a couple of weeks. I didn’t get to see my dad for Father’s Day. And the divorce had been finalized (summer of 2018), so of course my best friend was miserable. It was a really, really shitty time. I had also just gotten married a few months after my brother first told me they had split up, so the stress (and my sometimes over-involvement) was taking a toll on our relationship as well. Eventually there was a family meeting where we barely scratched the surface of everything that had transpired and then decided that we were a big happy family again, and that we would all purpose to actually talk about stuff now. Oh and at the meeting, I found out my parents had been split up for a couple of months and were also getting divorced. My parents were at least talking to me again, but things were still pretty tense between my brother and I.\n\n \nIt was like that for a long time until this last Christmas. My brother texted me a week before our family get-together letting me know that he would be bringing HER. The friend who had been living with them. He claimed that she was his soulmate and that she was family. He also let me know they he would be announcing the gender of their baby. She had gotten pregnant two months after the divorce had been finalized. I was infuriated and let him know that I would not be attending the family get-together anymore, and would see the rest of the family individually instead. He asked me to meet him for coffee, so I did. We talked for a couple of hours and although I was still pissed, I agreed to be at the Christmas party so as not to ruin it for the rest of my family. I specifically told my brother that I would not be all buddy-buddy with this woman. I would be cordial, and that was all. He said they both understood.\n \n\nAnd now we get to the relevant part of this story. My brother texted me last night saying that his new baby momma wanted me to text her, presumably about planning my brother’s birthday party (oh, and my brother refused to be at my birthday party a few months ago because seeing me “hurt him too much”). On the one hand I’m at least grateful that they’re asking instead of him just giving her my number. On the other hand I really just want to say no. I’d be fine with us having each other’s numbers for emergencies but I don’t want to talk to her. I don’t want to plan my brother’s birthday party with her. I’m not so sure I even want to go to my brother’s birthday party. Am I the asshole if I say no?\n\n\n \nTLDR; My brother married my best friend, they had a child together, three years later he told everybody that he had been tricked into marrying her and never loved her. They divorced early summer of 2018. This last Christmas he announced the gender of the baby he’s having with the woman who had lived with them for about 2 years while they helped her get back on her feet.  Needless to say, I’m not happy with either of them. My brother’s new baby mama now wants me to text her about planning my brother’s birthday party and.. I really don’t want to talk to her at all. Am I the asshole for saying no?\n",

      "description": "So, first of all im on mobile, now that thats out of the way lets begin\n\nThis story starts just at the begining of the school year in september. I was 16 and had never been in a relationship before. I was (and still am) bad with social skills and have a hard time making friends irl. But online is where i shine. So in september i was playing VRchat (i dont anymore) and met this girl. She seemed sweet and we became friends. We friend each other on discord and talk a lot. Im gonna call her K.\n\n So K texts me a few days later saying she likes me. I, the 16 year old autist i am, take this and we get in a relationship. And when this happens, the red flags show. Turns out she is suicidal, a furry (i dont have a thing against you people) and manipulative. But not in a normal sense. She would pressure me into seeing her nude. There was a time she sent me furry porn during class (it was a miscommunication). She had one rule for me, and im glad i didnt listen to her looking back. It was to not tell anyone.\n\n 2 weeks go by and i tell someone who she says is her ex. After that she breaks up with me. Me, being devastated. Tries to get her back. But it fails and i forget about her.(my mom went missing so i was focused on that). After about a week i see that im not blocked on snapchat and i decide to see how she is.\n\nIt turns out she blamed me for ruining her life, of which she cut herself (again) and had to go to the hospital. And (allegedly, but likely not) burned down a house. Thats when i decided to just get rid of her. And the last thing i sent her was.\n\n\"Cool😎\"\n\nThis expirience would come to ruin my next relationship( another story i will do later). But i do want to know\nAm i an asshole for not listening?\n",

      "description": "So today my girlfriend invited me over to her place to chill with her while she got high on a psychedelic, just to like chill. I currently don't have a car or cell phone, so the plan originally was that she drop me off in the morning at my mom's place, and then my mom drop me back off at her place around 4 or 5 this afternoon while my gf is tripping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, when we woke up this morning, my girlfriend asked me to stay, and I said sure, as long as I get the chance to go by my dorm to pick up some study material. We do that, hang out for around thirty minutes, and then she gets high. This was around 2, and she decided to go for a walk for a couple of hours after it hit. That was fine with me, I figured she'd be back around the time we originally planned to hang out (she confirmed this saying she'd be gone for around two hours.) Since college students in general can be a bit iffy with times i figured I'd assume she'd get back about an hour after that and was still okay with that, and started on my studying. I also had time to do some artwork for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree-ish hours go by, its now six o'clock, and I'm wondering where she is. It's dark out, and I'm concerned, and honestly quite bored sitting in her room with only my computer. I contact her and she says she isn't going to be back for another two hours. She suggests I socialize with her three (male) roommates until she gets back. I have social anxiety particularly around men due to a traumatic experience, and she's aware of this, so I felt this was kind of inconsiderate. In addition, since I don't have a functioning phone, I can't contact any of my friends to get a ride back to my dorm. I could walk, but it's about an hour walk and it's honestly not safe for a small female such as myself, especially considering I don't have my phone. I could get a ride from her roommates as well, but I feel this also puts them in kind of an unfair situation and I don't really want to involve them particularly when the worst thing that'll happen from me staying until she gets here is hurt feelings and boredom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know there aren't any huge negative consequences of this, and my girlfriend really DOES do a lot for me and is amazing aside from this and is generally super understanding of my anxiety, but I'm incredibly stressed. I feel like she kind of put me in an unfair situation, but I also feel like I'm making a big deal out of nothing especially because does so much else for me and it makes me feel ungrateful that I'm not happy with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: GF ditched me for a five hour walk while she got high aita for being upset even though other than this she's great?",

      "description": "  \n\nIt's a long and petty one, boys, so TL;DR at the bottom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I went to a Shen-Yun performance, and we stopped to get Panda Express on the way home. When the person at the window asks if we want any sauce. My husband asks me if I wanted sauce, and I said, \"Yes, please! Lots of Mandarin sauce. I want 2 or 3.\" My husband tells the person at the window “Mandarin sauce”. I said, \"Can you ask for extra sauce, please? Like 2 or 3\". He just says, \"We'll see how much they give us\". So, we wait. When we got our food, I checked and said, \"They only gave us one\". He sits there, looks at me for 5 seconds, and starts driving off. I was a little astounded and asked why he didn't ask for more sauce, and he gets mad that I would be upset over sauce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said that he didn't know they'd only give me one, so I said that I told him they only gave us one. He said, \"Well, you should have asked them for more sauce\". I said that he was the one in the driver seat, so why didn't he ask? I didn't think I had to ask from the passenger seat, especially because he didn't say he wanted me to. Regardless, he drove off before I had the chance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe has an outburst telling me that I always let tiny things ruin my day. If I don't get sauce or if I see dirty dishes left out on the counter for a few days, I just make him and everyone miserable \"every goddamn time\". He said I treat him like dirt, and that hurts because he just spent 4 hours going to a performance for me where he was just uncomfortable and had a splitting headache the entire time, but didn't complain. He said I'm not reinforcing positive behavior (going to a performance with me) by getting upset with him. He reminded me of all the times I asked him to get things for me and he did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe apologized for his outburst and, and after we got home, he said he would go back to Panda Express to get more sauce. For context on the dishes comment, I recently had an argument with our roommate (his brother) for not doing any chores around the house, and my husband said he was sick of hearing about it from both me and him. He's said I was trying to reason with someone who was unreasonable, so I should stop trying and just wait until we move out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I asked for some extra sauce at Panda Express, my husband refuses to make an effort to just get some extra sauce, and when I ask him why, he yells at me for treating him like dirt after he's done so much for me.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for considering giving my cat to my soon-to-be-ex-roommate?",
      "description": "I have two cats. Three years ago my boyfriend rescued a black cat from a work shop that he used to work at. Boyfriend moved to a different city for work two years ago and the cat stayed with me. But I was working A LOT and the cat was left alone at home for 12 hours a day quite often, plus when I finally got home late I often didn’t have any energy left to give her attention. So, one and half years ago I decided to get a second cat to keep the first cat company. I was obsessed with a specific breed of cat at the time, so I researched and shopped around extensively, finally picked a second cat and paid $1500 for him.\n\nUnfortunately, after the initial introduction period, it gradually became clear that the two cats don’t get along. My first cat is a really good cat; she doesn’t do anything that you don’t want her to do. But this second cat, while I also adore him dearly, is honestly a huge brat and a bully. He needs to be the center of the attention and would drive away the first cat any time he wants (food/water, any spot in the house, etc.) The first cat is a really shy girl who doesn’t fight back and would always just let him take it, whether it’s a toy, food, or a spot. I’ve seen countless times the first cat try to appease the second by grooming him but he never licks back... Because of all of the above, I try to compensate her and make sure she gets lot more attention and pets from me.\n\nLess than a year ago my lease was up and I decided to move into a bigger place and shared it with a roommate. For the past nine months, I’ve been living with another female who I met from Roommates.com and get along great with. She absolutely ADORES the second cat. Honestly the second cat is so pretty that almost everyone who has seen him says he’s the most beautiful cat they’ve ever seen. My roommate has experienced the same thing as well since she invites her friends over from time to time. We both get so used to hearing people telling us “I’m not a cat person typically but I love this cat!” \n\nRecently, the circumstances changed between my boyfriend and I, and we have decided that I’m going to move to his city to reunite with him in two months. Tonight, my roommate and I discussed some details of our move-out plan and rent stuff, and that’s when she told me that she has decided she’s going to get a cat just like my second cat. She told me she has grown so attached to him that she felt like she really wants one for herself. \n\nThat’s when I brought the idea up to her “Would you like to have him?” She seemed very excited and happy at the idea and told me she would love to. I told her I’ll get back to her on this. \n\nHere is why I feel like it’s a good idea: 1. It’s been explained above that my two cats don’t get along.\n\n2. He is a lot closer to my roommate than he is to me. The past nine months at our home it’s as if the first cat is mine and he is my roommate’s. He sleeps with her while the first cat sleeps with me; he plays with my roommate all the time. My roommate doesn’t intentionally try to only play with one cat, but the first cat is so shy that she never tried to compete with the second cat for attention. Even if we try to play with her, the second the other cat comes near she just backs out and lets him take over.\n\nI LOVE both of my cats and I’m NOT trying to get rid of my second cat. It’s not like “oh I don’t want him anymore; let’s see who else wants him”. To me, this idea makes sense; I feel like both cats will probably be happier if we do this (especially the alternative is that the second cat will never see my roommate again). \n\nMy boyfriend said the decision is mine since technically the second cat is MY cat (i.e., I paid for him and picked him), but he obviously judges me for it and thinks that I’m an asshole or I don’t love the second cat because I’m even considering giving him to someone else. \n\nAm I the asshole for even considering parting with one of my cats? \n\nTLDR: My two cats don’t get along. My roommate is very attached to my second cat and the said cat also loves her more than he does me (he follows her around the house, sleeps with her at night, and meows at her door for her attention all the time). I’m moving away and thinking about giving my second cat to my roommate. AITA? ",

      "description": "So I dated this guy for 4 years and a half, long distance relationship, seeing each other 2 times a year and that was the only the only thing that made me going. I don't really know how we got that far because I was just a kid and he wanted me to do everything he wanted: replying instantly, talking to him and 2 or 3 female colleagues, not going out etc. And we fought a lot.\nAnyway, when I went to college he became pretty obsessed, making jelly scenes out of everything and stuff. Ended it when I realized I don't have to put up with his shit anymore and didn't really have time for that due to lot of work school related. \nBroke up, blocked him cause he started calling when he knew I hated that, made new friends, got a new boyfriend (let's call him D), all good. When he found out about D he started messaging him saying what an awful person I am for not wanting to be with him anymore, how I ruined his life, how he wanted to marry me, how we had a perfect relationship and because of him I ended it (not true, met D after we broke up). After some time of calling me from other numbers to just ask \"how can I do that to him\", he stopped looking for me. \nIt's been 3 years since then, he still managed to find me on steam, tumblr and stuff but didn't talk to him that much. Last summer tho he wanted to meed and I said ok because I wanted to take all that hate out of me and just forgive him already. Turns out we had a really great time and promise we would still talk after he goes back home. Thing is he managed to get me in the same spot where he tried to manipulate me into doing what he wanted, despite the fact that I was going to move to another town, living in the same house with my current bf. \nNow: abusive ex bf moved where my bf and I live, managed to get on my nerves and block him again (even if he did block me in the first place and then unblock me), now he wants to hang out, invites me and my bf to his birthday party, tries to be friends, what?\nAITA for not wanting to go to his birthday party or meet him at all?\n",

      "description": "Throwaway. I am a 32F, he is a 34M.  We do not live together, but have been dating three years. I am aware that this is likely “not about the pizza”.\nOn Black Friday last year, my boyfriend bought all new appliances for his kitchen.\nThe first time we made a frozen pizza, back in December, I followed the box directions and put the pizza directly on the rack. This resulted in cheese melting off the pizza and falling onto the bottom of the oven. When he went to get the pizza once the timer went off, and found the melted cheese, he flipped out on me and we got into a huge fight. From then on, i put the pizza on a cookie sheet/pizza stone as he directed.\nLast week, we tried a new kind of pizza whose directions on the box say to place directly on the rack.  I used the pizza stone but the result was soggy pizza.  He complained all through eating it that it was soggy and did not like it because it was soggy and next time we should put it on the rack. I apologized.\nThis weekend, I bought same pizza and when I put it in the oven I remembered that it was soggy last time so I put it on the rack.  When BF went to get the pizza after the timer was up, you guessed it, he found cheese had melted and fallen onto the bottom of the oven - it was burnt and black.  He flipped out on me, going on about how I’ve ruined his new oven.  I try to explain that I’ll clean it up, he asked for that pizza to not be soggy again and I was just following directions on the box too.  His retort is that a) I should know that he didn’t mean that and to follow the ‘higher’ rule of NOTHING GOES DIRECTLY ON THE RACK, and b) I was disrespecting his property by “permanently staining his oven” with burnt, melted cheese.  I felt like a stupid child.  I told him he was overreacting over burnt cheese and that I would clean it out with soap/water once oven cooled off.. (but can we please eat dinner while it’s hot).  We go back and forth while I am scrubbing away the burnt cheese.  Once clean, he says he thought it was permanent and didn’t think the cheese would ever come off.. his anger is justified because it’s his property. I told him he’s being a jerk over melted cheese and that I had scrubbed it clean. His anger is justified, sure, he can be angry.  But I did not like the way he was treating me. I told him this. His reply was that “if you think that was yelling.. you have no idea.  I can show you what yelling is”.  Which to me is concerning.  If he reacts that way over melted cheese, I am concerned how he will react to what I consider a “real problem” (which I realize downplays something that is a real problem to him, but I still don’t think melted cheese deserved the attention it got.  He could have said “hey- I thought we talked about putting things on the rack.  Can you clean it up when it’s cooled off?  And I’d prefer if we didn’t put food directly on the rack going forward). I eventually just left and went home over the pizza fight. AITA for putting the pizza directly on the rack?",

      "description": "Hey guys, so as the title suggests, my father and I do not have a relationship at this point. I’ll give you some background. This is going to be a long one so sorry in advance. I’ll try to be as to-the-point as possible. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nMy mom and my bio dad were never married or in a relationship. My twin and I are the product of a one night stand, and when my mom told him that she was pregnant, she told him that he could choose not to be in our lives and that was his prerogative, but if he was going to be around that he should put in 100% effort into being a father and not to half-ass it. He told her that he would be around and pay child support and whatnot, but that was really only half true on both counts.\n\nMy father didn’t really start being in our lives until we were about 3 or 4 years old, and even then he wasn’t around much. We would only see him a few times a month and he would only act like a dad when it was convenient for him. This was basically how our relationship was until about 6th grade. But I loved him nonetheless. He was my dad and I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. \n\nSo 6th grade comes along and we had just moved back to our hometown after a year-long stint in Mississippi, and this move had sparked a pretty vicious custody battle over my sister and I. My dad pulled out all of the stops: he tried to have someone testify that my mom was beating us and that we lived in filth (which was easily disproved by a visit to our house and a visit to the child psychologist for my sister and I) and basically tried to take us away from our mom permanently. He tried on several occasions to turn my sister and I against her by telling us how horrible she and my stepdad was and how we’d be much better off with him. He also on one occasion gave us (at age 11 or 12) an ultimatum: we had to choose between him or my mom and if we chose our mom he was going to give up all custody/visitation and have our stepfather adopt us to be our only father.\n\nObviously, my mom won the custody battle and had sole legal/physical custody over my sister and I, but my dad would get visitation with whatever him and my mom could agree upon. Basically my mom told him that he didn’t even have to talk to her about visitation and that he could just talk directly to us about it. Even gave him our phone numbers to call us so that she wouldn’t be apart of it (my dad HATED my mom). \n\nHe agreed, took the phone numbers... and neither my sister or I heard from him again until we were 16 years old.  No phone calls, no texts, no birthday cards, just absolute radio silence for 4-5 years. At that point, him and my stepmom had a kid (my litter brother) who was around 2-3 years old who I just fucking adored... and I didn’t get to see him grow up. And a few years after that they had another son who I didn’t get to meet until he was also around 2-3. \n\nWhen my sister and I were 16, he finally reached out again to try and reconnect but tried to lie to our faces about the reasons why he wasn’t there for the past 4 or 5 years. He swore up and down that the court had settled on him not having any contact with us until we were 18 years old. Which is obviously an absolute lie. What reason would the courts have to suspend contact if he wasn’t abusing/neglecting us?? My mom ended up showing me the actual custody order from the courts to prove it was a lie. \n\nFast forward a couple more years - my grandpa (his father) dies of cancer. At the funeral, no one bothered to invite my sister and I to sit with the family (even though we’d been very close to our grandpa) and my father did not make a single attempt to come and talk to us. Not during the wake, not during the burial or afterwards. I had to come up to him and my stepmom a few times throughout and tried to talk. But it obviously didn’t pan out. He then had the GALL to tell everyone on his side of the family that WE had turned our backs on HIM. I was infuriated and heartbroken. This basically ruined mine and my sisters relationship with our grandma. She wouldn’t hear our side of things and demanded an apology from us even though we hadn’t done anything wrong. She told us she wouldn’t have any contact or attempt to see us until we apologized and made up with her son.\n\nAfter all of this, my sister and I accepted the fact that we would never have a relationship with our father, and if that meant that my grandma was going to lose us too then so be it. He had put us through too much heartbreak and pain and we just wanted to be done with it. And so we were.\n\nA couple years after that my sister and I at one point did reach out to our stepmom to try and reconcile a relationship with our brothers to learn that our sperm donor had cheated on her and left her for another woman. So we explained fully our side of things and she apparently never knew that the no-contact order was a lie. She apologized for everything and told us that she felt terrible knowing what she does now and is now putting real effort into building back a relationship with her and our brothers and it’s going very, very well. \n\nNow, we come to today. My father decided today that he wanted to reach out over Facebook to try and rebuild our relationship now that he’s “finally happy after 40+ years” with his new boo thang or whatever. It has been 10+ years since all of this began. My sister and I are 22 years old. That is half of our life that he could have been there and chose not to be AND actively hurt us during a very painful part of our lives. I am at a loss for words as to how I’m feeling. My sister and I both suffer from depression and had issues with self harm/suicidal ideation all sourced from our father abandoning us at a very rough age. Our relationship with our grandmother is still suffering because of what he did at the funeral and he still refuses to take responsibility for any of it.\n\nHis message on Facebook did seem like he genuinely wanted to reconnect and try to rebuild whatever we used to have. But the damage is already done. \n\nSo my question is, WIBTA if I continued to not have a relationship with my father even if he does genuinely seem to want it now? It would save my relationship with my grandmother if we chose to give him a chance, but at this point, we’re trying to figure out if it’s really worth it. My sister and I are both at a loss of what to do. But right now we’re leaning towards continuing on with our lives. We’ve already accepted that he wasn’t there for us and will most likely continue not to be. We weren’t expecting anything like this, pretty much ever.  \n\n\n\nTLDR; my father abandoned my sister and I when we were 11 or 12, lied to us about the reasons why, ruined our relationship with our grandmother at our grandfathers funeral, and now wants to “reconnect” after 10+ years of literally nothing. Are my sister and I the assholes if we choose not have anything to do with him anymore?\n",

We have been engaged for 10 months and together for 7 years and getting married within the next 15 months is a done deal for us. With work and finance restraints it’s very difficult for us to plan and pay for our wedding back home in Europe, as from my side of the family we have no financial support. The problem now arising is that my sister who has a fear of flying flat out refuses to consider or make an attempt to travel to Thailand if we were to get married there. My family are pretty much telling me that I am being selfish and should consider my sisters feelings and that by not doing so I am turning my back on them. They are asking me to wait till our work contract is over and we move back or get married where everyone(my sister) can travel to without complications.",

      "description": "So throwaway (obviously).\nMy friend and I have been, well, friends for about 8 years now. Recently he got a new SO. This SO now takes up ALL of his time outside of work. I am not exaggerating when I say this. All day every day when he is not at work, he is with her. We make plans: \"Sorry dude I forgot\" if he even bothers to say anything at all. There has only been one time in the last month he has actually committed to a plan [and I had to remind him of it, he made plans with her(this is important)] was when I needed his input for a research paper. He continued to rush me through it, trying to find ways to hurry me along so he could go do his plans with her even though I planned this a week ahead of time and was actually looking forward to it. He then actually, and I am still mindblown, asked me why he even needed to be here and why I needed him. I chose him because he was my best friend and I wanted to hang out with him while doing a project. Not to mention I needed him for the project because his knowledge on the subject I chose far outweighed mine. So then he says he wants to focus on the gym and less on her. Cool. Fast forward to today and he acts like he wants to hang out all day, asking what I am up to and such. I was busy at this point so I told him so. I then offered, later, to go to the gym. Nope, he is with her again. Ok Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "This was 13 years ago, I was 5 years old. Let's call the girl in this story Skylar.\n\nOne day, Skylar was annoying me at lunch, while our teacher happened to be talking to the class. She was pinching me, taking my food, and kicking me under the lunch-table. I kept quietly telling her to knock it off, but she was relentless. I ended up getting really angry, and raising my voice at her. The teacher heard this and then called me out in a room filled with 250-300 kids or so. I was given a \"green-light\" warning by said teacher for interrupting her.\n\nI don't think this happens in many schools, but our kindergarten class had a traffic-light system for punishments. It looked something like [this.](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/e9/71/7a/e9717a4b06824ef966496a92f0d286ac--classroom-behavior-in-the-classroom.jpg)\n\nEveryone had little magnetic paper cars that started at the bottom of the whiteboard. If you misbehave once, you are given a warning and you have to move your car to the green-light. If you misbehave twice, you have to move your car to the yellow light and take a time out. You get the idea. I was a pretty good noodle, so it urked me that I got a warning, but whatever.\n\nThen comes recess time. I was hanging out in the gym when Skylar comes up asks me to play with her. I followed her and she lead me into a small nook with a bunch of other kids under the bleachers. I thought it was kinda sketchy, so I was hesitant. I asked Skylar, \"Did you ask a teacher if we can be here?\" Skylar replied that yes, we won't get in trouble. So like 6 of us kids are sitting under the bleachers just chilling. Then all of a sudden, the same teacher that called me out earlier comes out of nowhere, and storms over to us. She begins to yell at us, telling us how dangerous it is to hide under the bleachers where an adult can't see us. She looked us all over and gave everyone involved a green-light warning, but then she noticed me. She remembers me from earlier and says I will actually be receiving a \"yellow-light\" warning.\n\nI was so pissed. Skylar got me in trouble, **twice.** I sulked back to class, and shamefully put my little car by the yellow traffic light. My primary teacher, not knowing about the situation, asked if something was wrong. I shook my head and went outside into the hallway. I sat in \"my place\" while my classmates watched Thomas the Train. I was mortified. I had to explain to my friends and my family what had happened. \n\nAbout a week later, my chance for revenge came. I had seen Skylar run to the teacher, whisper something in her ear, and go into the bathroom with a pair of fresh pants. She came out wearing the new pair. I knew what had happened. Skylar had pissed herself. I immediately began going around the room, telling everyone what had happened. The rumor had spread like wild-fire, everyone knew. And Skylar went home with tears in her eyes, forever known as \"pee-pee pants.\"\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My best friend (let's call her R) has been in love with her childhood friend for seven years. He (let's call him N) knows about this because she has told him so multiple times over the years. He has never reciprocated her feelings for him and has made this very clear but she still can't let go of him despite multiple attempts to. I met him for the first time last year at one of R's parties and tried to play wing woman for R but N was very against it. He then proceeded to hit on me which I was very taken aback by. I told him that while I did find him attractive I wouldn't want to do that to my best friend. He tried to convince me there was nothing wrong with us getting together and that R had no control over who he got to be with because ultimately they were just friends but I persisted and nothing happened that night. \n\nWe met at a few more of R's parties and the outcomes were similar, until last night at her birthday. Now R had told me that she had finally let go of N a few months ago and that she was also very into one of the guys at her gym. I was glad that she'd gotten past her unhealthy love for N and was finally moving on. Last night, I met N again and we talked quite a bit. I had no intention of doing anything but we ended up leaving the party for a bit with some friends who then left us alone eventually. After some more talking we found ourselves more and more attracted to each other and we ended up leaving together which R noticed. I went over to his place and we made out quite a bit. Nothing else happened but I started feeling tremendously guilty. No one had seen us do anything 'inappropriate', thankfully but I felt like I had betrayed R's trust. \n\nI met R today and she brought up us leaving together and I said it just happened to be that we wanted to leave at the same time. I know she bought it because this is the first time I've lied to her. She then proceeded to tell me that she felt very jealous when she saw us together (he told her last year that he was into me) and that if anything had happened, she would cut all ties with me. I felt terrible that she would end our two year friendship over this and was glad I didn't say a word to her. R is usually a very smart and rational person but N somehow makes her go crazy. She also told me that she would always have a soft spot for him and that she envied that he gave me attention and not her. I feel like I have backstabbed her and betrayed her trust. I don't know if I'm in the wrong but I wouldn't want to lose her as a friend as she is nothing but amazing. So, am I the asshole here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR my best friend's unrequited crush and I made out and though she doesn't know this she said if anything does happen between us, she'll end our friendship.

      "description": "Hi Reddit, lurker here. Just wanted others opinion on this thing. I have had my troubles in life, and got disability pension four years ago based on mental illness. The illness is cured, in less than a year I will be free from medicines. My pension is permanent though, or at least 40 years. I struggled alot when I was younger, for 18 years I were a hard drugs addict, mostly meth, but anything I could get basically. I lived on the street most of the time with no possessions as my own. Now everything is sorted out, I have everything I need, 4 years clean. Thing is some people around me suggest I look into getting a job and I dont really know what to tell them. The pension is enough for me to live comfortably. I really feel the years as a drug addict took their toll, I dont learn as fast or remember as easily as before, and am somewhat satisfied just keeping my head above water, free from drugs, cleaning my apartment and doing chores that needs to be done. I do have a lot of spare time. I think about this a lot, and my thoughts go to whether I should feel an obligation to society to work, do my part as a citizen etc. There are also minor setbacks, like I havent got teeth anymore, so working with people feels awkward, and Ive gained some weight so physical labour is hard. But what do you guys think? ",

I asked my wife if she could push the party for a little later and I could come a little late, but still within enough time to see people.  She’s unwilling.  She doesn’t care at all about the opportunity to make a good impression on my boss.  Frankly I feel like this party is for her rather than my son.

      "description": "we've been dating for about 3 years, we're grad students, and we're both in our low to mid 20s.\n\nmy gf is one of those people who reacts angrily, or, gets an angry tone...and that's something that doesn't sit well with me because I'm the exact opposite...it takes a lot to get me mad and I don't stress easily... *unless* someone is mad at me...then, I tend to shut down\n\nanyway, recently I had felt like it was time to end the relationship because I've stopped enjoying myself and I often end up stressed out when I don't think I should be stressed. We had already planned a week long vacation and paid for it and made various reservations...so I thought that I needed to stick out until the vacation ended...and then I thought that maybe this vacation will change things and I'd find out that the stress comes from school and that maybe this relationship could be saved\n\nI was wrong, haha. We're on the vacation now for spring break and she has snapped at me a bunch of times, she's constantly stressed out...which constantly stresses me out when she takes out on me..and I'm still sure that I'm not enjoying myself in the relationship..and I know I can't go on like this and be happy\n\nSo I've been trying to figure out the appropriate time to break it off..but I'm bad at this stuff and don't know when or how. I think that the best time would be as soon as we got back from the vacation this weekend. I hate to be like \"glad we're back from vacation, ok now bye\"... but i feel like that's better than settling back into things unhappily.\n\nAs far as the vacation goes, it was just a beach vacation a few hours away. She had a deal and paid for the resort, and I agreed to pay for most expenses we incurred down here. Overall I'd say I'll end up spending 60-70% of the total money spent.. Just in case that matters\n\nLet me know if I can provide any details that I forgot here",

I told him I’d rather stay home as it was more convenient to us both. As we finished eating and got to his car he was saying something along the lines of, “You can come with me, two heads are better than one,” or “you’ll come with me yeah? To help your sister.” I was getting a bit uncomfortable at this point cause I really don’t like when someone just assumes I agree to go somewhere with them passive-aggressively, especially when it’s my dad. \n\nI felt cornered and pressured so I just agreed to go even though I have Algebra homework due tomorrow as well as a Forms of literature assignment. \n\nI don’t want to assume anything, but my dad asked my sister if she took the medicine the doctor gave her regularly and I’m not sure if she said yes or no.

For the past year she’s been telling how happy she is to be “clean and sober” aside from weed, and honestly it’s bullshit. Sobriety needs to be maintained and we both aren’t there yet.\n\nOne day she posts on instagram a video of doing some lean, and that just upset me. Not that she was doing drugs, just that she repeatedly lied to me (and there’s the possibility she was lying to herself as well). I told her pretty meanly that she needs to cut that “sobreity” talk out because her lying is pissing me off. Now, of course we aren’t getting her side of the story; I’ll admit I said it pretty meanly. She tells me she isn’t sure if she wants to associate with me if I’m so negative, that she can do whatever she wants, and that she’s happy for the first time in her life and she doesn’t want me ruining that. I reiterated that it wasn’t the drug use that bothered me, it was the lying. \n\nShe didn’t respond to texts for like a week. I asked her if we were still cool and she said we were but I need to “cut that shit out”. I apologized for upsetting her but not the remark and tried to explain how what she was saying upset me and that I was just upset because I cared. She doubled down on it, said she didn’t want to associate with me, blocked me briefly.\n\nI kind of just gave up, seeing she wasn’t gonna see my side. Just told her that I guess negativity wasn’t gonna help anything and that I was glad she was doing better. In this situation, I don’t think anything I say will change her mind. \n\nDid I do the right thing here?",

      "description": "Long post warning. Extremely abridged TL;DR at the bottom. This story basically defined the year 2018 in my life so I feel like it’s fitting to post about it now, just to get it off my chest. \n\n\nI [m] started college last year. I became friends with a girl who lived in my dorm building, and found out I had a class with her. She had a friend Jenna in the same class. So as the semester went on I sat next to both of them and started talking to Jenna. Eventually my original friend started skipping class a lot so it was just me and Jenna. At this point we were basically just in-class friends: that person you ask for notes you missed and review homework together. I was single (never had a gf) and she had a bf, but I wasn’t really interested in dating anyone at that point anyway so we just had a casual friendship. The semester ended and winter break came. She texted me once on Christmas but that was it, I didn’t think about her much over break. \n\n\nThen the spring semester started, and we didn’t have any classes together (we had planned on taking one together but when my enrollment date came it was already full). Jenna also had decided to change majors (we were both the same major before she switched), so I didn’t really see her at all for the first half of the semester. We texted a few times throughout those weeks, just memes and jokes basically. But then in early March she started texting me more frequently. We talked a lot more each day, and met up sometimes to study or get lunch. I met her friends, and hung out with all of them together. By mid April we were hanging out every single day, and it turned into a night-time thing. She loves Game of Thrones so we would watch it together, mostly in her suite or sometimes my building’s lounge. I put my arm around her one night and from then on we were cuddling every night for hours, watching tv and just talking about everything. This was going on from mid April to mid May, which was the end of the semester.\n\n\nSo basically over that four week period, there were two, maybe three nights that we didn’t hang out. We also still studied together during the day and went to a few on-campus events together. Early May I started to have feelings for Jenna as more than just a friend. We started to talk about more personal stuff each night, and I found out that she had broken up with her boyfriend in February. But one night in May, we were cuddling like usual watching thrones. The episode ended and we just kind of sat there together silently for a few minutes, her head on my shoulder and my arms around her waist. But then she sat up suddenly and leaned away to turn and face me, and she said “anon, I really like what we have right now and want to keep going like this. But I need you to know that I’m not really interested in dating anyone right now.” I don’t know what made her say that, because I hadn’t said anything about my feelings for her before that. I replied “that’s ok and I’m glad you told me, but honestly I am a bit disappointed.” She just nodded like she already knew I was going to say that. Now comes my first huge mistake: in my head I thought “this is actually ok because summer starts next week and I won’t be with her for it anyway (she lives near our school, I live about 8 hours away by car). So over the summer maybe she’ll change her mind.” Internally, I had already begun to convince myself that she would change her mind, which obviously was not necessarily true. \n\n\nWe said our goodbyes a few days later and then it was summer. My summer can be split into two distinct halves. The first half: I had gotten a job at an extremely remote place (long story that isn’t super relevant) so I spent one week with my family and high-school friends at home and then shipped out to the middle of nowhere. I got sick within a week of arriving and quickly discovered that I did not enjoy the job. I make friends pretty slowly and I felt like an outsider from my coworkers, so all in all life was shit at the moment. But we did have some internet access and cell service, so I was able to text Jenna and my high-school friends and my family. They all really kept me going, and basically I became more emotionally dependent on my friends and family. Which is definitely a good thing overall, but in the case of Jenna not so much, due to my unfounded hope about her changing her mind. Sometimes at night I was able to use my laptop for a while, so I would play videogames with my high-school friends or skype with Jenna. We skyped about once a week, for hours on end. I was late to work a few times because I stayed up too late talking to her. Finally at the beginning of July I had enough with the job, so I quit and my dad drove out to pick me up, which begins the second half of my summer. \n\n\nOne of my high-school friends got me a job at the ice cream shop he worked at, so I started there a few days after arriving home. I was still texting Jenna every day, and now that I was home we skyped even more, at least eight hours a week. Our talks became more personal. One night we we got on the topic of sex and she revealed that she had been with two guys: her ex and another guy, David. David was her first kiss, before her ex. She told me that when she broke up with her ex, she called David to hook up with him. So that was sometime in February. And then she hooked up with him two other times after that, the most recent of which was in June. So I assume the middle time occurred somewhere in that period of mid April to mid May, which means she probably hooked up with him on one of those two or three nights that she wasn’t cuddled up with me watching tv. I had no idea what to think or say to her. I was just crushed. But in my immense stupidity I thought to myself “she’s just lonely over the summer after breaking up with her ex; it’s just one guy and she’s not hooking up with him very frequently.” And so I convinced myself that things were all ok. As the summer dragged on I became more and more fixated on her, even as she drifted further away. I mean, we were still super close and texted and skyped just as much, but she slowly revealed to me other stuff she was doing. She got Tinder because “my [her] friends said it was fun,” and started telling me about the dudes she was talking to on there. She said she wanted “validation” whatever that means. One guy said some cheesy pickup line about her being cute and she texted me a screenshot with her caption of “VALIDATION VALIDATION VALIDATION”. It got to the point where I said to her “do you mind not talking about Tinder? Because when we’re having a conversation I’d rather not hear you talk about all the other guys you’re talking to.” She went to music festivals and got drunk in bars with her girl friends. Meanwhile our conversations were still flirty and even sexual sometimes. Making jokes about what she likes to do in bed, and one night she went to a party and texted me “I love how my boobs look in this pic and I want to know what you think”. So my brain is working overtime all through August trying to figure out what the hell she wants. But I didn’t want to have that “so what are we?” conversation over skype, so I was just painfully biding my time until school started again.\n\n\nFinally the fall semester began. I saw Jenna on move-in day and gave her a big hug and we went up to her room. We cuddled and talked for a while like normal until we came to the big question. She told me that she still wasn’t interested in dating anyone at the moment, not just me. She said “I just want to do whatever I want with whoever I want right now.” I was crushed but mostly have myself to blame for getting my hopes up. As the semester dragged on she went to lots of parties with her friends and kept using Tinder. I’m not the party type so I didn’t go to any with them, but still hung out a lot during the day and watched movies with Jenna sometimes, but it just hurt knowing what she was doing with other guys. We also had a lot more talks about our relationship. I made it clear that I was into her and wanted to date, but she still wasn’t ready. At one point I told her that I started to have feelings for her in May, and she admitted that she also developed a crush on me at the same time. But she didn’t want to do anything about it. I’m still super confused about that. She also told me stuff like “I don’t want to do anything [sexual] with you because I don’t want to feel like I’m cheating on you when I hook up with other guys” and “I don’t think we can be friends with benefits because it would be weird for our friendship”. We were still cuddling during these talks and while watching movies. One night in September we had one of those talks and at the end, she kissed me on the cheek and said she’s sorry. I didn’t know what to do anymore. Then one night in early October, we were watching tv and she laid down on her side on her bed. I asked “can I lay down with you?” and she said “yeah but I don’t really feel like cuddling tonight if that’s ok.” So instead of spooning, I laid down on my back staring at the ceiling while she laid with her back to me. After about half an hour of this I concluded that this more-than-friendship wasn’t healthy for either of us; at least not for me. I sat up and said “Jenna I don’t think I can do this anymore.” We had a relatively short talk and decided that we should take a break from each other. No texting, no hang outs, nothing. I kissed her on the cheek for the first and last time, and I could feel her head turn away like she had anticipated me kissing her on the lips and was avoiding it. \n\n\nI cried a lot for weeks. I’d never had that close of a relationship with anyone before, and even though romance went poorly she was still one of my best friends and I missed talking to her. But there was one thing she did that made me angry. Every o",

      "title": "WIBTA for skipping out on my fantasy football league next year? (Heads up this is long, see TLDR)",
      "description": "This one is long, I'll save you some time and drop the TLDR at the top\n\nTLDR - Despite having the best team, I was kept out of the playoffs by leaguemates losing intentionally to allow inferior teams in. I'm out $400 I would have won had I been in. AITA if I decide not to come back even though I've played in this league for years and am close with many of my leaguemates?\n\n\nFor those who may not know, fantasy football is a game based around the NFL, where you \"draft\" current players to assemble a team and are awarded points based on the statistical performance of those players. You play in a league with a set number of teams, 12 in our case, and can customize your roster sizes and scoring settings to make things as difficult or easy as you like. For someone who follows the sport closely, it can be a lot of fun.\n\nI've loved football for as long as I can remember and have been really into fantasy for a few years now. I began with a very good friend of mine and some other friends of his, and have become good friends with a lot of the people we play with. Until this year, we always played just for fun, but were finding that as the season wore on and people fell out of contention for the league title some would lose interest and stop playing. To combat this and up the competitiveness of our league, we decided to set s $50 buy in and play for a cash prize (a very common practice in fantasy football).\n\nWe had a buddy go to basic training for the military and another who had to step down for personal reasons, so there was a bit of turnover coming into the season which is not a big deal. The new guys were mostly a good fit. We had a few minor issues as the season wore on but resolved things in the group chat and were generally getting along well.\n\nNow, fantasy football is a fickle game. Because so many factors can affect a player's performance, there is always an element of luck along with your skill in assembling your team that determines whether you win or lose your matchup in any given week. It's accepted that this is part of the game, that the best team does not always win, but over the course of the season the best managed teams tend to rise to the top of the standings and make the playoffs.\n\nI found myself in a really weird position this year where I simply got every opponent on their best week. My team scored the most cumulative points over the course of the year by a wide margin but also had the most points scored against it, and my record was going to be just barely good enough to get into the playoffs. I was confident I could still win even with a lower seed as my team was objectively the most complete (not a brag, I just had a really good year, and something that was discussed in the open with our group).\n\nThe last week of our season, some managers who had already secured their spots in the playoffs decided to sit their best players and lose intentionally so that other teams who had a lesser chance of beating them than I did would make the playoffs. There was some debate on whether this was okay to do as generally you are expected to field a competitive roster and try to win each week, but it was decided that as we had not specifically stated this as a rule to begin the year, they were free to lose intentionally and keep me out. Those who sat their players were the new additions to the league this year, and most people who had been playing with us for a long time felt it was wrong for them to do it. I was obviously unhappy but accepted this as part of the game and moved on. (As an aside, one of the \"weaker\" teams that they lost to allow in wound up winning the $400 prize yesterday, beating everyone who sat their players along the way, which was satisfying to watch, although I outscored his team every week and would have won myself had I been in).\n\nThis post is not meant to argue who the asshole was this year; that's in the past and not important. My question is whether I would be the asshole if I chose not to play in this league next year over what happened. It's not so much being upset about the money as it is that I personally would not have done to someone what was done to me, and I'm not sure I want to play again with people who do want to play that way. I know that a lot of the people I have played with for years will be disappointed if I don't return, and one or two of them may not play either. My buddy who I first started playing with has expressed how disappointed he would be if I don't come back and stated his concern that the league may kind of fall apart if I don't return. I feel kind of obligated to the people I have played with for years to come back, as we generally have a lot of fun. We can implement new rules to stop the sort of thing that happened to me this year, but part of me just doesn't want to bother.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I skip my league next year and potentially break up the band?",

      "description": "I want to preface this by saying that we've been friends for maybe 8 years or so, maybe a bit longer and we come from a culture where things are not known to start on time (Island Time). That said I've always accommodated people by setting start times for events, gatherings, D&amp;D nights, much earlier so if people show up 'late' they are actually on time.\n\nBut I've always been a punctual person, show up within 5 minutes of whenever people say something starts, and early 9 times out of 10. Sometimes I show up 15 mins or an hour early if the location is somewhere public and fun like a game store (so I can interact with other gamers and shop around).\n\nNow I've moved to the states and being punctual has served me well, everything opens on time, people generally arrive on time or within 5 minutes. It's great!\n\nI got my friend a job at the company I work at (read: I referred, he applied, etc.). He moved to the states with his wife.\n\nThey started joining my games and events to make friends and whatnot. And about 1-2 sessions of D&amp;D/other activities in, it began.\n\nThey started showing up late, like 30 minutes late when they literally live next door to me, or an hour late when the game store is 10 minutes away. \n\nNow, 4 or 5 months later, it's gotten worse, they show up 4 hours late or not at all to things they said: \"Yeah I'm gonna be there!\" enthusiastically. They've basically become a joke. \n\nI started to curb the behavior by giving out extra XP to people who are on time or early to D&amp;D sessions, it worked for a little while, now it's back to being 15 minutes late, and likely will get worse again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote that they don't let you know that they are gonna be late, and don't apologize, just shrug and give a sheepish look, like it's supposed to be funny; it's, in fact, really upsetting to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I right to be really angry when people show up super late to events and activities they said they would attend?

      "description": "Some notes: I'm 17 and I work at a pizza shop, which is my first job. I've been working there for about a year now. I am still in high school, although it's homeschooling. I tell my manager I can't work Sundays and Thursdays. A few weeks ago I told him I can't work Tuesday/Wednesday (I allowed him to request which day due to my semi flexible schedule.) He chose Tuesday to have off. Great! This week I look at the schedule (which changes every week, for some reason) and find that I am working both Tuesday AND Wednesday and only those 2 days. Wow. I text my manager and tell him early on Monday afternoon, right after I saw the schedule, that I can't come in on Tuesdays because that's a school day for me. He asks me to come in \"just for this week\" but I told him no. One, because I know if I say yes he will put me on the schedule for more than this week, that's how he is. Two, my school schedule is not flexible right now. I'm about to graduate and have lots of coding classes that I'm studying for and cannot afford to sacrifice time I set aside to reach my goals.\n\nIt's important to note that I have school through summer, with small breaks in between. I know it would be much to ask to have many days off as he's used to having people on summer break, but there were at least 3 other employees out of school. All throughout summer he didn't cooperate with my schedule, having me work 4-5 days a week with ILLEGAL (somehow unknown to him) HOURS. Based on his track record of not trying to cooperate with my previous schedule, I don't really want to sacrifice more time than I have to to this job like I did during summer. It was a nightmare trying to balance school, family affairs and work, among other things.\n\nHe cut my days last week without telling me and I never would've known had I not double checked when stopping by. I don't know if that's important to mention.\n\nTL,DR: My manager puts me on days I requested off. Kinda feel bad for calling out.",

      "description": "Throwaway account\n\nAround 20 mins ago me and my sister started arguing about who got to charge our phone first, as we are traveling and only have one converter to American plugs. The argument was getting sort of loud (after around 3 minutes of arguing so far) and my dad said “I don’t care if you argue but quiet down”\n\nWe quoted down, but after around 2 more minutes we started getting loud again (not yelling but very raised voices) and he got mad, sent me and my sister outside.\n\nNow we are in a motel in Australia, half an hour after a very long, hot, steep hike. It’s still very hot and we were out here for one or two minutes, when he then let us in.\n\nNow once inside, I was very mad at him for doing this, so I said “why would you do that! That was just escalating the argument and poor parenting”. I regret saying that but in the time I was upset.\n\nHe then sent me back outside for almost 10 minutes. The door to the motel locks and I had to just sit on a bench outside for that whole time.\n\nI eventually came back in and after a few minutes he explained that he wanted some peace and thought it was fair because he told us to be quiet and we didn’t.\n\nSo... AITA for getting mad at him? I realize I shouldn’t have said some of the stuff I did, but I think it was a bad decision to send me outside and he should especially realize because he, too, was still hot and sweaty from the long hike.",

I figure $2k isnt that much for them. \n\nSo I call my grandma to see if they can help me out. She told me how this isnt just a few hundred and how was I going to pay her back. I told her I can pay her back in a few months. She's not worried about me not having a place to stay, only the money.  Even though they literally  just showed me their $100k+ Mercedes they just bought. She just said to figure it out on your own.

I told them no and that was the end of that. \n\nThen she asked them again... and again... in which case i WARNED her that i would tell our parents if she didnt stop because... well she is 13, and i firmly believe that anyone under the age of 16 shouldn't even consider touching ANY drug. \n\nThen she asked me and my friend again, this time i decided to scam her for $15 dollars since i really didn't want to tell our parents (I'm 17 so i didn't really want to admit i smoked). \nShe is getting her money back because i don't like scamming a family member (or anyone for that matter). But thats besides the point.\n\nShe ended up finding another friend of mine selling xanax and weed, he told me he met a customer that looked an awful lot like me. I asked if her name was (her name) and he said yes. \n\nThat was my last straw, i decided 2 hours ago to call up my mom, tell her everything that had happened and that i want her to set her straight without involving police ect. Ofc, somehow she wasnt surprised about me smoking but was really upset that my 13 year old sister was. \n\nShe ends up giving me a 40min talk about harm reduction and alot of what she said i already knew but made alot of sense. \n\nShe calls my little sister, and my sister ends up calling my mom \"unsupportive\" and \"a horrible mother\". My mom started crying and was almost late to her job.\n\nAfter that, my sister calls me an asshole, and threatens to snitch on me to the police.

      "description": "A few months back I planned a trip to go visit a friend and a few weeks before the trip started, she told me that she started dating some dude. Because of being in said relationship,this dude felt it was ok for him to alter my plans (ie make me stay at his house instead of her place). Although I was super pissed, I ended up compromising: I spent half the time at his place and the other half at a hostel to explore a nearby big city with her as we originally planned since my trip could not be cancelled.\n\nDuring this period I noticed a lot of warning signs about this guy she was seeing:\n\n1. He's 12 years older than her\n2. Tries to control what she wants to do and where she is\n3. Constantly degrades her(from what I saw and what she told me)\n4. He was very cold towards me and had a \"I don't give a shit attitude\" even though he made me stay at his place(as most likely to \"monitor my actions\")\n5. Subjected her to verbal abuse\n6. Overly jealous at the fact that myself and other friends have made plans to visit.\n\nHis behavior was rather alarming and even after I warned my friend to leave him, she kept defending his behavior and insisted he's a nice person(although she did acknowledge some bad things she noticed, she kept back tracking later on). She insisted she would be careful but still seemed to back track again. Last night I hung out with her and he called her cell, after she told him that she was hanging out with me, he became extremely aggressive and kept yelling at her (ex. \"YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER, YOU SHOULD BEHAVE\") and kept attacking her for being unfaithful and said a lot of shitty things about me too(even though we are just friends). She almost had a breakdown, so I left to give her some space after she told me so and said she wanted advice the next day. (But at the same time she kept insisting he was kidding around despite me hearing the entire conversation). \n\nFast forward to today, I told her how all these warnings and this shit she was dealing with was a super obvious sign that this guy is a toxic and psychotic creep. Despite acknowledging some of my concerns, she tried to insist I was being too mean to him and that he is a caring person. Supposedly the \"issues\" he has was related to a series of crisis in his life that affected the way he engages with people. She still insisted being with him is a good thing for her and claimed that she would end the relationship once she realizes he goes too far and that I shouldn't be too worried.\n\n\nTLDR: Planned a trip to visit a friend. She started dating a older guy before I arrived that exhibits extreme jealousy and paranoia. Despite my repeated attempts to warn her about him, my friend still tries to insist nothing is wrong.  ",

Meanwhile, my gf couldn't care less about other people and always does things that make her comfortable, even if it would make others uncomfortable.\n\nFor example, many times we have walked past a restaurant, and she slows down or stops to stare inside of the food people are eating. Usually people are sitting by the window and look little uncomfortable when she does that. I feel uncomfortable too, especially is she fully stops. I tell her that she shouldn't stare so much, other people might find it uncomfortable, but she says she does whatever she wants.\n\nShe also doesn't care about her surroundings. She walks on the bike lanes (not on purpose) and I always have to tell her to walk on the right side of the road or watch out if some bikes or big groups of people are coming. \n\nShe might watch some videos or play music quite loud until late and around 9-10pm I have to tell her to turn it down because the neighbors might be sleeping. She might also want to start the laundry machine in the evening, and gets mad at me if I say we should do it tomorrow because it's quite loud for neighbors. She says she doesn't care.\n\nThe last thing was today when we were walking across a big street. There were no cars coming so we just crossed the lights even though they were red. However, my playful girlfriend thought it's fun to press all the buttons as we walk past them, causing the crossing's lights turn red for the drivers, and green for us. But we had already crossed the road. So now there were couple cars that had to stop at the lights even though no one was walking across the road. I told my girlfriend she shouldn't do that, because now the drivers have to wait for nothing. She got mad and said I don't like anything she does and always tell her what to do and not to do. \n\nI just care about other people and feel uncomfortable if they suffer or have to wait because of something I did. I might sound little blunt telling my girlfriend what to do or not, but I never force her to do anything. Most of the time I even try to sound not serious but happy and just slip in the conversation she probably shouldn't do something, but she still gets offended. On the other hand she says she feel uncomfortable with too many rules and if she can't do whatever she likes. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "Recently I started to date a girl that I believe is perfect in every aspect. I met her 5 years ago, and liked her since, but only got to date her about 3 months ago.\nWe have mutual friends, that we like to go out in couple dates. This couple study in her college, and I study 438km away from her, being able to see her 3 days a month.\nSince the last time we saw each other we've been planning this weekend, since is her birthday.\nWell, we planned going out to eat sushi on saturday, then foing her house. In the sunday, the plan was to go some fancy restaurant with her parents (the birthday was on sunday) and then watch some movies together at night.\nIt happens that i came early to town, in the friday, and surprised her. While we were chatting, she told me that in the saturday, we were changing plans and going to a birthday party of our friend couple. I really didn't like that she only told me that one day before.\nBut okay, we ate sushi and passed by the party. Before entering the party, I received a message from the Friend saying that he and her gf were going to my gf house on sunday, night to see movies. I looked at her and asked \"seriously?\" since she didn't told me. But okay, I got mad, barely talked to anyone in the 20 minutes we stayed in the party, not because the plan changing, but because I got really sad that she wasn't telling me her plans.\nBut okay, sunday came, we lunched in a incredible restaurant, then we get to go to a water fall, and i gave her the birthday presents. One of them, a neckless with earrings. She liked, told that she  liked very much. The when the couple came, they gave her a necklace pretty much the same. She picked the present and at the same time putted in her neck. \nThe dinner started and felt really, really bad. My pressure felt in the ground, and i couldn't chat with anyone. Everyone detected something wrong. My mother-in-law got worried. (Btw my pressure felt not just for that, last night we were togheter until 4am, and i waked up at 6am to go with her family to church, didn't slept since).\nShe was drinking wine, and asked me to accompany her to her room, where a little drunk she asked what was going on, and i told her \"nice necklesses\". She got really really sad, but i was sad too. I fell in my knees and asked forgiveness for her for being jealous, we didn't argued or anything. But i felt really really bad, and her too. We got back to the dinner, but everything was not okay. \nBefore going to sleep, we texted each other, i apologized more than i should, and less than necessary.\nShe said that she loved my, sent many audios telling this.\nAnd this morning, everything is not okay. She is clearly mad. I bought some flowers, came to her college, apologized again in the break time. Now I'm waiting her class to finish so i can chat with her properly, but I really think I blew up the relationship with the person that i think about since 5 years ago. Please, while saying YTA, please help me to make this get better.",

      "description": "So I agreed to go to an out of town wedding with my boyfriend, and a few weeks in advance I asked what I should wear. I didn't own a suit, and wanted to know if slacks and a button down would be too casual. I had plenty of money to be able to afford a suit, and as an adult man it would be reasonable for me to have one anyway.  He told me that it would be totally fine, I didn't need a suit. \n\nFlash forward to the night before we leave for the wedding, we're packing and I notice he's packing a suit.  I said I thought we didn't need suits and he said I'd still be fine without one, but he was going to wear one.  This got me concerned that I'd be really underdressed.  I asked him if he could please not wear a suit, since I still didn't have one and had no way to get one in time.  I assumed this would be fine, since he told me it'd be okay not to wear one in the first place.  He probably just didn't realize that I'd feel a lot more comfortable: I knew that if we were dressed to the same level, I'd feel less out of place (you know, solidarity and all that). I didn't know anyone at the wedding and am just self conscious about being over/under dressed to things generally.  To my surprise, he outright refused.  He said HE'D feel underdressed and out of place at a wedding without a suit. We argued about it for awhile, and at the end of the day he still refused to dress down at all.\n\nThis hurt my feelings quite a bit because it felt like he was choosing appearances over my feelings.  Essentially he'd rather me feel underdressed than him, even when he told it'd be fine in the first place.  If he wouldn't feel comfortable without a suit, why would he tell me I'd be okay without one? I couldn't (and still don't) understand--if the roles were reversed, I'd dress down in a heartbeat.\n\nI recognize that this is a small deal, it sounds silly even writing it, but to me that almost makes it worse--I was having a ton of anxiety about it, and it seems like such a small thing for him to just dress down to the level he told me was reasonable.  On the other hand, I wonder if I'm the asshole for being hurt and making such a big deal out of this, because it's his decision to wear what he wants to wear and I shouldn't be trying to control that even if it WOULD make me feel a lot more comfortable?  So what do you think, AITA?",

Enter sister in law who just got back from college and when she enters the room unceremoniously tells me to GTFO of the room to change &amp; take a nap. Tell her my project situation but she apparently doesn't give a shit. Me being a smart-ass I tell her there are a good bathroom and a couch in the living room. Sister in Law flips her shit and then proceeds to yell, scream and bitch about me being a brat, stuck up, and not listening to elders. In response, I said the following. \"Elder? An elder is supposed to give someone wisdom, the only wisdom you could give someone is the teeth in the very back of your fucking head.\" It is at this point in when she pulls up the phone and calls brother, tells him what's going on (he's at work when this happened BTW) and in crying voice tell him \"I'm done with OP (me)\", I give a good, loud rebuttle, \"Feelings mutual\". Then the shitstorm of hell breaks loose as my brother throws every insult in the book at me to get me out of my own room through a phone, doesn't work. When I finished my project I got up and left the room, not 3 steps out of the door, sister in law proceeded to slam the door behind me and locks it. The rest of the day is my bro screaming at me while my parents sit there and do nothing (why I resent them to this day). Immediately tomorrow, I take my PC out of their way and put it in my crawlspace, where it just barely fits in a corner, bro and sister in law scream at me to put it back or they are going to sell it, and all of this other shit, while I proceed to just keep saying the classic phrase, fuck off. For the next 2 months my PC sat in my room in a box before my sister in law said fuck it and moved into her parent's house who actually had a spare room that was a decent size, and immediately moved over there.\n\nSo I ask you Reddit, who is the ass in this situation, Me, or Bro and his wife?\n\nP.S. Relations haven't improved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It took my mother weeks to agree to it but after I did it I thought it looked amazing even my grandmother liked it.\n But random strangers would always give me dirty looks or comments about me being “sick”  but one old man who lives me would give me especially dirty looks and once asked me while waiting in line at the grocery store if I was “sick or just stupid” for shaving off my “beautiful hair “ (which it wasn’t it was fried from my dying it every month) and I told him basically that I can do whatever I want with my head because it’s mine and I don’t care what he thinks. \nThis man decides to tell me “girls only look good with long hair. You should think about getting a wig to cover it” and I told him fuck off and went back home\n\nAm I the asshole? He was just giving his opinion but it was a very rude way to do it.

He knows I just got off my period and I don’t expect him to understand the female anatomy but he kept hinting at my smell during sex. I only get my period once every four months due to birth control so things get a little out of wack when it happens.\n\n I’d also like to add for my own embarrassment I shower daily with unscented soap around this time and have never had an issue like this before.  \n\nFinally this morning I get a text saying he’s concerned about my health and that I might have bacterial vaginitis and that it probably isn’t just a post period thing and he’s having a hard time having sex with me. In addition immediately after that he said maybe we need to slow our relationship down. I tried to explain that new partners can throw off ph balance as well to which the response was just an ok and a string of uninvolved texts when I made it clear I was embarrassed. \n\nIn addition to this he took the blame for moving things a bit too fast and I had recently told him I value openness and communication in a relationship. For this I feel like a hypocrite. I also feel that telling your girlfriend you don’t like her shoes and her pussy stank are on entirely different levels of openness we have not yet reached lol. I just felt double attacked in that moment when I feel a new relationship should be about being sweet and comforting each other. I also feel like this is a huge scar in my comfort moving forward with him intimately if I decide to continue seeing him. \n\nI’m incredibly hurt and embarrassed and broke things off. Am I the sensitive immature asshole here for breaking things off? He seems upset but willing to give me space. \n",

      "description": "So for my partners birthday, we had everyone round ours for celebration, including a few friends that are known to be a bit...sensitive and quick to jump to conclusions. They also get I'll very regularly and are constantly tired, so it was lovely seeing them both, even if it was just for a few hours.\n\nThey were planning on heading home just as I was starting on the main meal for the night: I at this point was in host-mode so just assumed I was cooking for everyone. One of the people in question is gluten intolerant, so I made a separate meal for them. They objected to this, I assumed out of politeness. But I was all-go, and I could see they were exhausted, and would not wanna go home and cook, or wait for a takeaway.\n\nSo, I finished cooking as they were leaving and packed them up to little tubs of food to go, the GF one labelled as such. They smiled and left.\n\nFew days later, we have a disagreement. They call me childish (I'm 8 years younger but I like to think I'm mature) and ignorant. They bring up my partners birthday, and how I ignored their 'pleas' at not wanting food, saying how they felt like they had said no and that should have been enough. They kept bringing it up over and over, saying how ignorant and an assailed I had been for giving them food. \n\n\nI didn't feel like I was in the wrong...as I said, they were exhausted. And if they didn't want the food, they could have thrown it out the moment they left my house. But instead, they took it and made me out to be bad. Now I wanna know if what I did really was bad of me....",

Everyday at 2:30pm I pick him up from school and every other day I take him to and pick him up from karate 5-6pm. My parents insist I do this because they are either at work or just got home from work when he needs rides. My other brother works from 3-6 after school and can’t give him rides either. The thing is his school is 0.7 miles from our house and karate is 0.2!! Literally down a block and a half from our house. My mom insists he needs rides because it’s too cold and night, and he used to have a big instrument from school but he doesn’t anymore and definitely can walk. \n\nYesterday was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Ever since I started picking him up, a year ago, he never looks for my car. If I’m not right up front, he waits around where I generally can’t see him, then walks home. His school is BUSY and I have come and park 15-20minutes early just so he sees my car. If I have to park across the street he won’t even look. Once I drove in circles trying to get him to notice and even yelled out the window and he just kept walking. \nThis happens way too often. Yesterday I waited 25 minutes just to get a call that he walked home from karate. This was the 2nd time in a row this happened. I was only 2 cars from the entrance (parked facing it so maybe only 25ft or less) but a truck blocked my view and I could not see if he was there. \n\nWhen I got home I was livid, I pay for my own gas and I waste SO much just driving to get him for no reason. And in the winter I leave my car on so I don’t freeze, making me waste even more gas. I told my parents I’m not giving him rides anymore, he can walk. They went on and on about how they can’t give him rides and it’s not a big deal. They didn’t even tell him to look for my car, they said it wasn’t his fault. I just don’t understand how many times can this happen before he looks for my car for once. He’s not an idiot but wow I get so mad because he can’t get simple stuff like this in his head. \n\nWhen I got home later that night I was told he was upset and it’s my fault. I didn’t even talk to him, I just told my parents I’m done with this ridiculous and not giving rides anymore. Apparently he overheard and is upset because I was being a jerk??  \n\nAnyway today my mom went to pick him up, GUESS WHAT HE DIDNT LOOK FOR HER. And she ended up just leaving and he walked home. She said he can walk now but is still mad at me for not giving him rides??? \n\nTLDR; my brother walks home when I try to give him rides because he doesn’t look for my car, but I’m the jerk for not wanting to waste my time/money anymore.

      "description": "For background I was having a conversation with some friends at work. And all three sledged me about being a slow driver because it took me 10hrs to drive from Sydney to Brisbane when they drive it in 7.5-9hrs. According to google it takes about 9.9hrs make the trip. But here in the city 10-15k over the limit is the norm. They said I was disruptive by driving the speed limit and now I’m wondering. I use the left lane most of the time, I stick exactly to the speed limit so that I’m not a danger to others, if anything I balance about 1k over most of the time however I’ve been tail gated and beeped at and now my coworkers agree.

      "description": "I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 5 months now and we had a interesting conversation tonight. I made a joke about kissing a random girl and she believed me at first but then I told her I was messing around with her. She said to me she doesn't like that because she has been cheated on before and doesn't want to be hurt again. I told her that I understand her and being cheated on sucks but I also told her there is a reason behind of it most of the times. We discussed what reasons could be behind there and 10 minutes later when I said ,,a healthy relationship is based on how much vulnerability are you ready to show and the pain that comes with it to take.\" I told her that I fully trust her she won't cheat on me. I asked if she fully trusts me aswell on which she replied with: \"I trust you.\". I asked her again and it went back and forth for a while. I told her, that I cannot see a point in this relationship if she can't fully trust me. She said she loves me to which I replied: \"Well, if you really do, then why don't you fully trust me?\" She said that she does trust me but its her own personal issues. I told her she shouldn't bring those into a relationship. When she said she doesn't I asked her again. Of course she did answer like before. After a while I told her that I either want her full trust or none.\n\nAITA for telling her I value full trust in a relationship otherwise I don't see a point in it?",

      "description": "I’m gonna try to be as straight forward as possible and not push anything against her. \nAnyways, going into high school, I wasn’t that social and had very few friends, she was the new girl. We were both on the school soccer team and when asked to partner up, we were always the only 2 left, so we’d always end up being partners. We clicked immediately and I helped her around as she was new to the area.\n\nOver the years we were doing everything together. But around junior year of high school things were going downhill. She started getting jealous of me whenever I got involved with boys and we were fighting more often. But with all the pressure on us of being I separable, I had to deal with it and make up with her.\n\nMay I also point out she’s had a terrible home life and parents are divorced and her dad is verbally abusive. But I do not allow that as an excuse for the stuff she put me through.\n\nShe always expected me to read her mind and got mad when I didn’t do what she wanted. She was trying to control my life and always try to do things to be better than me to one-up me and brag to me about it. \n\nSenior year I get a boyfriend and she struggles to keep a boyfriend for more than a week. Whenever I told her what I did, she would find a guy, hook up with him, and then brag to me what she did.\n\nShe would always tell me how much of an asshole my boyfriend was and how “we wouldn’t last”. She was the only person who pushed situations to have an excuse to hate him. (For example: she kicked my boyfriend in the balls and out of reaction my boyfriend swung as a reflex and hit her. She then went around telling everybody my boyfriend slapped her without the co text that she kicked him in the balls for no reason.)\n\nShe committed to a school 9 hours away while I was staying local.\n\n The breaking point for me was when me and my group of friends went on vacation. We went to one of my friends’s aunt’s beach house. So I invited my best friend and told her THE SPECIFIC DATES. I said “these are the dates, so let &lt;our friend&gt; know if you can go” because it’s not my trip, nor my house, so I told her to let the friend in charge of the trip to know if she can go. \n\nWe go on the trip and she never said anything. We come home and she starts blaming me for not inviting her. I tell her I told her the dates and she said “no, you just told me to tell &lt;our friend&gt;.” And I’m like, yeah, because she was in charge of the trip.\nTURNS OUT, she couldn’t have went on the trip anyways, so we don’t even know why she was making a big deal out of it. \nA week later she goes to college and I ignore her texts and stuff. Eventually I told her why I was ignoring her and she once again, blamed ME for everything, and didn’t even want to hear me out. So I ignored her again and she still keeps asking what she did and why I hate her, even though I’ve told her multiple times. \n\nSo AITA for ignoring her after 4 years of being best friends?",

      "description": "My best friend’s son turned two the day after Christmas. The week before, she’d told me they weren’t planning to do anything for his birthday. I offered to make a cake and do photos for them, and she agreed and started planning everything with me. We talked about it almost daily because I was bouncing ideas off her and getting approval and such. I started the cake on Christmas, and I ended up having some issues with it and had to remake a bunch of stuff and make a couple more trips to the store. I spent so much time and money making the damn cake and she knew about it. When it was finally done, I asked if they wanted to come over after nap time, and she told me her husband decided he was going to take everyone out when he got home from work and wasn’t going to “force him” to come to my house. I let her know that I was upset and she just told me that I didn’t have to make the cake, and was very unapologetic about it all. I just can’t imagine talking about plans with someone for days and then canceling last minute like that. So, AITA? \n\nTL;DR spent hours making a birthday cake that had been planned for about a week, only for my friend to cancel at the last minute so her husband could take them out. ",

I told her she didn't communicate that and she snapped at me that I know we leave at 9:30 why was I lollygagging, then tried to guilt trip me because I grabbed a thin coat and was cold and \"You're 21 I shouldn't have to make sure you're warm it would have been two minutes we could have waited\".  \n\n\nAm I the asshole for not waiting by the door, or is she for not explaining what she meant by 'early' and giving me no warning until she deemed we were 'late'?",

      "description": "Guess the title is pretty straightforward. Anyway, I'm 18, and up till about last year I was short, kind of round and rather awkward. Puberty hit late I suppose, and now I get a fair bit of attention, but the problem is that I never have an urge to act on it. I've never once pursued a girl, even when it's crystal clear that she likes me, I've never talked to the girls on my Tinder and I feel kind of like a douche ignoring girls like this. I'm 100% fine with being friends with girls, but I never have an interest in asking them out. I find girls attractive I guess, but I can't seem to be bothered. Some of the girls that later ended up being just normal friends seem a bit resentful about that. and I have a certain reputation. \n\nAm I the asshole for just not giving a fuck about this stuff? I feel like a dick when I turn people down or leave them hanging but I never know what to say, and I don't really care to think of things to say. Why am I even like this? Is there something wrong with me, or am I still stuck as that round short kid with no confidence?",

      "description": "I used to have this \"friend\" who would do the following things:\n\n\\-Berated my whenever I didn't do what she said\n\n\\-Got punched because I accidentally blew snow in her face and I said sorry. She punched me really hard in the stomache because quote \"You didn't say sorry\". Her logic was that because she supposedly had good hearing, it was impossible for me to have apologized without her hearing.\n\n\\-Sat on me with my arm twisted behind my back and wouldn't get off until I agreed to give her an item of mine. (Joke is on her because her mom came to pick her up)\n\n\\-When I was having a depressive episode (she didn't know, but most people knew I was having a hard time without me giving specifics) she gave me a list of people who didn't like me and why.\n\n\\-When I called her out for berating me, she told me I was being a huge jerk to her.\n\n\\-She would blow up at me for little things. One day, I didn't notice she got her eyebrows done, and she yelled at me and stormed off. Another time this happened was when I messed up painting her nails by accidentally getting it on her skin. The results were the same as before.\n\n\\-She knew I had a lot of difficulty with social skills (I found out later that it was because of autism) and I asked her to help me, instead she yelled at me when I messed up.\n\n\\-When I was acting erratically during psychotic episodes (I have multiple mental health disorders, in this case schizophrenia) she accused me of doing it for attention and getting laughs out of people.\n\n\\-She would touch me without permission, even though she knows I hate being touched. That included sitting on me, \"play\" attack me and possibly the occasional slap.\n\n\\-She said she touched me without permission because she didn't know boundaries. I tried explaining it to her, but she plugged her ears, laughed, and walked off.\n\n\\-When we were kids she said I was a bad christian for believing in magic (even though she believes in Santa)\n\nThis is all I remember off of the top of my head, but she did more. Also, remember when I was having a depressive episode? Well she did some of this stuff when I was on the very edge, and that was just enough to motivate me to commit suicide. (obviously, I failed)\n\nMonths later she mentioned she cuts on her legs (even though in a swimsuit, she didn't have any visible cuts, although I could be wrong because I suck at making detailed timelines from memory). She mentioned depression. In the past she has told me a lot of people were mean to her, but they were pretty nice to her (I know this because she was always with me. We were in church,school and we hung out a lot. On top of that she lived right next to me). And we were together for several hours a week) Fast forward to late 2018. She takes my phone and goes to the notes app. She writes a thing saying she might be bipolar. She asks for advice. She said \"this nice lady\" told her she might be. She went into specifics about some of her issues. I agreed that those symptoms would fit (I have a slight idea about the disorder because my dad was bipolar) and I just told her to get professional help and take care of herself. I didn't really care, I was just confused and wanted her to leave me alone. She told everyone in YW (young womens, it's a thing mormons do) my ward (church community) that she had depression. I didn't doubt this, but I felt suspicious.\n\nIf something she did to me was ever mentioned, she would say she changed. It would be nice to believe this, but I found out that around that time, a mutual friend hung out with her as much as she used to with me. That friend got transferred to another school because she was bullied by someone. She also tried to get me to give her my number (I said no) and kept sitting next to me in church for a while (she stopped in early 2018). Don't get me wrong, I don't hate her. I used to, but I realized hatred only hurt me so the hatred withered away. I have a similar attitude with her to most people: not liking, nor hating her. The difference is, I have lost the ability to care completely and I have no interest in having a relationship with her again. I am willing to help her as long as nothing on my part is at stake. AITA for cutting her out and not caring? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My husband made it very clear that we needed the evening to get ready for the week. My husband had some catching up to do for work and needed the evening hours for that. I like to do food prep and cleaning on Sundays and possibly sneak downstairs to our building’s gym while our baby naps and my husband is home to grab him if he wakes up. \n\nThey came to our place at 11am. We hung out and played with the baby and then went to lunch. Got back around 3:30pm and baby was sleeping. The plan was for them to leave at 5pm to meet up with my brother in-law. Brother in-law ran late and didn’t show up until 6pm. They didn’t all leave until 7pm. Baby took a miracle nap from 3:30pm to 6:30pm. My husband and I could have gotten so much done during that time. \n\nI want my husband to set stronger boundaries with his parents and tell them they can’t visit us if they don’t respect our time.

I felt bad but she send me a text to say I was paranoid and that nothing changed, nothing was bad between us.\nBut things really changed, she really stopped talking to me and only hang out with her new friends.\nI felt really bad because and told her a second time, without accusing or being mean about it.\nShe was pissed and told me she didn't see why I felt that way.\nShe thought i hated her for that but that wasn't the case, so it was kinda weird i think.\nAfter this, we entirely stopped talking, saying hello or whatever. We are now strangers, and I don't know if it's my fault. I feel bad about this friendship because i liked hanging out with her. I don't know if I should apologize for what happened, make a first step toward her or wait for her to come back.\nAnyway, what do you think, AITA?",

      "description": "So on my commute to work, I take a route that takes me through a mountain/canyon road. This is a one-lane road, meaning there's only one lane going in either direction. Legally passing a car is not possible here.\n\nThe speed limit is 45mph throughout the entirety of this mountain road, due to how many sharp turns and curves there are.\n\nI always adhere to the speed limit when driving here, and I've never encountered any issues for the past 3 years that I've been using this route.\n\nLast week on the way to work, I notice that there's a single car behind me that's aggressively tailgating me. Like, they got *really* close. They also honked at me aggressively multiple times, but I just kept minding my own business. I realize that they were accusing me of being slow, but I didn't want to go any faster because:\n\n1. I'm already going at the speed limit\n2. Like I said, it's a mountainous road, so sharp turns and curves throughout. Going any faster would be unsafe.\n\nIn the end, the car behind me eventually went \"Screw it\", and proceeded to do the unthinkable. They drove into the other lane, then sped up and passed me on my left, while giving me one final \"f*** you!\" honk as they passed me. Keep in mind that this is a one lane road, so the lane they drove into is meant for oncoming traffic. Luckily, there were no cars in that lane at the time, otherwise that car would be in for a very bad time. If there were cars in that lane, it would cause a pretty serious accident, considering there's the possibility of a vehicle being thrown over the cliff side.",

I've made a strong effort help her get to class on time even though it's not really my responsibility. She has an 8 a.m. class, and my first class is at 9 am. I've helped her arrange another ride to class, and she frequently misses it, and then I bring her in without having gone to her 8 a.m.\nLast night, I told her that she could not sleep in my room in my bed, in part because I wanted to have my space back. She frequently sleeps in my bed, and I don't feel like the Space is really mine, despite us paying separate rent and her having her own room. This usually upsets her when I do this, but I needed my space back for the evening even if it caused her problems. As expected, she did get upset, and stormed out of the room. She later expressed to me that she would not be able to sleep in her bed until she cleaned it off, which is ultimately not my issue.\nIt's morning, she apparently did not go to class, in spite of having a test. She's already used to drop grade, and this is frankly quite aggravating. However, I did not find out about this until I was already at school. Because of the 10 situation the previous night, I decided not to leave my ringer on on my phone because I know it would keep me awake. As a result, I did not receive the message that she had sent to me asking if she could get a ride.\nWriting this honestly makes me think this might be a waste of my time, but by the fact that she's giving me the cold shoulder, I certainly feel like an asshole. So, Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\n",

A bunch of us decided to make a new league and recruit some new guys to fill vacant teams and play with us.\n\nSo I was in talks for a trade with one of those guys and we agreed on a deal a few days ago. Everything was set and we were ready to do the trade but our schedules never matched up to get this thing in the game.\n\nUnfortunately he then told us he lost someone close to him very recently and wouldn't be in the mood to play for a while, we should just put his team on auto pilot and he'll be back after he's had some time for himself.\n\nI then proceeded to message the people in charge of the league to see if they could do the trade we had in place before he went on a break and got chastised because I was the insensitive one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Background: my fiance has some trouble with being in a relationship sometimes, as she believes some of her actions aren't right for in a relationship. For example, she felt badly when an old crush/friend of hers texted her sister on Christmas, but not her. Or when she develops a mini-crush on a guy because they are in the same scope of study. She gets feelings and suddenly she feels terrible about it, and we get into a debate about whether or not she is treating me fairly (I always tell her that feelings for someone are natural and not voluntary, because she is choosing to be with me and marry me). One of these guys she had a crush on for a bit, I will call Derek, he is a friend of hers at University; this is important later. \n\nAnyway, we were discussing who would be groomsmen and bridesmaids, flower girls, ring bearers, etc. at our wedding. My groomsmen are basically set- my best friend, my brother, and her brother, with whom I am great friends. Her bridesmaids are her sister and two of her friends. \n\nA few days ago, she learned that the ushers at weddings were chosen by the couple as a sort of position of honor, and she mentioned that she wanted Derek to be one of the ushers, because she doesnt want him to feel left out from the other people IN the wedding- even though my sister isn't getting this kind of offer. I haven't met Derek, as my fiance and I are not living in the same city right now. However, I feel uncomfortable with her wanting to have him IN our wedding, not only because of the way she had felt about him, but more so the way it caused her to react to her own feelings.\n\nI have no problem with him attending the wedding, being her friend, whatever. I dont see myself as being the overly jealous type. But WIBTA if I tell her that I don't want him to be a part of the wedding?",

He also used me like a credit card, borrowing thousands of dollars and letting me buy all the groceries, but eventually paying me back when he worked. \n\nThis last time he was gone longer than usual because his dad has Alzheimer’s and in that time I met someone else. I didn’t cheat but i spent a lot of time with this guy, telling myself we would just be friends but connecting with him really well. When my boyfriend got home I had an emotional meltdown and dumped him. I just couldn’t stand to continue things and breaking up was way overdue. \n\nFor additional context, I was also having issue with my dad at the same time (he was depressed and was threatening self harm) and my boyfriend did not check in on me when I told him about it. Like I told my boyfriend about my dad and I didn’t hear from him in a week, and only because I reached out.\n\nNone of my friends think I’m an asshole for the timing, but my ex sure does. I don’t feel guilty for ending it, but I do for the timing. ",

      "description": "Before I begin, I used to go to a private school, however unlike most of the students in the school I was not an oversensitive d-bag, I was just a d-bag. In my first week of my senior year I was looking through old pictures of myself and found one of a 10 year old me holding a bright yellow nerf gun and wearing sunglasses. I thought this was funny so I decided to post it on instagram. However along with the picture I also wrote the caption,\n\n***\"You guys are cool, don't come to school tomorrow\"***.\n\nThis was a popular meme at the time so I didn't think twice about it, cut to two hours later and I'm eating out with some friends when all of a sudden I get a call from my dad saying that the cops had called my mom and were now looking for me.\n\nAfter I explained to my dad the situation I rushed home and clarified everything to the cops. After looking at the post, they suddenly understood what's going on, they tell me to be careful what to post and left. I felt pretty relieved now considering the cops dismissed the event as a misunderstanding and because I had deleted the post.\n\nThere were repercussions from the school like being suspended for 3 days and having a parent teacher meeting, but everything seemed ok. Well, as it turns out, ***the school was livid!*** Apparently someone's parents saw the post and thought it was enough to get the cops involved. The new principal was especially mad saying my behavior was inexcusable and that I was a threat. I was shocked and didn't know how to respond. I was told that they'd make a decision over the weekend, they didn't, but they did accidentally send an email to the entire school (everyone needed a school email to turn in assignments/ check grades), which included private information about myself and my current situation. At this point I was extremely annoyed.\n\nLuckily I knew people who were on the school board, who defended me, because they thought the situation had been dealt with and needed no further punishment. To make a long story short I was expelled due to a vote by the school board. But the story doesn't end there. Because according to my friends, the principal made an announcement claiming the vote to have me expelled was unanimous, which is impossible, because my aunt was on the board and she was really trying to get me to stay. Not only did the principal lie to the school, but he also made a list of people who liked my post and questioned them if they were apart of this **\"scandal\"**. Obviously I took all the blame, because it was all me, but that couldn't have been enough to expel me in my senior year right? Along with that the principal also made up and exaggerated many aspects and even tried to blame me for stuff I wasn't apart of. IDK maybe I'm completely in the wrong, but it seems like something fishy was going on. What do you think? Was this post enough to completely destroy my HS Senior year experience? AITA???",

      "description": "Okay I’ll try to make this short and sweet. I had two tight knit groups of friends; 1 in high school, and 1 in college - the only person that belonged to both was my best friend and roommate let’s call her T. Last time I got together with my college group for a wedding, I was bombarded by this T friend after a few too many to drink on both parties. All in all she told me how upset everyone was after I had moved states away and hadn’t been contacting anyone like I used to. \n\nI work full time and also have a part time job, the rest of my free time is dedicated to my partner, who truly is my best friend. She explained that all of these things were happening in everyone’s life that I didn’t know about (moving, new schools, one of my friends father has died and I knew nothing about it). Of course I felt terrible, but tried to explain my side. \n\nThings left on poor terms, but I tried to make the effort after that to contact people. T would respond to texts for a few days and then one of us would break it off. The one whose father died hasn’t responded to me at all. I even invited them to come to my home in Tennessee to stay with us, and neither got back to me. \n\nNow I see posts of my college friends - including T - all getting together, and I’m obviously hurt that I haven’t been at all included. We’re all adults now, and I was hoping we would be able to live our lives without being up each other’s asses like we were in high school, but that seems to be landing me with no friends. \n\nDid I bring this on myself, and should deal with my consequences of being a shitty friend? I feel friendless now, as everyone has seemed to shut me out now... \n\nAITA? Should I move on? I realize how petty this is, but I was hoping for some outside advice. \n\nDo people really talk to their friends states away on a weekly basis? ",

I shared the photos with him but he insisted that I should give him the phone for no reason. He got mad and we started discussing. \n\nI told him that, even when I don’t have anything to hide, I’ve got some private stuff like my gym progress photos (which I’m embarrased about), messages from close friends (some of them who talk about their private problems) and stuff like that, that I wouldn’t like him to see. \n\nAfter that, he said that I don’t trust him and he feels like I’m always hiding things. I know that it could be seen bad, but he’s the only one on who I really trust and I tell him everything that I think, feel and want. \n\nIt’s not the first time this happens. We had the same talk when I got stolen my bike and bought a new one without waiting for we to go both to the store, or when at my dad’s death 15th anniversary I didn’t replied a message within 2 hours when I was at the cemetery (it’s in another town and he had to work so I went alone). \n\nWhat do you think?

      "description": "I have 4 siblings and I am the second oldest. Our ages are 26, 23, 21, 15, and 13. My sister recently told me her boyfriend is planning to ask my siblings and I for our blessing before he asks our dad. My 21 year old sibling and I told her 'no', and my other siblings didn't really care. Our other siblings don't know this so maybe that's why they don't really care, but the reason we say 'no' is because he has cheated on her 3 times (that we know of) and has beat her to the point where she needed stitches. We suspect she's been beaten more times because of random bruises, but this was the only time she needed/decided to go to the ED. My parents know none of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister and her boyfriend have been together for \\~5 years? He yells at her when she comes home late after hanging out with US at OUR PARENTS house, doesn't allow her to hang out with her friends (if she does, he has to tag along), doesn't help her care for their animals, never comes to our family gatherings (even before we didn't like him), made them get a shared bank account, didn't help her pay for her tuition which was $600 so she asked me and my boyfriend, cheated on her, beat(s) her, and is an alcoholic who has been trying to sober up since year 2 of their relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur parents have been married since forever and have instilled in us what a healthy relationship should look like. My dad has never hit my mom and he treats us all like princesses and a prince. My sister's boyfriend though... The way he treats her is physically and mentally abusive, yet she can't see it or refuses to believe it. I love her so much and I want her to be happy, but I don't want her to marry a \"man\" who treats her like that. I really can't see myself giving her boyfriend my blessing, but if he makes her happy, then would I be wrong not to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I’ve been struggling with anxiety, depression and addiction and recently started back on medicinal and behavioral therapy. My parents (mom more than dad) have been really supportive through everything but at the same time my mother is incredibly controlling and anxious in her own right and is somewhat of a trigger. Last night I got home from work at midnight and didn’t really fall asleep until 3 and woke up at 6:30 and woke up kinda depressed but I got up and showered anyway before mom took me to church (she makes me go.) We had plans today after I got off work to go to dinner but I realized last night as I lied awake that I don’t want to celebrate my birthday this year, in light of recent events it just doesn’t feel right. That is,  I don’t want to go to dinner, so I texted to cancel dinner plans and decided I’d rather stay on campus after I got off to study some with a classmate but I agreed to be home in time for cake. My question is am I the asshole for not wanting to celebrate and go to dinner with them? ",

      "description": "This is going to sound dumb, but I was best friends with a girl I met online for a long time (and yes, we have met in-person before). We both had feelings for each other but knew that distance was the biggest obstacle, so we stayed silent on the topic and just remained friends. \n\n5 months ago, she called me one night and vented to me on how she’s had a crush on me for so long, going as far as saying that she’s in love with me and that I’m the only guy she has feelings for. However, I was suspicious as I had seen photos of her with another guy she was hanging out with. I asked about him, just so I could make sure that I wasn’t getting in the way between them if they were seeing each other. She told me that they weren’t romantically involved and that he was gay. \n\nShe pretty much ghosted me that night for the next 2-3 months, and I could barely could get a hold of her. Whenever I did, she acted very passive towards me and sounded like she didn’t want to talk to me at all. I could say “I love you” at the end of a phone call and she would just hang up on me without saying it back, but she insisted that we were still best friends. \n\nI was on Twitter, and stumbled across her “gay” friend. Apparently, he wasn’t gay at all and they had been together (or at least FWB) from some very revealing tweets he posted about their relationship. Out of shock, I impulsively screen-shotted the evidence and sent it to her asking if she was lying to me this whole time about him. She only responded, “I’m sorry I can’t do this” and blocked me on everything. \n\nI ended up apologizing for being nosy and she apologized for lying to me, and I suggested that we stopped talking to each other. She said that she didn’t want to, and wanted me to give her another chance. I asked if we could talk this whole situation out on the phone, and she told me to give her 10 minutes. She ended up never picking up, and ghosted me again for the next month. \n\nI was obviously fed up and just said “goodbye” anyways since I knew she was going to keep ghosting me. I’m over it now but I just wanted to know, AITA for being too nosy? Or did I do the right thing by confronting her about it?\n\ntl;dr - best friend from LD confesses her feelings for me, but lies to me about not seeing another guy at the time by telling me he’s gay. i find evidence that he’s not gay and that they were seeing each other, and she blocks me on everything \n\n",

      "description": "My father isn’t what you would call a standup guy. He was terrible to me (23F) and my mother when I was a kid and we lived with him, and his newest wife has come to me since she, her teenage daughter, and my father have moved to my city and told me that since she’s married him, he’s fallen back into a lot of the same abusive behaviors that he had when I was a kid and living with him - flying into screaming rages over imagined faults, throwing things at walls, controlling her bank accounts and child support payments, blaming them for events that happened at work, demanding complete silence in the house, grabbing them if his demands aren’t met, etc.\n\nI feel terrible for my stepmother, and for everything she and my stepsister are going through - no one deserves my father. But every time I try and offer my stepmother help (trying to get her connected with people I know are hiring for her skillset in the area so she has her own finances again, offering to put her in touch with a domestic violence advocate I know, etc.) she turns it down. I even sat down with her before they got married and explicitly warned her what type of person my father was. Nothing seems to get through, no matter what lifelines I send her.\n\nThe only thing she says she does want me to do is spend more time with them, because she says he’s “better behaved” when I’m around - I think because he knows I have no problems cutting him back out of my life if he doesn’t behave. (I have my own job, life, home, friend group, everything in my city - I was established before they moved here, and there was a solid four year period in my teens where I didn’t speak to him once.)\n\nThe issue is: I don’t want to spend more time with them. Every time I have to go out to dinner or the movies or something with them (one of my hard rules about my father is that I’ll only see him in public settings, though he doesn’t know this), it takes a mental toll on me, and frankly a part of me wonders if even those short, infrequent outings are worth it - even though I know me spending time with them helps them. I (selfishly) don’t want to have to put my own recovery at risk to act as a shield for the two of them.\n\nBut my stepsister has started developing some worrying tendencies that look a lot like the beginnings of an eating disorder, and she’s gone from a straight-A student to flunking her classes. Not doing anything to protect another kid who’s in the situation that I was once in feels like a pretty goddamn asshole move. People are coming to me for help with an abuser, and I’m doing nothing except accepting a dinner invite once every month or two. Am I the asshole??",

I told him that if the plants were still on the counter when he left for his trip, I'd throw them out. \n\nHe left but I didn't throw out the plants.

      "description": "In the middle of October, my neighbour (directly underneath me) got a new TV and has since then been blaring it at all hours of the day and night (8:30am, 4:00am, 9pm, 11:30am, all day). I'm not able to drown it out even with my white noise on the loudest volume possible, and it's keeping me awake well into the night and driving me absolutely insane through the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a week or two of the noise, I left a note on her door asking her to turn it down by 1am (since I'm never in bed beforehand and didn't want to be all 'turn it off at 9pm sharp!!!') so I could sleep, which she ignored completely. Then I wrote to the property manager and asked if they could tell her to quiet up, and they've been supportive but haven't actually given her the notice yet. I asked for an email update 3 days ago, and no response. I had guests over last weekend and the noise was keeping them awake past 3AM, so they went downstairs to knock (they're braver than me, I'm too scared of confrontation) and they were completely ignored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few nights ago, I called the nonemergency police line to report noise at about 2am. They came to the house, banged on the door for about 5 minutes and eventually had to yell in her window to get her to listen. They told her the noise was too loud, and that she had to turn it down or next time would be a fine. They left, and she kept it at the exact same volume that night and has every night since. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still have no response from the property management company and it's 12:30am and I know it's gonna be another sleepless night. There's music playing and loud gunshot-type sounds from whatever movie she's watching and I'm really tempted to start calling the cops every single night until she cuts the shit out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this seems pretty in favor of me at the moment but I really, honestly feel awful about the idea of harassing her with the police. Weirdly, she's a really friendly woman to my face. We hung out on Halloween and gave out candy together, and a few days ago she brought me a Christmas card. She seems nice, and I don't want to start problems. I also feel really shitty clogging up police lines every night when they have better things to be doing. I feel like the civilized thing to do is to wait out the calm, professional response from my property manager and wait for their warning. I also feel like I'm a jerk because I'm (and always have been) really really sensitive to noise so it's entirely possible that nobody else would be this bothered by the TV sounds, and I'm being a big over-dramatic crybaby. But oh, man, it's seriously hitting me hard. I feel like ripping my hair out and I've had two or three total meltdowns about the constant noise. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

It certainly had brought us closer together, I thought. \n\nI happened to be at a non-profit event nearby this morning as my boyfriend was clearing his apartment out to move. I stopped by afterwards to say hi and his landlord came by at the same time. This has never happened before but... I was introduced as a “friend”. \n\nTo qualify, I don’t find embarrassment or circumstance to be an acceptable reason to misrepresent me or our relationship. \n\nI was noticeably bothered once the landlord left. The only answer I received was that it wasn’t a conscious decision, nor was there any meaning behind it. I find that hard to believe. This has never happened before and he’s never acted in a way to make me think it would. \n\nI did leave without saying goodbye, but I also didn’t say anything hurtful. Refusing calls and texts since.\n\nAm I wrong for being hurt and disappointed, or even considering this an unrecoverable transgression?",

That next Monday, John was upset with Kenzie because he found out that she had gotten a hicky below her collar bone, and that she had also kissed several of her friends while she was there. We said it was kinda messed up that she did that to him, as that’s a pretty intimate thing. \n     Kenzie claimed that there was nothing wrong with what she did because she wasn’t gay (as in homosexual, not some sort of insult) and there were no feelings behind the acts. My friends and I (including John) claimed that not only was what she did very gay (as in homosexual, not an insult) but it was technically cheating on John. She doesn’t agree. AITA? ",

      "description": "Hello everyone, Throw away account because I don't feel comfortable with the idea that people that know me might find my personal problems.\n\nSo I have been in a long distance relationship for a year and a half. At first everything went really well but I felt like we were talking less and less which I really did not like. I tried to talk to her about the issue many times as I believe that communication is really important in any relationship but she either ignored me, or told me that she will make some efforts without making any in the end. Note that she was usually just hanging out with friends or alone ( so nothing really important that takes time such as a job or studies), and came back home at night too tired to even send me a message ( which sometimes got me worried ) or reply to mine.\n\nAfter trying anything that could go through my mind, I had come to the idea that the only way for me to make her realise how much of a big deal it was for me, and how much it hurts me was by breaking up so that it makes her realise it and maybe get her to make some efforts on that. To be honest, at this point I had already tried to adress the issue 8/9 times with no result and was pretty done both physically and morally and were not feeling able to continue like that for too long. I really loved her so I was hoping that she would finally realise but it actually backfired on me.\n\nWe have not talked for roughly a week. I was trying to hold my position as it was too late to go back, and was my only remaining option in hope of solving that issue. Came out that she thinks that I'm an asshole that just made out an excuse in order to break up. She accepts to stay friends though ( I had told her when I \"broke up\" that we could stay friends to add some realism to it. I dont know if this info is needed, Im just trying to be as transparent as possible).\n\nShe didnt seem to accept my explanations nor realise how big of a deal it was for me and keeps thinking that I just made up an excuse. However we keep talking the EXACT same way we used to with laughs and telling each others everything ( without the cute and sweet words ) which made me think that nothing is lost and maybe she just needs/wants me to insist ( like testing if I actually care about her or not- note that after asking her, she told me that she missed me aswell and still loves me as much as she used to). I tried for several days, but nothing. So I just got to the point where I got tired and decided to move on and stop insisting, but yet stay friends as I like her as a person and care about her despite not being with her anymore. \n\nHowever, it came to happen that I once told that I will never be in a relationship again if we ever break up - which is totally dumb and delusionnal but it also is my first relationship( even though I'm 21 ). So in order not to be a lyer I decide to inform her that I moved on and will probably try to get a new gf, and just moved on with the discussion. I didnt mean anything by that except the fact that I have accepted that we now are only friends and that she will never change her mind again. Yet she blamed me for saying that while still claiming yesterday that I loved her.\n\nSo let me be clear, I still love her, but I dont see myself waiting for her to change her mind forever. Now she doesn't even want to be friends and thinks that I have never loved her. \n\nAm I the asshole ? ",

      "description": "Bit of backstory before I start: GF and I have been dating for 2yr (started near end of freshman year, we’re now juniors). She has tons of guy friends who are constantly trying to do shit with her and she’s always secretive about it. She has also cheated on me twice, both times were within a week and with my 2 best friends at the time but she didn’t tell me until 10 months later because she could argue it was “sooo long ago”. Meanwhile I have been loyal the entire time and only talk to her, my 2 best guy friends, and 2 other “girl-friends” who I’ve known WAY before I even met my GF. Also things have been kinda rough for the last couple of months due to her randomly lashing out on me and calling me names and shit and ignoring me, which I usually just brush off because I can’t really do anything about it. \n\nNow, time for the actual story: I was at this college fair hosted by our school and I was just walking around and chilling with my gf. All the other schools within like 15-30 miles were there. So naturally I saw one of my “girl-friends”, we’ll call her Lauren. At first I wanted to go up and say Hello and whatever but then out of the corner of my eye I caught my GF giving me a look of almost pure hatred. So we (Lauren and I) ended up just smiling at each other and going about our business. I could tell that right after seeing Lauren, my GFs mood did a complete 180 and she was dry and emotionless towards me. Mind you, it was only directed at me because she was fine talking to her other friends and stuff. Anyways, after about 2 hours of just chilling and walking around and me trying to make awkward conversation that ultimately led to no response from her end; she just started going on about how much she hated Lauren and how ugly and gross she is and how she’s annoying (even though she doesn’t talk to her) and just shit like that. To me, I could deal with her being upset at me but it crossed a line when she just started bashing my friend like that (Lauren and I are good friends and nothing more than that, Lauren respects the hell outta my GF). So I stuck up for my friend saying that Lauren has done NOTHING wrong at all. Then she pulled this out of her ass... “Oh yeah, I forgot you two were dating”. I didn’t know what to say after that so I just walked away without saying a word, she followed but we didn’t talk. Now for the past week she’s been threatening to end our relationship over this and saying shit like “you don’t love me and you never have”. AITA that caused this?",

      "description": "Nobody really owes anybody anything when you really think about it. I don’t owe my mother a hug when I go visit her. I don’t owe my friends my time and attention. I don’t owe my dog love and affection. But I give it to them anyway, because it makes them happy, it makes me happy, and *it’s the right thing to do.*\n\nSo having said that, if my ex from a fairly amicable split decided to message me six months later with a genuine, sincere apology for things he thinks he did wrong, and he made it clear he wasn’t expecting anything from it, I would at least give him the courtesy of telling him how I felt about what he wrote. Because *it’s the right thing to do.*\n\nYou know what I wouldn’t do? I wouldn’t ignore them and block them.\n\nI sent a sincere apology to my ex the other, and he blocked me. I didn’t expect anything to come of it, but I at least expected some kind of honest response out of it. I thought he was better than ignoring and blocking. He fucking told me he wanted to be friends *multiple times.* I guess that was a lie he told *multiple times.*\n\nHe’s allowed to feel how he feels, I’m not angry over that. But he does NOT get to act like I was the only who pulled shit worth leaving over. Yes I had anxiety attacks, yes I was emotionally a lot to handle at times. But at least I worked on my shit. I sought therapy. I got on medication. I started journaling and meditating and doing things that were good for me because I deserved to be healthy and happy.\n\nHim? He made me feel like shit for having anxiety in the first place. He made me feel like all of our problems were because of me. He never put any effort into the relationship. He ignored my needs. He NEVER ONCE made good on his promises. He promised to help me in making sure my medication wasn’t causing any weird side effects. When it did, he said nothing. He promised to be more present. He didn’t. He promised to fucking *read* some articles I sent him that I thought could help our relationship. He didn’t. And he promised that he would tell me if he ever found himself in a place where he didn’t think he could he in my life in any capacity. He didn’t.\n\nAnd he knew...he FUCKING KNEW that the one thing I hate more than anything else in a person is being ghosted like that. HE KNEW THAT ABOUT ME, AND HE DID IT ANYWAY. Yes, I pulled some shit that nobody would blame him for walking away from, but SO DID HE. He’s not the only victim here.\n\nAnd that’s what really fucking gets me. Over the three years we knew each other, I can honestly say that I’m a better person now than I was back then. Much better. I cannot say the same for him. If anything, he got worse.\n\nThat said, am I the asshole here? Am I a bad person not worth dating? Anytime I talk about how I feel on reddit, they blame me. Anytime I talk about how I feel to a therapist, they tell me it’s not my fault. And I don’t know why.\n\nSo who’s correct? Reddit? Or my therapist? Am I actually the asshole?\n",

      "description": "I’ve only been on this subreddit a few times so this post might be weird but anyways...\n\nSo my grandma has an old iPhone that I offer to sell for her because it’s only a few generations behind (still fetches generally high price). She agrees to let me keep 25% and the rest goes back to her. A few days later I line up a deal to sell it to a friend of mine and all is good until my parents step up and tell me they need the phone because my sister broke her phone screen. Also if this phone goes to my sister, it would be a substantial upgrade from her current phone in terms of storage. I initially agree, but then they lowball me (they lowball the friend/family price which is already at a considerable loss). I deny the first offer they make and shit starts to hit the fan. They hold stuff above my head that they bought for me as a kid and all that, but I maintain my stance that this is for my grandma and the phone isn’t even mine. I also offer them a few options of my personal iPhone collection they could use for her instead but they’re not having it. They then proceed to guilt trip granny into giving them the phone for free because they “need” it so bad and she tells them to pay my 25% since I spoke up about it first (keep in mind that sisters phone still works fine but just cracked screen and low storage). They reluctantly pay me and  I hand the phone over,  and at this point they cut my grandma entirely out of the deal (which I still feel bad about but I’m in a financial bind right now and grandma knows it).\n\nAt this point  my parent are attempting to activate the phone for the network they on but have no luck. I look at the phone and realize it needs to be unlocked from the previous network. Call ATT, unlock code, Bada bing bada boom, done. I give the phone back and they try to activate it again but there are apparently network inconsistencies between ATT and other phone services, so company 2 denies the activation. \n\nNow my parents do a 180 and sell the phone for the full price I could have gotten for it and more on eBay, and as of writing this they are mailing the phone to this guy out of state for a high balled price (I warned them this is probably a scam but let’s assume this is legit) so they can buy my sister an even bigger upgrade. \n\nSide note: She broke her phone screen twice. The first was repaired but not the second. She also doesn’t know what a phone case is apparently\n\nSo am I the asshole for thinking my parents are spoiling my sister and scamming my grandma?\n",

      "description": "My paternal grandmother died this summer. Two of her kids live hours away. They also have teenaged children. For the last few years, Grandma's health was in decline. She wasn't in much physical pain, but she was certainly limited in what she could and couldn't do. My Dad visited her everyday. This started after I went to college also hours away. When I'd visit, I'd offer to go see Grandma and help out so Dad could take a break. Dad insisted I go there with him and \"just visit with Grandma\". I did. This continued even after I moved back in with them to recover from an extensive surgery. When I could drive again, I took Grandma to a few errands locally and occasionally to lunch. Dad still attended her doctors appointments. My mother (to whom he's still married and lives with) would also volunteer to help Grandma out. I'm told she would plan to take Grandma to the doctors on days she was off work, but Dad took a day off anyway and insisted only he and Grandma go. This was the pattern for a few years.\n\nOne day, I had to be in my Aunt Cheryl's town and she and I spent some together. We talked about Grandma and she confirmed what I had always suspected. She had offered to come and visit a few times, but Dad insisted she stay home with her family. He said he could take on the bulk of it because his only child (me) was out of the house. When Grandma was feeling up to traveling she'd stay with them once a week every so often. Her kids would still need her. I know that all of her kids would call at least once a day and usually would video chat as well.\n\nSo this summer. Grandma passed. It was sad for us all. All of her children were with her at her deathbed and she saw them all during her final days in which she was conscious. At her funeral, my half-sister (maternal) left in the middle. Out (maternal) aunt \"Heidi\" was watching her infant son and she was going back so Heidi could attend the funeral. I went with her to Heidi's house so we could stop on the way and get something from my parents house.\n\nI should preface this by saying that Heidi and I have had problems for a while now. Heidi is white trash and a complete asshole. She bosses my mother around and is an all around unpleasant person. I wish my sister wouldn't use her for childcare, but I'm told the arrangement will end soon. Anyway, as Heidi, her husband and I were on our way back I told her how the funeral was going who was there... Heidi made the gem of a comment \"If only her kids cared enough to see her while she was alive\" she also called them \"vultures\" for going through Grandma's jewelry too soon. I wanted to spit in her face, but we were arriving to the funeral so I held it in.\n\nAfterwards I told my mother that I want nothing to do with Heidi until she apologizes. Heidi has done some shitty things in her life, but to insult my grandmothers children at her funeral (or on the way, for a point at me being the asshole, we were in her car in the road and no one else would hear) is my limit. Unless Heidi apologizes, she's out of my life. I told Mom that if I see Heidi when I go to visit I don't care what time it is or what the weather, I'm getting my things, getting in my car and driving home. The holidays are coming and I'm reiterating to my mother, I don't care if it's my nephews first holiday season, I see Heidi, I'm out. My mom has always kowtowed to her siblings and I know this is causing her stress. She's insisting that Heidi was kind to my Grandma in life and spent time with her while she was sick. I've told my sister this as well, my sister made similar disgusting comments. I've told her off. I'm giving my sister leeway due to stress from raising a baby. I intend to keep up on my promise. I haven't told my Dad what Heidi said or my ultimatum.\n\ntl;dr: \n\n- Aunt insulted my grandmothers children on her way to her funeral\n- Aunt and grandmother are on different branches of the family and unrelated\n- My mother insists that my aunt spent time with Grandma while she was sick and they were friendly while Grandma was alive\n- The insult was uncalled for and blaming them for making choices in a hard time\n- If I see Heidi while vising my parents I'm leaving\n- My mother won't acknowledge what Heidi said was wrong and is stressed that I'm causing a rift\n\nI feel it necessary to close by saying, I will never be violent with Heidi. She isn't worth jail time. I may insult her loudly but overall I jsut want to never see her again.",

      "description": "**posted elsewhere last night. Getting more opinions**\n\nBasically the title, but here's some extra info:\n\n- whenever we see each other, he won't leave until at least 12am (and won't let me leave until then either if I'm at his place). Even weeknights. I work 9-5 while he is a student.\n\n- he bought me a game for his console, not mine, so I can't play it at home.\n\n- no matter what I'm doing, he wants kisses *all the time*. Middle of a timed level? Kiss. Spooning with my back towards him? Kiss. Driving? Kiss. At least for that one he waits for red lights. If I say no, he pouts and tries again 30 seconds later.\n\n- we have broken up on two different occasions. The first time (lasting a little over one year) was because he was super clingy and wanted all of my spare time, but didn't want to do any of my preferred activities, and the second (lasting 9 months) was because he allowed his friends and family to treat me like shit.\n\n- start to finish we've been together for 4 years if you don't subtract the breakups.\n\n- experience has shown that he doesn't respond to gentle requests (ie \"please go home so I can go to bed; I'm really tired\" or \"please don't try to kiss me now, I'm trying to finish this level\"). He only listens when I get frustrated enough to yell, and then he complies, but nearly in tears.\n\nI do love him. But I'm horribly annoyed by this behaviour. AITA for being annoyed?",

      "description": " (Thowaway)\n\nAround 2 years ago an old friend of mine (called T here) became addicted to heroin. Although I knew they were using various recreational drugs for many years prior, I didn’t realize the degree until their heroin addiction was leaked to me by T’s colleague, who needed immediate help bringing T to rehab / family. T’s colleague warned me that T would deny being on heroin, which they did on the day they I took T to the airport.\n\nRehab was in different state and my contact with T has been sparse. I’m not sure how much rehab or therapy was actually attended. I’ve had mainly digital contact with T since their relocation, during which T has said they’ve been doing better, although avoiding being open about details. Others that have interacted more closely with T have said otherwise, siting drug related behavior and other illegal activities. My trust and general feeling of friendship with T have really declined to say the least.\n\nRecently, T contacted me to tell me that they are engaged and their SO is pregnant, acting as if the only thing to discuss is how I could best attend the wedding. I feel this is a red flag, and am worried that T has glossed over their addiction with their SO and may be using the situation for personal gain with no real regard for their SO or child. \n\nI want to confront T and get their word that this is not the case, but I’m not sure how I’ll be able to be sure of anything over phone/digital communication. I’ve started to think that the best thing to do is tell their SO (who I have never met) about what I know in case the SO has been lied to. I want to do this for the safety of the SO and the pregnancy primarily, but do not want to destroy T and SO’s relationship if it is actually a good and honest one. What is my responsibility here? AITA for thinking I should intervene?\n\n**TLDR** not sure if I will be saving someone + a possible newborn from a marriage with a heroin addict or ruining a marriage.",

      "description": "Sorry, first time poster here, formatting, etc. (Maybe a little too long backstory?) \n\nSo, as the title states, my extremely close friend of 13 years recently passed due to a school shooting, where she was specifically targeted by her ex. She had multiple other siblings, most of which are... A little overwhelming to say the least. \n\nShe was the only one out of them that her mother could rely on to take care of the little ones, because her older sibling was/is taking drugs at school/a complete asshole to the other siblings and parents. The next youngest sibling after her is attention needy and is verbally toxic, and won't accept anybody else's opinion unless they agree with him. The others are incredibly immature for their age (even before the shooting) and are physical with guests and visitors to the point of insanity (constantly hitting, biting, etc.) \n\nAfter the shooting, their family and mine became incredibly close because of the circumstances, but when it came time to have friends, see movies, etc. I wanted nothing to do with them, because of how they acted and were talking in public. They were openly arguing with parents/cussing them out in front of others/being dicks in general, and yet my family still continued to entertain them because \"they're going through a tough time, they need all the support and love they can get\".\n\n It continued to piss me off when the siblings repeatedly asked for food (bought from restaurants) when we mentioned we were going, and my mother would never deny them, reinforcing this behavior. It got to the point where they were invading me and my siblings social plans with friends, all because they heard from others that we were doing activities/events. Still, I was forced to go along with it and my day would then be ruined, because of the way they acted towards my friends/relatives.\n\nNow, it's been a few months since the incident, but they're continuing to be this way, and I finally put my foot down. I told them they couldn't act this way around my friends, because my friends would be miserable but bear it for the sake of my friendship with them, and I would be miserable as well. I still would see them/talk to their family, but they absolutely could not act like entitled little pricks who used the death of their sister to get unnecessary things like clothes/gifts/etc. (No, they weren't poor and they had a constant supply of food/clothes/shelter).\n\n AITA for doing this? I know that they needed somebody to talk to, be there for them, and comfort them during their time of loss, but them throwing the death of my best friend back in my face every time they want a new jacket is heartbreaking and infuriating. I've talked to other friends who also talk to this family, and they seem to be having the same problem.\n\nAgain, sorry for rambling. This has been going on for months and I'm sick and tired of people using deaths as an excuse for personal benefit.",

      "description": "I’ve been married for a year. My husband has had this damn doll since before we even met. For those that aren’t aware, there are lifelike dolls made for purchase. It is freakishly similar to a real woman. It was very hard for me to even lift the thing on my own to take it to the dump, but I did manage!\n\nI generally try my best not to kink shame anyone because everyone has preferences. But my husband’s...interactions...with this thing have always gotten under my skin. I almost feel like he’s having an affair, as stupid as that may sound. \n\nHe said there was a time when he was having sex with it almost daily. When we began dating/being intimate he cut it down to once or twice a week (or so he claims).\n\nI have tried to talk to him about how this makes me feel. He always brings it back to the fact that I have dildos and vibrators, so what’s the difference? Well, they don’t have FACES for one!\n\nThis week I guess I just snapped. While my husband was still at work I hauled the thing to my town dump. He was pissed when he got home, obviously. I don’t know he exact cost, but I think he said before that he paid a few thousand dollars for it. Despite that, I can’t lie and say I feel guilty. I actually feel a huge sense of relief. (Maybe that in itself makes me the asshole but it is what it is). \n\nMy husband actually went to the dump to try to get the doll back, but I guess it was too late. After that he was even more furious and threatened to throw my designer clothes/bags in the trash too. So we had a big fight. Maybe the biggest in our marriage. But if I had to look at that thing one more minute, I think I’d have left him anyway. \n\nSorry if this post is a bit too weird for people. I can’t really share this story with anyone else for obvious reasons and my husband is still too mad to have a normal conversation with me. So it’s nice to finally get it out and hopefully hear some neutral perspectives. ",

      "description": "My spouse was extremely good during our marriage, but we had lots of problems at the beginning when i discovered that their recent relationships all ended with cheating and moving on to the new person. It was very hard but we regained the thrust we stayed together for 3 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, what i feared at the start happened. My spouse met someone online and it only started as a friendship but there was frequent communication between them behind my back for months. the contact is now permanent (every day several times) and the nature of the relationship is different and there are feelings involved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was asked for the divorce and even tho i wanted to try to fix the marriage i agreed to not contest it just to make things easier and cheaper avoiding courts. But when we were deciding how to split assets (my spouse does not think i deserve anything because earn almost a third of their wage and i did not contribute the same economically) I was lied to and i knew it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI invaded their privacy (i know is bad but consider the magnitude of a divorce) to find the truth and that is when i discovered the affair and that there is money that my spouse tried to hide from me. I collected evidence of both things in case we end up in court.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner was great during the whole relationship and i was not great but not bad either. My spouse wants me to stay and help with an uncontested divorce but refuses to be completely honest about the money and keeps permanent contact with the new person despite me asking to stop it until the divorce is finalized.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to facilitate an easy exit for my partner, and either contest the divorce or simply refuse to cooperate and then provide the evidence i have and claim for a ruling from the court about the assets split thing?",

      "description": "Since i dont want this to be *too* long, heres a basic summary.\n\nI play a game with a large community. A good portion of everything is text based. \n\nWe have groups where there is the owner (creator) Admins and members.\n\nThe group im in is very art focused (for those that know closed species, it was basically one of those)\n\nSo this game is linked through facebook, therefore there is technically age restrictions of 13+ because of possible ill content for minors (Major cussing for example)\n\nSo this kid was an admin in the group with me, and i had just bought the group for myself since the owner couldnt keep up with it. Since only the owner can do things like addming more admins or removing admins, we kept in touch (since you cant really transfer ownership unless you email the game's support and go through a bunch of stuff)\n\n\nAnyways, in this group we would host games, mostly text based like Werewolf/Mafia and raffles and such.\n\nIn one of out games, the kid joined it, and lost. No biggie, we host tons of games and they can even host their own, as admin. Plus its common to lose since we had 20+ people joining games that are meant to have one winner.\n\nSo after this game, the kid attacks a different admin in PM (private messages) yelling at them for betraying their trust by voting them in a game where the more votes=bad. \n\nThe admin was harrased for about two days before contacting me with proof in the form of screenshots.\n\nI went over it with the creator and agreed to remove them.\n\nI sent a formal notice so they wouldnt be confused about their removal, and it was basically along the lines of \"Your actions were viewed as immature, we were notified of your primate messages attacking people, and we have chosen to remove your adminship. If your behavior changes, you may have a chance to rejoin us.\"\n\nA day later their mom PMs me about them, saying how it was kinda rude of me to call a 10 year old with autism \"immature\" because *thats just how kids are*. After i clarified that the adminship she was holding could be on par with a job and providing an analogy about employees harassing customers, she stopped responding. \n\nI did feel a tad guilty, but they deserved a proper punishment for their behavior, right? If left unchecked, people would leave to avoid them (as a few people have told me when they left claiming the group was \"toxic\" despite *almost* everyone being really friendly.) and the group would just die, causing their adminship to be pointless. Kid or not, they need to be responsible if in a position of any kind of leadership. Or maybe thats just me. ",

There was a somewhat communal water dispenser that the other 3 roommates used and I was not to use it. I had asked about paying for use of it the first day or so I was in the house since the water is awful in the area and was told no, the 3 of them use it and that's it. No problem. I got my own, and have my own internet separate from theirs as the rest of the utilities are included in rent. But everyone pays for their own stuff other than what the other 3 decided to go in together on. Now, my roommates are asking if they can use my water dispenser because they like mine more than theirs, and if they can use my internet because they don't want to pay for a new router now that theirs is acting weird. I don't really want to let them. I know it's probably petty, but am I being an asshole?",

      "description": "Some Backstory: Not too long ago, I escaped my abusive parents to live with my boyfriend. We were long distance dating for a while and he wanted to help me get help.  I lived in PA while he lived in UT. Well I eventually moved in and across the country with him after we discussed it and in doing this, I was disowned from my entire family. I didn't have a job (I had quit it to move and the move was rather sudden planned on moving in May and I ended up moving 2 months earlier than I planned). So I started volunteering at the local Aquarium to keep me busy as I looked for a job. It had taken me 5 months to find a decent job here in Utah. During that time I was trying but there wasn't much to do in science without a PH.D in academia. He comes from a family of very good means (his mom has fuck you money) and his mother constantly berated me for not having a job and she told him that he should protect himself from being taken advantage of and I should have gotten a temp job in between while looking. He had told me that frankly I didn't need to work, and he wanted me to go to a place where I would be happy. Eventually I found a good job in R&amp;D for a pharma company and we finally started to pull ahead financially from me moving in. He proposed to me about a month ago and we are genuinely happy for one another. I honestly feel as if I am the luckiest girl alive and am greatful for him every day for just coming into my life. \n\nThe problem: He recently was offered a significant promotion, which would require us to move to Seattle. His mother lives in Seattle. I don't want to pidgenhole him in his carrier and he would be climbing essentially 4 management positions (from middle management to just below the CFO). I don't think I could bare to have 0 support surrounding me and I have issues making friends due to my childhood (I shut down and don't talk a lot) so I havent made very close friends here in UT. We talked it over and I wouldnt have to work, and can finally persue my goal of going for a PH.D. The only thing I'm worried about is him or his mother thinking I am taking advantage of him. He really is a blessing in my life, he helped me when I really didn't think I was ever going to live past my 30s. I would need to be out of work for a year before I would start school again. And would be applying in December this year for fall 2020.  WIBTA if I quit my job to persue a doctorate? I don't want to take advantage of him. ",

      "description": "Too long didn't read will be at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give you all the full story, I have to go back a little and explain some things. I had a friend named Marco, we were close friends. He eventually proposed to a girl whom is a nice and genuine person named (not actually) Heather. Marco had some serious issues (drugs/drinking/lying/etc...). They eventually split up and Marco destroyed every bridge between myself and him. However, I stayed in touch with Heather. Not a lot, but the occaisonal like of the others post on social media. Other than some very short conversations, that was about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to about a year ago, I started dating a girl named (not actually) Stephanie. Stephanie left a relation that was going nowhere to start seeing where our relationship could go. She however lived with her ex but re-assured me that there was nothing to worry about. I wasn't happy about it, but I trust her. Over the span of almost a year, Stephanie would get a little jealous of some of the girls who had my attention before we dated. Heather was one of them. I explained who she was (on several occasions when it was brought up). She was a friend of mine, but I had **no** interest in her since she had already been with Marco. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to about a week ago. Heather messaged me out of the blue. She said she was in my state (she does not live here. She came to visit her best friend from my state that she made while living here with her ex-fiance). There was a light show going on and wanted to see if I wanted to join with herself and her best friend. I had nothing else planned and had not seen her in a couple of years in person. I agree'd and told Stephanie about it. She wanted to come along, which I said would be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following day (the day of the light show), I spent almost all day answering questions Stephanie had about Heather. Why do I still talk with her? How did I first meet her? How often do we talk? etc... It just kept coming from early in the morning all the way until about 3 or 4pm. It snowed heavily around this time and I did not feel comfortable with my vehicle (which still has summer tires) to drive around. I told both Stephanie and Heather that I couldn't do anything tonight and I will instead be going to a close by friends house and staying the night since I didn't want to risk something happening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStephanie continued the questions and I told her I was getting upset by the constant questions. There was a lack of trust because she thought it was weird that I was friends with my ex-best friends ex-fiance. I told her that it isn't more weird than her still living with her ex (this didn't go over so well). Eventually she calls me while I am running around (to several malls and finally an all year Halloween store for kaliedoscope glasses. She needed them for a school project). I explain that I have been trying to find these damn glasses all morning and just found them after running around for 4 hours on my day off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe end up getting into a fight over the phone over the subject of Heather again. I told her it is really upsetting that she doesn't trust me when I give her tons of trust by still living with her ex. She explains that she does trust me. Then I bring up why she would be asking all the questions if she did in fact trust me. She tried explaining that she is skeptical of the situation. I couldn't believe what I heard. I told her that if she is skeptical that she clearly doesn't trust me than. She tries to tell me that she can trust me but be skeptical of what I am saying and what I could be doing without her knowing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt ends with us breaking up because she says that she will always be skeptical of everything and everyone. That clearly was not okay with me when I put so much faith and trust in her and have given her literally no reason to fear what I am doing. I have (on multiple occasions) offered to have her look through my phone or any conversations I have with someone to help clear her mind. She refuses every time. Looking back on it, I still feel like I am in the right here. But am I just being biased over my own views and opinions? Or am I the asshole in this situation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClearly neither of us are going to back down from our view points but thats why I wanted to ask you, the people of Reddit. Am I the Asshole? Or was I right to be upset and tell her that you can't trust someone while being skeptical of them at the same time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl:dr Ex tried telling me she trusts me but is skeptical of me and to me that didn't make any sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I proposed the idea of going to the beach with a group of friends. I booked the house with my credit card on Air BnB. When I originally booked the trip I had invited 2 couples and the rest were single friends. I also invited one of  my best friend (Taylor) but I didn’t invite her boyfriend because he and I had several problems and didn’t get along. Everyone has paid in this trip (no one has paid completely tho except the couples) except one single friend hasn’t Paid at all and things had been better and I’m slightly more inclined to invite my friends boyfriend now if this friend cannot pay up (Let’s call this bf jake) there’s a limited number of beds and Taylor suggested that her and jake share a bed which of course that’s a good idea. However I went back to the booking to draw things out and I realized that I would be left to share the bunk beds, which is fine in theory but honestly I paid for the whole trip with my card and I really want to have the master bedroom (queen bed) and share it with my friend Katie who I also invited, and told me how nervous she was to go as I am her only mutual friend. The other guys would be in the bunk beds too and Idk im just thinking she would feel weird and be anxious if she didn’t have a space space to hang away from people if needed. The bunk beds have a double bed on bottom that Taylor and Jake could sleep in but ugh would I be an ass to put them in it bc they wouldn’t have privacy? I haven’t officially invited Jake but I really think I’m going to.\n\nTLDR I booked a beach house with my friends and I paid for it in full. Friends are paying back. One can’t pay. My friend wants her bf to come take persons place but I don’t want to give the Queen bed to them bc I wanted to share with nervous friend and would rather give the double bed in the shared room with other people.

      "description": "So currently I'm in university right now and sharing the room with a friend that I've known since some time back. While she's a decent roommate and all, she has this extremely intense body odour which i cannot stand and it has led to me resenting my initial agreement to share a room with her. I've thought about telling her, but it seems to be very rude and I'm not sure if this is even something that she can change. The odour stays even after she showers, and I've confirmed several times that it is her body odour rather than anything else in the room.\n\nIn a few months time I'll be going on an exchange, but she'll be there too. Problem is, it's a small group travelling and the accommodations made only have double beds. She doesn't know anyone else on this trip, which will mean i will have to share the bed with her, which already makes me dread the body odour. \n\nAITA if i want to make this piece of information known to her?

      "description": "Yesterday I witnessed an incident where an older woman (at least 65+ years old) slipped on the wet floor outside a fuel station and seriously injure her leg. It was during a massive storm and it was raining hard, which is why the concrete was wet and she slipped. Several people ran to help her and call an ambulance. She was howling in pain and lying on the wet ground trying to hold her injured leg up. \n\nI really wanted to give her something to cover up from the cold and wet, but all I had was a knitted blanket that my friend has lent me. It's a pretty cute little blanket. I decided to run it over to her, and they used it to prop up her leg and shelter her from the incoming rain. She was immediately more comfortable with her leg supported. \n\nUnfortunately I was driving for work and I had to keep going to make a delivery. I asked a gentleman to leave the blanket with staff once the ambulance picked up the woman. I drove off but I was super stressed someone would take the blanket. I made my delivery and then back-tracked 40mins to get the blanket back. Thankfully a staff member had held onto it and gave it back to me. Whew, that was a relief! Good deed done, and blanket returned safely. \n\nWhen I retold my crazy afternoon to this friend she was not impressed. She only cared that her blanket was returned in perfect condition and was disgusted that I let an injured person use it. She couldn't understand why I wanted to help someone in pain and was totally judging me. \"I'm struggling to empathise because I wasn't there\" were her words. \"Gosh I hate it when people hurt themselves in public and then cry really loud for attention\". Like, what? I'm the weirdo because I felt sorry for someone and helped them out? Sorry I used your blanket but I brought it home exactly as it was lent to me, and I even washed it for obvious reasons. \n\nAITA for using something that wasn't mine to help someone? ",

My wife bought it for us.\n\nMy wife is always asking me to NOT confront D because she is mentally ill.Party is over and D goes to the living room to write her essay right before the deadline.Me and my wife was talking about someone and D was listening to our conversation.My wife went to the living room and D started yelling about we are talking about her and teaming up against her.\n\nI walked in and heard D is saying things like \"This is why i have to move out because everybody hates me.You hate me too and whispering behind my back and you did that several times\" . Actually, no. We wasnt talking about D and never whispered about her especially not when shes close to hear it. \n\nI got mad because shes manipulating my wife and tries to force her in a situation what is completely made up.

And why do you act like we are the cause of you have to move out? If youu want to move out because you dont like us , do not try manipulating us and convience us and other people we hated you out the flat because that is not true\"\n\nThats all i sad and my wife looked at me with a \"why did u do that\" face.

I said yes. She asked if it was STILL a guys night out, which should have been a red flag but I'm dumb so I said yes. Turns out she saw the text and went nucking futs.\n\nBut in my defense...\n\nSandy is the only one of our wives that drinks regularly, Sandy and Sam drink together all the time while my wife only drinks socially, I can't remember the last time she had even a glass of wine after dinner...\n\nI knew from offline conversations that Sam's wife has plans for Friday and wouldn't be joining us, so it will in fact be another guys night out...\n\nThe 4 of us meet regularly for drinks and it has always been just 4 guys...\n\nWe mix English and Spanish when we get together and my wife not only does not speak Spanish, but she gets upset when people at her table speak too much Spanish (or any language she doesn't understand/English)...\n\nI honesty don't think she would have fun with us. In fact, if we're going to spend time together, I'd rather go somewhere just the 2 of us and not to a sports bar to drink with the guys. I tried explaining that to her but she's not having it.\n\nIn fact, she's so upset I'm getting the feeling maybe I'm missing something. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I can't talk much about the project (NDA), I don't want to name the client, or give too much away about the other engineer, so we'll give the engineer the name Bob.\n\nI'm a recently graduated engineer with a passion for what I do. I chose to go to a school that offered me a full ride, despite the school not being known for engineering (it is accredited though). I worked all through college, got into paid internships very early, now I work commercial research and couldn't be happier; but I felt like I could take on more so I started putting in proposals for freelancing jobs. I get put on an interesting project with another engineer, bob, who lives in the same city as the client. So far so good. \n\nDespite living a couple hours from the client, I decide to drive in for the initial meeting, make a good impression. I get there, and Bob greets me at the door of the office instead of the client, and immediately starts talking about himself; primarily about how he graduated from a prestigious tech school nearby. Graduated 5 years ago. Great. We'll call that school tech. I introduce myself with my work experience upon being asked, and talk none about the school I went to, because personally, I think it's more important what you do with your education, not where you get it.\n\nBut this is how the meeting pretty much goes for most of the afternoon, me trying to speak about the project, client giving me half an answer or responding with a question just for Bob to interrupt with something along the lines of \"well at tech this was how we did this\" or \"when I was at tech, I learned that you should..\" over and over. We aren't even close to the same type of engineering, so eventually I was sick of him trying to pull rank on me. I wasn't there to talk about my Alma mater, I just wanted to tell the client how feasible their ideas were, and how to make them a reality. But Bob just kept on about tech. \n\nAbout 3/4 through the meeting, I was fed up and finally put down a couple slightly rude comments on the table, along the lines of \"Tech isn't going to get this project done, we are.\" This shut up Bob for the rest of the meeting, excluding questions about the project at hand. \n\nI have some small talk with the client at the end, ask where to get some food nearby, and that's the end of it. Early the next morning, I get a phone call from the client; Bob is no longer being considered for the job and they were wondering if I had any recommendations for a replacement. I've now been working with the client for two weeks with no issues, but that day has bothered me from time to time.\n\nAITA for being rude to Bob? I feel like my rude discourse with him was a large part of why he was taken off the project; but you can't ride on the coattails of your past forever, right? \n",

      "description": "AITA?\nA little backstory first: I (17M) broke up with my ex of around 9 months about 2 weeks ago my feelings had been going away slowly for a while but I still cared about her a great deal and wanted her to be happy so I let her down as easily as I possibly could. \n\nA week later she went to a sports game with a new guy (John) and I’m still in high school so obviously to everyone that was there(I wasn’t) that was a lot of drama and they were blowing up my phone about it and who he was. I didn’t care that she had moved on I was happy for her but one of my oldest friends (grace) knew the guy and she told me he had herpes (this was a joke but I didn’t realize this until she told me later) since I thought he had herpes I texted my ex’s best friend and told her exactly what my friend had told me because I still cared a great deal about my ex and didn’t want her to get a disease that I knew the guy had beforehand and could’ve let her know. \n\nAround 30 minutes later my friend grace told me that John had texted her telling her off Bc she told me He had herpes and that’s when grace told me it was just a joke so I went and apologized to my ex to John and to my ex’s best friend about the misunderstanding. They all go on to make me out to be a shitty dude and just jealous and make a huge deal over this misunderstanding that lasts for days and josh threatens to beat my face in.\n\nFast forward a week and I’m eating with a couple of friends and my ex, josh and grace come walking by and josh just stares at me then walks away and a little later grace texts me and said he wanted to fight you he has a crowbar in the back of his truck. I guess the only reason he didn’t is because I was with other people. So obviously I’m extremely pissed off from this, I was close to getting my head bashed in with a crowbar over some small childish shit. Josh would’ve done it too I was told he has gotten in fights with crowbars before.\n\nI texted my ex and went off I was and still am angrier than I ever have been in my entire life. she blocked me and I’m glad she did because I probably wouldn’t of been able to stop myself from going off on her since she was defending him for wanting to bash my head in with a crowbar. She’s now calling me a peice of shit and that it’s all my fault. So AITA?",

By her logic I should stop talking to other girls that I've been friends with for years. Once a classmate of mine texted me saying \"I'm lonely\". Gf said that I should've sent her to fu*k off. Which I didn't do. So she started attacking me that I cheat on her and that I lost her trust. By the way she looked inside my massages, since I gave her my pin. Just saying if we are already talking about trust. \nShe always says that her heart has been broken way too much and has a hard time trusting again but I don't understand why she has to give me these choices when I did nothing against her. She wanted me to choose between a good friend and her. After that I asked her the same saying \"if I have to get rid of my best friend you should do the same\". Also lately when in or after an argument I sometimes poke her with some sass Like \"you lied when you said that you take everything seriously. It's obvious that you can't take me seriously\"\n\nI have no idea about what I've done or have not done.",

      "description": "So back story, I have been with my SO for about 5 years. When we first moved out together, I was paying significantly more than him because I had a full time, average paying job. For example, he paid half of rent, I paid all utilities, food, health insurance, and household items. Red flags started coming up like him complaining about me cooking at home and not buying him takeout, him getting new computers and other things for hobbies, while I was barely affording gas to work.\n\nFast forward a year, we agreed for him to take on a high risk gig because it was his dream gig. In the end, he was scammed, I ended up taking $4,000 out of my 401K just so we could pay rent and he can buy new clothes for a new job he had to get. \n\nAfter this I put my foot down and told him he would need to start contributing half. His insurance was costing me $300/month, his eating preferences were costly, and I kept watching him buy expensive things, bass guitar, Mac, new phones, etc. \n\nNow I make about $15,000 more per year and we are still going Dutch. He brought up to me that it’s unfair because I make more money. It’s not money I get to keep though. I’m still paying back student loans (which he doesn’t have), and all those years I couldn’t pay more into them due to paying more for him, and other loans. So AITA?",

      "description": "Basically, my significant other and I always end up arguing over the volume of our voices and TV because a couple times now our neighbor (we live in apartments) has pounded on our wall randomly. My s/o always says “shhh” or “turn it down” which irritates the hell out of me because Monday-Friday our neighbor will have some girl over who, as soon as you hear the door close next door, will start moaning super loud to the point where we can hear it two rooms over. Last Wednesday she was screaming “F—- me harder!!” apparently when it was way past midnight. \n\nSo in the end I don’t care if I’m speaking at a normal volume or laugh loudly occasionally when the dude next door doesn’t seem to care if he interrupts everyone on the floor with the late night meetups. But my s/o constantly chastises me, gets all self conscious if he thinks we’re being “too loud”, and is all nervous the neighbor will knock again on the wall. I personally don’t see a problem if the same courtesy doesn’t get extended to us and if we’re not even being loud, especially on a Saturday night. \n\nSo AITA? Am I being unreasonable or petty? I want to reiterate again that I just listen and speak at a normal volume but I feel like my s/o wants us to speak in library voices and have subtitles on the tv just to avoid our neighbor knocking on the wall or having a bad opinion of us (even though we’ve only seen him like 3 times; never spoken in depth). I can admit that sometimes we or friends we have over can have loud outbursts of laughter or exclaims, but it’s never a constant flow of loudness nor is it a daily occurrence. \n\nThanks in advance for any feedback/opinions. Yet again our night has ended sourly over a disagreement over this topic, so I hope to get some honest feedback and different points of view! ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been living together for several months. About a week ago, I had a biking accident which left in pretty rough shape- the worst of it being a broken arm. \n\nMy boyfriend has been incredibly supportive- driving me to all of my doctor’s appointments, helping me to get dressed, and generally helping me to do the things that I can’t do with one broken arm. \n\nThat being said, he has been making jokes that make me uncomfortable and upset, and I wonder if I’m overreacting.\n\nThe first incident was the morning after the accident. He thought it would be funny to throw his used tissue at me, since I obviously couldn’t catch it. In pain and frustrated and exhausted from the events of the past few hours, I reacted by bursting into tears.\n\nHe told me I was overreacting and being too sensitive, and I somewhat agreed that it may have been over the top, but 3 days later, he tossed a pair of shorts at me and yelled “catch!!!!” As expected , I was extremely upset, since we had talked about this, and my reaction was again tears.\n\nLater that night he “joked” about how I must not be attracted to him anymore, since we hadn’t had sex in a few days. I explained that I was in a lot of pain, but he persisted, for about 45 minutes of pouting and whining, until I grew severely agitated. He then insisted he was joking, and how he had never met anyone as easily offended as me.\n\nThis brings us to last night. We were at a friends house, surrounded by people, when an acquaintance asked what I was doing with my time, since I’m unable to work for the time being. As I was about to answer, my boyfriend jutted in and said, “being a waste of space”. \n\nWhen I told him later that I was upset by that, he insisted that he was joking, and I shouldn’t be so sensitive.\n\nThe truth is, I feel really shitty for being mad at him and upset after all he’s doing to help me out. He had to help me shower the first few days, has helped me with cooking, and has taken me to five doctors appointments this week, not including the night he spent with me in the ER.\n\nSo tell me, am I being an ungrateful asshole for harboring anger toward him?

I love watching toturials and learning about cars and bikes, I’ve taken a few classes and a very close friend who is a mechanic helps me out with questions or any problems I have. But by no means am I professional.\n\nA lot of my friends when they learn this ask me to do work for them, the times I have they either offer me money upfront or after I do the work they ask how much they owe me. I don’t charge much and could even say I charge a lot less then local shops (I do all this at my house) Also important note. I don’t charge people for referring them to skilled mechanics for certain problems their car has that I can’t fix or don’t have the tools for. Also I don’t charge for looking up pr looking for parts. Never have.\n\n\nSo one friend of mine we’ll call her T (because I’m drinking tea rn) learned about my mechanic skills over last summer. She asked if I could work on her car. I said sure, asked her what the problem was. She wanted her speakers replaced, a total brake job, oil change, oil filter and a few other small things. The speakers are the worst for me because I hate wiring. But we had been friends for a long time so I said sure. I helped her track down all the parts she’d need, and everything came to about 400$ she lowered the proce by buying extremely cheap speakers from China. I told her it would take me about a weekend to do the car because of everything.\n\nI brought up id be charging her for it and she asked rudlet how much? I told her I’d do everything for 200 which in my opinion is really good for everything promised. She got really upset and said her bf wpuld do the speakers. Yet he always made excuses not to. I told her that this was a whole weekend of free time being used and I thought I deserved something for doing it. She tried throwing the we’ve been friends for so long card but I said no. She didn’t talk to me for 2 months.\n\n\nAbout a month ago we were hanging out and her front bumper and the front end were MANGLED mostly held together by duct tape. She told me she lost control in a snow storm and hit something. She asked if I could help fix it. I said sure the bumper for her car was mounted by brackets and we could probably get one at a scrap yard or offline. She wanted a scrap yard even though the colors most likley wouldn’t be the same. She also asked me to change her headlights and get new lenses for them. I felt bad and told her I’d do all that for 100$ and even had spare headlights she could use so she didn’t have to buy them.

      "description": "We started dating in High School and I'll admit that I pushed for the relationship to continue through college even though it would be long distance. Through the years, there's been a lot of ups and downs, mostly due to not being able to spend that much time together. I started to have doubts over whether or not this is what I wanted but I didn't tell her because I wanted to see how it would be when we were back together in person. \n\nShe came home for Spring Break and it was going pretty well until the end. At the beginning of the break, she asked me if I could drive her to the bus station because she wanted as much time with me and of course I told her yes. Three days before I was supposed to drop her off, my mom told me that she didn't want me to use the car because gas is expensive. I knew that her parents had wanted to go see a show because they thought I was taking her but they hadn't bought the tickets yet. I told my girlfriend that I could be in the car with her and her parents to drop her off but she said that wasn't the point. She even offered to pay for the gas but at this point I knew that I didn't want to be with her anymore. She yelled at me over the phone saying that I always promise her things than take it back and that she doesn't want to date someone that does this. She hung up on me after she said this but tried to call me and texted me apologizing and saying that she only said those things because she was upset. I didn't respond to her but finally texted her once saying that it's over. She came over to my house later to see me and cried saying she was sorry but I held my ground. We were in the living room talking for awhile and she said that she wouldn't leave &amp; throw away our 3 year relationship. After a couple hours of talking, I told her that I'd give her one more chance because I knew she wouldn't leave otherwise. That night and the days following, I acted like everything was normal up to the point she got on the bus. \n\n  \nI know that it wasn't the best option but I didn't have any other choice. She knew something was off when I didn't text her throughout the day and when she called me that night, I told her it was over for good. She said that I was a coward for waiting until she was far away and that she couldn't believe I talked about our future/acted normal but I did try to break up with her that night. AITA here? ",

I try my best to keep a social life and hang out with people. The thing that bothers me is that every time I make arrangements with someone, it doesn't work out and it always follows the same pattern.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decide on a day to go grab a drink or whatever. That day, we text confirming the plans. Few hours before we're supposed to meet, I get a text that they need to meet someone else before (or do something else, whatever) and they are not sure, when the will be free, so we agree that they'll let me know. Radio silence then. I text them a few time asking to let me know if they'll make it and if, give me some estimate to know when to prepare and stuff. No answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt starts to get kinda late so I get fed up, start watching a movie or do something for school. Then, a response, usually pretty late at night to meet them at \\[insert a place that's like a 30 minute subway ride away\\]. At that point, I don't feel like going out anymore (and spending money on cabs as public transport sucks after midnight and I live in a pretty big city). I just tell them I won't come. After that, I always get the \"we never hang out\" and \"you can't ALWAYS be busy\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am starting to feel like the asshole as this keeps happening quite often (more often than I'd like). Am I a control freak for expecting people to just take the time out of the day if we agreed on it (or at least let me know not at the last minute)? Am I the asshole for feeling quite angry at the people and not wanting to see them after?",

      "description": "It’s a little long and this is my first time posting here, so bear with me. Also on mobile so sorry for formatting. \n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend’s roommate / best friend lied to me on my birthday about being stuck at work but was actually at his new girl’s place instead of my small dinner party. We discovered this by tracking his phone location. \n\n\nSo my birthday was last night and I threw a super small dinner party for my friends and family. I invited my boyfriend’s roommate (let’s call him X) since I consider him to be a very close friend of mine. On X’s birthday a few months back I went to the super small dinner/drinks at a bar with their friends to celebrate with him. \n\nAnother thing that should be known about X is that he meets girls and is super super into them for about a month (like hanging out with them 5-6 nights a week right after meeting them) and then gets bored and ghosts them. Then a week later he meets a new girl who’s the “real deal this time” and the cycle starts over. X is currently 2 weeks into this cycle with a girl who we’ll call W. I haven’t met W yet and my boyfriend has only met her once for about an hour. I did not invite her to my birthday since it was a very small dinner and (again) I haven’t even met her yet and odds are she’ll not be around for much longer. \n\nSo I told X about my birthday dinner party last week and he told me he was working at the hospital that day but would come over after. My boyfriend reminded him the night before my birthday of the dinner party the next day and X was still saying he’d come over after work. Again yesterday during the day I text X reminding him of the party at 7pm because he’s notorious for ditching on plans and flaking in general. He said he would try to leave the hospital by 8 but would definitely stop by. \n\nAt 7:45pm, I text the address of the party to X. It’s on his way home from the hospital and not more than 10 minutes out of his way.  My boyfriend and X have always had their location shared on their phones with each other so my boyfriend randomly decided to check X’s location and see if he had left work yet. Sure enough, X wasn’t at the hospital and was driving. At the exact same time, X texts me back saying: “Honestly don’t think I’m goin to make it, my patient just coded while giving report. Gunna be here a while”. So he straight up lied about being stuck at work and having a patient code. 10 minutes later my boyfriend checks his location again out of curiosity, and sure enough he’s at W’s house. \n\nMy dinner party ended up being lovely and fun and I had a great time, but now it’s the next day and my boyfriend and I are pissed at X. We were planning on saying something to him tonight to let him know that we know he lied and it was pretty fucked up to ditch me for his new girl. We understand that he could’ve been exhausted and stressed from a long day at work, but he could’ve been honest with me and not lied about a patient coding and being stuck at work.\n\nAnyway, I was discussing my frustrations with my friends and they don’t think that my boyfriend and I have a right to confront him. They think it’s not right that we tracked his location, and that we invaded his privacy. All in all they don’t think it’s a big deal and we should just let it go. It was his choice if he wanted to come to my party and he wasn’t obligated to go to his roommate’s girlfriend’s party.  \n\nSo if we confront him, are we the assholes?",

      "title": "AITA for reporting a potential DUI?",
      "description": "This isn’t as clear cut as the title may suggest and is different enough from other DUI reporting stories that I don’t know how to feel. \n\nI’m good friends with some people who often hang out with this guy named “John” (names changed), one of my friend’s brother. To me, John is exactly the kind of person I hate. He’s very successful academically and socially. However, he uses his talents to be just enough of an asshole to get away with everything, meaning no one ever calls him out on his shit and no consequences come from his behavior. He’s untouchable. \n\nExample: John was telling a story once and his dad asked him to repeat something and in front of everyone, John got very snarky with him - claiming if he cared, he would have heard him the first time (this logic still doesn’t make sense to me) and that he shouldn’t have to repeat himself. John is usually this rude to his parents, but his dad was particularly upset from John lashing out at him this time since it was a party in celebration of John’s graduation. No one has ever said anything about this incident to him. \n\nGoing back to the AITA scenario, we were having a party for someone’s birthday and John is talking about how surprised he is about his brother, my good friend, is drinking and “not just being boring like he always is” and that he might even make some friends. This is something he usually says about his brother but for some reason, this time it just made me snap. I knew his dumbass would think he would be good to drive home even if he wasn’t. Sure enough, when he decided it was a good time to go, he said he was going to drive back home. As he drove away, I anonymously called the police and reported him for drunk driving. He was pulled over and got in a heap of trouble. As the police started to approach him, he panicked and tried to get away for a second until he became sensible and stopped. He blew a .08 and is getting a DUI. Now there’s a very real possibility that he won’t be able to get into the medical schools he wants to and he is really really upset about it. \n\nHere’s why I’m potentially the bad guy. Although I didn’t encourage him to drive, I didn’t try to stop him. What’s worse is that I didn’t even know if he was that intoxicated. I didn’t see how much he had and I couldn’t tell from his behavior. I just reported him anyway and hoped he’d get in trouble. \n\nI feel kind of bad for what I did, but since I did it anonymously, I don’t have anyone to discuss this with. I just want to hear what other people think. AITA?\n\nP.S: I don’t want to paint John one dimensionally. He can be very nice and from I understand. Since his girlfriend of 2 years hasn’t dumped him yet, he’s probably not too awful to her. My friend has had a lot of good times with John, but he doesn’t like that John puts him down as often as he does. \n",

      "description": "\nHi there r/AITA, I’m a 14M here. A few days ago, my dad called the police on my mom for assault. In a nutshell, a discussion about money became a fight, and my mom mainly started it but my dad was the one who called. After my dad called, my mom continued it instead of calming down. I witnessed most of the fight as I was trying to get my parents to calm down. My mom came into my brother’s room and told us not to tell the police anything, and later almost broke my brother’s phone because he was recording some parts. When the police came, my mom told them that the punch was accidental. When the police questioned my brother and I, we told them everything we saw and also the fact that our mom wanted to keep everything a secret. They thanked us and made our parents have to stay away from each other for a while. \nTwo days later, my mom came back and had a private talk with me. My brother and I now have to be witnesses at a trial, and my mom wanted us to plead the fifth. She said that “people usually don’t testify against their moms” and started getting worked up over going to jail. She told me about how people get killed in jail and how I didn’t care about her dying. She also stated that we would have to move since she would be fired from her job if she went to jail. She told me I was taking my dad’s side, and wanted to move out because she didn’t feel loved. She also sounded a bit mad at me for sharing the fact that she didn’t want us to tell the truth and the fact the my brother recorded some scenes. She was proud of us for being truthful earlier, though, so she was sending mixed signals to me imo. AITA for believing that my mom is trying to guilt me into pleading the fifth at the trial? \n",

So she gives her friend my number and we start texting we're both 22 and lets call her Sara, after a day or two of texting we meet up for coffee and she gets there before me and messages me saying she's wearing a red top. I look around and the only woman in there wearing a red top is in a wheelchair, I get kinda confused and go up to her and say Sara? She gets excited and I sit down but I'm shocked since I didn't know she's in a wheelchair, I ask her if she wants a drink or something to eat then wait in line and get us coffee and her a croissant. We spoke for like an hour about stuff and how she was born being paraplegic and had some disease but I can't remember it. After about an hour of talking and of that heavy stuff I just flat out told her I didn't know she was in a wheelchair and she said she didn't want my friend who gave me her number to tell me as she wanted me to get to know her personality before I saw her like that. I was annoyed at that and told her that its not gonna work out but I wish her the best in life and she started crying, I just bolted out of there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI almost immediately get a call from my friend and she's cursing me out, calling me a dick, douche, vain etc and that her friend is so pretty and nice I should give her a chance.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "  \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for about 2.5 years. We have a very healthy relationship, other than one part. She SCREAMS at me over the smallest things. These stories are crucial, I gotta make you understand.\n\nSo here are some examples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. She got mad at me for telling her parents a secret of hers (she smokes weed every now and then), so she belittled me for giving her up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. We were dancing at my brother’s wedding, and I picked her up (admittedly a little intoxicated) and accidentally let her down too fast, hurting her. She didn’t speak to me for three days. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Last week I was supposed to participate in a marathon for a work event and got hurt while training before the race. For some reason she was upset, even though it was an accident and I was just running around and sprained my foot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Last, but surely not least, I made her my signature brownies that she loves to make all of this up to her. I decided to bake one half with marijuana, one without. I accidentally served her the marijuana half (as well as myself, whoops) and she left our apartment and hasn’t come back. This was last night, and I don’t understand why she’s so upset over me giving her dessert. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo today, I apologized for all of it in a text. I said:\n\n\\*“I’m never going to give you up, never going to let you down, never gonna run around, and dessert you.”\\*\n\nShe hasn’t responded. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "(Sorry I’m on mobile) \n\nTL;DR at the bottom\n\nSo I’m on spring break right now with my younger sister and my dad had planned for us to go away to Indiana for 2 days to do some hiking. Honestly I wasn’t overjoyed with what we were doing but I was pretty exited to go away and do some swimming since we hadn’t gone on vacation in over 3 years. \n\nWhen we were driving on the express way our car started to have some problems so we pulled over and my dad took a look at it. He decided that it was too dangerous to drive the 2 hour trip so we turned around. \n\nI was a little annoyed but I figured we would just take my moms car and continue the trip, that was not the case.  \n\nWhenever we stopped at a ref light the car would turn off and he had to restart it again. When we were about 3 miles from our house, the car completely died and we had to call a tow truck. When we got back my mom told us that we weren’t going on the trip and she canceled the hotel. \n\nI was very mad at my parents and told them why but my dad just snapped back that it wasn’t his fault and I should be thankful we’re okay. \n\nNow yes, the car breaking down wasn’t completely his fault but he never went to get it checked Hereford we went on the road trip like you’re supposed to do. And yes I am thankful that we’re okay but I spent hours packing my bag and loading up the car for nothing. (I also later asked him if he could take my sister and I to Starbucks since he promised to do so on our trip but he yelled at us instead even tho he a) promised, b) could have easily killed us on the express was for going 20mph and c) I asked a few hours after we had gotten home) \n\nSo AITA for being upset over our cancelled spring break trip? \n\n\n\nTL;DR my family was going on a trip for the first time in 3 years and we had to cancel because our dads car broke down. I complained that we could’ve used my moms car and got yelled at. AITA for being upset? ",

The relationship was extremely toxic for me due to her battling with various mental illnesses that caused her to snap at me and physically hurt me occasionally. Me, also suffering from depression and anxiety tried my best to be good but my life was going downhill as a result of this relationship. So here we are, 2 years post the breakup and my mental health is in shambles. I’m currently seeking the help I need from my doctor and a psychiatrist and it’s going quite well. Out of the blue, I received a message from this ex and she had explained she was sexually assisted and she really needs someone she can trust and the only person she trusts is me. I know my mental health isn’t good enough and when I asked my close friend what to do, he explained that I’m not a professional and he doesn’t think I will be good help in the current mental state I’m in. I’ve listened to him and can’t decide if I’ve done the right thing. So reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I feel like because he’s older than me, he thinks he knows more than me. It can get irritating. He takes me literally a lot too, and he gives me these weird semi-lectures/rants when I make jokes. \n\nWe were out eating and I was telling him a story of when an old coworker asked me out, the coworker and I are both girls. I had told him about it when it happened, but he forgets things he doesn’t care about. \n\nI told him that she asked me by sliding me a note. He cut me off and rolled his eyes and said that I made it so obvious. I asked him how, and he mimicked me like I just opened the note like it was no big deal, like I made a show of it. At first I thought he was joking because he made this big gesture like I was opening a scroll, but he kind of doubled down that I probably made it obvious. I said no, I put it in my pocket (she didn’t fold the note, she just slid me a paper). He said “oh wow that’s even MORE obvious”. He said that now everyone saw that and probably thought we were hiding something. If he had let me finish my story, he would have known that nobody was around to see. We were alone in the back room, but if she asked me verbally then yes someone would’ve been close enough to hear unless she was creepy and whispered it to me. \n\nI just got annoyed that he not only kept cutting me off, but that yet again **I** did something wrong. This is supposed to be a funny, light-hearted story and yet somehow I’m wrong. Again. \n\nSo then he asked me, after a bit of silence, “what did the note say?” I just made a gesture that said “doesn’t matter”. \n\nHe asked me what was up, and I told him that I was just bugged because he’s always telling me I do dumb stuff or that I’m wrong. I was just trying to tell him a simple story, but why can’t he just listen to me without giving me advice or ignoring me? \n\nWe were silent for the rest of food. In the car, I asked him if he really can’t see what I’m saying. He said no, and started raising his voice. He was saying “I didn’t call you stupid or freaking go YOU’RE WRONG. So no, I’m not going to apologize because I didn’t do anything.” I wasn’t even asking for an apology (he rarely apologizes anyway). I was trying to see his side, and I didn’t even raise my voice. \n\nIt was silent again for a while, and then I just said \n\n“I’m not asking for an apology, but can I point out that every time I upset you I apologize? I don’t get to decide what upsets you, and an apol-“ \n\nhe cut me off. “You want an apology?” \n\n“No, I said-“\n\n “Do you want one?”\n\n “I said-“\n\n “Fine, I’m SORRY.” And then he started playing with his phone. Silent drive home and silent now. \n\nI feel like I’m taking crazy pills. We can’t ever have a decent talk because he always thinks I’m attacking him, and then he feels the need to “well, YOU do this”. I mean I know I can be annoying, but I don’t know what’s my fault and what’s not anymore because everything is always my fault. \n\nAITA? What do I say/do :( ",

      "title": "AITAH For not wanting my girlfriend to draw while I read to her",
      "description": "So this is not a major issue, but it is something that has come up several times. Sometimes I read to my girlfriend (she is a willing participant and says she enjoys it). However, she is an artist, and she sometimes likes to draw while I read. I am the kind of person who is mildly (ok, maybe mildly is putting it lightly) bothered when people are on their phones during movies and stuff like that (although not to the point of anger or anything, I just don't like it). \n\nNow, having done research into multi tasking I have come to the conclusion that Humans can not focus on more than one thing at once, only switch focuses. If you're just doodling random lines on a sticky note while on the phone that's one thing, you're not really paying attention to what your drawing, but if you were painting, or composing a more complicated peice, or sketching something, I feel that your attention to whoever is talking is greatly diminished and you are now being a passive listener rather than an engaged and active participant in what is being said. A person who focuses on the teacher and what they are saying is much more likely to remember what was taught than a person who was drawing during class. \n\nThere is a key difference between her family and mine. In our family, when everyone is watching a movie, everyone has devices off, the lights are off, (at least for the most part, there are exceptions of course) and everyone watches the movie, it's a family activity we all participate in. In her family, when they watch a movie the lights are on, half of them are knitting, and there's almost always a bit of chatting going on. I have gotten fairly used to this, but I tend to not see the point in watching a movie if you're not paying attention to it and at that point would rather have it off as it feels like the TV is just their to provide something to look at because of a lack of attention span. \n\nSo that explained, the main conflict is simple. I feel that when I am reading to her and she is drawing that she is a passive listener and not engaged in the story and characters and whatnot, is more concerned with her drawing, and so I feel ignored and slightly disrespected and feel like I'm more there to keep her ears busy than for her to actually hear the story. Whenever I mention this she gets upset that I want her to stop drawing and pay attention, I would rather just not read if that's what she is doing. AITAH for this and should I just suck it up? And would I be TAH if I decided to stop reading to her altogether of she isn't willing to \"pay attention\"? (BTW, she counters that drawing does not affect her ability to listen and pay attention to the story, I believe she's wrong and only THINKS she can) \n\nSidenote: she's already stopped knitting while we watch TV when it's just the two of us doing it together as an activity because she knows it annoys me, and sometimes I feel bad about that and wonder if I should tell her she can knit if she wants even though it bothers me and makes me feel like we are doing two different things instead of one thing together (although it's tv, so should I really care? You tell me)",

      "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend that we’re done if she doesn’t want another kid in the future?",
      "description": "obligatory throwaway because friends know my real account.\n\nbackground: I’m 28 with no kids. My girlfriend is 26 and has an 8 year old son from her previous relationship. She was with the guy since they were kids but when she got pregnant, he dropped the ball. She had it pretty hard during the early years and it was a huge struggle for her to balance work, school and her son. She made it work and is now in law school. (The kid’s dad made a change about three years back when his own father died and has since been helping.) We’ve been together for a year and two months and I really do love her. \n\nHowever when we first got together she did mention that she doesn’t see herself having other kids because it was incredibly hard, she values her time alone when her kid is away, and she wants to travel with her son being that he’s bigger now. Also that she has a school-age kid and doesn’t want to start over with an infant. We were too early for me to complain about it or try to change her mind. It wasn’t bought up again for some time. \n\nFast forward to last night, we were watching something and I mentioned that my coworker has left work to have her fourth kid. She said that she couldn’t imagine having that many kids. I got a little offended being that my parents had 5. She told me that that’s what worked for my parents, but it wouldn’t work for her. I asked why and she listed the reasons above and that 4 kids is “just excessive.” I tried to reason it down to 3 or even 2. She said she doesn’t want any children but her son.\n\nThe way I see it, the only reason it was so hard was because of her age when she first had him. My logic is that any future children we produce will be secure and she won’t be alone or have to struggle. for background, I have 4 siblings while she has one sister who lives in another state. She doesn’t understand how important siblings are. I told her if she’s unwilling to have even one child for me in the future then we’re done. She agreed and said we’re done then and I’m incredibly hurt. \n\nThis is a hill she’s willing to die on. She’s super smart, but so hard headed. No matter what I said all night, she wouldn’t hear it or budge her views at all. I’m hurt because I made the empty threat and she very easily went through with it. I’m not feeling valued at all. I love this woman and the thought of us having an expiration date kills me. I want to marry her and have kids with her and she’s just uninterested. She also said I was being an asshole and not taking her experiences into account when I totally am! I acknowledge how hard it was for her which is why I think she would have a totally different experience if she tried again. She’s not 18 anymore and will have me by her side. \n\nI want her back but don’t know what to say. She seemed very certain when she agreed to the breakup.\n\nPlease tell me AITA? ",

Upstairs I have two rooms (my bedroom and a second bedroom that I’ve turned into “my living room” + a bathroom) I have the upstairs to myself and stay up there most days.\n\nMy grandparents live downstairs. When my friends come over they often see them once when they first come in (because to get upstairs you have to go through the living room) but then they don’t see them after that until they leave.\n\nSo on Tuesday my grandfather was hospitalized with an aortic aneurysm. He is set for surgery later today, and I’m not sure when he’ll be home. On Sunday I generally have a DnD game. So I was wondering if I should cancel or not. On one hand, I want him to be comfortable when he does get home and not have a bunch of random people running around upstairs &amp; possibly stressing him out, but on the other we’ll be upstairs so I’m not sure if it’d matter. \n\nIt’d only be three extra people so it’s not like I’m throwing a party.",

However, my reasons for doing so are admittedly somewhat... shallow (if that's the right word). The truth is that it's (mostly) because I want to be in closer proximity to a girl that I have a huge crush on. We went to college together and were pretty good friends. I was always really into her but never acted on it. Clearly I'm still hoping that it's still a possibility. \n\nI revealed this information to another female acquaintance recently, and she sort of lost her shit. Like, screaming. She told me I was being a huge creep, and, yes, an asshole, and that I should just leave this person alone and get on with my life. Naturally I got super defensive and dug in about it. But I'm not sure that she isn't right. \n\ntl;dr Uprooting my life and moving to a new country to maybe have a shot with a girl I like. Friend thinks that's a creepy reason and a surefire trait of an asshole. Is she right?",

      "description": "  \n\nBack Story: \n\nMy sister moved to another state 7 hours’ drive away 4 years ago. Before that she lived in the same city as me. We were very close and saw each other often. She was my best friend. After she moved I visited her as often as I could- 2 or 3 times per year. Things were still good, we texted and called on a regular basis. 2 years ago we started drifting apart due to what I believe is postpartum depression on her end.  I would call and text, but her replies were few and far between.  In that time I was only able to visit once. She never once in 4 years made the trip to see me.  She couldn’t even be bothered to wish me a happy birthday on Facebook. Despite all this, I still considered us close.\n\nNow for the real story:  4 months ago my sister was in town for her husband’s grandmother’s funeral. I just so happened to text her while they were driving in and she told me they were on their way. We texted back and forth a little bit catching up and I asked if she could text me if she got any free time so we could meet up for breakfast or whatever. I told her I would love to see her and her family since it had been a long time. She said she would and I left it at that. The end of the weekend rolled around and I still had not heard from her so I decided to send another text asking what she was up to/ if we could meet up. I am on her way out of town and I was willing to meet her anywhere she wanted. This was her response: “Hey Sis, we are headed back already. Sorry.” “This has been the hardest trip ever; we cried nonstop, we’re completely emotionally worn out.”  I said “OK, but I’m pretty upset. I haven’t seen you or my niece or nephew in over a year.” In her next text to me she completely flipped out and went on about how the grandmother was the matriarch of their family and everyone was devastated and they only had time for her husband’s family etc.  I never responded to that text. I wasn’t sure how to properly convey my hurt feelings without sounding like a jerk so I left it alone. I am not in any way trying to dismiss her loss or not be understanding, but I didn't think I was asking for much. \n\nAll I was asking for was an hour of her time during her 3 day stay. Shortly after this exchange, 2 weeks or so, she and her husband (and his family!) completely blocked me and my whole family (Our mom, dad, my husband, Aunts etc) from social media with no explanation or anything.  When I texted her to ask why I never got a response. I’m devastated that I won’t get to see my niece and nephew grow up or have a good relationship with my sister again.  Am I the asshole for asking her to spare an hour to visit me while she was in town for a funeral and then being kind of mad when she didn’t? ",

      "description": "This is my first time posting here, and English is not my first language, so sorry for any mistakes. For some context: I was diagnosed with celiac disease about 2 years ago. Since then, I follow the diet religiously . I live with my grandmother ( I attend university and don't have enough money to move out.), and it was really difficult to explain to her how to be careful in the kitchen so that gluten won't get into my food. In the beggining, she was using lots of flour and the air particles got everywhere, in my food, on utensils etc. I asked her kindly and multiple times not to use any flour as cross- contamination can't be eliminated and it was constantly making me sick. I managed to finally convince her to use gluten - free flour when cooking, so I don't get sick every time I eat . Lately, (about 2 months ago) , I started to feel very sick all the time. I couldn't figure out why. I started to get scared as I didn't know what was happening. Yesterday, I came home from my boyfriend only to find a bag of  wheat flour spilled out on the kitchen table. I asked my grandma about it and she said she was making cookies for the neighbor. It turned out she' s been doing it for some time when I wasn' t home. I freaked out and started screaming at her that she' s so inconsiderate, selfish, and a terrible person as I asked her about a hundred times before  not  to do that. I told her that it' s all her fault that I feel sick all the time. Then I threw out all the flour in the kitchen while still screaming at her and finally stormed off to calm down. My question is: am I the asshole for freaking out on her? I was feeling really helpless, exhausted and desperate (and my symptoms were severe so that added to my anger)but also think that I went over the top.\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here?",

I later found out that she had a pretty bad pill problem. Anyway the last time we hung out was 4 years ago. My husband and I were having a small party at our place. Our friend showed up got really wasted and for some reason took off her necklace and left it in the bathroom. She later left without it. When i found it I immediately contacted her and let her know that she left her necklace behind. She responded it was no problem that she would just get it back the next time we hung out. Well we still have not hung out again. The first two years I had it I would reach out periodically over Facebook and try to hook up with her and get her necklace back to her. I even asked for her address but she never responded. Then she deleted her FB and I have completely lost touch with her. I have moved twice and each time I take the necklace with me. Thing is is this girl has really rich parents and this necklace is worth a lot of money. I kind of want to sell it and pay off some debts. Would I be an asshole if I did that? I know she really liked this necklace, she wore it all the time and at first was really devastated that she left it behind. Then she fell off the face of the planet and had never tried to get it back. Though that might be because of the pill problem. Do I hold on to this thing forever? ",

      "description": " \n\nOk a little backstory: my mom has been going to this church for basically my whole life. I was raised in this church and a lot of the people there are like my second family. The church pretty much entirely makes up my mom’s social circle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is the volunteer treasurer and the volunteer high school youth leader. I (21F) used to be the volunteer that ran the middle school girls youth group, so kids would deal with me for the 3 yrs and then hang out with my mom for 4 yrs. everything was going well until a parent found out I am gay. Another volunteer with the youth group sat me down and basically told me that I had to do a better job of staying in the closet or stop volunteering at the church. I chose the latter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell the rest of the church found out I was gay because I stopped being so in the closet and now every time I’m there I get weird looks, no one will talk to me, and people I considered my family won’t hug me or shake my hand anymore. I’ve kinda distanced myself from the whole thing because I’m just uncomfortable every time I’m there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom still works with the high school youth and is extremely involved at the church, but she also has a very demanding full time job and is really busy a lot of the time. She frequently will ask me to pick stuff up for her or drop stuff off at the church or be a driver for her kids when they do outings and such. She really needs the help because she has to depend on parents helping a lot but it’s not always enough so I feel like I’m leaving her without any options if I back out. But the thing is, I was really passionate about being involved with the middle school kids because they are an age group I really like dealing with, they have so many unique problems and it’s an age where they have so many questions and I liked being the person that could guide them through that and feel like I was told that I’m not allowed to do that anymore. I was never heavily involved with the high schoolers and would only help my mom every once in a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery time I help her with something, I’m reminded that I was basically kicked out of doing the thing that I really care about. And also I’m not any less gay, so if it was an issue with the middle school parents, that’s still gonna be a problem for the high school parents as well and I just don’t want to have to deal with it at all. I haven’t even been to church in like 6 mo because I just feel so shitty there so I definitely don’t want to have to put any extra time/effort/money into an organization that made it very clear I’m unwelcome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue is that I really don’t want my mom to feel like she has to chose between me and her entire friend group.\n\nWIBTA if I told her that her homophobic church makes me vastly uncomfortable and I don’t want to go there, much less volunteer there?",

      "description": "I’ve wanted to travel to a popular destination for most of my life. I met my SO about 5 years ago and we’ve been together for 4 of those. We’ve talked about going there, and she wants to join me, but she has a hard time saving money (due to things out of her control like her car needing unexpected repairs and surprise trips to the vet for our dog) and that throws a wrench into our travel plans. \n\nI have been (very) slowly saving my money for a long time and I finally have enough to go on this trip. I actually have enough to cover expenses and plane tickets for both of us and I offered that to her. She told me she doesn’t want me to pay for her and I countered with “You can pay me back for it” but she didn’t want to do that either. I briefly brought up the idea of going by myself in a separate conversation and she said she was okay with it, but the context, tone of the conversation and the way she said it made me feel otherwise.\n\nI just went through a big career change and now have a lot more flexibility and free time with my schedule. I have the money, I have the time, and it feels like I’m finally in the right place to be able to go on a trip like this. \n\nWould I be an asshole for seriously suggesting that I go without her? I’ve been wanting to go to this place for a long, long time before we met and I would LOVE if she would let me take her. But if she doesn’t want me to, I also think that it’d be a good//growing experience for me to go alone. ",

      "description": "Okay this is a tad lengthy..\n\nBackround: \n\nMyself (29f) and a friend (25f) of mine at the time were pretty inseparable. We did almost everything together and even though I have a 9 year old and a husband I always made time for her. Hell she was really good friends with my husband too! Not just to go out but every late night call crying about how lonely she is, talk her through her relationship issues, literally any time we had a conversation it always revolved around her. And I was always okay with it because she genuinely had issues and I didn't. I did notice though, after we \"broke up\" that any time I did try and talk about one of my issues it somehow still circled back to her. She was always the first one to say how she's a selfish, rich bitch. She almost wore it as a badge of pride, but she was always such a great friend that none of it bothered me. \n\nThe argument:\n\nOne night we're out drinking with some guys, there's one in particular that was flirting heavily with her and knowing he's married she heavily reciprocated the flirting. Now I understand it is not her cheating it's him however she has always turned guys down if they were married and hitting on her and always said how she respects marriage too much to entertain. Somehow tonight was different. As we're both wasted I tell her she needs to calm it down with the guy. In the middle of everyone she starts calling me out for being mean, fat and jealous of her. \n\nWe stood there, again-wasted, argueing, crying, just being hot messes. She then tells me the friendship is over and I leave. \n\nIn 8 months we haven't texted, talked, radio silence on both of our ends. \n\n\nWas I the asshole for saying something in the first place, or for not apologizing afterwards?

I paid for the food and they only paid for 1st vet visit that was around 25 euros. Now problems rose when I found a tick on her 2 days ago. My mom wouldn't let me get the tick off or take cat to the vet so he can take it off because she thinks that tick is dangerous and will bite me even though it is already attached to the cat. So today the cat was infront of the house and I picked her up to bring her to the backyard and give her some food. Lo and behold there is my mom in the backyard smoking a fag and she goes mental when she sees me carrying the cat, berating me how I can be so stupid and that I will get lyme disease. She then proceeds to hose kitten down even though it is 15 degrees out. So I go  walk around the block to try to find her and after an hour I give up. I get home pissed because kitten I hand fed is out at now 10 degrees celsius and tell my mom if kitten doesn't come back I will never talk to her again. AITA?",

      "description": "Some backstory:\n\nMy friend Anna (20F) and I (20F) have been best friends for 8 years and started liking Kpop 5 years ago or something like that. We were both around 15 when we started liking Exo but it only lasted half a year to a year for me because I just don't like obsessing over artists the way that I need to see every interview and every episode where they supposedly show their \"true self\". Fast forward a few years and our other friend Nicole (also 20F) joins us. Anna is still following EXO while I haven't been catching up with any news and only listened to like two songs or something. Anna started introducing us to BTS which was really fun at first and they are really good artists imo. \n\n Onto the story:\n\n1. Last summer we went to South Korea for Holiday (mainly because we were all pretty much still fans of BTS). It was really fun and we had a good time overall (no fights between each other or anything like that). So one time we were hanging out with our neighbours, drinking soju and eating some really good food, when I (pretty drunk) remembered how Anna told me that if you pronounce Joker a certain way it means Big Cock or something. Now me being drunk said I'll pronounce it very carefully and obviously fucked it up, hence the two Korean boys couldn't stop laughing and it was pretty funny too. It's been more than 5 months since then and they still tell the story, even when non Kpop fans are present and then explain while the other people usually just look at them weirdly. \n2. There are no normal conversations with Nicole anymore. The only thing she talks about is Kpop and literally nothing else. She's not the most outgoing girl and that's fine and everything but then she starts saying she only wants a korean boyfriend and that she wants to live in South Korea (even though she's not even trying to study korean). I don't even like our ladies night we have anymore because we'll usually watch something funny or talk or whatever, but now it's just become this huge Kpop thing where we only watch Kpop videos, listen to Kpop music and if we're not doing that Anna and Nicole are trying to do the choreography (which is fine but please let's not do it at 3am). Even when other people are there Nicole still turns on Kpop and the videos.\n3. Even in normal conversations in public spaces Nicole will randomly start dancing her favorite parts or respond in her few korean words that she knows. Whenever I say \"I don't know\" (which is kind of often tbh) she immediately responds with \"NAN MOLLA\" (\"I don't know Nan molla\" are lyrics in a song) which was funny the first few times but she's been saying that for months now and it's getting pretty annoying tbh. \n\nI know I should say that it's bothering me and I've stirred conversations back to the topics again. To be fair I did tell them I'm just not that much into it anymore but maybe I should do it again? Like am I overreacting and just being overall to harsh?",

      "title": "AITA for declining to hang out with a guy I tried to be friends with in the past?",
      "description": "I tried to make friends with this guy a couple of years ago. Granted, I did have a crush on him, so it might have seemed like I was trying to get with him, but I also wasn't opposed to us becoming platonic friends if we weren't a match romantically.  I asked him to hang out about 6 times over the years, and he only actually hung out once. He also stood me up twice, once cause he fell asleep, another because well.... just didn't contact me that he wasn't coming. I stopped trying about a year ago. Since then, we've both gotten SO's. Our social groups were somewhat connected in the past, but I actually hear and see this guy a lot more because of my SO. Not close friends, but close social group, like 3-5 of my SO's friends are this guy's friends, but just an acquaintance with my SO.\n\nAnyways, a mutual friend hosts a party. He's there. Later on in the night, we're talking, having a nice conversation. Then he asks me if my SO and I want to go to an event he's going to, too. I scoff, saying \"oh, now you want to be friends?\" To which he retorts \"uh... I mean, I wanted to, just didn't get the chance to.\" To which I am mildly infuriated with since I was always the one initiating contact in the past and he was the one curbing each single attempt. So I said, \"Uh no. Stop lying to me.\" And walk away. He's a bit perplexed and goes to confide in the others while I'm in the kitchen hanging with my SO.\n\nLater on in the night, he leaves and one of the friends confronts me about what happened. They're obviously more biased to his side of the story since everyone there is more friends with my SO and him than with me, but I tell them. They proceed to say that I was out of line for shooting him down like that. Yeah, perhaps I could have elaborated or been more polite, but all that annoyance I felt for the wasted energy and time I used on him welled up and retaliated in his face. I tell them a little bit of the backstory behind it, and some of them were still on his side. To which I said, \"you know what. If he thinks back on these past few years with all the interactions we've had, he'd understand why. I'm done trying to make friends with that guy. I don't mind if he happens to be around whenever I'm hanging out with any of y'all, but I'm not going to accept any of his attempts to hang out with him. I gave him too many chances to, and he never took them.\" It was a little awkward afterwards, but since he wasn't there anymore, the party transitioned back to normal fun.\n\nHonestly, I feel that now that I've got someone, he knows he's safe from any attempts of me going after him, so he feels safe to approach me now. Additionally, we matched on Tinder before, too so I don't think it's because he didn't find me attractive or whatever (that didn't go anywhere either). Whether that's the case or not doesn't really matter though because he still wasted my time. Or rather, I gave him too many chances to fuck me over and he took almost all of them. So I don't want to try acting like it was all nothing and I'll just overlook how he disrespected me in the past. But a few of those friends and probably whoever else he confided in probably see me as the asshole since I shot him down with no context as to why.",

      "description": "So at uni the other day I was walking along a path where they were doing construction work nearby. On the path there was a straight road leading to an 90 degree right turn which I needed to go through to get to my class, about a half a meter before this turn was a construction worker of sorts standing guard of a gap between the turn and the straight path (so like a mini shortcut). We get a lot of tourists and I was stuck behind a big group of them at the turn so I opted to go through the shortcut. (This shortcut had no construction work happening it was just being blocked for some reason). As I was walking this man stuck his arm infront of me as a way of telling me I cant go through here(this annoyed me). I asked him \"why not\" and he didnt  really give me an answer, just said something along the lines of just doing my job.  I said this was stupid (something I regret, I shouldnt have  belittled his job) and decided to walk right through him despite his protests. AITA?\n\nI went back and apologised which I somewhat regret because as soon as he saw me he stuck his arm out when I was just saying sorry.",

      "description": "I (23 M living in NY) somewhat convinced a friend of mine, who I met in South America and who lives in Germany, to travel Iceland with me. I suggested to him Iceland, and he was on board with it. I didn't have to beg him, but there was a period a few months ago where we didn't know which country would work best for both of us. I only had 5 vacation days and I said that Iceland, because of how ridiculously expensive it is and our limited time, middle point between NY and Germany, and both of our interest in nature / landscape, would be the best. We both agreed and booked flights. We also booked a van, $350 each of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, WOW AIR ceases operations. Flight is cancelled. He booked with another airline. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe asked if I was willing to book another flight. I said i wasn't sure because I wanted to make sure I could recoup the initial $400 from the first flight. The new flight would cost me anywhere from 600-800$. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI offered to pay half of his flight if he didn't go, which would be $170. We could get refunded the van cost. So we would both stand to lose at minium $170. Max, i would lose would be 570 (400+170).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel really guilty for not be able to come since this was my idea at first. So AITA for not re-booking a flight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Wow air stops operating, new cost of flight is 1.5-2x more expensive. Friend booked with another airline. I've cancelled. He might travel solo. I've offered to pay half of his flight cost if he doesn't go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ",

Don't get me wrong, I love my mom to death, but conversations with her tend to by straining on me, because they usually turn into interrogations where she just grills me about my bad grades, or my bad eating habits, or whatever else she disapproves of in that moment, which means I'm put on edge whenever she comes and chats with me.\n\nThe other day (Thursday), I had a rough day at school, so when I got home, I wanted to keep to myself for a while particularly strongly. My mom got home a few hours later, and when she came to ask me how my day was, I bluntly told her \"I had a rough day at school, and don't feel like talking. I want to keep to myself\". She tried to start conversations a few more times throughout the day, but I just gave really brief \"yes\" or \"no\" answers, again, because I wasn't feeling sociable.\n\nThe next day (Friday), I still just wanted to be left alone, which I told my mom again. Towards the end of the day, she started crying because she though I was being needlessly mean to her by ignoring her and being dismissive. I sat down with her and talked with her to calm her down, but I after I defused that situation, I went back to minding my own business for the day. \n\nI haven't told her about why talking with her is stressful, because I don't think she'd take that particularly well, but to be fair, from her point of view my dismissiveness doesn't seem to have a reason behind it.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I don’t doubt he loves me but I still get nervous because I used to be very staunch in my belief that “once a cheater, always a cheater.”\n\nToday, LBF asked me if I knew a number that I had texted him, I didn’t recognize it nor was it saved in my phone. I texted it just trying to figure out who it was, which might be dumb but who cares. I think the part that scared me and frustrated me the most was that he called him by a fake last name and when I asked bf about it he got upset and defensive.  He asked me why I texted it and if I was fucking with him when I asked who “LBF Fakelastname” was.  Mind you, he’s been very open with me about his past and past relationships/hook-ups. He told me it was Ex-FWB and I got upset. Him getting defensive like that made me nervous and scared so I got upset and now I feel like an asshole. Am I? ",

      "description": "I met my current spouse (JERK) after a peaceful divorce from my prior husband. I had to move two states away for work shortly after meeting so I kept two homes: one for work during the week and the other to see my kids from the first marriage on the weekends. Early in my relationship with Jerk I was on the fence about him because he showed signs of anger &amp; anxiety. However, a  traumatic event in his life made me sympathetic and I became closer to him. I was  covering more and more of his bills because he was “traumatized” and crippled with anxiety. He could not control his abussive temper but I was super busy with work &amp; commuting &amp; kids so I kept taking his excuses &amp; promises that he would be better.\n\nThis went on for 5 years. We built our homes together and got 2 dogs. I was paying 85% of the bills and still dealing with his outbursts but now he blamed them on the commuting. When the time came to prepare to move back to the state my kids are in, we decided to have a baby and he expressed he wanted to be a stay at home dad and proposed. I had our daughter a year before the transition “home” and that’s when the severity of his anxiety hit me. He didn’t come to the delivery. He visited us (drunk) like a guest for 20 min or so the 4 days we were in the hospital and he gave no support once we came home. He would not touch her and would not help me. I had a c-section. Two weeks later he informed me he wasnt commuting back to my work house and so I went alone terrified how in the hell I was going to work and care for a newborn.\n\nIt was devastating to me. Being personally rejected is one thing but having my daughter rejected was the worst. Eventually he came to visit us. He still would not be left alone with her and minimal contact. I had to have my mother move in full time so that I could keep my job.\n\nWhen the time came to finally stop the years of commuting and just live in our home state I thought the nitemare would finally end. Things actually got worse. He couldn’t escape us anymore. We just had the one home. His reaction was meltdowns and tantrums and cussing and ranting on a weekly basis then disappearing to sleep in his car. I had to involve the police and social services several times when it escalated to physical violence. \n\nNow she is 3. It has been daily hell every day we have lived here. He can’t be alone with her. He will not take her anywhere. He will not take care of the home. He contributes to none of the bills. He will not stop verbally assaulting me and has assaulted her twice now cussing nastily at her. \n\nNow she seeks him out desperately for attention. I have hoped so much the nitemare would stop. I see now it will not and he is only with me as a squatter. \n\nAITA for cutting him off and basically out of our daughters life when I let things go so far?",
