      "description": "I'll put a tldr at the bottom, but I'd also like to give enough background information to allow for a proper judgement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground info:\n\nUntil last week, I was in a long distance relationship.  Both my (ex)partner and I suffer from depression, which is kinda how we met.  We're both college aged, though she is younger than I am.  She is also living in a shelter currently because her home life is not great at the moment.  Also, when we started dating, I told her that one of my biggest fears in a relationship is being cheated on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Breakup Part:\n\nLast week I got a message from her on Facebook saying that she had something to confess.  Immediately my mind went to \"she must have cheated on me\".  So I asked her.  She said yes, she cheated on me.  Not wanting to be a bad guy, I asked her how \"severe\" she cheated on me (e.g. just a kiss followed by immediate regret, passionate sex, or something in between).  After pressing that question for a bit, she said she had sex with another guy.  I then told her that we were over.  She said \"but I wasn't in my right mind\".  When I asked her to clarify, she told me that her depression became too much and that she needed to feel loved, so that's why she slept with him.  That made things worse in my eyes, because depression is not an excuse to cheat, so I doubled down on my resolve and told her that we were over, but I hoped that she continued to get better mentally and that she would be more faithful with her next boyfriend.  I then couldn't message her again (I'm assuming she blocked me).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Part That Makes Me Question Myself:\n\nToday I got a voicemail from her, saying that it wasn't her who contacted me on Facebook (using her account) and that she wanted to tell me the full story.  When I called her back and said that I'd let her explain, she said that another person at the shelter asked to use her Facebook account to contact a friend, and that it was that person who messaged me (and then blocked me).  I asked if that meant she didn't cheat on me.  She said \"well, not really\".  So I asked her to explain.  She said that she and two friends (one male, one female) wanted to get out of the shelter for a change, and since the guy had some money they bought bus tickets and went into town.  They also got a hotel room with his money, and my (ex)girlfriend said it was to be able to take showers, eat food, and watch TV.  However, the guy eventually started asking my (ex)girlfriend to have sex with him, and she initially told him \"no, I have a boyfriend and you have a girlfriend\".  He kept asking her (and saying things like \"I got you this room and food with my money\") and she eventually agreed to have sex with him.  A day or so later his girlfriend finds out, and she's the one who tricked my (ex)girlfriend into letting her message me on Facebook.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Takeaway:\n\nMy (ex)girlfriend cheated on me.  She wasn't forced at gunpoint or overpowered (which would make it rape), she just got tired of saying no and therefore agreed to have sex with someone else.  Either that or the story she told me on the phone is a lie in an attempt to make me feel bad and agree to get back with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Ex-Girlfriend's Takeaway:\n\nShe says she didn't cheat on me.  She says that because she initially said no, and that she was in a \"bad side of town\" (and therefore didn't feel comfortable leaving the hotel room), that it doesn't count as cheating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr:\n\nGot a message on Facebook from my long distance (ex)girlfriend which led to a confession that she cheated on me.  I break things off over Facebook messenger.  About a week later I get a phone call from her, and she says someone else sent those messages, but she did still have sex with someone else but it doesn't count as cheating because of where it happened and that she said no at first.  I tell her I'm not changing my mind and that we are still broken up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(P.S. if this would fit better on /r/relationships or another subreddit, just let me know)",

      "description": "**Background: Sexually Promiscuous Coworker (SP)** is a nice girl, but wildly naive and immature. We only hang out because we work together; we'll drink and have game nights, but that's it. She dates around and enjoys telling others of her escapades, which include sleeping with reps that come to our building, oral sex with an uber driver, and going at it in the backseat of her car in the office parking garage. She's not shy about any of it. In December, she was caught by another **employee (E)** late at night **having sex with a random in our company's lactation room.** He was there because he had been using the office as a second home, but that's another story.\n\nE told **coworker (C)** and myself about the situation, and SP told her **good friend (A)**. To my knowledge, only us 5 know that it happened, and that's all that matters here. I let SP know that I was aware and told her to cut that shit out ASAP.\n\nNOTE: It's not my place to report it, I don't want to get involved. If anyone says anything to someone in charge, it won't be me.\n\n**Now:** I recently wrapped up a conference as event manager, with a handpicked team consisting of SP, A, and C. Before it even started, I had to drop off supplies at the hotel, and took A &amp; C. While in the car, I explained why I chose each of them, and there had been an option to add E, but due to his and SP's history, I decided against his presence. The 3 of us ended up on a tangent about him sleeping at the office, when C piped up:\n\n*\"I don't know, I prefer his sleeping at the office to ... some people doing other things ...\"*\n\nWe both knew what he was referring to and had a good chuckle about it, and **I said something along the lines of \"other things\" being a bad decision/still couldn't believe it.** At that point, A chimed in:\n\n*\"Allegedly!\"*\n\nWe all agreed with the event being alleged so we could drop the topic, and the conversation was done.\n\n**Today, SP approaches me, nearly in tears, and asks**\n\n*\"Did you talk and laugh about me in the car the other day?\"*\n\nI was up front with her that she was a tangential topic in conversation that occurred about E and, yes, we chuckled about the situation because it was common knowledge and not gossip amongst the 3 of us. And, in all fairness, she's so candid with her other shenanigans, that at this point, it's repeating factual events.\n\nShe seems incredibly hurt by it. I'm not a chronic shit-talker, but we've all done it to an extent and brought up past events, \"Oh, do you remember when so-and-so did XYZ?\". But I'm wondering ... AITA for enabling her to be brought up in another conversation, and laughing about it? It's nothing I wouldn't have joked about to her face. Or is she just emotional because she's embarrassed by it and is afraid it will come to light with people who could fire her?\n\nThanks for coming on this ride with me!",

      "title": "AITA For not wanting to share a summer job with my (F17) little sister (F15)?",
      "description": "Howdy, long time lurker here, and I've been thinking about this for a while.\n\nLast year I actively pursued getting a job as a lifeguard. I signed up for special classes, spent my own money on my certification, and found a job at our local pool, all practically without help. That was fine by me, as lifeguarding was something I really wanted to do (alongside making money) and I was the first kid in our family to go out and get a real job without a family friend's help. \n\nI ended up really enjoying my time there. Yeah it was hot, boring, and I barely made above minimum wage, but overtime was good and the people were even better. It ended up being almost a replacement for school, and meant time away from my house that I didn't have to spend cooped up with my family. I worked ~45 hours a week on average, made a shit ton of money, and planned to return again next year for a small raise and to reconnect with my coworkers.\n\nTherein lies the issue. While my sisters and I were out with my mom, she suggested the idea of lifeguarding to my oldest sister (15F). She basically said that it would be great for both of us to work together over the summer now that she's old enough to get a worker's permit, and that I can drive her there and back. She also offered to pay for my younger sister's classes (~$250). My sister agreed that this sounded like a good idea, even though I typically worked double shifts that go beyond the amount of hours she'd be legally allowed to work in a day. When I brought this up, my mom shot me down and said she'd pick her up on days I couldn't drive her home.\n\nI know this is childish of me, and that it shouldn't matter if we happen to work in the same space again, but I really don't want to work with her. It feels like I share everything with her, from activities to interests, nothing is 'mine'. This was the first thing I had for a while where I felt like I could decompress because my family wasn't around the corner ready to join in. I enjoy being viewed as an independent person, not simply her big sister. I went through the same thing with my older brother (19M) and I couldn't stand it. The closest comparison I have to this feeling is when your kid sibling wants to play with you and your friends, and as such won't leave you alone.\n\nMy sister also has a terrible work ethic when it comes to jobs, we currently both work for the same after school program twice a week and she is constantly complaining and trying to get out of it, not contacting our manager when she's unavailable, etc. I don't want to be responsible for her or her actions, and I feel like my parents would definitely expect that of me if this were to happen. When I brought my concerns up with my mom, she essentially told me to suck it up, that she had done the same thing with her older sister and that this shouldn't be an issue, that I was being selfish.\n\nSo reddit, I'm asking you, AITA for not wanting to share my summer job with my sister?",

      "description": "I have been married to my husband (Dan)  2 years now, together for almost 10.  I believe that you can be friends and have a respectable relationship with an ex, but this girl is different.  Every now and then he will talk to his ex one night stand Gina through messenger and phone calls.  She has been known to manipulate men.  Example: Gina was pregnant when Dan was with her and she tried to claim that he was the father.  He wasn’t, and eventually Gina was proven wrong.  Gina went on to have at least two divorces and three babies with different daddies.  All future conversations between Dan and Gina are online, she lives several states away. \n\nDan and I have a relationship in which we are comfortable knowing each other’s phone passwords.   A couple of years ago I noticed that he had received a photo from Gina and she was sharing her weight loss.  Poor judgement, but I checked his phone and conversation with her. (This was shortly after we married.) She was flirty with him and stating that she needed money to keep her possessions from being pawned.  I confronted him about it and he kinda just shrugged it off.  It bugged me to the point that I asked him to stop talking to her and he did.  He didn’t give her any money that I know of. \nHe also tells me that she has been diagnosed with a super rare brain disease and potentially only has a few more years to live, but still cuts it off for a while. \n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago.  I notice another notification from Gina, and again curiousity got the best of me.  This time she was just telling him about a surgery coming soon.  Dan and I talk about it a bit and everything is cool.. she’s not bringing money into the picture this time he said. \n\nA few days ago while he was in the shower his fb messenger was blowing up, and sure enough ALL messages were from her.  I noticed some raunchy stuff in the message preview, so I checked.  Gina had been sending him messages about how she was flirting with her guy roommate, being VERY descriptive about dirty details and just going on about how close they were to having sex, describing the tension between them... Lots of details about her masturbating as well.  I confronted my husband again, this time he yoinked the phone away and deleted a bunch of stuff.  \n\nI pestered him about it and eventually he confessed that she had sent him another weight loss photo and had told him to leave our marriage if he wasn’t satisfied, poking at my weight.  I asked him to stop talking to her, and he guilts me into the whole “She’s got a disease and might not make it past her surgery in April”.  Last night we left off with a compromise that he will shut her down if she does that again, and won’t let her talk about the sexy stuff anymore.  I would still much prefer that he stop talking to her entirely. \n\n\nSo WIBTA  by asking him to stop talking to her completely?",

Of course i agree and we keep chatting and it kinda gets side tracked as we talk about a bunch of other things, all while i still manage to complement the fuck out of her and build her up. at one point she made the point to say \"we're basically in like a loooooong distance poly-emotional relationship\" (she's actually in a poly relationship with someone else) and also say how great i am for always being there for her no matter if she talks to me for hours on end or just once a month and how she appreciates me. after a few hours of talking and me staying up way past my usual bed time to keep her company, she falls asleep on me, which is nbd. but the next morning she read any messages i had left her and then just doesn't reply, no thanks for keeping me company or hey i appreciate that, she just goes right back to not replying. \nAITA for being annoyed even tho she explained the night before that that is basically just how she is? im just sick of building people up only to be ignored when they dont need the confidence boost for the time being",

      "description": "Sort of TL;DR for time restraints.\n\nMy brother is in with some OK kids but they vape and must have given him one. That's a huge no no in our house. The thing is, he is already grounded and Mom would not hold back if she found out about this. She would also probably make him stop hanging out with that group, his only large group of friends. He also has pretty severe anxiety and depression, and from what I've heard, it is very easy to get vape around our school. \n\nShould I throw what I found away and move on or tell Mom?\n\nAlso please no arguing about the negative effects of vaping because it doesn't matter to me or my Mom (issues are nicotine and possible unknown negative effects).",

I believe the little sister and friend are both much younger than us as were all adults and they’re under 10 years old I believe.\n\nNow, the reason why I said no is because we smoke weed and have some stuff around the area and my roommate likes to smoke in the living room and would continue to do so because the kids parents do apparently.  \n\nI simply wouldn’t feel comfortable having two kids around, especially on short notice, that kind of area.  I don’t want to expose kids to that stuff and if anything happened, I’d likely be liable as the oldest and the one whose name is on all the bills.\n\nSo, am I the asshole or what?",

      "description": "So this happened when I was going to leave for my grandma's house. I had just recently seen my brother eating from a bag of chips, so right when we were going to leave, I grabbed a bag of chips for myself and got in the car. In the middle of the drive, my brother asks me for some chips. I refused, and told him that he already ate an entire bag and the lame excuse that he didn't offer me any chips either. I figured that if I refused and gave an explanation, things would just end there. But it didn't. He got angry and told me that if I asked, he would have given me some, which I doubt was true. He's not really the type to share his food. He then told me that I was greedy and selfish for keeping the bag of chips for myself. At this point I'm pretty stressed out, but then my dad realizes that I have chips and asks for some, to which I don't say anything because I want to keep my chips, but I know that my brother will start arguing with me if I say no. Then, my grandma comes in and calls me selfish and stingy and that I should listen to whatever my brother says. As we get in my grandma's house, she scolds me for not offering her chips even though she didn't want them, and then went on to tell me that I'm always taking things from my parents and giving nothing in return. Is it really such a big deal to share food or were my brother and grandma overreacting?",

It was great, and the speaker was really good, but afterwards quite a lot of people were being pretty cruel about her and trans people in general (as usually is the case). \n\nThe guy in particular has been a really close friend ever since I came to the school, and he's really smart. So it was a huge surprise when after the talk he told me that she (the speaker) was a 'cocky bitch' who should be 'fucking put down'. Ever since he said that I've avoided talking to him as I think tht it's pretty disgusting that he thinks that way, and i don't know if I can still be friends with him knowing his views on the topic. However I feel like I'd be overreacting by avoiding talking to him, considering how good of a friend he can be.\n\nWIBTA reddit?",

Which is when my brother buts in, saying \"I wasn't asked to bring what I am but I didn't care, it's christmas\" I've not had that good of a relationship with my family since secondary school and when me and pare he disagree, my siblings are always there shouting at me and not seeing things from my point of view.

He stayed with me for a few months and moved in with a girl and her friend. These girls have moved into an apartment without having a job and they are now 300 dollars short for rent. My friend is heavily implying and dropping hints that I should loan him 300 dollars so that they don't get evicted. I would feel a little more inclined to do so if his name was on their lease or If they hit a hard spot for whatever reason. But They have bought plenty of alcohol and furniture for their house and they have only lived there for 3 weeks. Also They are 100% free to return home. ",

      "description": "I was invited to hang out with two of my friends at a hotel room tonight. When I got there, the two of them were quite drunk. They seemed to be okay until one of them started to throw up. She was unable to walk by herself, so I had to drag her to the bathroom to get her washed up. She was very out of it and was struggling to answer simple questions (what’s her name, what year it is etc.) and to keep her eyes open. Also, my other friend was throwing up as well, but was still able to communicate and move without assistance. I didn’t want to cause a scene at the hotel, so I called my sister and partner (both of them work in healthcare) to help me take of my friends. After telling me what to do, they both said to me that once I get the two of them into bed, I should leave them to rest and call them in the morning to see if they’re ok. \n\nI was hesitant to leave them since my one friend was in rough shape. I did wake her up twice before I left to see if she was ok and asked her the same questions as I did last time, and she seemed more coherent than before. I did leave them with waters and a garbage can at their bedside as well before leaving and made sure they were both sleeping on their side. Although they were both safe in bed, a part of me feels guilty for leaving. I felt like I should of stayed with them over night, but I do feel like it is not my responsibility to babysit them.  Did I do the right thing?\n\n",

      "description": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have been with my (now ex) fiance for just about four years and recently broke off our engagement due to his parent's racist remarks at a restaurant.  We were to be married in June of this year.\n\nTo make a long story short, we met at a work conference in 2015 and maintained a long distance relationship (he lived in CA, I lived in N.C.) and made it work.  We got together for about a week every two months or so, and during this time, I met his family and he subsequently met mine when we were in each other's towns.  There were no red flags, not even a hint of how racist his parents really are - I ultimately found this out a few weeks ago.\n\nWe (me, him, and his parents) were out to dinner a few weeks ago and this little boy, must have been six years old or so, accidentally tripped our waitress resulting in dropped plates and food getting all over his mother and father. \n\nI had never seen such a dramatic shift in mood, but my future father-in-law stood up and started spewing A LOT of hateful remarks about people of other races -- I'll spare you all the details, but it was extremely vile and disgusting stuff.  People started recording on their phones.  It was a HUGE scene that left me VERY embarrassed and ashamed to be there - what makes matters even worse was that my mother-in-law did not disagree with him; she sat there nodding her head in agreement  My fiance didn't say anything,he just sat there. He didn't acknowledge what his father said, but the fact that he just let it go and didn't stand up to him was very telling.\n\nThe day after this incident I drove over to his house and broke off our engagement.  Understandably, he was very upset and naturally we had a big argument which I'm sure the neighbors heard.  I know he didn't say anything at dinner and I asked him point blank \"Are you a racist?\" - he did not answer, only turned away.  I'm not sure what that meant.\n\nI had absolutely no idea his family was like this and a big life lesson I have learned is to spend more time with a partner's family before making any decisions.  I simply can not be with someone whose family harbors so much hate - the apple doesn't drop far from the tree.\n\nWhat conflicts me is that his family paid for the entire wedding - everything from the venue, to the dresses, to the food, to the decorations.  Me personally, I don't come from a lot of money and would have been happy with a nice backyard wedding.  But I know they spent a lot which makes me feel terrible.\n\nDoes this make me an asshole?",

She didn’t believe it however and asked me to join a call with her. \n\nI did, and I just started laughing loudly until she left the call out of nowhere.

      "description": "Throwaway because people know my main account. \n\nHello all, this is a situation that happened about a year ago but every time I think about it I get upset and I really want to know, AITA? \n\nI’ll try to keep this as short as possible, but this requires some backstory. I’m a student at a university and I was looking for a place to live for a year when one of my friends said she needed another person in her group, so not having any options lined up I jumped on the opportunity. I didn’t know any of the other girls but we met and they seemed nice so I agreed to move in with them. Something happened with my friend and she had to back out of the deal, leaving me with these four other girls that I didn’t really know. However, we had already been looking at houses together so I figured we might as well go through with it, this ended up being a terrible mistake. It should also be noted that I was the only one who had not lived in a dorm so I had a lot more furniture than everyone else which was put in the common areas. \n\nWhile I am aware that I am not a perfect roommate (who is?), some things happened throughout the first semester of us living together that made it very hard for me to be at home. To start off with, I have a very busy major which requires me to work in a studio most of the time so I tend not to be home very often, especially as the semester kicks into gear. I already felt kind of weird because the other girls knew each other and with me not being around a lot I felt a little isolated. \n\nAt first everything was okay, but then things started to get out of control. One of the girls was apparently fed up with being the only person cleaning (which no one asked her to do - she was very anal about her level of cleanliness and was scrubbing floors and all kinds of surfaces) and she made a chore chart for everyone and had a meeting (at a time I was in studio) with all the roommates about it except me. I was not aware of the chore chart so I didn’t do my chores for the week, and when I came home one day I was confronted about it. I am not a very confrontational person and I got upset because I literally had no idea what my roommates were talking about (which apparently didn’t matter). I grew up in a family of 6, so I’m pretty clean but I’m used to living in a mess. I do try to keep the common areas clean and do things like my dishes, but I’m not as worried about something like scrubbing down the bathroom every week. Which I don’t mind helping out with chores, but again I had no idea that a chore chart was even a thing. \n\nSituations like that happened more often, which I think is mostly due to the fact that I wasn’t there which resulted in me getting blamed for things as I wasn’t there to defend myself. I would get yelled at for leaving dishes in the sink (most of the time that weren’t mine) for a day, and for other small things. One time I left the door unlocked one night when I got home late (around 3 AM) from working on a project and I went straight to bed and simply forgot. The next day I was confronted by all of my roommates sitting on the couch when I got home saying that I needed to apologize to them for leaving the door unlocked and how I didn’t care about anyone else except myself. Now, to be fair, around this time there were stories of someone breaking into houses (not where we lived but still) so people were a little on edge. However, they are saying how selfish I am while sitting on my couch, watching my TV, using my Fire stick. \n\nThe thing that really made me mad though was whenever I brought over my boyfriend. My boyfriend didn’t live in the same town (he went to a different university) so whenever he would come over he would usually stay for the weekend. We had agreed at the beginning of the year it was fine to have guys over as long as you told people. However, I would come home multiple times to my roommates having their boyfriends over, which wasn’t a big deal, but they would always chew me out if I forgot to give them a few days notice of my boyfriend coming up. \n\nAt the end of the semester, I brought my boyfriend over to stay for the week of finals because he was done with school and I wanted to hang out. I forgot to tell my roommates he was coming because I was spending a lot of time working on a project and it slipped my mind. When I was heading out the night he came over my roommates ambushed me and told me that my boyfriend couldn’t stay over for the week and were telling me how disrespectful I was and all this stuff. I started crying and left to hang out with my friends. I got pretty drunk and my sober friend told me that we should just take all of my stuff in the common spaces into my room if my roommates thought I was so selfish. So, me being drunk, I agreed expecting my roommates to be asleep and that I could just move my stuff quietly. When we got to my house however, my roommates were watching my TV and I didn’t want to chicken out (liquid courage I suppose) and I began moving all my stuff upstairs without saying a word. My roommates realized what was happening and started screaming at me and calling me all sorts of names saying how my parents must be so proud of me and all this shit. They kept saying how loud I was being and the only thing I said that night was, “You guys are the ones screaming at me right now.” \n\nLong story short, I moved all my stuff into my room (couldn’t fit the couch, so I just took the cushions) and my roommates wanted me to leave. I agreed but they wouldn’t agree to a sub leaser (All my roommates had to agree per the lease) so I had to stay for the next semester. After I cooled down I offered to move my stuff back downstairs but they declined. So, Reddit, AITA?\n\nTDLR: I moved into a 5 person house with 4 girls I didn’t know who confronted me about petty things constantly even though I wasn’t the only one who wasn’t doing all my chores or having my boyfriend over without telling people. One night when the confrontations came to a head and I was called selfish, I moved all of my stuff out of the common rooms (which was pretty much everything except for kitchen stuff) and into my bedroom.

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI’m currently in college and sharing an apartment with my sis and two friends who we’ve known since middle school. One of my friend has a car, so she drives herself. The other doesn’t own a car, so I volunteered to drive him to college since we’re friends.\n\nSo I wanted to leave on Fri to go home for spring break, but he wanted to leave Sat. He planned on writing an essay due that Fri after his class. My friend’s bday was on Thurs and few friends were waiting for me to come back Fri night to celebrate. I’m also 6 hours away so of course I’ll want to leave asap and hang out with friends I rarely see. They also work, so it’s hard for us to make plans.\n\nSo, we have a class in the same building. I come early and sit on a bench to do hw. He comes about 20 min before his class starts to chat. I asked him about leaving Fri for spring break. He said he had midterms to study for and a 1000-word essay due Fri night, and he plans on writing it the day of, so he wanted to leave Sat. This was our conversation:\n\nMe: Can you work on your essay ahead of time?\n\nHim: No. I need to study for midterms. I’m not changing my plans.\n\nMe: Can you work on it in-between classes?\n\nCan’t remember what he said but basically bc he didn’t want to.\n\nMe: Just do it in the car.\n\nHim: I need to be comfortable and lay everything out on my bed so I know what to write.\n\nMe: My friends having a bday party, and I really want to make it.\n\nHim: Tell your friends to move the party to Sat.\n\nMe: No. We have plans already and that’s the only other day they're free bc they have to work.\n\nDuring the conversation he sounded kinda irked and talked loudly, so I decided to drop it bc I was annoying him. The next day, I brought up the topic again.\n\nMe: Can you finish your essay in time?\n\nHim: I got another hw due Fri.\n\nMe: Just work on it ahead of time.\n\nHim: No. I did good on my test today bc I followed my plan. I’m not risking my grades for your friends.\n\nHe was talking aggressively again, so I just left. I was getting frustrated at this point and sent him a message saying I’m leaving at 2 Fri and to let me to know if he wants me to wait for him. He tells me to fuck off.\n\nFri comes and I’m ready to leave. My sis tells me that he asked her if the rest of the food in fridge is his (He didn’t pay for most of it, but whatever). So he plans on staying, and I shouldn’t wait.\n\nSo now, he hasn’t spoken to me once. He’s purposely avoiding me... He walked past me in the hallway multiple times without saying a word, treating me like a stranger.\n\nTLDR: Leaving my college roommate who doesn’t have a car at college 6 hours away bc he didn’t want to work on his essay or study ahead of time and waited last minute while I had plans with friends that work a lot, and it was hard for us to make plans, so I wanted to go home asap.\n\nSo AITA for leaving him behind? Is it justified for him to be mad and treat me this way?\n\nOur last conversation: [Link](https://imgur.com/7IdD7iG)",

      "description": "I was married to my ex husband for seven years before we divorced.  He had a daughter from a previous relationship who was 12 at the time.  In the beginning we had a very strained relationship understandably, but she grew to like me eventually.  For whatever reason though I just never felt all that much of a connection to her on my part though, despite my best efforts at it.  I always outwardly showed her love and kindness.  I always thought that it might be a “fake it until you make it” kind of thing so I just kept the act up hoping one day it would become real for me.  It never really did though.  \n\nNow that her father and I are no longer together I’m in an awkward position.  She stays in touch often.  She texts multiple times a week and is constantly trying to arrange spending time together.  I’m still pretty raw about my divorce and these interactions really are just a reminder of him and nothing more.  I’m just getting nothing out of them emotionally besides painful reminders. \n\nIf she was a child I might try to keep up the act, but she’s an adult now.  I’ve started making excuses not to get together with her and have become as distant as possible through texts.  Giving only the bare minimum answers or outright ignoring some.  I don’t really want to be brutally honest with her since she’s done nothing wrong in all this.  So I’m just doing a slow back step out of her life.  ",

My gf never wants to do anything.  It’s like pulling teeth just trying to get her to go to a bar.  And once we’re there she’ll want to go back home almost right away.  Don’t get me wrong, I like relaxing at home sometimes too, but I also need to have more than that on my days off.  \n\nI’ve tried to come up with a solution.   There’s this app, meetup.   It basically lists all the social activities and groups going on in town.   It was a huge list and I went through it suggesting things to her.   She shot them all down, wouldn’t even try one.  Who doesn’t like trivia night?!  \n\nSo I gave up.  Save for going out to eat occasionally I let it go.  A buddy of mine wanted to get back into bowling and asked me if I wanted to join a league with him.   It sounded fun so I said sure.  When I told my gf about it she got upset with me.  \n\nShe says that between my weekly game night and now bowling, I’m going out of my way not to spend time with her.   She says she didn’t move in to feel neglected.  I tried to justify it by telling her she never wants to do anything, but she just said that it shouldn’t be such a chore to spend time at home with her.   That during the week we’re too busy to connect like we used to and weekends should be about us.  \n\nI’d be thrilled if she wanted to go out and bond doing something together, that’s why I went through the meetup list, but she refuses.

      "description": "Writing on a cell phone, so please bear with me.\n\nA little back story here, I have 4 siblings 34F-half sister with same mom, 29F same dad, same mom, 27M step-sibling( and half brother to Tim) and 16M, Tim (fake name). 3 of us left home at 16 or earlier because of abusive parents and the situation at home being hell ( me 27F,  34F and 27M). 29F stayed longer with my mother and step-father ( Tims dad) due to her being slower than the rest of us and could not live on her own.\n\nWhen my mother and Tims dad split when he was about 10, 29F finally was able to move out on her own. So now it's just my mother and Tim ( because his dad got married and his wife wants nothing to do with my little brother, and he's always been lazy in taking care of his two boys anyways).  \n\nMy mother was very abusive towards us when we were children ( she was loving one minute then would explode), but with her diagnosis on being bi-polar and her being on medication has turned her into a loving, caring and emotionally present parent. She would do anything for her children. The only problem is, she's mentally drained, everyday is a challenge and educating a teenager is way out of her strength range right now.\n\nTim has a hard time with school ( always has been that way) and has already failed 1 high school year and is about to fail another one. He's actually a really smart kid with lots of dreams and ambitions, but when he starts something, he nevers finishes it. He has abandonment issues because of his father not wanting to see him often, low self esteem because he doesn't understand that people really love him and used to (if not still has) suicidal tendencies along with other things.\n\nMy mom cannot give him guidance or structure because she is not strong enough to face a teenager right now, and I've offered to take him in for the rest of the school year, to help get those grades back up and get him into a routine. The problem is he would have to change high schools, since I live an hour and a half away. He also would have to learn structure, something he's never really had before, because I will make sure he does his homework and understands the subjects and have an actual schedule.\n\nOf course he doesn't want to leave his \"I get to do what I want when I want it\" life style. I understand that. Also, uprooting him in the middle of a school year is unsettling, plus he'll be the new kid, will have to make new friends ( I would still do everything in my power for him to see his other friends too). I know that because I moved over 30 times in my school years, luckily, I only went to 5 different schools.\n\nI really want him to finish highschool, be there for him, guide him. Because right now, he's failing hard, has no motivation, is lazy with his work and doesn't care about anything ( typical teenager). Plus he smokes weed every single day. I wouldn't mind that much if he did it on the weekends. But he smokes every day.\n\nSo. I feel like my only option is to force him to come live with me and my boyfriend ( he's a really good guy and Tim likes him) and for him to hate me for a while until he gets into a less toxic routine. I just had a 40 min long talk with him and he refuses to do that. He says he's finally happy and that I'm trying to take it away from him. Am I the asshole in this situation? I genuinly want to know if I'm pushing things too far. \n\nSorry about the long post, my heart is aching right now. He's the sibling I am closest to. We usually have a great time together and I can't let him go in a downwards spiral without helping him... my 34 year old sister helped me when I was a teenager, and I'm so thankful to her.  \n\n( if it matters, my boyfriend and I are fine in our financial matters, live in a 2 story house with a basement and have 3 bedrooms. We difinitely have enough room for him)",

      "description": "Repost because I forgot the acronym.\n\nAnti-bonus: This effing site tells me to repost but won’t let me repost for 10 whole minutes? I’m already pissed off and this is complete bullshit I just want to go to bed\n\nI went to sleep at 9 p.m. (My schedule has been shit for years and I’m getting normal), but I woke up to pee and get a drink. The sink in my bathroom doesn’t work so I went out to the main room to get my drink (literally from my door to the kitchen sink is like 5 steps).\n\nSo in this 2 minute interval my mom decides the laundry needs to be taken down. In the dark (all 3 basement lights are out) through the liter boxes (they are near the door and the cats are messy so there’s pee so I stepped in pee) downstairs.\n\nMe: Can’t I do it tomorrow when there’s light down there\n\nHer: No, because it’s been there forever!\n\nThis is her laundry and her blankets that she told me to put in that spot by the way.\n\nSo now I’m mad that I was asked to do this on my way back to bed, and the anger and physical activity has now woken me up.\n\nBackstory: So we recently got a cat but she fights with my other cat so we have to keep them separate. We can keep them mellow if more of us are in the room but there weren’t so I had to catch the slippery, small cat who dug her claws into þy arm and let out smelly farts because she’s scared of the older cat.\n\nJust as I’m going to put new cat in her room, the older cat is in the room. So I say “go chase her out of there while I got this cat” (she’s hard to catch, and it’s a miracle I got her without her swiping at me because she doesn’t like to be caught or held or put in her room).\n\nAnd she freaking says “I was already up, you run her out”\n\nWhile I’m holding this terrified cat, I’m supposed to walk toward the thing she’s scared of, or let her go amd have to spend another 20 minutes trying to catch her if I put her down to run the other car out of her room.\n\nSo I’m super pissed at this point (it happened line 10 minutes ago so I’m still pissed)\n\nSo I get her in there and she growls and digs into my arm because th cat she doesn’t like is there, and the older cat runs behind a chair where I can’t reach her, and now our third even older cat has also entered the room. So I was like “screw it” and gave up.\n\nLuckily I went back and was able to chase out the older cat bwfore they fought.\n\nAm I the asshole for being pissed about having to do laundry and rangle cats for 20 minutes instead of being able to go back to fucking bed?",

      "description": "I’m a freshman in college in my second semester with a roommate. I’ve been having issues that I think are valid, but may very well be selfish. I don’t want to act on them until I’ve been judged. \n\nWhat are the issues? Here we go.\n\n1. My roommate blow dries her hair while I am sleeping (well, trying to sleep). I have a sleep disorder so I sleep at weird times. But she blow dries her hair at 9 am. Which is really early for me. \nMy side: she should go to the bathroom, I’m trying to sleep. \nHer side (likely): it’s her room too and it’s not her fault that I sleep a lot. \n\n2. She opens the blinds while I’m sleeping. I was sleeping at 1145 am today. She comes back from class and opens the blinds. I grunt so she knows I’m here. The blinds remain open. \nMy side: I’m SLEEPING \nHer side: it’s 1145 and it’s her room too \n\n3. Her bedtime varies greatly, and when she goes to sleep, I can turn on NO LIGHTS. By varies I mean 8-1230. It’s a complete surprise. \nI come back from rehearsals and I can’t put my stuff away cause it’s pitch black. Now, this is fair and I understand, but my main problem is when I’m asleep, she comes in and turns on the lights. And I mean at night. Like, if i go to bed at 11 and she comes back at 1130 she will turn on all the lights and wake me up. \nMy side: this is an unfair double standard \nHer side: not sure what she’d say\n\n4. First semester I was never in the room, so I never threw my trash away in the room trashcan. She would throw away everything in there, and then ask me to take the trash out every 4 days. Even though often I had literally nothing in there that’s mine. \nMy side: your trash, your problem\nHer side: it’s a shared room. \n\nThat’s pretty much it. Have at em boys.",

      "description": "My boyfriend, 29, is a director at a youth theatre. He directs their shows and I’ve been to see a lot of them. I used to work as a receptionist/admin assistant at a performing arts school, which is how we met as his company rented rooms at ours and he chatted and one thing lead to another \n\nHowever a year ago, I got diagnosed with severe depression. I’d had it a while, but it got so bad I ended up with suicidal thoughts and had to leave my job. My boyfriend has stuck by me through all of this even though it hasn’t been easy \n\nSo for a year I’ve been out of work. I’m at a point now where I’m better and have been trying for a lot of jobs. But none have been successful.\n\n\nMy boyfriend tells me his company are looking for a admin assistant and I’d be working for his boss, who I’ve met, who’s the company director.\n\nHe’s told him before about me and my struggle so knows how desperate I am so my boyfriend and I think great! Let’s put my name forward. \n\nHe asks me for an interview. It goes great and it’s clear I can do it. However in the interview he says something which hurts me. “I know it’s been hard for you, and being second best to your boyfriend all the time can’t be easy, in terms of career success...” I leave feeling hurt but brush it off as I really want the job.\n\nHe asks me to come for a “second interview” even though he knows me well, but I do it. My boyfriend tells me there’s no way I can’t get this job as he knows what I did before. And has recommended me. \n\nAfter that, I get an email telling me I was unsuccessful. My boyfriend is confused so I write an email asking for feedback. I get a call instead, he says “Don’t take it out on us please.” I explain I’m not and my email had been professional. He says “Look, we don’t want you and that’s that. Don’t act like a spoiled child. We saw more talented candidates and even though I know you personally I can’t take someone on out of pity because they’re not doing so great”\n\nNow this would’ve been an okay answer if I was still struggling with depression but I’m not and told him in the interview I’m ready to go back to work. The role was exactly the same as the job I had. Same admin work, literally the lowest paid job, sorting papers, taking cash from kids. Phoning the parents. I’d just be with him in an office doing that. It’s hardly “talent” so he doesn’t make sense.\n\nI found him very arrogant.The way he spoke to me proves he thinks less of me. My boyfriend agrees he was rude however refuses to say anything as his job is important Since this guy will be in the audience in my boyfriends shows I told him I don’t want to come see them or support his work at all.\n\nWe argued and he’s mad at me because it’s nothing to do with him. But I don’t want to be involved in his work anymore. I’ve been judged and made to feel like someone who isn’t worthy of being a part of the team. Also I’m finding it hard to discuss his work whenever he talks about it\n\nAm I overreacting or should I tell him I’m standing by this?\n",

      "description": "I rented out an AIRBNB for a friends birthday surprise get together with friends.  Due to this the AIRBNB is a big house and can fit several people to spend the night. To help cover the fees I asked everyone to pay even if they are not sleeping over.\n\nNow, everyone was okay with helping to pitch in since we all make similar pay and understand where we are coming from. Yet, it wasn’t until recently that a couple thought it was wrong to charge them since they weren’t spending the night and are only visiting for the get together.\nThe couple mentioned that since they are bring alcohol and some goodies for the birthday friend that it should be more than enough on their part and charging them wouldn’t be ideal.\n\nTo put out some numbers: I was charging everyone sleeping over or not to pay $30 per person.\n\nI was going to drop the rate for them for $30 buck for both of them, but they are now going around asking the other people if they are going to pay me and I’m not sure where to stand on this issue anymore.\n\nThoughts and advice welcomed!",

      "description": "This happened a few months ago, but I am having a hard time letting this go, and I feel as though my parents and my relationship is permanently messed up now. Will try and be as brief as possible-\n\nHusband and I have two kids, and when my first son was born my mom offered to provide childcare for us, and did so for 3.5 years.  Obviously this was a huge undertaking, I am extremely grateful they did this, obviously saved us a ton of money and emotional turmoil, etc. I made every effort to be as appreciative as I could possibly be. \n\nAfter kid 1 was born, my mom came to my house (30 minute drive each way) every day. After kid 2 was born, they asked that we drive the kids up to them in the morning, and said they would bring them back.  We did this for a few months, but it became a huge pain in the ass to get two kids out of the house by 6:30 in the morning, drive 30 minutes, drop kids off, then drive 30 minutes back to work, since we used to live literally right next to my work.  Also, I started feeling SO much guilt about my parents doing the drive back, obviously a huge pain in the ass for them as well. \n\nHusband never really understood the problem with this, mostly due to him never having to do it (leaves for work too early).  Parents and I start talking about us moving closer to make things easier on everyone.  Took a while to convince husband, as he did not want to live in the area that parents live in (neither did I, just random suburban sprawl away from city center) Finally wore him down, as the drive was making me and parents batty, and as winter approached I started to worry about the safety of the kids being in the car that much. \n\nSince it was wintertime and we needed the move to be “worth it” (as in, within 5 miles of parents) we didn’t have many houses to choose from.  We ended up settling on a house that is NOT what we ever would have wanted for a variety of reasons- but it was mere blocks away from my parents, so we bought it.  Mortgage payment is double what we were paying before, not ideal, but its a more expensive area and we still had leftover cash each month, so no biggie. \n\nMy commute to work is now 45 minutes to an hour each way, which sucks, but is still less than I was driving before, and now I don’t have kids screaming in the back. During house hunting process, my parents were ALL ABOUT IT, so excited, couldn’t wait to have the setup be easier also.  I asked them, SO MANY TIMES, “are you guys SURE you want to keep doing this?? because if we move, thats a commitment, and we won’t be able to afford a daycare at that point.” Yep, they reassured me it was fine.  About halfway through the year, at mom’s request, I enrolled older son in part-time preschool and also hired some part-time help for my mom. She then asked for me to pay for more help or more days at preschool, and I told her that I was sorry but I could not afford to do so. \n\nThis was all good for about eight months, when my mom (who has a variety of health issues) gets very ill and is suddenly hospitalized for two weeks.  Learning of this sent us into instant panic mode, obviously because we were concerned about her health, but also because we had no backup childcare plan. I stayed home for a week, cobbled together babysitters for another two weeks (which was hell, since kids were NOT used to that), and burned through our extra cash for that month doing so. NBD I think, just gotta get through this illness. \n\nThen I get a text message from mom that says “my doctor thinks taking care of children has taken a toll on my health and I need to quit. I don’t want to leave you hanging, so heres the name of an in-home daycare.” \n\nThis text threw me into a rage fit.  Not only do I not have time to look into this daycare, which I don’t like, but asking me to suddenly cough up an additional $1600 a month AFTER I had used all the spare cash that month on babysitters is the DEFINITION of leaving us hanging. I asked if my dad could fill in a day or two and she replied “there comes a time when you need to look outside family for help.” WTF \n\nI was honestly so angry and stressed that I could not even manage to talk to her for weeks. The in-home daycare lady even ended up filling the spot before I could even get there, so that was not an option, and all of the daycares around us had year-long waiting lists. Over the next three months, ended up burning through huge chunk of savings to pay friends and care.com people to watch kids, while I spent many sleepless nights stressing about what to do. \n\nMom was still pretty sick for a while, so I was also trying my best not to let her know I was so upset while she was trying to heal.  Finally when we got together to “talk,” and I talked calmly through my anger, she just seemed...bewildered?  No matter how many times I explained it to her she did not get why I was so angry. Still doesn’t. We have had THREE hour-plus conversations and at the start she always says “I just don’t see why you are so angry with me. I took care of the boys for years, I did a good job.” I have never disputed that! I have fallen allll over myself to be properly appreciative, the point is that they never acknowledged, in any way shape or form, the sudden, extreme financial burden that they placed on us.  \n\nTo be totally clear, I completely agree that she needed to stop doing childcare for us, completely legit.  Of course moms health is important to me, and I know she needed to stop. And I am extremely grateful for all that they did provide.  BUT now we are barely making ends meet, through connections we found daycare spots but are now paying $1900 a month, AND the kids are getting sick so often that I frequently have to shell out for emergency sick child care at $160 a day. \n\nI have tried every which way to explain this to her, and I don’t know if it is because they have always been well-off and don’t think about monthly budgets, or what, but they don’t get this at all. They keep saying, “I thought you guys were fine?!?” uhh, you mean all those times I told you I couldn’t afford 3 day a week preschool??  \n\nMom actually said “but you told me you had a decent amount of money saved?”  You mean my 401K??? you want me to burn through that until the kids are in kindergarten?” to which she replied “sometimes parents have to make tough choices.” what???  that is a real solution in her mind? \n\nSo now we are faced with moving to a cheaper place, less than a year after we moved here, which would put us in the position of trying to find another daycare spot in a different area, which is damn near impossible.  We would almost certainly lose money on this house.  Although we don’t love this place, moving sucks and neither of us are keen to do it again. \n\nWhat I can’t get over is why they have never offered us money. Still haven’t.  When they know we are struggling.  I understand that when mom first got sick she was probably in panic mode too and wasnt thinking about the money aspect, which I totally get. But now it has been months, they KNOW we are really having a hard time, and just...nothing?  When we moved partly at their urging?  They have the money, they absolutely do. They have given us money twice before as a gift (for our wedding, then for kids college fund) so it isnt like that doesnt occur to them.  I don’t feel like I can ask flat-out for a variety of reasons that would take too long to explain. \n\nTL;DR- parents suddenly tapped out of childcare due to health problems, after we moved less than a year ago to make the setup easier.  We now live in a house we don’t like, in an area we don’t want to live in, and can no longer afford now that we have the additional expense of childcare.  Am I out of line for thinking they should be helping pay to get us out of this situation?\n",

      "description": "In the first quarter of grades in my school, I had two pretty bad quiz grades, which brought my grade total to a 75. Because my grades will be sent out to colleges she bumped up my grade (along with other students) to an 80. \n\nLast Wednesday she gave us 2 worksheets to do, and we had to translate 2 pages of a book we’re reading. She told us these were due Friday, and that we would have a substitute on that Thursday. That substitute got some messed up instructions and told us to finish the translation by that class. I did. The substitute then told us that the other 2 papers would be due the next day (Friday). I did one after school and planned to finish the other one during class. Friday arrives and I start working on the worksheet, and my Italian teacher tells us that she said on Wednesday that the two papers and translation were both due on Thursday (the day before) and took my empty paper and counted it as a grade. I was understandably upset at the substitute for giving us faulty information, because maybe I heard her wrong on Wednesday. Italian teacher tells me that it was all my fault. I explain that I was sorry, that my Grandmother was in the hospital (she was brought into the hospital Thursday afternoon, returned home Friday night), and that my mind is in another place. She said that my grandmother being in the hospital is what I get for not doing my homework.\n\nThat Saturday night I had a few friends over (One of them has had her in the past, another one has the same Italian class as I, and my last friend has never had this teacher). Together we made a video called “[Redacted] High School staff portrayed by Spongebob”. For the two other Italian teachers we used the Ravioli Ravioli scene. For my current Italian teacher we used the “When people want to sound smart the talk loud, right?” “Correct” scene from the episode Band geeks. For other teachers and school staff, we made fun of they’re bald, called them terrible cops, and made fun of their personalities. My current Italian teacher is the only teacher who didn’t enjoy it, as when I walked in to class this morning she said she was mad at me and explained why.\n\nI’d also like to make it a point that my friend who is also in my Italian class was the one with the Idea for her spongebob scene, and I was insisting against its inclusion, but it made it in anyways. My friend took credit for that scene, but Im the one who she’s mad at. Finally I’d like to add that the teacher is loud, and she even points it out.",

      "description": "Long time lurker - finally posting for the first time please bear with me here \n\nFor the past couple of weeks I was seeing this guy casually (N) that I met off Tinder and things were going pretty well. I work 5 days a week including one weekend day at a medical clinic with long hours so I go to sleep pretty early to make sure I'm well rested. Saturday I went on a small day trip with my friends and got back home during the early evening. Now throughout the day Saturday, N texted me asking me about how the trip was going and what time I\"d be home so he could drive over to see me. Fast forward to the evening when I'm home and he texts me that when his errand is done at 9pm, he'd drive over. So now that I have a time frame as to what time he would arrive, I shower, unpack my things and settle in to wait for him. 9pm rolls around and suddenly he messages that he can't make it. Whatever. Fine. He's flaked a few times before so it came as no surprise. I text him back no problem and to have a safe drive home. \n\nSunday comes and I'm exhausted from the day trip before still but I run a few errands for my mom because she was sick in bed that day and also prepare dinner for the family. N and I were texting sparsely throughout the day mostly just asking after each other but not really saying if we wanted to see each other that day because I had work on Monday early as usual. 8pm rolls around and I'm serving food to everyone when I get a text from N that says \"I'm coming now\" and I start freaking out because I'm eating dinner with my family and we aren't nearly close enough or even a thing where I can introduce him to anyone. I text him back in all caps saying not to come because I was eating dinner with my family and then radio silence from him. After dinner, I clean up and start getting ready for bed because there was still no text from him after I told him I was eating dinner so I assumed he wasn't coming. He didn't say \"what time are you done with dinner I'll come over\" or \"let me know when I can come\" so I just went to bed at 9:00pm because I wake up around 6am for work everyday and I was already tired from earlier. The next morning I wake up to a text from him at 9:44pm Sunday night saying \"\"ok good, how about now\" followed by \"i'm outside let me in\". Well folks, I just about shit my pants. Immediately texted him back apologies on how I fell asleep but still haven't gotten any responses from him. To throw it out there - this guy has flaked a few times times throughout our few weeks of knowing each other so I didn't know if he was actually going to follow through on coming over in freezing weather ( he has my address from a previous visit) plus the actual lack of communication on his part is making me a little nuts. AITA??\n\nTL:DR - fell asleep on a guy who didn't really say he was coming to my house UNTIL HE TEXTED HE WAS AT MY HOUSE. ",

      "description": "At the start of the year, we got a new student who I thought I could get along with, seeing as we both liked art and I thought we would have a similar attitude, because of this we quickly let her into our friend group, it went down-hill from there. It had mainly begun with here making declarations of \"I'm trash\", \"I am so depressed\" and \"I wish I was dead\" in joking tones and I was fine with this (my sister and I myself often make rather self-deprecating jokes, just never that straight forward), except she only really repeated these jokes about her self and making jabs at everyone in our class, now most our classmates wouldn't care, because we do that to each other all the time, but she herself wouldn't let us make playful jabs back and would threaten us by telling the principal (who let her get away with most things because her mother told him she had depression, anxiety and later on a minor form of autism, she also had a real hand condition).\n\nThis continued on for a bit, her mocking us, but not allowing us to do the same. I just ignored it and so did my friends, in fact, we continued to let her hang in our group, but things began to get a little more intrusive and physical, she would get in our personal space and that is a big no with me, even my close friends and family understand I hate people in my space (it actually causes me a great amount of stress and anxiety, especially if they get close to my face, or neck), so I straight up told her I despise people being in my space and she listened, unfortunately, my friends aren't the most confrontational.\n\nAs this continued my patience grew thin and my friends and I (including the other girl) were told to go to our class and our teacher tried to solve the problem, by telling the other girl some of us had larger boundaries and I was told to be more patient with her, because she had mental health issues (I myself actually have some mental health issues, mainly cause it runs in my family), I agreed, seeing as I used to deal with it how my father and siblings dealt with it and each other, which was make snarky remarks and generally be pricks to each other. So instead I mainly ignored it and talked with my other friend, who she herself had major issues with the other girl and just recently begun to hang out with our groups (because of a falling out with her used to be a best friend) and we all got along splendidly (minus the other girl, who my other two friends were the only ones which would stand her behaviors).\n\nThis is mainly a side-fact, but my cousin (who I am very close with and treat him as though he was my brother), was in the same class and it was obvious him and I treated each other much more different and the all the teachers and as well as a lot of students understood this, I would make much harsher jabs with him then I would with others and he did the same with me, because we understood that neither of us would get hurt by what we said to each other. We making snarky comments at each other, when my teacher asked me to do and chore and I agreed, quickly doing it to get back to being an ass to my cousin, when I heard the other girl mock him, which he did in return and I saw he blow the hell up and of course she was just told to go outside, while my cousin had detention and everyone in class agreed it was bullshit.\n\nThe worse thing to happen was when I stayed home because I had a rather bad throat infection, but the next day I returned I noticed my friends were being a little off, so I asked and my friend, who herself didn't allow the other girl's leniency and told me that the other girl hadn't only pushed her into the bag-rack, but also tipped cola into another friend's eye and this made me livid and I admit what I did was rather bad, but I stormed up to the other girl and went off at her. Cause a few weeks ago she had thrown a stick at another classmate who was a fun to have conversations with and instead of hitting him, it hit my youngest friend, narrowly missing her eye and causing her to cry, causing me to yell at her and she ended up crying. I'll admit it was impulsive of me and I should've gotten a teacher, but I was so sick of her attitude, so now we're not allowed near each other and my other two friends think I was too harsh, while I still hang out with them they would have to hang out with the other girl, or the principal would think they were purposefully ditching her to make her upset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs my temper justified, or are my friends and teacher right about me being too harsh towards the girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Im sorry if this is really long. this is my first post.\n\ni’ve been fighting with my mom over this periodically over the last year and i just need somewhere to get this out and see if im really in the wrong here. im not saying im not wrong, but i dont think im completely as heartless as my mom is making me out to be.\n\nmy (25F) sister (22) has been sick for years. to make a long story short, she has an undiagnosable physical condition that has left her in severe pain for about half her life. she was in and out of the hospital for most of high school. after 2 years of uni, she had to take a year off last year bc of the pain. \n\nshe never had any friends to keep in touch with bc of her illness. she never got close to anyone. you could say that the only friends she has are me and my brother (her twin). and me and him have our own unique relationship with her. i love her. its been really hard watching her go through all this and not have any way to really help. \n\nduring her time off from uni, she was alone in the house a lot. im in uni and have a job, my brother is in uni and has a job, my mom works full time, our dad is dead to all of us, has been for 10+ years. she would always say that she wished her body would just catch up to her mind. because in her mind she knows what kind of life she wants, but she just can’t get there because of the pain. like how heartbreaking being trapped by your own body like that? i’m such a wimp, my pain threshold is practically non-existent. she always “joked” that she’s glad she was the one who got sick, bc me and my brother wouldn’t have been able to handle the pain. she’s not wrong.\n\nshe’s back in uni now on a reduced course load that she can barely handle getting to class for, but she wants to be in school so it is what it is. but she’s become severely depressed. it’s not surprising, after everything. she’s tired of feeling like shit. \n\nthe thing is, she doesn’t ever talk about anything she’s feeling, except with our mom. they have this insane bond bc of her illness. my mom is a momma bear with her. with all of us, really. but they have a thing that is unbreakable. she spent weeks sitting by my sisters side in the hospital, taking her to doctors appointments, fighting on behalf of my sister to the uni faculty when they wouldn’t accommodate her studies. my mom always likes to say that she knows our minds better than we know them ourselves. with my sister feeling the way she is feeling, but unable to really put into words what she’s feeling, she and my mom have talks all the time when my sister has her moments of severe sadness. crying, not sleeping, stressing about school, the pain, the depression. my mom is great at helping her work though all of it. the conversations they have help her. \n\ni dont know how to communicate this properly without sounding mean, but they don’t share anything with me. i don’t mean that i think i’m entitled to know everything they say, don’t get me wrong. but when it is about ME and the things that I do or say that may not help the situation that my sister is in, they don’t address it with me in the moment i do it. but when im not there they’ll talk about it. and then in a moment where i say or do the problematic thing,\n\nthe thing in this particular instance that i am doing wrong is asking “what happened?” \n\ni should also say that about 3 years ago, i was severely depressed myself. like out of commission, lying on the couch day in and day out, thinking about ending it all, depressed. i had been taking meds for depression and anxiety for a few months. the meds helped the anxiety, but were not helping the depression. my mom at that point was really old school about mental illness. meds were not supported, but she couldn’t deny that they weren’t not helping, so she shut up about them. shes had things happen that she knows should have made her want to stay in bed, but she could just tell herself to get up and go and she eventually “picked herself up by her bootstraps”. mind over matter is her motto. its great for her. i don’t know what the three of us would have done if we didn’t have our mom taking care of us. but mind over matter is not really what you want to hear when you’re in the thick of it. nothing anyone said could snap me out of it or help in any way. while there were obvious reasons for my depression, they were things that happened years ago and, really, while horrible, i was kinda really over by that point. i was just done with everything. i couldn’t see a future for myself. i didn’t really want to get better. \n\nseeing me that way was hard for my family. my mom thought she failed me as a mother. she’s a “fixer” and she couldn’t fix me. my sister was also really worried about me. they would talk to each other when i went to bed and would say how scared they were for me. it got so bad that they just wanted to know what it was that was making me so down. i would tell them that it really was nothing specific. that nothing bad was happening for me to feel this way. remember this, this is important. so they learned a lot about depression during this time. how is a chemical thing in the brain. doesn’t necessarily have a trigger. etc. they eventually told me that it was hard seeing me that way. my sister said that she found it hard bc i was her best friend and she wouldn’t know what to do if anything happened to me. that she really had no one. this shook me. the sad truth of it snapped me out of it a little. it made me want to get a little better. sometimes you dont do things for yourself, but you do things for the people that care about you. i got put on a different med that actually worked, got a part time job and hated every minute of it, went into my last year of uni, and kind of took it day by day. it was hard. i wasn’t always pleasant. none of us were, really. but things got better for me where im at the point now that i’m somewhat healthy but functioning, planning for my future after school is done. made some really good friends. \n\nso back to the present.\n\nwe were watching tv together and my brother texted asking for one of us to pick him up from the subway. i went upstairs to put in my contacts so that i can see while i drive. and while i was upstairs, my sister had a little breakdown with my mom. i came downstairs and saw her crying and immediately out of concern asked,”what happened?!”\n\napparently that was the WRONG thing to say. \n\nthis is how the fight started. me is me, mom is mom, s is sister.\n\n&gt;me: what happened?!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: Nothing happened. Does something have to happen for her to be crying?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: (shocked at the reaction) no. Whats going on?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: did you need something specific to be going on when you were like this?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;sister: stop mom!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: i was just asking what was wrong  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: (looking at sister) well if i don’t say anything nobody will. she’s said when you’ve gone upstairs, why does she (me) do that?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: mom, please stop. this is crazy.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;sister: (closes her eyes in defeat)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;silence for a minute  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: maybe i overreacted here, but she doesn’t need a reason to cry.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: i know. i was just asking out of concern.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: am i wrong, s?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;S says nothing, won’t even look at mom  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: yes, she was telling you to stop saying what you were saying  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: she was defending you so i wouldn’t yell  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: no she was telling you to not say anything  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: no we’ve talked when you’re upstairs and she doesn’t need a reason to cry and she hates when you ask for her to explain herself  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: (wanting to end the conversation and seeing no way out as usual unless i agree) okay\n\ni go out to get my brother at this point. when i come back, my sister going upstairs to bed and says goodnight. \n\nthen my mom says: \n\n&gt;mom: I’m sorry about getting angry at you. I’m just so tired and don’t know how to deal with S flip flopping between physical and mental pain. I’m sorry I yelled at you  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: thank you. I know it’s hard right now with S. But please don’t take it out on me  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: …and you missed the point again. you dont understand  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: (silence)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mom: yup, as usual, you don’t try to see things from any one else POV but you’re own. its always about you.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: “gathering my things to go upstairs bc i dont want to fight anymore and nothing i say will make it better)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: its just like living with your father again, go upstairs  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: goodnight  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: yup exactly what your father would do\n\nso at this point im really upset. i just came downstairs and saw my sister crying and asked what happened out of concern. and mom’s telling me i shouldn’t have done that bc there doesnt need to be a reason and i’ve maybe asked more than once before what was wrong and i shouldn’t have? aaand my mom brought my father into it. she does this a lot. he's not a good person in case you didn't pick up on that. \n\nnow at this point im about to fuck up. i know it but i’ve been fighting with my mom a lot, about many things. so i’m just really having trouble believing that my own sister talks to my mom behind my back about how i’m not being supportive in the right way. my sister is not shy. she tells it like it is and she doesn’t care about hurting people’s feelings. so i just find it so hard to believe that i’ve been fucking up so badly about her depression and that she can’t tell me about it TO me. so i go to her room and ask :\n\n&gt;me: can you just tell me if i said something wrong before?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;S: i dont want to do this  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: you cant just tell me?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;S: i dont want to do this  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom comes upstairs: did you really just go and talk to her after all that?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;me: i just want to understand it from her  \n&gt;  \n&gt;mom: shes not ready to talk to you. for 2 years nobody could say anything to you and we left you a",

      "description": "For background, me and my friend had known each other since freshman year of high school. She is now one of the very very few people I still talk to from school.\n\nHer and I both attend the same university now and we are about to start up our second semester. We both still live with our parents as we individually don't have the money to move out. Last semester I drove her home twice a week since we lived relatively close by and I knew she didn't have the best relationship with her parents. The first week it was ok since I was just excited to be doing something after a long summer of doing nothing but working.\n\nIt was during the first week that I learned that she still didn't have so much as a learners permit and she hasn't made any attempts at getting a job. Her parents are still paying for everything for her. As the weeks went by, all she ever did was complain about her parents being assholes, despite them still paying for everything for her. The drive from the university to where we live was over half an hour on a good day, an hour at the worst. She would talk the entire time and I could barely get a word in.\n\nI considered telling her last semester that I didn't want to drive her, but she made me feel guilty about leaving her with her family. The one time I didn't drive her was because I had to take my sister to a doctors appointment and she got really pissed at me. She kept yelling into a group chat we are both in about how I couldn't make her get picked up by her parents and no one else wanted to take her home. She ended up staying at the school until midnight then called her grandmother to pick her up. After finals, I didn't even get a thank you for driving her home all of those times.\n\nNow that we are going to be starting next semester, she keeps making offhanded comments about how she wants me to drive her home every day and I just ignore them. I really don't want to deal with all of that again. She still refuses to get a job and has barely recieved her learners permit, but she wouldn't shut up about how her parents bought her a new car. She won't be able to drive alone though until the middle of summer, so she still is going to be relying on her family to drive her.\n\nI've only talked to two friends about the situation, one agreed with me, the other said I was being a major dick by not offering to drive her this semester. What should I do? Should I just tell her straight out that I'm not going to drive her or should I still drive her?\n\nTL;DR: I am sick of hearing my friend do nothing but complain about her family on 40 minute drives and don't want to go through it for another semester.",

      "description": "So this happened a year ago. I met her at a party and we almost immediately hit it off. So we started hanging out a good bit. Even with conflicting schedules. So a pattern of behavior developed that whenever I saw her we always had to drink and she pressured me a bit. She never cleaned or did anything with herself. She has mental health issues and that's okay. But the further into the friendship with worse the drinking and drugging got. She was never sober and coped very heavily on hard drugs. She kept begging me for my meds to help her and eventually a bottle went missing. A bottle went missing at our mutual friends house as well. So I distanced myself. I got calls at midnight with her so fucked up that she was slurring super bad, and didn't remember anything I said within a couple seconds. I cut her off no warning becuase there was no nice way to do it otherwise. Me dumping her as a friend sent a chain reaction of other people dropping her as a friend becuase of her drugs, drinking, and everything else.",

      "title": "AITA for letting some girls sleep in my flat mate's room although he said no ?",
      "description": "So the problem is like this. I live in a rented apartment, with a friend from work (lets call him A) for 3 years now. We know each other from college, but really got friends when we moved together in a new city. Now the apartment has 2 bedrooms, one for each of us ( he insisted he wants the bigger one, I didn't care that much and let him have it) and a somewhat spacious living room. We pay equally the rent, with me doing the actually pay and all the effort done to discuss any damages that happen, any roads to facilities or stuff like that, while my friend pays half and that's about it, 0 effort and expects for everything to be done for him like he is entitled.\nSome friends of mine decided they would like to visit me in the weekend (one of my best friends from high school together with his gf and 2 of her friends ). A leaves almsot every Friday to visits his gf and returns late Sunday.  I discussed with him if my hometown friends can visit and stay in our apartment, he was OK with it and said he is thinking if anyone can sleep in his room (that was last week). Wednesday comes and i ask him again about it and he vehemently says no, that his room is not \"prepared\" to have guests and that he is om with people coming in the house, but they are not to sleep in his bed/room. Meanwhile another of my best friends from highschool decided to join totaling 5 people to be accommodated in my bed and a lousy couch in the living room, that can barely accommodate one person and with little time for my friends to rent something cheap to sleep through the weekend while visiting me. \nHe refuses to have guests in the house, if the house is dirty or not cleaned, while he is lazy (we both are) to clean most of the time. He hates people getting in his apartment while its not clean with such a passion, he declines instantly any visit no matter how far the person has traveled to see him or how rare that ever happens. That's his quirk, its either clean or no visit. I know about this quirk, we had another similar fight some time ago, thats why I asked him before hand to clean up or to at least tell me with some time ahead if will do that or not, so that my friends can find something to rent. Thursday he didn't have the time or the mood to clean and thats why he declined my requests to have the 2 girls sleep in his room.\n\nI \"was forced\" to let the couple sleep in my room, me and my other high-school bestie slept on the couch and the other 2 girls slept in my friends(A) room. He now accuses me that I broke boundaries, his trust and that I was an asshole for not even asking him in the last moment. I believe its his own fault for taking to long to decide.  We are in a pretty big fight about this whole incident. AITA for letting the girls sleep in his bed? \n\nTLDR from above: My flat mate of 3 years is pissed at me that i let 2 girls sleep in his room even tho i asked him ahead of time to let the girls know if they should rent a room or stay in our apartment.\n ",

      "description": "I'm out of town and had an item (movie Steelbook, a collectible thing), available in the US only I'm shipping to a friend in Germany. He just needed me to wait for him to have enough money to pay me back for the item/shipping and got it sooner than expected, so because I'm not there I asked my girlfriend to do it. She said sure thing and I gave her all the details and shipping instructions. \n\nI told her the exact method to get from USPS, it was a dollar more than the other option, but would be way safer (box with bubble wrap vs bubble wrap envelope). She shipped it today but because she didn't read my full instructions (her own admission) she chose envelope. The item *might* be okay, but from experience it's prone to damage during shipping. \n\nShe's very apologetic but also getting mad at me because I don't want to talk. I'm pretty mad, it was nice of her to agree to do this for me but I gave clear instructions and she has now admitted to not reading them in full and just assuming when I said bubble wrap I meant those bubble wrap envelopes. Am I The Asshole for not letting this go and forgiving her right away? I'm not yelling at her or anything I just don't want to talk so I said I had to go and haven't replied to other texts and have ignored her phone calls.",

I went so far as to take the ASVAB and score 94. I was a week out from MEPS and got a job offer making $50K a year salaried plus benefits at a company in an industry I've been in for two years. It's not glamorous and I'm not fulfilled, but I make decent money for being 23 and having no degree. I have my husband and two kids to support, so this was the smart choice, at least in my mind. \n\nI didn't want my kids to be without Mommy for basic plus tech school and possible deployments so I could fulfill some stupid dream of being in the USAF. I also didn't want my husband (who has PTSD and Bipolar as a result of his Navy service) to have to leave his treatment team in the city we live in now. I thought taking the safer option was smarter for my family.\n\nMy husband says I've been miserable to be around, though, since I decided to forego enlistment and take this job instead. He said I'm miserable and that it shows because I'm not pleasant at home anymore and all I do is complain about work. He says I'm going to end up resenting him and the kids for preventing me from fulfilling my dream. He says I'm selfish for using him and the kids as an excuse to not enlist. \n\nAm I the asshole for not enlisting even when it's what I wanted? ",

      "description": "So last night I had met a woman on tinder at my university and we chatted up for a little while. To be clear, I had no intention nor any expectation of having said intercourse. I (18M) had went to her (22F) apartment simply to hang out and drink, as it was only a ten minute walk away. Things started heating up and moving along and she had asked me if I had a condom, which I had not because I didn’t expect anything along the lines of actual sex. \n\nPush came to shove and I ended up walking back to my room, then back to her room which took about a half an hour. When I had gotten there her friends had left an entire box of condoms on her nightstand. This didn’t bother me entirely too much because well it’s always good to have extra, but it would’ve been a nice sentiment to tell me the option was there. Thus, I was already slightly irritated to begin with.\n\nSo we restarted things again, but this time I wasn’t as, for a lack of a better term, excitable. She saw I was completely mortified, which I was because I’m much younger and presumably less experienced. She reassured it was okay and we could try other things to jumpstart the process, which we did.\n\nEven that didn’t work and I was stuck feeling rather embarrassed. Also what she did and how she acted started to make me feel slightly uncomfortable. We tried starting and seeing if it’d just work itself out (the “problem”) but that just causing more problems.\n\nEventually she had told me that I had just taken her virginity, which shocked me even more and set things back even further. About five minutes later and with lots of struggle I had told her I just wanted leave, to which I was treated like an ass and berated as I was leaving. Essentially I’m just curious as to if that’s a bad thing to do, considering I had just taken this girls virginity.  ",

      "description": "So, here is the deal. I grow weed for a living and it is not legal in my area. My operation is what I would classify as of medium size, between 2 and 3 pounds (\\~1 kilogram) monthly. I love what I do. It is like having a hobby and a job tied into one.\n\nI have been doing this for many years, and it is not something I talk about to anyone in order to protect myself, my freedom and my livelihood. I do not live a flashy lifestyle, in fact I save/invest nearly everything I make, so when people ask me what I do for a living I just tell them that I am a freelance programmer who does an odd job here or there, since my living expenses are very minimal. You would never guess that I am doing quite OK financially if you looked at me, because I drive a crappy car and have absolutely no sense of what to wear. In fact, according to my girlfriend, most of my clothes are something that should be thrown away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, when my girlfriend came to the picture, I chose not tell her in order to protect myself. I did not feel guilty as I never tell anyone, but figured that if she had a problem with this, I would essentially be lying to her and that I am depriving her of her ability to make a choice about her life. As a compromise, I decided that if we are still together 1 year later, I would let her in on my secret. The 1 year came and went, and I showed her what I am really up to. She was OK with it, as I suspected she would be. In fact, I am not sure if I would have kept my promise to myself if I wasn't pretty sure how she would react.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly have no idea if I am/was an asshole, so I am glad this sub exists. I am ready to accept my judgement.",

      "description": "A few nights ago I was at a party celebrating the end of the semester and seeing a friend off before they left for home. One of them, who we’ll call Dave, had never really drank before, and so everyone was excited to have him try stuff like shotgunning and beer pong. Dave agreed to do it but he asked that no one record him and send it to anyone, since he was worried about who might see him drinking. \n\nThe next morning one of the girls, who we’ll call Jessica, texts the group chat for the party saying that she’d recorded him shotgunning a beer and sent it into an instagram meme page. I replied a few minutes later asking her if she remembered that Dave asked everyone not to do that, and if Jessica asked him whether or not she could send that in. I told her that I wasn’t trying to be confrontational, just trying to do my job as a friend. \n\nJessica replied that if I wasn’t trying to be confrontational then I wouldn’t have said anything, that Dave could say something if he had a problem, and that all I was doing was showing everyone how immature I am by confronting her.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My friend (let's call her Chanel) and I were having a drink yesterday. Our conversation eventually went into the sexy department. It was casual as usual. But at a certain point something clicked. You see my friend has her own apartment, and she has a full time job, and a few extra income, so she has no issue with living space, and she works from home, a few days in the week. She can't concentrate at her own house, which I find odd. so our friend (Elf, that's her name yes.) sometimes borrows her small studio apartment to Chanel, when she is on vacation, or is visiting her parents, so Chanel can work in peace.\n\nIssue that clicked in my head is as follow, our friend Elf is on vacation for about two weeks. So Chanel is crashing there. Elf is kind of a clean freak, she doesn't mind a little mess, but you better use a damn coaster, and you better clean after yourself, and take your damn shoes off in her house. I asked Chanel what she exactly for the past two weeks. She proceeds to tell me that she basically lived in Chanel's house for two weeks, despite having her own house. She then proceeds to layout that she had sex multiple time, sometimes for multiple days. At that moment something seemed odd, So I asked her if she slept with these guys in her own house, cause it would seems like a drag to hop to your house, and our friends house. She told me reluctantly that she did it in our friend Elf studio apartment, for the last two weeks.\n\nNow I know a 100% our friend would flip the fuck out, if she heard this. Years ago a former friend of ours brought a random girl to her house, without us knowing, the guy sat the girl down on my our friends bed put a blanket on their lower half and started having foreplay together in secret, we didn't notice for the first 5 minutes. Elf eventually noticed weird movements under the blanket. When she noticed what the movements meant she flipped the fuck out, and told them to leave and never show their face to her again, she never made contact with him again. I told my friend that what she did was inconsiderate, despite having her own apartment she used her friends to fuck random strangers in it (she is not that much into cleaning btw) and due to her actions she could ruin her friendship with Elf. She told me I was tripping, and she thought I would be cool about it. Chanel then proceeds to tell me that \"It wouldn't be a problem if Elf never knew, so be quiet about it.\" now she made me part of damn issue too.\n\nI'm meeting with Elf tomorrow since she just came back from her vacation. on one hand I want to tell her, on the other hand, I don't really like being a snitch, but in this case I feel morally wrong about it. AITA if I tell my friend Elf about it? or should I keep it on the down low?",

      "description": "I (20F) moved in with my then boyfriend a few months ago. Recently things weren’t good between us so I made the decision to move back in with my dad (7 hour drive). My parents had a nasty divorce and I have a strained relationship with my mom due to her taking out her anger on my dad towards me. \n\nMy dad and stepmom picked me up last night around 12am. I was busy packing and loading stuff into the car so when we left my bf’s place I was exhausted. It didn’t even occur to me to text/call my mom to let her know I’m moving back to the area my dad &amp; mom live in. \n\nMy dad &amp; I couldn’t sleep in the car until 6am since my stepmom is a magnet for “otherworldly” occurrences, so when we arrived at the house I had no energy. I know I sleep for a while so I wanted to clean before going to bed. I reorganized my bedroom, unpacked my belongings, did 2 loads of laundry and showered. \n\nAn hour or two before I got into bed my mom texted me asking for my bf’s address to send me something. I didn’t want to reply until I was done settling in, so when I was finally in bed I texted her “I’m back at my dad’s place”. \n\n3 hours later I awoke to my phone blowing up. \n\nMom: Since when? Didn’t even call me?\n\nMom: &lt;paragraph of me needing to get my life together, let her know when I want to pay back my student loan that’s under her name, “have a nice life”.&gt;\n\nMe: I was awake all night. I was going to call and let you know after my nap. I was unpacking and cleaning all afternoon. \n\nMom: You’re so ungrateful!!!\n\nMe: You don’t understand how tired I am, why are you getting angry out of nowhere? Please don’t text me hurtful stuff. \n\nMom: &lt;2 long paragraphs of “I am your mom”, “I wanted you to be better than your sperm donor”, “I’m done with you and your dad”, “I’m canceling your phone service don’t call or contact me anymore”&gt;\n\nMe: I didn’t do anything besides try to sleep. Please control your anger in the future.”\n\nMom: &lt;text chain of “I’m exhausted too”, “my anger is not the one disconnecting the phone, it’s the principle”, “I will have anger until your sperm donor dies” etc&gt;\n\nNot my proudest moment but I somehow fell asleep when she was sending those texts. I woke up to 2 missed calls and 7 texts. She wanted to know if I wanted the number so she can release it to me to pay on my own, and that she will be taking me off of her health insurance. I declined and a few minutes later my phone has no service. \n\nI fully intended to call her after I got some rest, I just didn’t expect her to want me to drop everything and call her first thing. I’m normally a relaxed person but this is upsetting me. Not the fact that my phone is no longer in service but that she blew up at me and said all these hurtful things to her only child. \n\nAITA here?\n",

So she asked if i wanted to go with her and i didn’t have plans on that day so i said yes. \n\nWhen we got into the museum, i found out that she wasn’t actually that interested in seeing the art pieces. She just wanted me to take pictures of herself walking around the museum. \n\nI was so turned off because i actually knew some stuff about the art pieces and was really interested in learning more. She pretty much talked about her life all day and consistently shut me down every time i tell her something about myself. \n\nHalfway through the date, i already wanted bail on her but i didn’t. It was just so much work being with here. We ate dinner afterwards and by then my face was literally so tired of faking a smile or a laugh. She shared so much of her life story to me that i could write her a memoir, i’m telling you. \n\nWhen we asked for the bill, i was kinda hoping she’d at least initiate since as she said “had so much fun”. But she only waited and stared at me while i was paying. I was honestly just glad it was over when it ended.\n\nTL;DR: She asked me out and i went on one of the worst dates i’ve ever had. I was hoping she would at least initiate to split the bill. I probably wouldn’t have mind paying for everything if she just initiated or was at least worth spending time with.",

Cool. \n\nI know that Justin and Alice talk a lot. Seemingly a few times a week. He usually calls her and they chat about whatever. Since I live further out in the boonies for my job I do not get to see them all that often so they sometimes go out for drinks when I can't make it. We hang out just whenever I get into the city. \n\nSo last night the three of us are sitting at his place and just out of blue Justin asks me to leave and take a walk around the block so he can chat with Alice. Goes something like this:\n\nJustin: Hey SevereCucumber can you leave and go take a walk around the block. I have something I need to talk with Alice about. \nMe: *Throwing my arms up* Okay. *Stand up*\nAlice: Justin, what the hell?\nJustin: *Looks at me*\nAlice: Sit down SevereCucumber you aren't leaving. \nMe: Justin, did I do something wrong?\nJustin: No it has nothing to do with you.\nAlice: Then why does he have to leave. Whatever you say to me you can tell him.\n\nJustin goes into detail how he's in financial trouble. I won't detail it further as it is not relevant to this post. Regardless we segway into normal booze conversation that people have and everything is fine. \n\nToday I text Justin that I want to know why he seems to trust talking to Alice more than me.\n\nMe = Blue\nJustin = Black\nAlice = Green\n\nhttps://imgur.com/S3gIgHx\n\nI'm feeling super conflicted and this feels totally not normal. I get the feeling that he goes to Alice for a lot because that is most comfortable to him which doesn't bother me but it certainly feels like he doesn't trust talking to me. Especially when he put the spotlight on me by saying that I don't tell him about my life. I never think of much to say because in real life all I do is sit at home, masturbate, and go to work. I don't think of myself as a great storyteller because I don't think my life is all that impressive. Justin is more a outward type of personality, he even wears a hugely flashy suit and gets a lot of compliments for it. In the last month he went to a strip club with friends and one of them puked and it all sounds super exciting. I've heard stories of the girls he slept with and when he goes out to a bar on occasion they will buy him a drink. I'm a much more introverted type. I don't say much as what I do in life because everything feels similar to the previous day. \n\nHowever I also think it's funny that he goes to Alice so often but then sometimes complains to me that what she says annoys him. \n\nHow should I approach this situation? Or am I the asshole for trying to pry him open?",

      "description": "On mobile so no formatting boys\n\nAITA for being mad at my dad for turning off the WiFi at night? \n\nBackground: ever since I bought a PC with money I had saved my dad started turning off the WiFi. \n\nHis default defense is that it helps me sleep properly and that he pays for it and gets to make the decision, which in essence is fair, however it’s not the turning off that gets me it’s the reason why I feel he does it.  He never wanted me to get a PC he felt I was wasting money etc and he hated it even more after I got it. He felt it consumed me too much and that the games that I played were bad for me (violence etc). I’ve never been violent and games didn’t change this.  I spend probably at most 4-5 hours a day on the thing and I probably average about 2hrs a day on it which I know isn’t healthy but it isn’t unheard of. I’ve been depressed over past years and I feel he probably doesn’t think that it helps me, I would argue the opposite but that’s not the point. I bought a computer with money I earned and out of spite he seems to be turning the WiFi off at night. AITA?? \n\n- He turns off the WiFi at like 10-11pm \n\n-I have a phone with unlimited data so he’s not stopping me from going on the internet it’s ONLY the computer he cares about. ",

      "description": " Basically, there's a game me and a friend of mine (let's call him Larry) like to play about every weekend when we can, called Warhammer 40,000. For the uninitiated, it's a 28mm scale tabletop strategy wargame played with plastic models that has a TON of different armies to choose from. We're talking humans (Imperial Guard), Orks, Eldar (Space Elves), Space Marines, and most fantasy things one's heart could desire.\n\n Larry likes to play the faction known as the Space Marines, and recently has been wanting some Imperial Guard to go with them. However, I already play Imperial Guard in the small group of people Larry and I include in our WH40k playing. I've never played anything else for the almost year I've been into the game, and these models require a lot of dedication. They're priced exorbitantly high (go to the Games Workshop and look at Warhammer 40,000 models website if you don't believe me), and they come unassembled and unpainted, meaning there's a lot of work one has to put into their model into making it look presentable and getting it to your standards. We're talking hours at a time for a single model sometimes. **Long story short,** these models take a lot of work and are expensive. \n\n With all this being put together, especially with the fact I feel he has many other factions to choose from, I don't want him to start collecting this army. I feel like he should bring something fresh and new to the table if he's gonna get a new army, rather than doing what I've been doing. It also makes me feel slighted that he wants to start collecting this army after I've been playing and learning and collecting it for so long, which, as any 40k player worth their salt will tell you, is quite an ordeal. However, I also feel like I should let him do what he wants, and it makes me a selfish asshole if I don't want him to get the same army as me. So tell me, AITA?\n\n**TL;DR: My friend wants to start collecting the same army as me for a wargaming tabletop game we play together, and I think he should he get something else because he should bring something new to the table, and it makes me feel slighted that he wants to start making the same army I have after I've been playing it so long.**",

      "description": "It’s a longish story so I’ll just give the run down. Megan and I have been best friends for 9 years. Last summer I introduced her to the friend group I was in as I had planned to move 14 hours away later on. At the time, I was seeing a guy named josh. When I introduced them, they pretty much blew me off for the entirety of the night. She was sober and he was black out drunk. She backed into someone’s car in the parking lot and dented her roommates brand new car. Freaking out, josh and Megan insisted they go find a toilet plunger to fix the dent. I stayed behind to calm her roommate down and planned to stay up until they returned bc Megan had a tiny kitten that I was terrified of squishing in my drunken sleep. \nAfter 6 hours of sitting awake, sobering up, and calling Megan and josh in fear that they had been in an accident, they get home. They are very serious, Megan’s hair is a mess (she’s a v successful cosmetologist and I’ve never seen a hair out of place) and they don’t have a goddamn plunger. They “left their phones in a different car”. \nFast forward a month. A friend of mine and Josh’s reveals to me that he and Megan made out while I sat waiting for them to get home. Neither of them told me, and we had discussed it since. \nA mutual best friend of mine and Megan’s sent me the screenshots of texts Megan sent her, saying “it wasn’t a big deal, chrysanthemummm is overreacting” but to everyone else, including josh, she is ‘heartbroken’. She apologized to me, and he screamed at me for a few hours telling me to forgive her and to not throw away 9 years of our time just because of that night. \nI love her, and I miss her, but I think what she did was unforgivable. It isn’t even the first time she has been a real bad friend. She knew josh and I were involved with each other, and I had gushed to her on how much I liked him. That night, they were so involved with each other everyone around me began to ask what happened between me and josh to make this okay. \nA few friends of mine have been urging me to make things up, and I don’t think I should, but I could just be being an asshole. \nWhat do you think?",

      "description": "I have a “family member” from my stepmom’s side who was nice enough to give me a job. I’m a college student and I live in an area where finding a job is incredibly difficult with no experience. Meanwhile, it’s impossible to gain experience because you can’t get a job. I admired this family member a lot. However, after starting to work with him I’ve lost an incredible amount of respect for him. To make a long story short I worked for him for less than minimum wage for 3 months, watched him treat workers like shit, make people feel guilty for taking breaks which are their rights as workers, make them feel bad for asking for their checks that are past due, etc. He favors the workers that will work overtime for free, who won’t take breaks, who will bend over backwards for him for no cost and meanwhile will call the workers who take their breaks, work when they have to, etc “lazy”. I watched him basically blame everything under the sun on my coworker (who eventually became a friend) until he found a new job and quit. The thing that finally threw me over the edge was when he started scamming me out of hours. I work the same amount of hours every single week and as time progresses, he’ll pay me for less and less hours. I know it’s not an accident, he knows exactly what he’s doing. It’s the SAME hours, SAME amount, every two weeks. Last pay check it was just 1 hour unaccounted for, this time around it’s 3. That’s 4 hours of work that I didn’t get paid for. 4 hours that I could’ve spent studying, doing homework, etc. On the day when we were supposed to get our checks, he said he didn’t have him and that they’d be in the next day. I didn’t work the next day so I asked him if he could text me and I could swing by and come get it. His response was “why? You don’t need it.” I’m living with my mom, typically have very few expenses (I pay for gas, and other things here and there) and am pretty well off to be completely honest. However, that’s money I worked for and I need to get my oil changed, filters replaced etc. I shouldn’t even have to justify it. It’s MY money. I want to vent to my dad but I’m afraid he’ll tell my stepmom and it will come around and bite me in the ass somehow. I’m just so fed up and I’m not really sure what to do. WIBTA?",

      "description": "I have this friend, lets call him Greg. We have been friends nearly a decade and he is (or maybe used to be) a pretty good dude to hang out with. Recently things have started going down hill. \n\nFirst, it's probably important to mention that in our friend group, we do a fair amount of drinking, on a regular basis. For the most part we keep our shit together. Greg seems to have a problem with drinking. He gets sloppy, white-girl-wasted, and blacks out and drinks everyday. He has quit in the past but he is right back at it. I realize we are probably all assholes for drinking around him, but he is my friend and I want him around. I dont wanna stop hanging out or cause any drama due to the drinking, and the rest of us dont really seem to have any problems with our consumption habits. Anyways... that is not him being an asshole, just thought it would help paint more story. \n\nRecently, he is becoming REALLY mean and aggressive. He and his husband had roommates who were also a couple. Lets call them AC. He had asked AC to move out. No hard feelings, just wanted his space. So AC moved out a month earlier than asked to leave. This did not cause any financial issues for Greg, it was a good thing. Apparently, AC had asked to leave 2 guitars and a box of bathroom stuff for an extra day as their load was full and it was getting late. Greg agreed. The next day AC did not get around to picking up the belongings, and all hell broke out. Th next day Greg is telling AC that they are never allowed at the house again, and all their left possessions will be thrown away or sold. And any mail coming to the house would also be thrown away, and demanded the house key back. telling AC that they are no longer friends and just freaking the fuck out. This is all somehow justified as complete \"disrespect\" To me, this is nbd its just a day!\n\nGreg has been having dramatic freak outs just like this over small annoyances. He is getting progressively aggressive and it is affecting everyone in the friend group. He will start fights with me or his husband when we say things he doesnt like, and will scream and slam doors if we ever tell him we dont agree with logic or reasoning. \n\nIn the past I have brought up that I dont appreciate his temper, and I want to figure out ways to build our friendship to avoid these crazy fights, and it did not go well at all. I had to apologize for months before we went back to full time hangouts again. \n\nI just learned that others feel the same way as I do (we try not to gossip about eachother) and although I feel scared about the outcome, I just keep feeling like something needs to change or it will just be the end of us. I really dont want that to happen, cuz I love the guy, and his husband is also my best friend. I guess Im just wondering if I / we would be the asshole to have like a group \"asshole intervention\" or something? to try to get the point across that we all care, but something has to give. ",

      "description": "Hi Reddit! I actually posted this late last night but didn’t get many replies because it was an awkward time. I’m hoping you can help me with an ongoing debate I have with my brother and father. One of my guy friends who I hang out with a few times a year admitted that he liked me a year ago. I told him that I think he’s an awesome guy, but I only see him as a friend and that I am not interested in anything more. I also said that I understand if he no longer wants to be friends with me but he said he didn’t want to lose me as a friend and that he will get over it. \n\nThe issue is that when I hang out with this guy it’s still obvious he likes me. When I was home visiting my family for Christmas this issue somehow came up in conversation and my dad and brother said I should cut this friend off to spare his feelings. They said even tho I shut him down he will continue to try to change my mind “because that’s just how guys are”. I said it was unfair because I made my feelings very clear and that if he was still choosing to pursue me he wasn’t respecting my decision and that is not my fault. My brother and dad said that it is my fault because I know his feelings and am still choosing to give him hope by keeping him as a friend and that I should be the bigger person and end the friendship. \n\nI guess this struck a nerve with me because I’ve been verbally and physically harassed by men (cat called, groped in bars more times than I can count, hit back when I finally hit the old guy who came up to me and started to grope me), and I’m sick and tired for having to control my actions because “that’s just how guys are”. Obviously those are much more extreme cases but I guess those experiences have influenced my mindset when it comes to this point and makes me more angry and stubborn and perhaps I cannot see the issue clearly. It even angers me that my dad and brother are saying my guy friend will say he’s ok and wants nothing more and it that it’s only natural he will continue to try to win me over. I think that’s deceptive and that if he is doing that then he is only to blame for any pain caused because he is the one who is lying to me and choosing not to respect my decision. I would understand if he was honest with me and said he had to cut me out because I have had another male friend do this in the past and have respected his decision. But then again I’ve also had unreturned feelings for people and so understand it can be heartbreaking. I guess where my issue lies is that the blame is on me to end the friendship because “that’s just how guys are”.\n\nSo I’d really love your input Reddit. AITA?\n\nTLDR: guy friend told me that he likes me. I told him I wasn’t interested and only like him as a friend and understood if he didn’t want to be friends. He said he could handle it and didn’t want to lose the friendship. It’s obvious he still likes me. AITA for remaining friends with him?",

I don't know if it holds true for every country, but oh well\n\nSomething like 3 years ago, my friend start dating this girl. I thought she was really nice, cute and overral a good person. Even though i was really intested in her, i never really thought of having any serious relationship.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of this year. This friend of mine became a extremely toxic person, his attitudes were really bothering me (hit a car and ran away, borrowed money he refused to pay, betrayed  his GF, and some more). So... i cut ties to him.\n\na little later (something like february), i found out he and his ex broke up. And didn't thought much, because i didn't gave 2 fuchs about him, and i started talking to her.\n\nLong story short, i've been dating her for like 6 months now. I just wanted to know if IATA.\n\n\n",

      "description": "So, some backstory. Basically me and this guy dated a year ago or something like that, and he really hurt me. One of my best friends who was there for me, and also physically every time I was forced to see him (once a week), had told me how much of a dick he was to me, that I deserved better, and that she didn’t like him anyways, stuff like that. I guess the year went through with her defending me from his comments, for example when I wasn’t around he would say how low it was of him to have dated me, or shit like that. After I started dating someone else and made it official, he texted me saying he was so sorry for how he treated me, that I deserved better and such. Now months after, his bestfriend and I met, somehow became really close which he was upset about and basically called me a whore for commenting on one of his ig posts. I of course told him to fuck off. \n\nNow what I don’t understand is why my bestfriend who was with me throughout this whole thing would post a pic on her story hugging him, because it literally makes no sense after what he put me through and she knows how he used to want to humiliate me and such. Now am I the asshole for being upset about this? Is it just a photo and I should chill? I need opinions. \n\nTL;DR : one of my bestfriends posted a pic on her story hugging my ex, after telling me a bunch of times how he was no good and treated me like trash. ",

I had a memory foam mattress pad so she likes to lay in it when I’m not there and we were cool with it but nothing sexual. So we go for a food run and I come back she’s passed tf out in my bed. I try to wake her up and she’s like we can cuddle it’s fine. Cut to the next couple days she tells me she always had feelings for me and was jealous of her roommate and we try things out. To be honest I wanted her too but she had a bf so I kind of fell for her roommate.

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend are moderately overweight. We have been noticing that we were getting fatter still, so I pushed us to try and lose some weight. We now go on walks everyday, we cut the sugar and generally try to eat better and in reasonable quantities. This is being tougher on her because she really enjoys eating until she's full. I'm mainly the one trying to keep us on track and very often I have to call her out when she's sliding back into our old eating habits.\n\nSo this last weekend we went to a wedding together as guests. We were sitting next to each other, together with family members from both our families, all in the same table. Every table had its own food so everyone could just serve themselves. So what happened next was I had to watch as my girlfriend filled her plate up with all kinds of delicious food. I kinda gave her a look like that, but she just shrugged it off as if to say \"yeah I know, but we're at a wedding\". I was slightly annoyed with her behavior but sort of forgot about it and tried to just enjoy everyone's companies. Some time after that, when she was finished, she was out for more. She asked me to pass her this big plate of shrimp rice so that she could try some of that. That really struck me, but I didn't want to argue right there and then, so what I did was get the srino rice and proceed to fill her plate up until it was literally overflowing a little bit.\n\nShe just kind of stared at it, then got up and went outside alone. Everyone was staring at me at this point and I thought it was better I just went outside too to talk to her. She told me she was humiliated and that I stepped out of line and they I came off as a controlling jerk.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for taking a stand against her completely disregard for our agreed upon diet?

Over the years I’ve received interesting rocks from all over the state, and even a pet rock gift box ( Rocky is the best pet) I held onto and cherished these gifts, in fact there is a pile of rocks in my dresser drawer that are all gifts from her.\n\nA few years ago I put an end to the tradition.\n\nShe and her brother came over like always, and the exchange begins, at this point we could buy bigger gifts and the rocks were more or less a tradition. She hands me my gift and it’s a massive rock from a construction site up the road, she even jokingly referred to a piece of dirt (at least I hope it was dirt ) as dog poo. This soured the mood for me, and I just sorta went quiet while everyone else had fun. I didn’t talk to her for a week  afterwards, she never apologized to me, and when we finally did talk I told her that it was inappropriate to do what she did, and that the rock tradition was over. I think I actually returned the rock to where she found it. Or chucked it in the garden. To this day she has been unable to pick up on when I’m upset, and if anything Sav has become even worse, to the point that I’ve questioned my friendship with her. I’ll tell more stories on here if you want. \n\nSo tl;dr: me and a friend had a tradition, and I cut it off after a thoughtless gift AITA",

      "description": "So, there was a post about some cybersport team, which wasn’t pretty good last couple of months, and in the community they are considered as a disabled team. I wrote a joking comment that was pointing out that opinion.\n5 minutes later one guy responded me, that I am the asshole, and that he was offended by that joke, because, as he said later, he is disabled. He acted like he was 8, and more triggered than offended. I responded him with some edgy jokes and told him, that he has a problem. He responded that I’m mentally disabled, that I don’t know what is like being disabled and blocked me.\nBut what is he don’t know, is that I have a severe form of Hemophilia, and it’s kinda hard to live with that in my country. Furthermore, I am completely aware of what is like to be a disabled person, and I had really big issues with my health. I just trying to live as a normal person, and I also joke about my disease like it’s not a big deal. \nSo, one side of me is actually feel sorry for that guy, because I know what is he going through, and another says that he is an whiny little idiot, who triggers at every joke",

      "description": "I am an 18 year old freshman in college and I am an avid D&amp;D player. I am currently in two campaigns at the moment and both of them involve my non-binary acquaintance, let’s just say her name is River, and I used to enjoy her company. However, recently River has become super annoying and rude to many of my good friends. Especially when we play D&amp;D together. \n\nIn one campaign River plays this huge and flamboyant firbolg and has taken every opportunity to remind everyone in the party that we have no idea what the fuck gender this monster is. It’s growing annoying and the way River has gone about correcting us when using the wrong pronouns is downright rude. Sometimes we slip up and say “she” when we’re in game and they immediately cut off the conversation and grunt “them.” repeatedly until we apologize and say “them” instead.\n\nRiver is the DM of my other campaign with several of my good friends in it as well. When we play the game it’s fine but River makes unnecessary rule checks and hampers down on us having fun in the game and forces us (by benevolent forces in game) to go along the story path she wants to follow. The party has 6 people in it so inevitably there’s some side conversations going on throughout the game and River has said, on many occasions, that “side conversations are to be left outside so that my spotlight as DM shouldn’t be taken away.” She also gets upset when we miss little details of the story because she talks super fast. She even snapped at my elvish friend for wanting to read inscriptions on the wall instead of fighting with the group. \n\nHere’s a bit of backstory: when me and River first met, River must’ve heard my name wrong somewhere. But she refused to call me anything other than Anita (which is NOT my name) even after I showed her my license AND she found and friended me on Facebook. My roommate and I were pretty annoyed with it so I jokingly said “well then I won’t use your right pronouns until you use my right name” (which I personally think is fair, but it may not be) \n\nRiver’s rude behavior has caused us to grow apart, even though she’s really clingy and calls me and my roommate her best friends all the time. Though she’s a big part of my hobby, so I can’t just stop all contact like I’d prefer. \n\nHere’s my opinion: respect must be earned. So in order for me to use the right pronouns she has to be respectful, right? Or am I just an asshole and this is all an unnecessary petty thing for me to do? \n\n(Also, I’m posting this on mobile so sorry for any mistakes or typos) ",

      "description": "Okay so I posted this earlier this week on r/legaladvice for the legal side of it. Though it got me thinking about this subreddit so I'll post it here as well.\n\nThe following is my post from LA: \n\n&gt; I understand that I can simply take the bird feeders down. However, my husband and I work long hours and we have two cats at home. They were tearing apart the apartment before we got the bird feeders and now have settled down. They spend most of the day watching the birds now instead of trying to tunnel through our walls (we watch them via nest cameras).\n&gt; \n&gt; So this has left us in a bit of a pickle. We have the permission and support of the our complex and their management to have these bird feeders out. However one of our neighbors has a very big problem with this. Apparently all these birds are ruining his POS car's paint job. He parks under a tree... where all the birds are. There is plenty of parking elsewhere in the complex but he wants to park closest to his apartment entrance. No one else, to our knowledge, has complained.\n&gt; \n&gt; His argument is that I am attracting these birds and ruining his enjoyment (?) of the property. I'll also add there is no assigned parking. I park basically next to him, just not under the tree and I get maybe one maybe two poops a week. I feel like that's kind of the price to pay for living in a heavily wooded area.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does he have any legal standing? Part of reading in this sub I understand that people who say they will sue/get us evicted usually don't do anything. I just am wary of running into an obscure law or ordinance that prohibits what I am doing. \n\nSomeone on LA thought I should get him a car cover but I'm scared to approach him since he just hates our guts. He has now taken to watching us come and go from his balcony, which has really put me on edge. AITA?",

He is very kind/affectionate to me when I have something he wants. Otherwise he is openly rude, ignores me, or does things on purpose to piss me off because he finds it funny. I get it- he's still a little kid and I should let it go. I have tried very hard to ignore him, but he's always around and getting on my nerves. \n\nRecently my bf and I had some relationship issues where we did end up breaking up for a few days. The day we broke up bubbles was there escalating things, chipping in and causing more drama. He laughed at me as I left the house on tears. While bf and I were apart he nearly hooked up with a mutual friend of ours who has been very openly into him. We got back together and things have been fine, but bubbles keeps teasing my bf for not have been with very many girls, (I'm the 3rd) and joking about how he should've gotten with mutual friend. He drops her name and jokes about her frequently. \n\nI have not been rude or caused fights when bubbles is over, but I also don't hide the fact that I don't like him. I have stopped sharing with him, I order pizza he begs for some, I go to get a soda for bf and I and don't let him come with, ect. When asked directly by my little brother I have said I don't like bubbles and explained why. I am trying my best to avoid insulting or talking badly of him. I try to avoid him at all costs, because he refuses to stop any the stuff he does and I don't like the conflict and drama. \n\nI thought I was behaving maturely and making the best of the fact that he and I will not get along. Recently little brother has been pissed at me for not liking or being around bubbles and bf and my best friend have told me that I'm the asshole here for being upset, not pretending to like him, and avoiding him. They say because he's just a kid and he's just messing around, I shouldn't have a problem with him. Are they right? Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I might be vague over some parts because I don’t want people finding out it’s me who wrote this.\n\nI was forced into a school club where everyone studies a certain topic over an entire school year and compete against other schools to see who gets an overall high score. There are 2 groups in each school who compete: Group A and Group B. Group A is the group for the top people who’s scores matter more for the competition. They are also required to write, memorize, and recite a speech which counts towards the school’s score. It does get fairly intense as the teacher who runs my team requires that they go to school to study the material and practice their speeches about 10 hours a weeks, usually after school and during weekends. Even after that, they are still expected to study more at home. There’s only a limited amount of people allow on this group as well. Group B is where everyone else is placed, who’s scores don’t matter as much and aren’t required to recite a speech. It’s pretty much where everyone who didn’t make it onto Group A go to.\n\nI was lucky enough to be on Group B. About a month back, my teacher, however, tried to convince my friend to join Group A, who was also forced into the club. He really didn’t want to for all the right reasons. His parents are divorced, he barely has any free time, he lives about an hour away from school, and he has to care for his parents for a lot of things. He was pressured into joining anyway since he really doesn’t have any other choice being in a club he didn’t want to be in. He didn’t really know how excessive the work would be and wanted out after like a week in. My friend couldn’t get out despite trying everything he could. He emailed, spoke to in private, and got his dad (his mom forced him into the club) to email the teacher but was constantly turned down by some crap like “try your best to come to the practices.” He was even questioned why he didn’t make it to practices. Keep in mind that he also made it clear how the situation was at home and how he doesn’t have any more time for the club. There was one other person who could take his place, but it was really obvious that the teacher only forced my friend into Group A to avoid said person getting in.\n\nThis went on for a while and the dad of the friend was apparently get mad that he has to drive my friend around everywhere constantly. Because Group A had to write a speech, they had to recite it a few weeks before the competition. My friend said he’s now going just like he didn’t want to be in this club in the first place, and got his dad to email the teacher saying he couldn’t make it. Because clubs are also counted as periods, the teacher responds saying he would fail him. He told me this and in my mind at the time, I was pissed that the teacher prioritized the team over his needs. I convinced him to talk to his counselor to get out of the class. He did, didn’t go to the speech event, and was apparently able to dropped out.\n\nThis happened a few days ago and I just realized that I might’ve just risked our team placing at all during the competition because he dropped out. Missing a member that’s on Group A will drop our overall score by a lot. Our school is known for winning these competitions and it’s a fairly big deal losing one. I completely ignored the fact that it would greatly impact our team’s score and the people in Group A obviously work hard to get a decent score just to place, and I’m worried that I might’ve just risked it all over one person.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "   So some context, I'm an 18 year old female living with my father. When I was 8 my parents seperated and I my dad got custody of me when I was 13. When I moved in with him he was living with his girlfriend (let's call her 'Am') had her two sons from a previous marriage, (Let's call them 'Gamer' and 'Perv') Gamer is the youngest and I don't have a problem with him. But his older brother Perv, who is actually only 3 days older than me, that I have a problem with.\n\n   When I moved in Am and her Kids Gamer was kool and we got along just fine. But Perv was always a pain in my ass. He would insult me, harass me and even physical hurt me (the biggest thing I can think of is her once grabbed my arm and swung me into a glass lizard tank which resulted I'm me hitting my throat on the corner and making it hard for me to breath). He was always a gross creep.\n\n   It would even seep into my school life as he would harass my friends to the point were some of them refused to hang out with me if he was in school that day. \n\n   Anyway, when I was about 16 \"The Incident\" happened. I was in my room sleeping when I was woken up to someone touching and moving my leg around. As I was half asleep I just assumed it was my older sister, who was living with us at the time, making room in my bed for my young niece to sleep with me. As my niece liked to sleep in my room sometimes, so I didn't react right away.\n\n   But then I feel whoever was moving me reach there hand up my nightdress towards my \"area\". At this point I woke up and looked to see Perv standing above me in just red basketball shorts and his phone out. I checked my own phone and saw it was about 4am. \n\nMe: -still half asleep- what are you doing?\nPerv: I wanna show you something.\nMe: No get out I'm trying to sleep.\nHe leaves.\n\n   I don't think to much about it till the morning, when I woke up and realized how unnerving the whole situation was. So I went and told his mom, Am, in hopes she'll do something about it. She didn't. She called my dad and told him that Perv was in my room \"tickling my toes\"??? When my dad called my sister's (now ex)boyfriend he told my dad what really happened. \n\n   To say my dad was pissed would be an understatement. When he heard that he immediately came home from work, packed all our stuff and we moved in with my grandma until we could get our own place. While we were living with my grandma Am started texting my dad hateful things about me and him like, \"she's fucking lying\" \"your a piece of shit\" \"that fat bitch can fucking die\" and so on. Keep in mind I was only 16 at the time. She even went to my grandmas house and took my dads truck (which was in her name at the time).\n\n   So we just started to ignore her. 2 years and 3 more girlfriends later me and my dad finally have our own place, just me and him. A little bit after moving in he started talking to her again and now he's dating her again, even though I had told him I didn't think it was a good idea and that I couldn't stand her. But he ignored me, and now Gamer is living with us and she practically is. She also keeps bring Perv with her so now he's coming by the house and sometimes even stays late at night. Am and Perv fed my father with a BS story that he was in my room looking for stuff to steal, not touching me.\n\n   Now he's thinking about moving in with her and wants me to try to get along with her. \n\nAITA for holding a grudge and not making peace with them? Should I just forgive and forget? Am I right to not want them in our lives again?\n\nTL;DR: My stepbro snuck into my room to touch me inappropriately. Dad moves us out. Stepmom lies and insulted me. 2 years pass and there back and I don't want them to be.\n\nPlease help. Idk what I should do, this whole thing is complicated.\n",

      "description": "I’ve known John for a little over 4 years and I would consider him to be one of my closest friends. About two and a half years ago he introduced us to Jane. It was very clear that he had feeling for jane and honestly, I thought that they were dating for the first few months after meeting her.  But it soon became pretty obvious that she did not have feeling for john and they were just friends. Jane is a very awesome person and became part of our friend group. I would say that jane and I are friends although we never hung out without being with a group of people. While john never really got over his crush on jane it had seemed like he had moved on as he has dated multiple girls over the past couple years, although he is currently single.\n\n\tThis brings us to last week, I was just getting off work and I stopped by the bar on my way home to grab a beer. At the bar I ran into Jane and her roommates, they were celebrating her roommate getting a promotion at work. Jane invited me to join them and I obliged.  After a while her roommates wanted to go to another bar and Jane said she wanted to go back home and invited me to go back to her place to smoke. I agreed and when we go back to her house. When we got to her place, she kissed me, and we end up sleeping together. \n\n\tI don’t know if Jane told John or how he found out so fast but the next evening I got a call from john and he was really angry at me calling me an asshole and telling me that I don’t respect him and that I did this to hurt him. Then he asked me what my intentions were with Jane. I told him that I didn’t mean for him to get hurt and that I didn’t know what if I was going to pursue anything more with Jane that we were drunk, and it just happened. He hasn’t talked to me since.\n\nOne on hand I can understand why john is so angry and hurt but on the other he has liked Jane for years and she does not feel the same way about him. If something was going to happen between them, it would have happened already. I kind of feel like Jane and I had a real connection and want to see where this goes but I also don’t want to lose a close friend over this. So, am I the asshole for sleeping with my friends crush?\n",

      "description": "I had to drive 1.5hrs to a specialist vet for my dog. I drained the battery in my electric car I found 3 charging locations near me, 1 at a mall, 1 at a AAA business center thing, and 3 was at a local cafe. \n\nThe mall was all being used, AAA was broken and when I pulled up to the Cafe there was a gas Audi parked in the spot. I googled my states law and it states:\n\n&gt; Florida Statute 366.94 Electric vehicle charging stations\n(3)(a) It is unlawful for a person to stop, stand, or park a vehicle that is not capable of using an electrical recharging station within any parking space specifically designated for charging an electric vehicle.\n(b) If a law enforcement officer finds a motor vehicle in violation of this subsection, the officer or specialist shall charge the operator or other person in charge of the vehicle in violation with a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as provided in s. 316.008(4) or s. 318.18.\n\nI was stuck waiting here since I didn’t have enough to get me to the next one (which could be broken or in use) and it was the only one working since AAA was broken and not just busy. \n\nI called the non-emergency line to complain, I even asked two workers if they knew whose car it was, they didn’t know.  I waited in the closest spot hoping police or owner of said car would do something. \n\nCop shows up comes over to me an says “There is no law for this so why did you call me?” I showed him the above quoted statue and he says “I have to look this up.”  He goes back to his squad car and the owner comes out yelling at me that it’s his car and he paid $1500 to install that and if he wants to park there he will and I need to get off his property or he will hit me with trespassing. Now I have to pay to park and charge in that spot, this was not a free charge while you eat/shop kind of thing. Cop comes out to say that I am right, it is illegal to block the spot and he also cannot ask me to leave because I am paying for the spot and I have a contract with ChargePoint the actual owner of the charger. \n\nSo AITA for this? The owner did not get a ticket for parking in the spot because the cop felt it was “up to his discretion” to decide if he violated the statute. ",

She says shell just arrive with a bunch of friends \"no bigge ill meet you there\".\n\nProm is finally here and I get there early to make sure i greet her.

      "description": "So our relationship’s alright. Its long distance and she’s really emotional about it, so i get being upset pretty often. Lately though, she’ll make huge shifts in her mood that tend to be her upset at me.\n\nBackground: she’s an artist, but she’s been struggling a lot in her classes. Lately, she cusses and puts down her own work constantly (even though we both agreed not to cuss about little things.) Everytime though, her projects still turn out good, no matter what she says. She always turns it in on time, and always gets full points and kudos from the teachers.\n\nNo matter what it is, i support it. Today though, i was having a reeeaaally bad day. 5 exams this week, havent slept in 3 days. She’s been really emotional lately and has only been negative today (there’s a baby in the house, her parents arent supportive, she’s always the butt end of insults at her house, etc). I was getting tired of texting “im sorry” or “that blows” or “i wish i could help,” cause thats all i usually am able to do on these days. When she got really mad about her work the 5th time in a row today, i said “whatever you say.” She was furious. Told her i didnt know what else to say at that point, so she said “just dont talk then.” \n\nSo, since i was busy, i said alright. Told her Id text her late tonight when i was done. I feel like i was in the wrong somewhat. AITA?\n\nAlso, no comments about “red flag” crap. I want judgement, not dumping advice. Im not mad at her, i just figured id give her some space.",

      "description": "So just for some context, I work in a big city with a fairly large homeless population. I’m usually accosted by them every day for money/food/etc and recognize plenty of them. I’ve been receptive to them before, but after multiple incidents personally and that I’ve witness, I choose to either ignore or engage, since I don’t know if they would be aggressive or not. \n\nSo, me and my boyfriend are waiting in the train station for my train to arrive, and a clear homeless man is personally going up to every person he sees trying to get food. Me, seeing this as he approaches me, I wave him off and grab my boyfriend closer to me, as I feel uncomfy. The homeless man proceeded to personally say to me “fuck you” so forth and so on. Then proceeds the typical back and forth between him, my boyfriend and I, which causes my temper to come out. \n\nAfterwards, my boyfriend is having a debate with me now about what I did was wrong, and I made him feel less than “human” in a sense. My reasoning is that I don’t want to get us involved, as I have to many incidents where once I talk, they latch on and try convincing me to give money. \n\nSo what’s the verdict reddit? ",

      "description": "So I go to a highschool in the USA and last year we made a rule that all the doors will be locked during class time because people were scared of a shooting or something.  So everyone is used to knocking and someone getting up and answering the door.  Well I guess they decided that rule was dumb and they could just lock the doors if we go into lockdown.  They never really advertised this change.  Well in my first period the door is always unlocked and if we are all doing a test or reading sometimes people will walk up to the door and knock on it without trying the handle at all.  They will knock once and then twice and then just walk away and no one in the class moves not even the teacher.  I know it’s simple to just get up and open the door but it’s annoying because if we are in the middle of a deep thought getting up can interrupt it.  I’d be pissed if I knocked twice and no one answered but like how easy is it to just try to fucking open it. ",

However, she doesn't want to take the opportunity. For background, the school isn't a very good one. My sister has made many friends there which I think is the reason she insists on staying for another year that she doesn't have to. Her reasons are gaining college credits and that's about it. My sister already has a fully paid scholarship for college and wants to stay behind for a year she doesn't need to for a couple college credits instead of going to actual college? It's ridiculous to me which is why I think it's because of the friends she has made. Because of this, we have been at odds over this issue, our relationship is great otherwise. Our parents want her to do what she wants to do and wants us to drop the topic because of how heated our discussions about this get but how can I stand by while she squanders such a great opportunity?",

I didn’t feel too much for her but we planned to meet again and I decided I would because it was fun the first time so maybe I’ll end up liking her or something who knows\n\nAnyway she bailed after I got ready and claimed to go a birthday party but ended up meeting her ex, not too bothered barely know this girl but then a few days later (today) she asked me out, I was like sure thing and she bought a friend out.\n\nShe wouldn’t stop talking about her ex and was generally loud, rude and selfish, she told me and her best mate she was out of weed but I was on the way to pick some up anyway so I didn’t mind, once I picked up she ended up having loads and then once hers were over she had mine. Now I’m not selfish, I often share my things, food, drink whatever and I’ve shared stuff with this girl before however I just thought if she’s selfish over something so small she’s just not got the right moral character and is just downright immature for my liking.\n\nNow her friend on the other hand, was down to earth, also cute and we got on amazingly, we were just laughing at each other’s jokes constantly and nothing felt forced at all, she didn’t constantly talk about any ex’s etc and she was polite! (Used please &amp; thank you, other girl didn’t, which actually does bother me) I can tell OG girl treats her friend like shit by the way she talks to her and tells her to do stuff and it just reflects more of what I don’t want in a person.\n\nAnyways I’ve arranged to see the girls friend and she’s having a fit over it, AITA for seeing her friend even though she’s clearly not over her ex, is rude and we have no chemistry?",

      "description": "Alright so here's the scoop.\n\nI've recently started hanging out with my ex again. We never really stopped talking fully but we had a period of time where we werent talking alot. I am in a serious relationship for about 10 months now. And it's a coincidence that the two of us started talking again. We go out for coffee's, discuss problems only if they are mutual, most of the time spent talking with her is about things like: Memes, videos, video games and music. \n\nMy girlfriend insist i should talk to her less because she does not trust me, due to an incident, which involved me lying. I lied about not having sex with someone in the past. I cheated on a girlfriend I dated before this one and she was cool with it. They were best friends but ended up working it out. They're still best friends.\n\nI do not want to stop talking to my ex, even though we had a relationship in the past, its in the past for a reason. I still see her as a good person and a good friend. I talked to her about some private stuff involving my gf and continued to talk to her about said private stuff after gf asked me to stop since i dont think she can limit what me and my friends are allowed to talk about, even if the friend is my ex. its not only her private stuff, its my private stuff as well. i know for a fact she tells her female friends about MY private things. she says she wouldnt mind me talking about it if it was anyone else but the ex. Which is in my opinion a bit melodramatic and childish, lets be adults about these kinds of things. \n\nI mean its not worth losing a girlfriend over, but it's also not worth losing a friend. I have also made attempts to meet the two, and actually suceeded because i thought they would click. But my girlfriend is not fond of her because she thinks i spend to much time with her and even brought up dumping me if I don't start \"putting boundaries\" on the relationship.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to stay friends with an ex?

I asked him to come to my birthday party and he didn't show up because he had nothing to wear apparently. Every time I extend and invitation it's rejecting, or if he does come along he complains and makes rude remarks the entire time.

At the beginning I just assumed they forgot about me, but obviously not after 2 years. Whenever I join the discord and they are talking about hanging out, they all go silent. One of my friends let it slip that they have a whole group chat to plan when they hang out and I'm obviously not in it. The thing is we already have a group chat so they went through the effort of making a new one with everyone else but me in it. The thing is I don't even see a reason for them pretending to be my friend. Some are in my classes at school and I help them out and share homework, but some aren't even in any classes of mine.

      "description": "Bit of background - she (29F) used to work with my husband. They were more friends than her and I were, but we would occasionally go out to lunch and hang out. I always saw her as quirky, but nice. \n\nShe lost her job and I know that she is a very dedicated and loyal worker, so I felt comfortable recommending her to work where I do. \n\nNow that we spend more time together, I'm quickly realizing she is generally annoying. She has a lot of habits that annoy many people (mainly that she talks incessantly and doesn't take a hint that you don't want to talk), but she is nice and means well.\n\nOne thing in particular, however, drives me so nuts that I might just say something. She will always try to feed me (and everyone really) but she will not take no for an answer. Here's a scenario that just happened.\n\nMe: *actively eating lunch*\n\nHer: Would you like some chicken?\n\nMe: No, thank you! I have chicken in my lunch.\n\nHer: You don't want more chicken?\n\nMe: No, thanks.\n\nHer: But I'm not going to finish it all. \n\nMe: You could save it for tomorrow.\n\nHer: I could just put it on your plate and you'd have more chicken.\n\nMe: Really, I'm good.\n\nHer: Are you sure?\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nShe then asked me again if I wanted it before she left. She does this all the time with candy, snacks, lunch, etc. and doesn't seem to take a hint. She means well and I can see that, but it is very annoying that she can't just take the no. WIBTA if I asked her to stop?\n\n",

This is in the middle of a bigger city so there's plenty of people that do this I'm sure.\n\nAfter getting burned by people like this and seeing people get burned, my personal policy is not to give any money to people that come up and basically panhandle out of the blue.  I'll donate to organizations plenty, but that's it.\n\nSo I politely say, sorry, I have no change on me.  Another guy near me has some change and gives it to him.  The beggar starts calling me a scumbag and my parents raised me badly, etc. I say nothing.\n\nThe other guy actually starts defending me(he is awesome by the way), and they are borderline arguing over this. I stay quiet to not escalate things. I finish up quickly and leave.  The chill dude tells me to have a good day, I tell him the same and walk out.",

Cal expects to do the same for him. So we sat him down and talked to him about what he wants to do. He says he wants to major in art history. We asked him what his plan was after that, whether he would go to grad school, etc. He said he wouldn't go to grad school, and had no solid plan.\n\nMy wife and I came to the decision that we don't want to pay for his college when 1) he's majoring in something without good career prospects (not saying there's no jobs out there, but the job pool is going to be pretty narrow 2) he doesn't want to go to grad school, which might help widen the job pool by possibly offering roles in academia and 3) he has no real plan, and when we asked him to come up with one, he refused.\n\nHe called us hypocrites for paying for his sister's med school but not for him. I told him that we're paying for her med school because she's in a lucrative field and has a clear plan (we've discussed this with her).\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I just don't want to 1) pay for or 2) encourage him to go into a field without planning. If he wants to major in art history, fine, but what rubs me the wrong way is that he has no plan, no solid idea of what he's going to do. I know, I know, he's 18 and nobody knows what they want to do fully at 18. But I'm not asking for a step-by-step 5 year plan, just something along the lines of 'these are some jobs I'll be applying to/here is how I'll make a living'.\n\nAita?",

      "description": "I work at as security at a fancy mall and we have our share of homeless people wanting to get out of the swedish cold. Now I'm not heartless so as long as they look well kept, don't smell, are sober and arnt standing out (none of this is difficult in Stockholm since we have \"roof over head guarantee\" so you can sleep for free at a shelter, grab a shower a small breakfast and if lucky, laundry).\n\nOne of our regulars is a alcoholic and he has been for 52 years. Most of the time he is well behaved and not drunk in the mall but the times he is I escort him out into the cold and wish him luck for the night to come. When he was shit faced enough to smoke inside the mall I decided that enough is enough and banned him from the mall (he isnt a customer and never has been). \n\nNow to the story, this is my first shift back from a vacation and I haven't been at work for a week my team leader notified me that my ban of the regular has been lifted (been in place for 2 months) due to \"he can't be banned for life, that's just unfair\". Since he is my superior I accept under protest. I work nights and I mainly deal with homeless people and junkies while my team leader works daytime and deals with mall business. My shift rolls on...\n\n... at 23:35 our regular rolls around and since he has a very distinct walk I notice him on the CCTV right away. He sits down in one of the armchairs and promptly falls asleep (now I don't allow anyone to sleep in the mall plus I know that he has received a flat from the welfare state). I'm lazy and tell myself that I he can sleep until I close the mall at 00:00.\n\nDuring closing one of the roller-gates won't function so I call the on-call guy (OC) and try to troubleshoot this gate and while I'm on the phone I have to keep emptying the mall and lock the rest of the doors. Our regular knows OC and apparently he has promised the regular a carton of cigarettes. When I wake the regular up and tell him it's time to leave he denies sleeping and then demands to know who I'm talking to and I say that it's OC and I'm trying to sort some stuff out. Regular demands to talk to OC - I say no, we are busy... Regular demands to know where his smokes are - I offer to ask when we are done. As this is going on I'm escorting him to the last door that I need to close and this takes us past a restaurant that is open (they have their own entrance) and regular decides to throw a hissy-fit and yell \"I WANT MY SMOKES NOW\". I tell OC that I will call him back and I put my phone away. I order the regular to leave since he is causing a breach of peace and we are closed. He flat out refuses and I put a hand on his back as I'm explaining that this is not acceptable behaviour and he needs to behave if he dosent want to get banned again.\n\nHe flails his arms like a child in response which results in a punch to my jaw - I'm 181cm of swedish private security and he is 155cm of elderly alcoholism. I littally pick him up and walk him outside and as morning rolls around I tell what happened to my team leader and back it up with CCTV footage and OCs word.\n\nTeam leader sais that im being harsh and an assholefor wanting the ban reestablished\n\n\nShould i look the other way because he is homeless(ish) and 70 years old? Am i the asshole? ",

She said no, but was really nice about it. It sucked, but I was able to move on and stayed friends with her. \n\nI also spent a lot of time with another friend of mine, who I had a little crush on when I first met her, but I never acted on it, because she already had a boyfriend. During the summer she broke up with her boyfriend and we started to get closer somEwhere along autumn. I realized, that my crush for her returned during the holidays and decided to simply ask her on a date and to be fine with whatever answer she'd give me. \n\nShe turned me down, but while it sucked, it was still ok for me. Until she texted me later to tell me, that she talked with a friend of hers about me asking her out and got to know, that I asked out this other girl back in November. Apparently this is the reason, that now some of the girls I know don't like me, because apparently my feelings are \"changing too fast\". And by asking her out, I apparently proved them right. \n\nI am honestly completely shocked by it, but it also got me thinking.

      "description": "Kind of a clickbait title, but it’s a complicated situation.\n\nOk, first of rall I have muscular dystrophy, leaving me in a wheelchair. Two and a half years ago I worked at my local movie theater selling movie tickets, this was prior to me committing to my wheelchair. At first I was OK at this job, but near the end, my condition had just progressed so much that I started to be a liability, so I quit. Side note, I got this job through vocational rehabilitation, and it probably wasn’t the best fit for me in the first place, but I was just excited to get a job coming out of high school. OK, back to the present. A few days ago I went to the movies, and on the way in I ran into one of my old coworkers, we recognized each other and chatted for a second, and he mentioned that he was manager now. We wrap up talking and I go on and see the movie. The movie ends, and on the way out I run into another one of my old coworkers, and he’s my favorite one. We used to chat about video games all the time. We actually had a really nice conversation. We finish our conversation and on the way home my mood was so brightened, and I started to realize how much I really missed it over there. In the 2 1/2 years since I quit I always thought “I could do podium”(the ticket tearer), but I never acted upon it because podium workers double as ushers and I can’t usher, I didn’t want to take a job away from somebody who actually needs it because I get disability, and let’s face it there’s not really a high demand for a podium worker. I just want a job to have something to do, and to maybe brighten somebody’s day  because hey that’s all you can really hope for when you’re disabled. So I thought on it, and the next day I decided to hit up the first coworker on Facebook about it. I explain what I was trying to do about possibly coming back on to do some podium work, and he responds saying that that sounds like a great idea and that I could talk to the general manager about it. Now I’m not trying to guilt anybody into giving me a job, so I just told him I could fill out an application and drop it off. He says all applications are handled online now, he could tell them I applied, and he sends me a link. I applied, putting the two coworkers I ran into as references, but there was no where to explain my situation, so I asked him to explain my situation if he brought me up to the general manager(he’s a different gm than i had). It’s been 4 days and I haven’t heard from either the theater or this coworker. I know it’s over and that’s that, but I don’t want it to be weird if i run into this guy again, I’m genuinely unbothered by it, I completely understand not wanting to hire me, I knew it would be a huge favor in the first place, and I kinda wanna tell him this. I just don’t know if there’s a way to say that without sounding passive aggressive. WIBTA if I said anything else? AITA in certain places? AITA all along?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for half a year now. Two months ago he mentions a trip his friends were talking about going on in June. At that point I still hadn't really had a chance to hang out with his friends. (I think it's really important in a relationship for the SO and the friends to get along.) Since it was just a friend outing, I was kind of waiting for him to invite me. He didn't, so I asked him myself if I was invited. He said yes. I was feeling iffy about the situation since it felt like I had just invited myself. I didn't think it was wrong since it wasn't a boys trip or anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later he asks me \"What should I do on the trip?\" And I immediately get upset over this question because in my mind he had just completely cut me out of the equation and he was set on me not going. He reassures me that it's alright and he really wants me to go on the trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother few weeks pass and he invites me on a weekend trip to a city a few hours away from us, but last minute tells me that his friends just want it to be a boys trip. I was so excited to go on this weekend trip and it crushed me when he said I couldn't come. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis weekend trip was a month ago and on this weekend his friend explicitly told him that I wasn't going to \"fit\" in this trip logistically. (That part is still iffy to me, it's not hard to add 1 person to an itinerary.) My boyfriend didn't tell me about this conversation at all and up to a few days ago hadn't even mentioned the trip since he reassured me that he wants me to go on the trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days ago I asked him if he still wanted to go and he tells me that everything's already booked and they're ready to go. I immediately broke down and got very upset at him. I cried for hours. All I could think was that he didn't value me as much as I valued him. I put so much into our relationship and I felt like he didn't care. He already knew I was sensitive about the trip. Now it felt like he went behind my back to book this trip. He had a whole month to tell me about how I wouldn't \"fit\" and only finally told me when I asked him about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe didn't understand why it was such a big deal to me that he was going on a trip without me. All I wanted him to understand was how it made me feel that he told me yes, made it felt like a maybe, reassured me with a strong yes then said \"fuck you, no.\" It's not a big deal to me that he's going on a trip without me. Its about how he handled the situation and made me feel like he didn't want me to be a part of his life. If he knew I was sensitive about this topic, shouldn't he have told me everything up front? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being sensitive about this situation and getting upset at my boyfriend?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I guess they kept the line moving after I went to go get the water and long story short, one bag of groceries got mixed up with ours. We ended up accidentally taking a bagful of groceries that wasn’t ours. The contents were 2 cream cheeses and 2 tubes of refrigerated pills bury crescents. I feel really bad for accidentally taking this persons items, especially before thanksgiving, but I feel like even if we do take it out, they probably won’t put it on the shelf or give it to that person anyways.

      "description": "I (M20) have been living with my boyfriend (M25) since October.  \n\n\nFor the past 5 months since moving here I've had issues making new friends. I've worked with the elderly in a retirement home as a full time job for 4 months, with colleagues well above my age. While this isn't an issue for me, it doesn't lend it's hand to that many free time hangouts. I knew 1 person (let's call her L) in the town prior to moving and we're very close, so apart from my bf she's been the only person I've seen, maybe once or twice a week.\n\nI love my boyfriend, but we are /very/ different people. He's into politics, he's orderly and he likes simplicity and elegance. I'm more reminiscent of a passing tornado. Quite messy, pretty impulsive, and slightly more chaotic. While this does lead to arguments, we usually have strong communication and always seek good compromises.\n\nThe winter periods hit me pretty hard because of some trauma from my childhood and because of this I haven't had much energy to go out and do activities, meaning I've been pretty much stuck at work or at home. My boyfriend is super supportive of me and he's a great help and comfort throughout these periods.\n\nA month ago I started seeing a psychologist and things have been steadily moving in the right direction. I have more energy during the day, I feel less overpowered by my own thoughts and I've been wanting to spend my time outside of the house. I also started school again and met a few interesting people, one of whom (Let's call him M) I hung out with after school last Friday, right before a 9 day winter break. We clicked pretty quickly, and since then M and I have hung out a total of 5 of the 9 days we've been off school. I didn't realize how much I had been missing speaking to like-minded people, and I've honestly been really stoked about making my first friend that hasn't been introduced to me by L.\n\nSo here's where issue comes in. My bf asked me if I wanted to go out an do something together this Sunday (nothing specific), to which I replied that I wasn't sure if I had time, because maybe I was doing something with M (we had talked about doing sketches at a skatepark, but hadn't actually planned anything yet). This led to my boyfriend first getting sad (and later angry), because he felt he was being used as \"an option, in case there wasn't anything more exciting to spend time on\". I understand why he's sad, but we live together, so we see eachother every day, and finally I'm actually talking to people I can somewhat relate to in my free time. I admit that he's been moved down on my priority list these days, but it's also only been a week. It's not like I'm ditching him forever because I found a friend, I've just been very caught up in the excitement that followed from not feeling alone anymore. I also know he's been struggling a bit at work, but we've talked about it multiple times and I personally do feel like I've been there for him. I've thought that maybe he's been needing a day together for a while, but hasn't been vocal about it, and maybe that's why it got to him so hard. He's also quite a private person, so despite living here for 1½ years, he hasn't made many friends outside of work, meaning I'm a big part of his daily social interactions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for not spending time with him?  \nSorry for the long post. In case you need anything clarified feel free to ask in the comments",

My family and I have made it 100% clear how we feel about him - the best part is he doesn’t “approve” of homosexuality (surprise, I’m a lesbian) FYI: I am past the point of caring what people think, but the fact she would continue to mess with him has more or less made me not really want a relationship with her even though I do love her very much. I can’t help be disappointed. \n\nTurns out, she’s pregnant. When I found out, I was livid because 1) the dude is an absolute waste of oxygen and 2) I feel as if my wedding is ruined. I said some things I do regret, but that’s besides the point. Am I taking it too personal for feeling like my wedding is ruined? She is due right about the time I am getting married and as you can tell by the title, she was supposed to be IN my wedding. I told her she’s out - she hasn’t said anything to me since. Also, I feel as if I am breaking my mothers heart by kicking her out (I hate to see her hurt and stressed. I tend to take on her stress as well) Am I being too harsh?\n\nI really don’t know what to do or how to feel. But I can’t have her negativity ruin my wedding for me and my fiancé.  ",

      "description": "First time poster so give me corrections if I’m doing this wrong.\n\nI work in the finance department for a small company. For background we are under 20 people so the department is really just me plus my boss who oversees both finance and operations. Like most small companies we get quite a bit of scams being sent out way. This usually isn’t a problem since they are pretty transparent. However, we have a new assistant (Let’s call her Alice) who is very naive.\n\nToday she got an email from someone pretending to be her boss (Nancy). The email was fairly generic saying that “Nancy” was running into a meeting but could Alice pick up some amazon or google pay gift cards. When Alice wrote back that she was on her way in but could do it as soon as she got the credit card or petty cash the scammer told her it was time sensitive and she should just buy them and be reimbursed at the office.\n\nY’all— Alice bought $1500 worth of Amazon gift cards with her own money. She didn’t even realize anything wrong until she asked me if I could expedite the refund check because her rent is coming up and I was completely confused. When I explained that this was a scam and that I couldn’t reimburse her for a non business expense she started crying. \n\nShe didn’t know how to report fraud or file a police report so I spent all afternoon on the phone with amazon and the store where she bought the card to see if anything could be done not to mention reported the fraud to both the local and federal authorities  but because she had bought it herself there was nothing anyone could do as far as actually getting her the money back.\n\nWhen the real Nancy found out she told Alice not to worry since our company would reimburse her anyways. I explained that while this was incredibly unfortunate this wasn’t something that we could do. We are incredibly tight on money right now to the point where everything in the office is breaking and much needed issues have been back burnered for far to long. What’s more, a lot of out money issues have to do with Nancy always approving money for people in vanity projects or overpaying them because she says they really need it. \n\nI understand that Alice is out a lot of cash right now and I offered to try to organize a collection in the office to help her with rent this month but I put my foot down about writing a check from the company account. Now though Alice is angry and Nancy has gone over my head to my boss with some nasty jabs along the way. Should I just give in and reimburse her or am I right to hold my ground? \n",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my husband to work with me to improve our sex life?",
      "description": "So, the title makes this sound like a slam dunk, validation searching post, but bear with me as I unpack. This has been going on literally for years now and I’m to the point where I’m truly starting to wonder if I am an asshole.\n\nMy husband and I have very mismatched libidos.  I’m a “why WOULDN’T you have sex every day” kind of person.  I think sex is a blast, I enjoy experimenting, and you’d be hard pressed to find a time I am not in the mood.  My husband, however, is very much not this way.  We have been together for almost 7 years, married for just under 5.\n\nThis is going to be a bit of a long one so please forgive me, but I truly do want to give this story as neutrally as possible as I really want honest feedback.\n\nWhen we started dating, we did the long distance thing.  I would see him on weekends or every other weekend and so it wasn’t apparent how mismatched our desires were, because obviously we only could have sex when we saw each other.  I noticed that some of those weekends we wouldn’t do it (much to my dismay) but always chalked it up to his job at the time (hard physical labour that left him pretty physically beat, especially in the summer time).\n\nThen we moved in together and I started noticing things I of course took the typical female route and completely panicked that he didn’t find me attractive or sexy etc etc.  We had a number of big conversations about it where he would always say it had something to do with being tired, or the job, or stress, you name it, but constantly reiterated that he found me desirable and sexy and that it was “him not me”.\n\nFast forward a bit more, and I’m still constantly trying to “spice things up” or increase our frequency, and stumble upon the fact that he has dealt with erectile issues, by way of my constantly trying to initiate sexy times leading to a few time where things “didn’t work”.  I learn over the span of many deep conversations that this has been an issue for him for a long time and obviously is something that gives him a lot of stress surrounding sex.  I feel awful for him and try be as supportive as possible, and pretty much completely back off.\n\nThis continues for years, compounded with us having issues conceiving our first child (semi-unrelated) and I will definitely admit that there was often stress on our bedroom life.  BUT glory of glories, we persisted, I continued to try be supportive, and we morphed to this sexual activity that was VERY much focused on him... by way of I think both of us wanting things to “work”.  It has now been a couple of years since he’s had any issues yet... we still have the same sex.  Every time.  We still only HAVE sex maybe once a month (sob). I haven’t received oral sex in years.  He refuses to do it in any position but the one we discovered “works” consistently, won’t do it out of bed, won’t make out anywhere that isn’t the bedroom, will stiffen up if I even TRY to paw at him outside of the bedroom, and still consistently is “not in the mood”.  \n\nGuys, I seriously beg this man to let me give him a blowjob, and he declines.  Constantly. \n\nI don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve reached the point of terror where I go “is this my life now?” Will I ever receive oral again? Will I ever get to have sex doggy style (my favourite position) again?! I never pictured myself as doomed to a sexless marriage.  And it terrifies me.  \n\nOkay, now to the point where you’re going “why are you posting here and not r/relationships ?”.  I had a revelation the other day, that led me to wonder if in all of this, I’m being an asshole. \n\nOver the years, we have talked about this A LOT.  To the point that my husband doesn’t even want to approach the conversation anymore.  I’ve suggested counselling- he doesn’t want to go.  I’ve talked about ways we can work on things- never goes anywhere.  Last time we had this conversation (which is what led to this revelation) I asked him something I’ve never asked- I asked him “are YOU happy with our sex life?”.  Because all our previous discussions were always approached from the mindset of improvement- of us trying to get to this place that was “better”.  Suddenly now I’m wondering if he doesn’t WANT better.  If this is just his happy place.  And if that’s the case, am I an asshole to try push him to achieve this sex life that makes ME happy?  I think if the genders were swapped- you always hear about husbands complaining about wives who won’t have sex with them- and usually the answer they are given is “tough titties buddy, you can’t make her have sex if she doesn’t want to”.  Is this what I should be telling myself too? I think of the shitting on that dude got who made the spreadsheet of how many times his wife rejected him- and man did I EMPATHIZE with that guy! You should see MY fucking spreadsheet! But maybe I’m an asshole too!!\n\nSo please, tell me- do I just lay this to rest? Am I the Asshole for continuing to pursue?",

      "description": "So initially, my prom group was supposed to be small- only 6 people. And when people asked to join, we told them we weren't sure. We decided to let in 2 more of our close friends. Then, the people who we weren't as close with started asking to join and we thought we couldn't use the valid excuse of \"we want a small group\" since we already let in two others. \n\nWe started discussing how to handle this but before we could decide anything, one person just assumed that they were automatically in our prom group since we didn't say no outright. And she started telling her friends to join her in our group even though we hadn't said yes. And once that got out, everyone who we had told we weren't sure about started pressuring to join our group, and we gave in. Now, our group of 6 has turned into a group of 20 and we're positive we won't have a good time especially with all the logistical nightmares of transportation and reservations.\n\nSo now, one and a half weeks before our prom, my group is debating whether to cut everyone out except for our original 6. Will we be the asshole if we leave them with no plans this close to prom?",

      "description": "Okay, so this isnt necessarily a today thing, it's over the span if a few months. It started in December of last year.\n\nAnyway, I tell my friend everything. I mean everything. Personal issues, who I like, why I'm doing this, why I wouldn't do that, etc. So I tell him who I like (we're in high school, still act like kids). He says something along the lines of \"cool, you should ask her out.\" He doesn't think for a second to tell me he was talking to her, and going to ask her out too.\n\nSo I asked her out on New Year's Eve. She said no (unsurprisingly) and I get over it in the next few hours. New year, new me, right? I get on my ps4 to talk to my friends about it, including the one I told earlier.\n\nI explain the whole ordeal, going into immense detail (we're best friends, after all) and let him tell me his input. \n\n\"Aw it's okay, OP. We all get rejected.\"\n\nAgain, decides not to tell me hes still talking to her. \n\nFast Forward to Valentines day. I havent spoke to my old crush in a while. I go outside after the bell rings, and see my friend and my old crush hugging, with her holding teddy bears and balloons, etc. Cool, he got with her. I think more into it, and end up realizing he was the one talking to her in December. This dipshit decided to let me humiliate myself. I message him later, \"So you were the one talking to X when I asked her out? Then you decided not to tell me anyway.\"\n\nLeaves me on seen. I message him back a few hours later saying how he needs to learn to face his problems like a man. He cant just ignore them. I get pissed at him and that how I ended up here. So, AITA?\n\nTL;DR - My friend of over 3 years didnt tell me he was talking to my crush when I asked her out. He then decides to act like it's no big deal, me basically ruining my social life with her.",

      "description": "Yesterday I hosted a Super Bowl party, it was a rather large party (around 20 guests). Everyone offered to bring something ranging from appetizers to desserts. People seemed to put in a lot of effort for their dishes. While it wasn’t a fancy affair, it was nice to see the level of commitment my guests put forth. Here’s where the question comes into play. One of the guests (on their way to the party) stopped at a local grocery store and bought a frozen appetizer, with the intention of me cooking it for them.  They had volunteered to bring said item (they just left out the detail that the item would be uncooked). All of the other food was already prepared and I was ready to just relax and enjoy the party with my guests. Needless to say (and maybe I over reacted) but I flat out refused to cook the food. I said it was rude to bring a dish with the assumption I would just cook for you. Given that this wasn’t the first time said guest pulled a stunt like this (bringing salad material for me to put together), I was just not having it. I told them they can make it themselves if they care that much.   (Which they bre grudgingly did)\n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "My (28M) roommate (24F) is super quiet and keeps to herself which is no big deal, but my gf tracked down her public tumblr and shes constantly complaining like a 16 year old girl. Talking mad shit behind my back instead of face to face, like an adult. Calling me an annoying asshole and all sorts of other things I dont want to get into. The worst part is this is all AFTER I asked her if there's anything I can do/work on to make her more comfortable, nope she replies, all good. I get it that some people just want to complain so I let it go for a while, just ignoring it.\n\nWhat broke it for me was shes always alone up in her room drinking and listening to her shitty punk rock music by herself. She posts on her tumblr all the time about how shes sad and that all her friends are gone. I usually keep my distance because that's what she seems to prefer, but I texted her and asked her if shes okay and let her know that I'm a good listener if she ever wants to talk or whatever.\n\nSo she ignored my text and posted on tumblr that I'm so fucking annoying and I need to 'leave her alone and let her live her life' comparing me to her dad. LOL WHAT LIFE. From what I can tell all she does is sit up in her room and drink alone. Yeah I'm going to check into it to make sure you're not going to kill yourself or burn my house down. Who the fuck reacts that way when someone asks you if you're okay or need help?\n\nI've been nothing but kind to this girl because she seemed really lonely. I got her a space heater because my house is too cold for her. I got her a (used) bed from my parents for her birthday because she couldnt bring hers when she moved here. I'm quiet and respectful (I try anyway) and from where I'm sitting she just seems like a complete cunt. I told her she has one month to find someplace else to live as per our rental contract (she rents a room in my house, this is another favor I'm doing her because she found me on social media, I dont need a roommate but she was starting a new job here in two weeks and really needed a place).\n\nSorry for the rant. What would you do in my place? Am I a creepy cyber stalker? Am I justified in trying to find out more because shes so reserved? Any responses appreciated.\n\nTLDR: Roommate has no problems with me when asks, but complains non stop on tumblr about me saying hurtful things. I'm doing here a favor here and when I saw that I gave her 1 month to find a new spot.",

      "description": "Long time lurker, first time poster, throwaway because typical reasons, etc.\n\nI'll start with a warning: I'm not sure this'll be an entirely complete or fair representation of what happened. It's one of those things that's fairly nuanced and even though it happened just a few minutes ago, I've forgotten most of the filler stuff/non-key details.\n\nI'm a college student (second year) home for the holidays. My mom's great - loving, caring, and a great gosh darn cook :) she's awesome in a lot of ways, but we've got a history of butting heads (I was an argumentative kid - we're both stubborn, though I'm working on that). We haven't argued or fought or anything like that in nearly three years and have gotten on great, until recently. \n\nWhen I come back, it's usually for 1-3 weeks at a time (spring break, winter break, and summer, for the most part). I'm in school far away from home, so I'm home for maybe 2 months out of every 12, tops. Every time I come home, I end up getting silently frustrated at how patronizing some of the treatment is - it's small things, like asking \"are you sure you've eaten enough?\" or \"it's going to be cold - are you sure you've packed gloves and a hat for your hike?\" (I'm in the National Guard and have been hiking in the arctic a number of times over the last two years). I know, I know, it's small, but it adds up over time and I end up feeling like I'm being treated like a child. \n\nThe first time I came home, I didn't want this to get in the way of us all having a nice break. I had a small, private conversation with her where I told her how it felt uncomfortable and a little disrespectful/patronizing, and she said she understood and would try to change. It happened a few more times that visit, so I believe I had another conversation with her about it - this was about a year ago, so I'm not sure whether that was on the phone from afar or in person. Unfortunately, as soon as I came back for summer, the same treatment started up again. I'm pretty sure I had a quick conversation about it again, and I got some resistance from her - \"I raised you for __ years and took care of you, I'm allowed to love you\" stands out in my memory. I went off for two weeks of drill, came back and experienced no change. I was back for maybe a month, during which I remember talking about this at least a half a dozen times. I remember the last week being really tense and cold, admittedly on both sides - I was pretty PO'd but trying not to let it affect things too much. (Note: My mom is like Phyllis Vance when it rains. These conversations always involve that earlier line and 2-3 others - she inevitably ends them either A) promising to change, or B) telling me she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. She'll show up at my door a few hours later, talking about how this is a transitioning time, but doesn't think she's doing anything wrong). \n\nThis Winter Break rolls around - all is pleasant. I've been back for just about a week and a half, and the (perceived?) patronizing remarks have continued. I've been trying my hardest to not let it affect the holidays, but after a sleepless night (work + minor emergency with a friend) and not having a chance to rest all day, it got to me a bit. I may have been disrespectful - not trying to shirk the blame, I legitimately don't know if I was. I think I was just cold and expressed a little bit of displeasure, and it may have come off as disrespectful. We launch into the same conversation, with a few points being made by her (notably: it makes her feel good to care for me like that she doesn't think it's patronizing_ and she uses a new line that got to me: I mentioned feeling disrespected by what she keeps saying, and she says \"Respect is a two-way street and I'm not feeling very much from you in this conversation\". I immediately responded with [POTENTIAL A*****E REMARK NUMBER 1] \"Love is a two-way street too, and it doesn't matter if expressing it in that way makes you feel good because I've told you that it makes me uncomfortable and upset when you do that. I'm happy to sit down and talk about some alternative ways to express it or even just point them out throughout the day, but it seems selfish to just keep doing something that I don't like because it makes you feel good.\" \n\nHere's where it gets messy and one more important detail is needed: she's just separated from her husband of 5+ years (moved out about 3 months ago and they're in weekly therapy; he's wanting to get back together but she's not sure what she wants).\n\nBack to the talk: she starts to cry. I don't know if ITA here or not, but I want Reddit to know: this kills me. I hate seeing my mom cry and wouldn't ever want it to happen. I'm also conflicted: she has, multiple times in the last 5 years, admitted (in confidence) to using crying to manipulate people (family members and friends). I can't tell if this is real or not; still don't know. She says \"I just want to love you; I just don't have very many people to love right now\". I told her I understood that it was a rough time, but that we'd been having this conversation for more than a year and current situations don't change what I said. [ANOTHER POTENTIAL A*****E REMARK HERE]: I also say \"I'm happy to address that later, but what about what I just said?\" She stops crying, and asks me to repeat what I said. I repeat it, and she starts crying again, then says angrily that it'd be best if we talked about this later/tomorrow. \n\n\nI'm at a loss. Obviously there's a ton of context that isn't here, a whole relationship dynamic that changes things, and a bunch of other stuff that I'd write if I had a book to publish, but I think these are the key points. If I'm not the A*****e, how do I keep bringing this up and get some results? If I am, how should I change my approach? I appreciate any input and will try to respond to whatever questions y'all have",

      "description": "Lately my girlfriend has been spending most nights at my house.  She gets out of work at 3pm and I get out at 5pm.  I had an extra key made so she could let herself in and watch tv or whatever until I get home.  \n\nThis is gonna sound weird, but I have this specific way I organize my dresser drawers.  Especially the top socks and underwear drawer.  It’s just a specific way I like to have my clothes.  This morning when I went to get dressed some of the black sock balls were mixed in with the white sock balls.  She’s obviously been snooping and didn’t put things the way I usually have them.  \n\nI obviously can’t prove anything, but she’s the only one who’s been in my house lately and I’m pretty anal about my drawer organization so it’s not really possible that I did it myself.

If I had joined on my own I would've been left but she has went as far as to cry saying she thinks me not being in band could drive us apart. I love her but I'm just not cut out for band. The section I'm in consists of 4 members counting me and two of which won't be in the band next year. The other is a beginner and knows only a little more than me as he can sight read the music. I cannot and lack the resources to learn. The two others who actually know their stuff consistently mock and put me down for not learning fast. They get into arguments about who's going to teach me every time I go to practice. My GF has stated that I ask the band instructor to help me, but I reminded her that the band instructor (BI from here on out) already expects that everyone knows how to sight read. Even when she takes sections to teach she doesn't really teach but rather tells them to take a moment to read then tells them to play the music. BI will nine times out of ten find out I can't sight read and either put me out of band or question my GF as to why she hasn't tought me how to. I've been not going to practice recently to kinda ween my GF off having me there. I've tried explaining this to her and she just comes up with excuses, until I show her the flaws in her excuse. Now she pretty much just says that I can fake it, but marching season is coming up fast and I don't see any point in me marching if I don't know majority of the songs we play. I'll add edits if anyone has questions.",

He’s getting gifts for 2 women in his office who clearly have some kind of romantic feelings for him which I do, however, take issue with. \n\nOne of them, Girl 1, has blatantly hit on him, told others that she only hired him because he’s attractive, regularly and openly talks about her sex life with him ect. Allegedly, Girl 1 bought him a 10$ ticket to something a few weeks ago and just told him that was his Christmas gift so he now feels obligated to get her a present. \n\nThe other one, Girl 2, is engaged but regularly tells my boyfriend that she wishes her fiancé were more like him. Both my boyfriend and his close guy friend have admitted to me that they think she has a crush on him. He feels the need to get her something more expensive than the others because he works next to her. \n\nWe just got in an argument because I feel like it looks bad and sends the wrong message for him to be giving gifts to these women. In the bigger picture, I feel like it’s weird that he chooses to spend so much time with them knowing how they feel as well. Am I the asshole for telling him to not get them anything?",

      "description": "Ok well where do I start, I have a friend who I used to be very close to but sadly fell out with a year ago due to numerous incidents and a phase of depression I went through. We’ve tried to be friends several times but every time would end with them deciding they’d be better off just not talking to me and leaving me hanging every time (I was normally the one trying to rekindle the friendship)\n\nIn the summer before we returned to our school, our friendship rekindled itself after a disastrous school year between the two of us and we talked a lot and went out a few times, however upon returning to school... I found them reluctant to talk to me anymore and due to this we both grew bitter and fell out again.\n\nWe then argued one night and said some pretty awful things to each other, we had argued before but it was normally me being their emotional punching bag and not offering much in the way of an argument  (Something I would later come to resent them for) and yet after the arguing was done, they came to me and apologised and we agreed to revisit our friendship at a later date.\n\nAnd then suddenly... two weeks later, the impossible happened and this person. A person, I had perceived as unemotional and uncaring towards me, opened up and admitted they missed being my friend and wished to be friends again for good. I know I said we were friends numerous times beforehand and tbh I should’ve predicted the outcome earlier. But this was the first sign of genuine friendship from them and I embraced them with open arms.\n\nIt took two weeks for things to slowly start reverting back. They’d stop making an effort to talk to me. They’d never look at me if we were in a group. Only the other people. They would never attempt to start a conversation with me. Unlike last time, we didn’t argue but we both let things get away from us and we stopped talking. However during a mutual period of exams. I found them suddenly easier to get on with and for a solitary month. They were consistently my friend and I genuinely thought things would get better.\n\nAnd then last week, they stopped. Suddenly my “easy-to-talk” to friend was cold and unwelcoming. This was by far the most abrupt they’ve ever done this and to be honest I am furious. I have always been the one pushing our friendship. Trying to fix it and make it work and I’ve always been the one cast aside for no reason. It’s never been them. This person genuinely means a great deal to me but they’ve never been consistent. I was the sole reason our friendship collapsed in the first place and as a result always blamed myself when our attempted friendships failed.\n\nHowever now, I see myself less as the sole perpetrator and more as the guy getting screwed. This person is genuinely a good and kind person however they play with my emotions and constantly make me feel worthless and unwanted in my attempts to be their friend. They’ve called me out before for “failing to confront them” (as if that’s the reason things always go to shit) and tbh I don’t want to confront them. I just want out.\n\nAnd so I ask... people of reddit. Would I be an asshole if I was to just start ignoring him. Block him on everything and cut him completely out of my life despite the facts I don’t know his true feelings and we would still see each other regularly. I would ask but doing so would most likely lead to an argument I’m really not emotionally equipped to have.\n\n",

      "description": "My ex (24f) and I (24m) dated 5 years ago. We were together for about a year, but then she dumped me out of no where for another guy and broke my heart. She and I shared the same circle of friends so I continued to be cordial with her for the sake of our friend group, and we remained friends until we graduated and I distanced her out of my life and no longer speak to her. I'm still close with my friend group, but they have drifted from her over the past year. I'll still see her sometimes when we have hang outs with the larger group, but I no longer speak to her and we just avoid each other.\n\nThis past weekend my friend had a pre-game/party for his birthday and she was invited along with our other friends. I have a new girlfriend (23f) that I have been dating for a few months (she is absolutely amazing, drop dead gorgeous, kind hearted, thoughtful, etc. I never thought I could feel this way about someone). I invited her too, and she knew my ex would be there but was okay with it.\n\nAt the pre-game, my ex had a couple shots, was maybe tipsy. She came up to me and my girlfriend and started talking to us normally. I was kind of confused as to why, but just went with it. She then says to my girlfriend, \"Hey did you know me and Ilovepotatoes22 used to date back in the day?\" to which she says, \"Yes, I'm aware\". Ex gf smirks very subtly and under her breath says, \"Yup and he sure downgraded\" while looking me dead in the eye. My gf said \"Wow, I'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me\" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. I was angry, I truly don't believe I \"downgraded\" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes I do find her more attractive than my ex. I told my ex \"I'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. Let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again\". \n\nShe went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them I called her uglier than my current gf. I told my friends what actually happened and they understand but they told me I could have been a little bit less harsh. Ex gf is apparently really depressed and has been telling my friends that she doesn't want to come to any of the hang outs anymore. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Maybe better suited for /r/AmITheCheapskate, but as that sub doesn't exist yet I'm asking here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA good friend of mine sent out invitations for our friend group to attend his NYE party. He plans to rent the party room in his condo, which admittedly is pretty nice, but all of the attendees will apparently be charged \"maximum $50 each, depending on attendance\" at the door. I think this is completely absurd - the party room is HUGE and can fit up to 100 people. At most, 10-20 people will attend this party, so this could easily be held in his condo, 2 floors away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think this is unbelievably tacky, and it makes me not want to attend. I'm a bit salty because I've always been of the view that the host takes on most of the cost of entertaining at parties, so when I've hosted parties I have no issues providing some snacks, mix, etc on my dime, and if guests choose to bring something/give me $? Awesome, but absolutely not mandatory. This also isn't like renting a booth at a club, where we'll get bottles and other stuff with the cost of entry - he's made no mention of food/booze being provided, and I've heard he's asking our friends who work in hospitality to help provide bevs and food from their work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me, this seems like a cheap money grab. I also acknowledge that different people have different priorities and I don't know his financial situation, but no one else has said anything to him (besides the people who are being asked to provide things), so I think I'm the odd man out.

      "description": "My s/o and I have been in a serious relationship for about 7 months. And for more context, I have diagnosed depression and was PMSing but that'll make more sense later, hopefully. We were having a fun, nice night. Got dinner at one of our favorite restaurants then headed over to the venue. We get there and I already feel uneasy. I smoke a little weed to help before we walked over and it helped until we were actually in. It was an edm concert/rave which I had never really experienced before. It was an artist my bf really likes and that I've listened to before but wasn't a huge fan or anything. We get into the building and not only do I feel like I'm incredibly out of place but it was just that feeling of \"I shouldn't be here, this really doesn't feel right\" My boyfriend tried to cheer me up and pulled me over to dance. I barely said \"I'm really out of my element. Can you give me a few minutes?\" before I just lose my shit and start crying. We go outside to get some air and I just cant calm down, feeling like I wasn't going to recover and be able to match the energy of the concert and feeling guilty that bf had to deal with this. After about 15 minutes it sounded like the artist was going to come out so he says, \"now or never. if you want to leave we'll leave.\" I still didn't feel any better so we left. He barely said a word to me after that and on the whole car ride home. I felt even worse considering I probably just ruined his night. No kiss, no \"I love you\", just dropped me off. 10 minutes later he snapchats (our primary form of communication) me saying I need you to give me some space\" and removes me as a friend. AITA? ",

      "description": "To start, he is step father in law, my husband's mom remarried, so he isn't actually related to anyone. He easily makes 6 figures. (Relevant) Using phone so format may be awkward.\n\nBackstory - 4 years ago my husband's grandmother died. Her husband has been in financial stress for a while and they weren't exactly long term planners, so no life insurance or funds for final expenses. SFIL loans granddad the money for an inexpensive coffin. The funeral is way out in the middle of nowhere, she wanted to be buried near SFILs hometown bc she liked him that much, but its several hours away. \n\nNow, 2 years ago it occurs to me that we missed grandma's birthday and I want to make sure we take flowers to her grave. I can't remember where exactly the cemetery was so I call SFIL and ask. He tells me then rants about how much he loaned granddad and how long it took him to repay. Uh. Ok. Just tell me where she is.\n\nSeveral hours later, I am standing in a cemetery and realize that I can't find her. Call SFIL and ask, what row? What does her headstone or marker look like?\n\nThere is no marker or headstone. Even the decorative memorial stone I brought to the funeral is gone. I can't find her. I am bawling because I can't find her grave and put her birthday flowers on it.\n\nSFIL tells me that he wasn't going to  pay for a stone because she wasn't his mom. Granddad obviously had no money to do it. Grandma adored this guy, thought the world of him, but he just wasn't going to spend the money for her to have a marker. Basically tells me to F off, not his problem.  I tell him that he was out of line. If he can spend 10k on a single coin for his collection, can't he help his stay at home wife get a gravestone for her mother? I remind him of all the things that I have done over the years with no ask for thanks, because I thought we were family. I ask him to give me contact for the cemetery so I can find where she is and do something. He refused. This ends as with me telling him i guess we aren't family and don't expect me to help again until he apologizes for putting money before family.\n\nNow, I did contact granddad and asked if he wanted help or if I could get a gravestone.  He is planning on having his son use his life insurance to pay for a stone when he dies. \n\nFast forward now. It's been 2 years since we have seen or talked to MIL and SFIL because of this. My husband reached out and asked SFIL to  put aside differences so we can do holidays together. SFIL will not let his wife see us (again they are about 5hrs drive away) and refuses to reconcile until I give him a sincere apology. I declined. \n\nSo am I being too stubborn? ",

      "description": "20F, ex-Catholic college student living away from parents. I'm sexually active, but my parents don't know.\n\nA few months ago, I had a conversation with my Catholic, non-practicing mom about birth control and was told that she wants me to be safe and hopes that I'll be open about it. I'm a dependent on their insurance, and she said they'd cover it, if I ever wanted it. My mom has been open about how she used birth control pills for the first 2+ years of my parents' marriage because they didn't want kids yet. \n\nOn that positive note and after a more recent broken condom incident, I told my mom I was planning on getting Nexplanon or an IUD through the campus health center and let her know that she if she had an opinion on which one I should get, I'd be interested in hearing it. Since then, she's told me which she thinks would be better but also keeps trying to lecture me about how I could get STDs that might effect my relationship with my future husband, about how she's heard some contraceptives prevent the fertilized egg from implanting which is basically the same as having an abortion every time you have sex, about how all of our relatives that had multiple partners before marriage got divorced, about how guys will pressure you and do anything for sex, etc. She keeps prying for information about \"the boy,\" but I refuse to tell her anything except that I'm not on any dating apps. I think it's unreasonable for her to expect me to divulge information on sexual partners. Some of the things she says make me feel bad, because I'm already sexually active and I've already made the choice.\n\nI know she wants me to change the mind. I've told her that this is an uncomfortable thing for me to bring up to her, and I would only bring it up if I had reflected on it and decided I was sure. She gets angry at me, saying I won't listen to her and that I am being condescending towards her. Since their insurance will be covering most of the cost, I feel like I do have to listen to what she has to say. I'd like to think she has had good intentions this entire time, but I also feel like she baited-and-switched me.  ",

Every time I tell someone about it they always ask to see a picture of her or look her up on Instagram.\n\nThis is fine and normal, however I always get hit with comments about the pictures of her and her ex of a few months ago all over her page. I’m always unsure of how to answer them.\n\nAfter I asked her about it, she said that she doesn’t have feelings for him and it was just a big part of her life that she chooses to not delete. While I think this is fair, it still makes me kind of uncomfortable to tell others. It doesn’t help that her ex hasn’t taken any of his pictures down either. \n\nThey dated for about a year, and not all of her posts in that period are with him.\n\nWIBTA to ask her to take those posts down?\n\nTLDR: would it be bad to ask my girlfriend to take down pictures of her ex on social media even if she claims there’s no emotional attachment to them?",

      "description": "My husband is currently freezing me out because I got a new tattoo two days ago. I’m genuinely unsure if I have been an asshole or not.\n\nFor context:\nI have had tattoos since we met and have had many since. Earlier this year I got a coverup of an old tattoo I had been planning for years. He was fine up until the day and even drove me to the appointment, but as soon as I got into the car on the way home, I was practically the silent treatment for 3 days. He eventually got over it, but never told me what his problem really was (it’s in a very visible place and is quite big, so I assumed that this was what his problem was). \n\nAbout 6 months after this I saw something I liked by an artist I knew, so showed my husband to see if he had any serious objections - his response was indifference. I discussed it with him, even showed him my stupid drawing of where it would go (it is an addition to an existing tattoo on my thigh - one which he quite liked), discussed the financial aspect with him, and never received any objections.\n\nHe was frosty with me on the day of, but he is very prone to mood swings, so I just put it down to him having a bad day. I went and got the tattoo, and he was in a dreadful mood when I got home so I decided then would not be the time to flaunt the new tattoo and piss him off even more. The tattoo hasn’t been mentioned at all, and I can’t even be sure he’s seen it as I haven’t outright shown him for fear of him being annoyed about it. Two days later and he’s still being very short with me. I saw a message today on his Nan’s phone telling a friend that he was ‘really depressed’ because I had gotten another tattoo. \n\nI am a bit confused about the whole thing - I know I should have considered his last reaction, and I understand that his feelings about this are important, but I know that I wouldn’t give a shit if he got a tattoo, whether I liked it or not so part of me struggles to understand his problem with it, especially as I have had them as long as he has known me, and I have never made my desire to get more a secret. \n\nSorry for the wall of text.\n\nTLDR:\nHusband showed indifference to a tattoo I wanted, so I got it. Now he’s pissed. \n\n",

He tried justifying it, but I just gave one word answers. Finally I said they let their kid cut infront of a line of folks and then cuss at someone, and this is funny? \n\nNormally I keep my thoughts to myself (Monkey, Circus), but this time I outright said that was out of line of her to do so, and they shouldn't have let it happen, or at least done something.

      "description": "So I (25M) have quite a large family. I have two brothers (14M, 17M) and three sisters (16F, 21F and 30F). And then my parents (55M and 55F). \n\nThe situation here is that my dad gave some advice to my younger brother (16M) about girls. \n\nNow some further context. Me and my siblings have all done fine with relationships. My older sister is married, but when she was younger, she was athletic, popular, sociable and got good grades. I was the same at younger age, now I hold a decent job and am doing well for myself. I'm single as it stands but I've dated around a fair bit. Likewise, my younger sisters (21F) and (16F) have their own boyfriends too. \n\nHell even my youngest brother (14M), is becoming quite the athlete and is starting to invite girls to the house (obviously, I don't think he's doing anything sexual at this age...but still, he's clearly getting confident with them and I can tell he's popular with them). \n\nBut the ''middle'' brother (16M) so to speak, he is different. He's incredibly book smart, but he has very limited social skills. He's very shy, he stays in his room a lot and plays video games, he doesn't know how to dress, he's a bit grumpy when family guests come over too (doesn't even try to socialize with them). **Simply put, he's not like any of us.**\n\nHell, his own younger brother is doing better with the ladies than he is! Me and my dad started to become very concerned for him. Sometimes me and my dad joke that he's adopted. When we were his age, we had girlfriends then...we were being sociable, but he doesn't seem to be doing so, nor is he really asking for advice. He just really...sticks out\n\nSo while I was in the living room alone, my dad walked in and asked whether my younger bro is in, and I said I don't know, so he calls my younger brother down and says ''Me and throwawayorpk want to have a talk with you''.\n\nI was a bit confused as to what was going on, but went along with it.\n\nBasically, my dad told my younger bro that ''We noticed you have never been with any girls and we know you can get a girlfriend, you have it in you, so if you need advice, come to us''.\n\nHe says ''I'm fine thanks'' and tries to go back upstairs but my dad stops him, and says ''Son, you need to be more of a man. Be more masculine. Get things done. Don't just sit in your room all day and play video games''. Then I notice that my younger bro gets angry like never before, I've never seen this side of him, he just bursts out ''Fuck off you asshole!'' to my dad and my dad loses it. My dad screams at him and says ''I was trying to help you and this is how you talk to me! For all those video games I bought you and you dare talk to me like that, you little shit, you are grounded. You're so done now.'' and he took away his video games.\n\nTbh, I don't agree with taking away his video games and I feel sorry for my brother now but I honestly agree with my dad's advice, I think my brother was being ungrateful, AITA?",

      "description": "Hello all, avid lurker never thought I’d be a poster but here it goes. Last night I went to a club with my good friend (G) and two of her housemates and another person I’d never met. This is a regular occurrence so I would say that myself and the housemates (A and B) are friends in a loose term I don’t see them outside of these nights out. \n\nAnyway for background A and B were together last year and broke up in October, it was friendly obviously because they live together and A is always getting with people when we go out and brings them back, all good. Now here’s how things went wrong, I have a bit of a thing for B because we just get along really well and he’s been there for me through a really difficult time at the moment even though he barely knows me but I kept my distance because I am not at all like A physically and personality wise so I didn’t think he was into me so I forgot about it. And then last night happened and when we were in the smoking area on our own he told me how he thought I was beautiful and he had a bit of a thing for me and we kiss, it just happened and it felt right. To add to this was his first kiss since the break up and he says he doesn’t regret it.\n\nBut anyway I told him we probably shouldn’t do it in front of A just to be respectful but turns out she did see us and she got REALLY mad and leaves. I want to go home but B convinces me to get a taxi with them instead of walking home alone and in the taxi is where it gets messy. I said that I would sleep on the sofa and she says something along the lines of ‘I’m sure b’s bed will be free for you’ and b goes off on her and I get the taxi driver to stop and I’m gone even though g and b are telling me she’s just drunk blah blah. She hasn’t talked to me and is posting all the pictures of last night on Instagram without me. I’ve apologised but G tells me I don’t need to but I feel like the asshole so I need an outside perspective, AITA?",

They are a habitual class-skipper, and will use every excuse they can to justify why they missed class (ie. I overslept, I was running too late anyways, I am super stressed rn, etc.). Now, I’m not going to say these aren’t totally bs excuses, I’ve used them a couple times myself, but he has attended maybe 4-5 classes of our like 14 class sessions this semester. Anyways, onto the AITA part of the story.\n\nHe came to me around midterms asking me if I could help him prepare for the test. At this point, I had even forgotten they were in  the class with me. I was willing to at least tell him what materials were on the exam, but when I told him this, he gave a very confused look and asked when I was going to help him study. Keep in mind, this class moves at a pathetically slow pace, and everyone who attended class regularly had no issues with what was on the midterm.\n\nI snapped at him after he tried to push me into helping him study for about an hour, saying something along the lines of “Instead of bothering me, you could have been studying this whole time, and if you had actually gone to class, you wouldn’t need to be bothering me in the first place.”\n\nWe haven’t really spoken since, AITA",

She’s four and I have some experience with little kids (babysitting) but obviously was never around one 24/7 before.\n\nMy mom asked me to take her to the park for a few hours and then bring her back, so I did. On the bus back, I sat her in her own seat and was playing on my phone and she had her head on my shoulder and was falling asleep.\n\nNext thing I know, she’s face down on the ground because she fell asleep and just flopped over. She didn’t get hurt except for a scratch on her chin but it did set back our bonding a bit, which sucks.\n\nMy parents are super pissed at me for letting her fall but I never knew you had to hold little kids up when they sleep or they fall over. Like I’ve seen plenty of adults fall asleep and they stay upright so I didn’t realize she was at risk. I know I’m supposed to watch her, but she was right next to me and leaning on me so I didn’t think I needed to hold her and literally watch her. AITA for this?",

Both were conceived via fertility treatments, bc we tried for a couple of years with no luck. The doc told me it was basically impossible without help. So we have our two boys, and it's not like we're actively trying....those with two young kids know it's hard to keep an active sex life. Anyway, in July she found out she was pregnant, and 5 weeks later sadly lost the child. Then in September she tells me she's pregnant again. I was stunned. After the miscarriage we had talked about having a 3rd but never really decided on it. Plus I thought it was a freak, one time thing...and I didn't have time to take off to get a vasectomy. We had sex August 31st which shouldn't have been in the \"danger zone\" for pregnancy....so she's 20 weeks along and I accompanied her to her 20 week ultrasound. I felt nothing. Unlike the previous two boys. I just am dreading a 3rd boy right now. I know things will change when he arrives in late May, and as a man of faith I feel that this was God's plan for us. But man, our house isn't all that big, going through the baby stage again at near 40, it's just tough.

They have no real power other than relaying messages and taking over when he's on vacation \n\nI was at work one day and me and another coworker switched duties. Usually my manager doesn't give a fuck and it's never a big deal but the lead hand wanted to be a hardass. He found out that we switched and got pissed saying that we should have his approval. Whatever I thought.\n\nEnd of the week comes and I'm only scheduled for 2 days. Usually it's a full week, 5 days. My manager never schedules me that little. I had a feeling that it was him as he was in charge of the schedule but wasn't sure.\n\nMy other coworker and I are talking and we start to talk about what am asshole our lead hand is. My coworker then mentioned that he had threatened to cut his shifts if he didn't keep up with his bullshit micromanaging. My coworker talks back and told him off. It was then that I realized that me getting 2 shifts was intentional as he tried the same thing with my coworker.\n\nNext week my manager comes back and asks why I barely worked last week. I said I don't know as I didn't want to make an accusation without concrete proof. This pissed me off though as he essentially robbed me of my money. At least 600 dollars.\n\nI saw him the other day and was very cold and short with him. I only talked to him because other coworkers were around. Since then I haven't seen him much as he's elsewhere for work but he has tried to call and text me about work related stuff and I've just ignored him. It isn't crucial that we connect as that's just how our workplace is struttred. I feel like he can figure it out when he gets into the building himself as the issues he contacts me about relate to him.\n\nHe just whatsapped me asking about the progress of a report and I left him on read. We were good before the vacation of my manager but ever since he did that to me I've been ignoring him. I consider it to be extremely low and cowardly",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years now and have been very happy to say the least. We are very much in love. We never argue and always seem to agree on the important things. \n\nThat being said, he is celebrating his 18th birthday and will be heading to college after he graduates. Being that I'm a junior, I will not graduate with him and I want to spend as much time with him as I can before our time together is limited. \n\nHe celebrates his birthday with a bunch of his friends that all come over and stay the night. His friends are actually my friends too, so we all get along very well. However, I wasn't invited to his birthday party. Despite all of his friends asking about me coming, he still won't invite me. (I should also note that I wasn't invited last year). \n\nWhen I started getting a little hurt, I asked him why I was never invited, and he just told me that I would be the only girl there. But he knows that it doesnt bother me, especially since we are all friends. And then he mentioned that it's an overnight party, but I told him that I had to be home at a certain time anyways. \n\nA few days passed and I asked about it again because his own brother was concerned that I wasn't invited. He told me that this was his last year to have a birthday party like that with his friends and then reassured me that we would celebrate his birthday in all the years to come, but I still couldnt help but be upset. Especially since this is a big milestone for him that I wanted to celebrate with him. \n\nI dropped the conversation, but I didnt talk to him for a while and even teared up when he wasn't looking. The party is currently happening and he has barely texted me. When he did text me it was small talk, so I just told him that I was getting in bed. I'm just so upset that I'm not in the mood for conversation. \n\nSo I want to know AITA for being upset with him?",

      "description": "So I met this guy online and he lives far enough away that he asked if he could stay over if he came to visit. I wasn't super comfortable with that on the first date, so I suggested we meet up halfway for dinner to see if we clicked first. He seemed fine with this and kept messaging me the days before and day of saying how excited he was.\n\nSo we met up for dinner in a town that was about double the trip for me than it was for him. I figured he would be driving out of his way if he came to visit the next time, so I didn't mind. It went really well and we seemed to click. He seemed maybe a bit nervous but I didnt get any red flags or anything. \n\nWe walked to his car afterwards (he offered me a drink he had in his car, which sounds pretty weird in hindsight lol). We talked a bit more and he mentioned our next date where he would drive down to me. I said I'd send him my address and we hugged goodnight.\n\nI didn't expect to hear from him that night, but he messaged me on the way home telling me to be careful since there was an accident.  I didn't reply until I got home since I was driving, but i thanked him and said i had a lot of fun. He agreed and sent me some links of things we talked about at dinner. Again, everything seems like normal. \n\nThe conversation led to something that seemed relevant to mention my last name (it's unusual). We are talking using snapchat, and his full name shows up on there due to however he entered his settings. After that, I asked him if that was his last name, and even said he didnt have to tell me if he thought that was weird. He just replied with \"ya\" and then we continued talking as normal.\n\nWhen I woke up in the morning, I read whatever he had sent last as I had fallen asleep. He said something like \"going to bed, talk soon :)\". I was busy so I didn't reply right then.\n\nWent to message him later and his name had been pushed down on the list (hopefully you'll know what I mean on snapchat) and I went to message him and it just kept saying try again later. With a little digging, I figured out he had blocked me... I was super confused and I have never been ghosted before. I gave it a day to see if it was an accident or something.  Nothing.\n\nMaybe this is a bit crazy, but I made another account and added him. He added me back. I sent \"hey, this is *my name *. Why did you block me? If you weren't interested I wish you would have just said so...\" he read it then blocked me.\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around whether I overstepped the line and was an ass or something? I paid for half of dinner and dont think I was rude, but I would like an outside perspective. \n\nTL;DR: I was ghosted after a normal first date, after asking for a last name. Is this an asshole thing to do?",

      "description": "I have to admit that I am the black sheep of the family. I'm very outgoing and creatively expressive. I am an open minded person and try to stay abreast of social issues and be active in the community. I'm an entrepreneur and I like taking risks and don't see the issue in failure. In contrast, every member of my family is literally booted into the matrix. They have reached \"success\",  I admit. They focus on stability at all costs even if it means sacrificing their happiness. They believe everything the news tells them. They are highly apathetic to anything that doesn't immediately concern them. \"Recycling is just hard. The earth is fucked anyway and things truly don't get recycled\", for example. They have a hard time with accepting people for who they are, and consistently judge people against their standards. I do give them credit tho. They are driven, not addicted to drugs, aren't criminals, stable, and are loving parents. \n\nLike everyone, I certainly don't care how they want to live their lives. They aren't really hurting anyone. That's not the point of my post. I can't change how they act. But, for years they impose their life values on me. It's so profound and so apparent that they literally verbalize how little they care about my interests or how I see life. Somehow I am the lost one, the immature one, the one who needs to get a clue. Never mind when my brother buys my 4 year old niece a box of Krispy Kremes at 10 a clock at night, when she had Chik Fil A for dinner, then knocks off my advocacy for health as \"hippy shit.\" Their lives are in shambles behind the illusion curtain of \"success\", and I truly feel like they constantly try to drag me down with them. We have no common ground on interests. I can't even talk to them without receiving some type of criticism.  At the end of the day, we have fundamentally different personalities to the point where I wouldn't want to really associate myself with them if they weren't blood. They would be that person at the party that I would politely greet and just get on with my life.\n\nSo, here I am making my own life and I have these constant itches in my thought process that says \"They're toxic for you, let them go.\" There is some anger in there, yes. But mainly I'm just numb. I dread their company and it mentally taxes me. I can't really say I love them tbh. I think I love them because that's what I'm told. So AITA? Should I re position my own perspective? Or indeed is it okay to let your family go if you know they weigh you down.",

      "title": "AITA for not loving my father enough?",
      "description": "A bit of background information: my father (let's call him Bill) has been married to my mother and has never been separated. \n\nBill has always been a bit of a narcissist, yelling often when he feels the slightest ounce of stress. Some of my earliest childhood memories involve him yelling at my mother. Many of the arguments he has involve trivial issues that normal people would resolve in minutes, such arguments would happen at least once a month. He is a reckless driver who rarely signals or pays attention and is the frequent receiver of honks from other drivers. While eating dinner, Bill noticed that I was picking out pieces of pork from my meal (unlike him I dislike meat) and tells me not to be a picky eater; when I pointed out that he had a pile of onions stacked on a paper towel that he was not going to eat he replied \"so what\"?\n\nThroughout the years, Bill has always worked the night shift, leaving during the evening and returning home early morning. His daytime his spent sleeping, going to the gym and watching television. He is extremely lazy in the household and gives the excuse of being the breadwinner in order to justify not helping with chores. In one instance, he was sitting about 10 feet away from the house phone and got angry when I did not pick it up despite the fact I was in the rest room.\n\nI have always had anxiety whenever I am near Bill. If my family is going out somewhere and Bill happens to be around to accompany them, I often times refuse to go. There is a bit of awkward silence whenever I am alone with him and I cannot seem to have proper thought patterns due to my anxiety. I have this irrational fear that Bill will find a way to yell at me and start an argument like he does with my mother despite the fact this has only happen a handful of times.\n\nBill has always loved the family as he expressed concerns whenever I get a medical issue, yet I have a hard time reciprocating these feelings. He has left home multiple times due to having to relocate temporarily for work and not once has I ever truly missed him. In fact, I have rarely noticed his absence, mainly because he typically sleeps or workouts when he is off work.\n\nI am not the only person who acknowledges Bill’s flaws, my mother and sister occasionally have brief discussions where we consider his yelling, refusal to help, etc.",

      "description": "A little background info: My girlfriend and I began a long distance relationship soon after we both finished school. We have been dating going on 5 years now and have been in the LDR for 1.5 years.\n\nLast night, she hung out 1 on 1 in her apartment with a guy she met from an adult sports league (they met a few months back, but still play together regularly). I was a little jealous when I heard what she was doing, but I tried to keep my cool in order to not be the automatic 'asshole'. I texted her goodnight around 10:20 my time (11:20 hers), then laid in bed for a few minutes and my mind began racing. I started wondering what kind of stuff they were up to and, I have to admit, my mind got the best of me. I trolled around reddit and some other websites for about 10 minutes to see if this situation was normal and if I should say something. I did.\n\nHere is my text: \"I will admit that it's really kind of weird that you're hanging out one on one with \\[insert name here\\] at 1130 on a Friday night.\" This was sent \\~10 minutes after my goodnight text.\n\nI thought this was reasonable. She would quell my fears and I could just go to sleep. 30 minutes go by with no response. An hour then goes by... I give up waiting. She didn't text me back until 9:30am (her time). I would have chalked this up to her falling asleep, but her excuse was that she 'just didn't want to deal with it last night'. Regardless of this being the real reason, this response really hurt.\n\nRewinding to about 4 years ago, we had a similar situation (albeit more severe) where she was repeatedly hanging out with a guy 1 on 1 in her room at college (we went to the same school). This guy called me the \"epitome of douche\" and was trying to get her to break up with me. At first, she wouldn't admit it. I had to call her out on information from her roommates in order to hear the whole story from her. She said they never did anything together and I told her I trusted her. \n\nLast night, I got flashbacks to the same situation. This time, I don't have the roommates to help determine if it is purely platonic and to hear the whole story. I vocalized all of this in a phone call with her about an hour ago and now she says I am being controlling and that she 'just won't ever do anything on the weekends again'. I am not trying to be controlling, but I totally understand where she is coming from (I stayed in the same state as college and still have friends here where she does not where she is). I just don't think she thinks it is as big of a deal as I do, especially her not texting back and the given history of this kind of situation.  \n\nTL;DR: My LDR girlfriend hung out alone in her apartment with a guy last night. I told her that what she was doing didn't make me feel comfortable and she didn't respond until the morning. Her response was that she doesn't have many friends there and just wanted to do something. This sort of thing has happened in the past and I had to call her out on information from her roommates in order to hear the whole story from her. We talked on the phone this morning where I told her that and she called me controlling and thinks I am overreacting.\n\nAITA??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for trying to strongly dissuade my GF from doing a Ph.D?",
      "description": "Let me preface this that I quit my ph.D program out of choice. Why? I was a middle-of-the-pack student. For an average student like me, I stand little to no chance in landing a tenure-track position even at an \"average\" university. What awaited me was post-doc purgatory and adjunct teaching, where you make a \\*pittance\\* for the amount of education you have invested in yourself. Foreseeing this, I noped the fuck out and jumped to the job market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnter my GF. She is a 28 years old Masters student in engineering. She has informed me on several occasions that she wants to pursue a Ph.D after graduating from her current program. I have been urging her to think twice about this momentous decision. Here are my arguments as to why I think a Ph.D is not good for her:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The Ph.D department she wants to go to is not that highly-ranked. Landing a tenure-track position after graduating from there is a snowball chance in hell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. You don't need a Ph.D in engineering to thrive in the professional/industrial job market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. She has never been on the job market. How would she know she wouldn't like it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. I don't think she knows what she's getting into. It's clear she hasn't thoroughly researched this career path. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. She's not that young anymore. Do you really want to use your prime years for an endeavor with highly uncertain payoff? Even if you manage to get a job after, that's \\~5 years of opportunity cost gone. That's \\~5 years in which you could have been working because a Masters is perfectly \\*sufficient\\* already. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. I don't think her personality is good for academia. She is a very quiet and somewhat passive. Teaching, competing for grants, going to conferences, and all that jazz would probably be tough for her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. Hell, if the Ph.D is really needed for her next promotion, what prevents her from going \\*back\\* to it after gaining some work experience on the job market first?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost importantly, though, it's that I see myself in her. I believe I was in her shoes 4 years ago. I do not want her to make the same mistake I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here's where I could be the asshole:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. She's allowed to do whatever the fuck she wants. Maybe I can give her some (unsolicited?) advice, but it's not my purview to tell her what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. The big one: I'm not that young anymore either. I'm also materialistic. Basically, I don't want a future in which my partner doesn't really contribute to the American Dream because she's still studying as an 30+ years old. If we are to share our life together, I'd want her to work. I'm scared of the uncertainty that her preferred career path brings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause I legit care about her and \\*because I want someone who can help me create the future I want\\*, I've been trying to dissuade her from pursuing her goal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "One of my friends that I play games with and talk to on a semi-regular basis (every 2-3 days) has been doing nothing to try and spend time with me over the past 14 days, which I wouldn't have a problem with if it weren't for the fact that I've been actively shut down every time I ask to do something with him, in favor of spending time with his other friends. These are friends that will go months at a time completely ghosting him for no reason, and it hurts a lot that he'd rather hang out with people that treat him like a convenience, rather than someone that makes an effort to spend time together. When I confronted him and outright told him that I'm upset at him for ignoring me, he told me that he's just used to not talking to friends for quite a while (which obviously isn't true, based on the fact that we talked every other day at least, for months at a time). As understandable as that might be, he then followed it up with saying that I was just looking for something to justify cutting him out of my life, which felt like he was trying to guilt me hard into not being angry at him anymore, however it just made me furious that it seemed like he was trying to manipulate me. Now, my judgement is way too clouded by anger to think if I was overreacting or if he really was being inconsiderate. So, AITA?",

      "description": "Ex: We watched a show I wanted to check out once and I liked it. I wanted to keep watching it but he hated it. So we took it off and saw something else. Weeks/months later after watching his regular podcast, he suddenly wants to give it another chance bc he found out the creator/voice actor of the show is a comedian that his favorite podcast host likes. Am I a jerk for losing a bit of respect in him bc of the fact that he completely changed his opinion just because he now knows it's some dude another dude he likes likes? Lol he hasn't seen it again yet but now he's suddenly excited to rewatch what he already saw and made clear he did not like...not to mention that over the course of those months I suggested rewatching a couple times bc I thought if he gave it another chance he might like it. So I guess there's the added element of feeling like these celebrities' opinions are more important than his SO's too? He does this with a lot of things. It seems his opinion is one thing but after listening to other people rant about whatever he gets completely brainwashed. It's like he lacks critical thinking skills of his own or simply defaults to getting into what 'personalities' he likes tell him is likeable. I know we're all guilty of falling for different advertising tactics to a point but to completely change his mind about things bc someone else (not even a real person in his life at that) has a certain opinion on it makes me feel like I'm ultimately stuck with whoever's trending's opinions rather than my SO's. Am I weird for this? How do I get him to express his own opinions rather than be a walking rendition of what he hears on a podcast? Am I missing something here?",

      "description": "Before judging me, please listen to why I have to say. It was the heat of the moment and I genuinely feel bad for doing that, and I know it is such a trashy thing for me to do, but I also have my reasons. \n\nShe barely cares and listens to the family. Whenever she comes home from work, she will start shouting and hurting my father emotionally. One time she started calling my father useless and that he does not work for the family. The thing is, my father has been tiredly looking for a job and been through much hardship working day and night and yet, my mother does not care about his feelings. She works for many hours and I know she gets stressed out sometimes, but she shouldn't treat my father like shit and care less about his feelings. The dispute between my parents are getting worse and worse and they started to shout at each other. If someone does not help , a divorce may happen soon. And I am just a 15 year old boy who really really do not want my family to separate. \n\nMy mother never listens to what I have to say. When I tell her everything my father has put through, she shrugs it off because she never treats me with respect. She cares about me, but what she doesn't notice is that she is giving me a broken family. \n\nToday, we were just having our meal with one of her friends(the people she gives a shit about) and then I broke. I called her a mean bitch and ran home. \n\nAfter saying that, I felt really really bad and heartbroken. I have never treated my mother like that but I really couldn't carefully process my thoughts then. But by doing that, I hope she can finally feel what my family is going through. My father is  depressed and she does not know that. (she is never home with us) Yet, she keeps berating him and does not treat him like family. I feel that by doing this, I can improve the situation. I really do not want my parents to separate. One time my mother was being so mean and hurtful that my father slapped her and then moments later, they started throwing items at each other until I had to call the police. I don't want that to happen again. I really don't. I am doing whatever I can right now to fix this. ",

      "description": "Ok so this happened earlier today. To have a bit of  background a guy and I have been friends for around 5 years, but in the last year I've noticed he is acting in a weird way: he's a constant show off and very dramatic, always calling for attention, but it doesn't look like he even notices. I have talked with him about this a couple of times but he never really listened and just continued being this way, acting as if he was above anyone. Again, I don't really know if he is aware of it. As a result I've been quipping at him because I don't really like these kind of people. I don't mean it in a bad way and we've been friends for a long time so we have enogh trust to joke this way.\n\nSo this afternoon I was pretty frustrated after a lesson I hadn't understood (I have a short temper), he was, as usual, speaking very loudly, almost shouting, so I told him to shut up. To be honest I said it in a rude way because I was irritated and highly irritable. He came over and told me that I wasn't entitled to be rude to people because I didn't understand a lesson, and he was right on this part. He said it roughly too. Then he just began rambling about how I always have a shitty attitude and how I was starting to be a pain in his ass (I guess having a shitty attitude is the same as not saying \"yes\" to everything he says). So then I told him he had been a pain in my ass for a while now. I can't really remember what he said afterwards, but it was something about me always ticking him off and shit talking him. I didn't really say much else. He just kept rambling about that and about how that was over and stuff. It came to a point when some people had to stand in front of him and I think he would have punched me. I was pretty puzzled after that and felt like a bully, but when I asked a different friend about it he said I didn't do anything he said I did. So AITA?",

      "description": "I’ve known this woman for almost 2 years now, she (29) reached out on Facebook after I (F 22) started talking to a roommate of hers I vaguely knew from when I worked at a mall.\n\nShe had started off really nice, but definitely overshared a lot in the first few months. I eventually joined a discord server she ran with her two roommates and everything was great! I was excited to meet new people and have more options for conversation.\n\nWell, within about 3 months of joining this discord, things took a sharp turn. She told me she loved me, that she needed me in her life, I treated her better than her previous partners, she wanted to follow me overseas.\n\nThis is where shit went down. \n\nShe got worse mentally after being ghosted and everyone looked to me to make sure she was okay. I had only met this woman 3 times max in person at this point.\n\nIt got to a point where everyone thought we were dating. She was telling people we were dating, including my coworkers and boss. This was a major problem for me because it’s not true.\n\nI told her to stop saying that because it’s not true at all. She did, for awhile.\n\nThings took a much weirder turn when she started discussing marriage and such. I said I would be moving abroad, we live in the US, and she immediately started giving me ways she could follow me. \n\nThat’s how she said it. “I’m going to follow you wherever you go because I need you in my life and I’d be dead if it wasn’t for you.”\n\nEmotionally I’m drained. I want to just drop her and ignore this woman completely. She’s crossed boundaries, embarrassed me in front of my coworkers and friends, makes these comments about how I’ll never be able to get rid of her because she needs me. \n\nI’m kind of scared that if I do cut her out completely, something will happen and they look it on me. Just last night she sent me a text, after I removed myself from the server and blocked her on just about everything, asking if this was an April Fool’s day prank because she has extreme abandonment issues and couldn’t handle someone else leaving her.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to drop this woman? I’m in college full time and my work hours fluctuate between part time and nearly full time because it’s retail. I can’t keep being the bearer of her burdens but nearly all of her partners have sent me something along the lines of, “Just don’t hurt her, she loves you.” \n\nIt seems like my feelings don’t matter to her. Every time I bring up issues it’s always turned into something going back to previous issues or her mental health is bad, she won’t take responsibility for anything that happens. I have bipolar, I know how it is, but she’s on a completely different level than me. \n\nI’m just so tired of these expectations everyone has set for me.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "We are both college students (20M, 21F) and have been dating for almost 1.5 years. We are pretty serious but stuff like engagement and things like that are nowhere near our future (need to graduate and get jobs ect). I'm still dependent on my parents but she is almost completely independent (pays for everything herself with the exception of having her car and phone from high school).\n\n\nFor context, her dad is not a good person. My girlfriend grew up with verbal abuse and to this day gets judged for going to college (shes the only one in her immediate family to go) and not staying at home living with them. Her step-brother for example lives at home and in general doesn't do much with his life. Her dad is also a narcissist and just an asshole in general (racist, sexist southern dude). Her stepmom can be nice sometimes, but when she doesn't get her way can act pretty childish and do things like give people the silent treatment. \n\n\nThis evening her dad, stepmom, sister and sister's boyfriend are having their first big food truck event. Live music, lots of people and other food trucks there. Initially my girlfriend wanted to go with her friends and I but after her friends told her no we decided we wouldn't go either. Its also not the kind of event we enjoy going too, we both hate crowds and loud music. After telling her sister that she wasn't going to go, sister told us that the parents were not happy about it and were mad she wasn't going to come. Earlier today she tells me that she is going and that she wants me to come. She changed her mind because even though she still doesn't want to go, she is only going to make her parents happy and that it would just be easier to go and avoid them being asses about it later. That's fine by me, I do things that make my parents happy too, but her parents are not my parents and I've been clear from the beginning that I didn't want to attend (even when she wanted her friends to go I didn't want to). She at one point said \"Are you really gonna make me go by myself?\" and I said \"I didn't make you change your mind\". \n\n\nIf it was an important event to her I would go. Holidays for example I'm OK with seeing her family because its important to her. But she didn't want to go to this event in the first place and has tried to rope me into it from the beginning. Looking for a reality check. AITA?",

I didn't want to be near him since he's the fucking worst. \n\nAfter my sister convinced me, I hoped he would leave me alone while I helped decorate, but he started bugging me immediately. I sat down on the couch and he started kicking my legs. He laughed and told me to start helping my sister, and he kicked me so I'd get off my phone. I was already in a shitty mood, but I wasn't interested in standing around a tree while he bullies me, since this isn't my first time with him. I got up and left, called him an asshole and a dick. He then promptly blew the fuck up, and while angrily laughing, demanded to see \"what was so important\" on my phone and said this over and over, while my mother pleaded him to stay away from me, and held him back from the doorway. My sister and mother then left after he finished raving about me with pretty much every swear known to man. My sister and mother are now not talking to me, because \"I shouldn't have made him angry.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I swore at my father after he started bugging me while I sitting on the couch.

      "description": "A little background; When I was 16 years old, I was staying the night at my moms friends daughters house. She was 22 I believe. She invited me over to hang out and spend the night. I specifically remember drinking a Smirnoff ice that night. It was the third time I had ever drank under age and I was nervous about it cause I didn’t want to get in trouble. I felt like my mom would swing by and check on us at anytime. Anyway was married and had her two-year-old little boy living with her but her husband had been staying somewhere else. This night though, him and his brother decided to sneak into the house. I was immediately uncomfortable cause they didn’t even knock but chose to sneak in through the sliding door on the patio. They were still married and had a baby together so it made no sense. I told them I was going to sleep on the couch and I’ll see her in the morning. Soon after she and her husband went to their room. I could hear the brother walking around, stepping out to smoke and when he came back in he pulled my blanket off and got on top of me. He grabbed my hands and did what he had planned to do the whole time telling me shh and “I’m sorry”. I kept saying please stop and no while crying. When he got off I ran to the bathroom and he went to their room, grabbed his brother and they left. I didn’t tell her what happened. The next morning when my friend that had planned to get me the next day came, he knew something was wrong. He wouldn’t stop hassling me so I broke and told him. He took me straight to the hospital. It only got worse from there. My mom’s (yes both of them) showed up about the same time as a police officer. He asked me what happened in an irritated tone. I told him as he barely looked at me wrote in his book. He asked had I been drinking, I said yes I had had that one Smirnoff ice. He shut his book and told my mother if she were my kid she’d be in a whole lot of trouble at home. \nMy Mom’s did just that. They said get dressed, they didn’t even have an exam done, and they took me home. They grounded me to my room for a month. I sat in my room feeling like I was drowning everyday. I can’t believe I survived myself then. I don’t know which pain was worse, the attack or the aftermath. \nSo forward 16 years later and my mother had posted almost daily on FB about Ford and she must be believed and all this. It brought back all of this for me. My mother doesn’t know Ford, has no connection with this woman but was actively supporting everything about her. Calling for the investigation but wouldn’t even help her 16 yo child get their own. My heart feels like it’s been ripped outt my chest again, chomped up and spit out. I don’t know if I should say anything to her about it. Seems pointless anyway with someone who’s own child means that much to them. But this resentment is eating at my soul. ",

      "description": "A bit of back story before I begin.\n\n I've just entered \"Liceum\" (I guess the American highschool?), and I've met new people, one of them is the main character of this long and boring story.\n\nSo there's a boy in my class, really nice and caring guy. In the beginning of the school year I didn't really talk with him, but since September he's been my go to friend in class. \n\nAt first he didn't really talk a lot about himself, but neither did I so I didn't think much of it. After a few weeks he started continuously saying that he's sad and that he can't sleep, I was there to help him, and talk with him because he didn't exactly have a lot of friends, I didn't try to diagnose him or really try telling him to do anything, I was just there to listen and reassure him.\n\nLike all teenage boys, our conversations gravitated towards girls, and I told him that one girl caught my eye, then he directly proceeds to text her and tell her to meet up with me on a date. I obviously get mad and tell him to not do that every again. He apologises and says they he won't.\n\nA few days later, while I'm texting with my best friend, he asks who I'm texting. When I told him her name, he immediately texts her to go on a date with me, she's very prone to anxiety attacks, and has one because of this (used to have a huge crush on her, asked her out, she said no, she feels really bad about it because she convinced herself that's why I had mental health issues). \n\nI obviously get very pissed at him and ask him wtf is he doing. He said that he's just trying to help me and that he thought that I want to be with her. I essentially told him to fuck off from my love life and that he said he wouldn't do anything like that. \n\nHe apologises and says that he hasn't ever had any friends and just wants me to be happy. I tell him that I don't think I want him as my friend if he's going to behave like that. He says ok.\n\nA couple weeks later (today) he does it again, this time writing to one of my friends I met at a party. I told him to fuck off, for good. A few minutes later, a mutual friend started texting me saying that I'm a dick and that my now former friend is crying and contemplating suicide.\n\nTldr; friend wants good, slips up 3 times, I tell him to fuck off and now he is contemplating suicide. AITA?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Me and my (now ex) best friend had a recent fallout out, mainly due to her lying/hiding things from me. \n\nFor some backstory;\nI built her a gaming PC back in August for her birthday, after wanting one just like mine. I did, out of generosity. After a while, she slowly stopped talking to me, hanging out, or even playing games with me. She got addicted to a game called \"VRchat\". She met some dude on there and started dating him, via the game. After that, she told me (because of her dating this guy) she doesn't really want to play with me or hang out with me anymore. I told her that I want my things back that I bought for her then, seeing as I was essentially being tossed away. I calmly asked her to return the Monitor I had lent her, and upon asking, she called me a selfish cunt, then blocked me on every form of social media. I got my monitor back, but only because I had asked her cousin to tell her that if she didn't return it, I would take her to court. She quickly gave it up the next day.\n\nNow, I want my other things back from her, including two 8GB RAM sticks, a headset, the keyboard/mouse I had lent her, and some clothes I had kept there in case I stayed the night. So, would I be an asshole, to go and take back my items? Without the RAM sticks, her PC won't even start, which would pretty much kill her relationship with her new boyfriend. Without the headset, she wouldn't be able to talk to him anyway, even if I don't take the RAM, and without the keyboard/mouse, well, she can't even log on her PC. \n\nAm I an asshole for wanting my shit back, while also inadvertently ruining her long distance relationship?",

      "description": "There’s a little backstory to this one so please bear with me. A few months ago I was out with my girlfriend, her brother and, and her roommate having a picnic on my college campus. We are kicking a soccer ball around and some guy walks up to us and asks if he can join in - sure, no problem. The more he talks, the weirder he gets. He starts to brag about how he’s “been intimate” with 14 women since he got here earlier in the year (which he later defines as kissing) and is obviously interested in my gf and her roommate. He also tells us how he’s disappointed that America isn’t like it is in the movies where all the girls want to sleep with you all the time. Apart from the weird comments he’s also generally socially awkward. When we finally decide that it’s time to leave my girlfriend asks for his phone number and we all part ways. I asked her why she got his number and she said that she felt bad for him because he just seemed really lonely and he’s in a new place all by himself so he probably doesn’t have any friends. I feel the need to say here that I trust her and I don’t think she’d ever cheat on me, she can just be very niave/oblivious at times. After a week or so the now five of us get lunch on campus together (just as awkward but I’ll spare you the reading) and pretty much stop having contact with him after that other than him making a few more attempts to make plans with us by texting my gf and a happy New Years text followed up by another request to make more plans that ended up in limbo as well. Well today, months later, my gf texted me saying that she’s getting coffee with him alone. I’m pretty upset by this because we’ve talked about how she doesn’t realize some guys take being friendly as flirty (and she’s a very friendly person) and specifically about how this guy seems really desperate. She says there’s nothing wrong with it because it’s “obviously not a date” but I’m still pretty upset. AITA or am I being too up tight about this?",

      "description": "So me and my friend go to Europe last year for about twelve days. It’s mostly a hiking/sightseeing trip so we’re doing a lot of driving to go from trail to trail cause it’s our first time in Europe and we want to see as much as possible. \n\nMy friend drove the entire way because we didn’t want to add on the extra driver cost. We were both cool with this situation cause she loves driving and I don’t. Plus we save a lotttt or money. In turn, I planned the entire trip. From researching all the potential viewpoints and trails, emailing huts for a sleeping spot, booking hotels,etc. Planning a trip for 12 days took me a very long time. Which I was okay with since she was driving a lot. \n\nSo for the first few days, she was speeding like a manic which she always does when she drives. I tell her to stop speeding repetitively (cause I’m a pretty safe driver and we’re in a foreign country’s)but she’ll start speeding like 10 minutes later or when I fall asleep. I noticed the cameras on the third day and I told her. Turns out Europe has a lot of speeding cameras. So she finally stops speeding for the entire trip cause she’s paranoid. \n\nAlmost a year later, she gets the first ticket and it’s $600. She asks me to split it with her but I really don’t want to. I told her many times to stop speeding but she never listened. And the ticket is for over 15 kmph and not just a  5kmph. So I don’t think I should have to pay for her recklessness. In the end, I ended up paying her $150 cause she was bugging me daily for it. \n\nBut I feel angry about the entire situation. If I had a speeding ticket and I was driving with friends, I would never ask for them to help since it was my fault. I feel like she thought this was different cause we were in a different country. If it was something that was out of our control then I would be down to split half.\n\nAITA for not wanting to split any part of the speeding ticket? ",

      "description": "I am 23, my fiancee is 21, and we are getting married in August. Her twin sister is the maid of honour and planning all the bachelorette activities. For her bachelorette party, my fiancee and her 5 bridesmaids are going to Las Vegas for a 4 day long weekend trip. They are watching a lot of shows, magic shows, talent shows, and even a show featuring Australian male strippers. \n\nI talked to my fiancee and told her I was okay with all their events, but the male stripping show was definitely a no go. She said its \"no big deal\" and that it's pretty much just a bunch of guys dancing on stage. She said \"it's not like I'm getting a lapdance or anything\". I said that I still wasn't comfortable with it. I asked her if she would be okay with me going to a stripclub for my bachelor party (I'm not), but she said that's different. She said a show is very different from a strip club. She said its all very classy. \n\nI also talked to her sister, the planner, and she said I'm overreacting. Her boyfriend, one of the groomsmen, was also iffy about the whole thing. We would never go to an event featuring naked ladies. For my bachelor party, we're just going to a hockey game and having dinner. \n\nAm I an asshole for putting my foot down? They haven't booked anything yet, just made an itinerary. My GF is NOT the type to cheat at all, but I'm just not okay with the idea of her watching dudes strip on stage. ",

We'd hang out a lot and he was always looking out for me and vice versa--a 'best friend'. Anyway, I left the state but went back to visit for spring break so of course I reached out. I told him that we definitely have to make some plans together. Now, some context, I am currently a criminal justice major and I committed a crime in high school that really put into perspective how one small thing can really derail your entire life so I've been especially careful around my friends since most of them use illicit drugs. They're really good people so I don't cut them off just because of that choice they just all know not to do that stuff around me. \n\nAnyway, I hear that he is planning to bring some weed with him when we go to meet up. He says he won't smoke around when I'm around but I know it will be on him in the car. I did not want to even be around the stuff  so I kind of went off on him about how he's my bro but the choices that he makes make me not want to hang out with him atit kind of resonated with me when he called me fake. He tells me I'm fake and says that I only talk to him when I need a favor or something which is definitely not the case. It hurt but I cleared it up as best as I can. We stopped talking but then I reached out to him and told him that I really wish he didn't feel that way because it wasn't the case and it was solely because of the drugs that I didn't want to hang out with him. We are now friends again. \n\nEven though we're cool now and I believe that  my reasons were just, I still can't help but feel like a dick regarding the way I went about it. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "     I'm in high school and I have two friends Liz and May. May and Liz have been friends all their lives. I met them both this school year. They have been in many disagreements. One where Liz did not like May's boyfriend so May would talk about how Liz should grow up and get along with him because he has been nothing but nice and respectful. Once Liz heard from a friend about it, she would insist whenever May came to our lunch table that all of us were expected to get up and leave. \n    They did make up but eventually May had talked to a friend Carrie about how Liz was a 'little annoying at times, way too protective over her boyfriend, and how toxic it was for them to be together.' (She has been insanely cold towards her boyfriend and others) Carrie told Liz and she freaked. She wouldn't tell May she was mad at her and whenever she saw May she would get up and expect us to go to the other side of the cafeteria. (It was a big place)\n     This went on for a 3 weeks before I decided I'd had enough and that if Liz was not going to tell May what the issue was I wasnt going to move. So I stayed when Liz, her boyfriend, Carrie, and her other friend got up and left. We have a small friend group so only three people went with liz but because I stayed everyone else did to. Me, May, and three others. Once we finished lunch that day we went to the library on campus and I talked to her about the situation. I told her that she shouldn't trust Carrie and that she did tell Liz about what she had said about her. \n       At one point I was walking out when Carrie said how I hurt Liz by leaving. When liz was telling my boyfriend I was a Traitor ass bitch. I told her I has only sticking to what I thought was right and try hat they should work it out themselves. She then told me May had said stuff about me but would not tell me what she said. Only telling me said had talked shit about me once. I walked away after that. \n      Liz would still hang out with us but when lunch came the four of them would go to the other side of the cafeteria. This went on for a about 2 weeks. We would be together for breakfast, on the bus, and 4th period. But after the 2 weeks she stopped hanging around anyone from the rest of the group. May had told me about how Liz would talk about everyone else behind their backs to Carrie but never told anyone else but May about what she said about her. \n     Carrie was basically the messenger between the two of them but would constantly take Liz's side. So we stopped associating and she cut off any of her friends that would hang out with any of us. I wrote them a note and gave it to her boyfriend and told him to read it before he showed the girls. I basically said if Carrie is the problem in his relationship since he had asked my boyfriend that question out of the blue once. And basically saying I didn't like how this was going and that Liz should handle it better. \n \n       She then even made her boyfriend stop being friends with mine. Now to present day she talks about me and makes her group tell my boyfriend lies about how I'll leave him for one of my friends. She has tried to hit one of my friends and even shoved me into another person we were trying to get around in the locker room this being two days  ago my shoulder and neck still hurt. Liz is a small girl around 4 something but does pack a punch especially when mad. \n\nSo I just want to ask AITA for not being friends with someone who I believe over reacted.\n\nTLDR; May calls my friend Liz a little annoying and now Liz wont associate with anyone who hangs out with her or me because I 'took her side' by sitting with May at lunch.

      "description": "(Doing this on my phone, btw, sorry for any bad format)\n\nSo when I was around 13-14 I had been going into my neighbor's field (I'll call him Phil) for fun. I just walked around and didnt really do anything past that. Then I saw a hunting trap. This was to stop things like rabbits that would get into his field.\n\nSo I kicked it a lot, but it didnt break or anything. Theeeen my friend/other neighbor Cody told me about what happened to his dog, because of Phil. I didnt know if he was telling the truth, but he said Phil shot Cody's dog for going on his property. I assumed it was true, and was piiiiiiissed.\n\nSo I started kicking my neighbor's stuff more as revenge for my friend (I had no life, as you can tell), and tried to even get it hidden in the plants in the tree line...then I found the tree stands.\n\nIf you dont know what that is, it's a platform that's attached to a tree, off the ground, that normally has a ladder. They're used for hunting and without being spotted by deer and stuff. Phil's was a metal one.\n\nSo I started...messing with it (he had more than one but I didnt know at the time). I got small hedge clippers and stuff to cut the ropes attached to the  bottom of the ladder. They didnt really do anything though, and he would probably notice that they were broken.\n\nThere was this very small man made 'pond' that was basically a sinkhole a few yards long, directly next to the tree stand basically, and filled with brown, muddy water. So, with hedge clippers that I used as a screw driver, I unscrewed the lower half of the ladder, picked it up, and threw the ladder into the water, letting it sink to the bottom. He probably will never find it unless he goes into that muddy, gross water, and looks through it. \n\nThat was it. I messed with a guy's property, for something that might not even be true, and against a guy who was supposedly an asshole to his neighbors.",

      "title": "AITA if I keep this cat?",
      "description": "So I live with my girlfriend and my friend/roommate in an apartment. Last week I opened my front door and scared the shit out of this cat, I felt bad and was like “oh shit, sorry buddy” and went on with my day. The next night it was cold and rainy and I started to hear some meowing from outside my door. I opened the door and this cat just strolls on in to my apartment. I thought it was funny at first and gave her some pets and some milk. It turns out this is the nicest cat I have ever met and she immediately became bonded to me. There’s no way she wasn’t someone’s pet before. I sat on the couch and she came up purring and immediately took a nap on my lap. She is actually perfect. My roommate hates cats so I tried to send her outside but every time I did that she would just wait on the doorstep for me to let her back in. I did not have the heart to not let her sleep inside. My roommate was a little upset about that but it was ok because it’s just a couple days.\n\nMe and my girlfriend took her to the vet, and it turns out she has no chip but is otherwise a healthy and normal cat. She is just the sweetest thing. \nI’ve posted on Craigslist and lost pet Facebook groups and scoured and looked for lost pet posts and I cannot find anything for this cat. \n\nI’ve been trying to find a friend to maybe agree to foster her for 6 months so my girlfriend and I could get her once we move out of the apartment with my roommate in it, but no one is coming through so far. It’s coming to the point where I either have to put her in a shelter(which is what my roommate probably would prefer) or try to convince my roommate to let her stay at our place and keep her primarily in my room. But I just feel like a huge asshole asking him this because I know he doesn’t want her and even if he agreed maybe he’d be agreeing begrudgingly and I hate creating a toxic atmosphere with the people I live with. But I love this cat so much. She has stolen my heart and she cuddles with me and puts her paw on me when I’m sad and I’ve named her Luna and honestly having her around makes my depression and anxiety about 20-40% better.\n\nBut yeah. My roommate does not want the cat, I know he hates cats because I guess every cat has been a dick to him in his life, and he’s not allergic but it is against the apartment policy to have pets though it is super unenforced and there are like 10 dogs in the complex barking all day. I hate asking him to let me break the rules so I can have her. But every time I imagine bringing her to a shelter my heart just hurts so much and I get really anxious.\n\nIt’s now been like 4 days of anxiety and my girlfriend and I have been hanging out at my parent’s place with the cat and I had hoped to get her somewhere by now but have to go back to the apartment now and I still have this cat.\n\nAm I the asshole if I try to convince my roommate to let me keep this cat? Or at least until her owner contacts me or I can find another solution?",

And my friend and the enemy meet and do their thing while I stand more on the outskirts waiting for them, keep in mind all I have done was fist bumped the person. However a week later the best friend I’ve been friends with for 5yrs texts me, saying “I heard you were with (enemy). Ik I don’t have any control over that and I know you probably didn’t think of it as an issue but I do think that was crossing a line of respect and fucked up.” And I told him nah I didn’t hang with enemy, we just met up with enemy bc one of my friends was getting something from him. And I told my best friend that this argument was childish since he is gettin mad about me fist bumping him, and he kept saying how it’s disrespectful and such that I did. And now he’s saying it’s whatever and he will not see me the same as he once did.\n\nTl;dr  My best friend says it’s disrespectful and a ass move that I fist bumped his enemy. ",

      "description": "I regret this alot. Last year on halloween there was this kid that was dressed up like quasimodo. His outfit was really good , including a wig and some makeup. You would think he's just a \"normal\" kid with a really good costume.\n\nI noticed he loved showing everyone his costume. So i went over and complimented him on it, after which he kept making weird noises like \"ooff\" and \"durr\" and tried to \"scare\" me for a while. At first it was kind of funny, but he just wouldnt stop. After a while i told him to leave multiple times.\n\nEventually i got quite mad and just walked away. A couple minutes later though he was suddenly behind me, screaming a really loud \"DURRR\" while making a very weird face. I kind of lost control and beat him up. Not too bad, but i did land some fists on his face and body. He ran off screaming and panicking, still making these weird \"Durr\" and \"ooff\" noises. I then realised it wasnt an act.\n \nLater that night someone told me the kid had down syndrome. I cringe everytime i think about it and feel really bad.",

      "description": "I have an older sister, Z, and our mother is K. Z has her own house and husband, and I am still living with our mother. Earlier this week, my mother noticed me buying a bunch of skincare products, and commented that she wanted some of her own. I told her next week Thursday (payday) I could take her out and buy her some of her own products for her to use, and we could get dinner together too. She happily said Ok.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Saturday, I texted my sister to ask her if she wanted to go out to lunch (my treat), because I just returned home from a 3 month holiday in America. Z agreed. Z and my mother don't have a good relationship right now. My mother made some off comment as we were walking out the door \"Oh the rich people are leaving the poor to go out to lunch\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not spend that much on my sister, I only spent about $20 on her lunch in total. Nowhere near the allocated $150 I plan to spend (and still plan to spend) on my mother next Thursday. During our lunch my sister confided in me her financial problems, and her struggles to have children because she simply can't afford all her bills, mortgage, and a child. Z told me she feels she can't talk about this to our mother, because our mother doesn't understand and blames it on the husband. We talked a bit about our problems over lunch then I did a bit of shopping, and then we returned home. While shopping I bought my mother some bread treats from a bakery that she likes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got home, I handed her the treats, told her I bought them for her, and she said nothing to me. She still hasn't said anything to me, and it's the next day. My stepfather dropped me off at the train station so I could go to work, and he said it was rude of me to not take my mother out too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like because I already told her I would hang out with her on Thursday, that hanging out with my sister alone yesterday should not be a big deal. When I take my mother out alone, my sister doesn't complain, so why does my mother complain when I take my sister out?\n\nSo reddit, AITA in this situation?",

      "description": "(Im female, he's male, both young and first relationship for both, we were about 3 months in I think)\n\nWe were horsing around, I tend to let myself go limp when we're playing as kinda a joking thing. I'll go limp and fall onto him, or like just go limp and roll around idk. It's always in jest. I hit my head a bit when I do this depending on where we're playing around- he doesn't like it when I hit my head at all ever, it freaks him out cause he used to get head injuries when he was young.\n\nwe were on this carpet thing and we were playing around. Our sleep schedule has been off, I was a bit tired and school was starting up so we were stressed a little too, at least I was. But as we were playing and when I decided to go limp I missed the carpet and hit my head on the floor. It hurt a little, I was a bit dazed (probably also cause I was tired) but I also didn't make a big deal- it was kinda funny in my head, whatever. \n\nHe kinda pulled me up to a sitting position and was asking if I was ok (I hope Im wording this right, this is fuzzy almost). I said my head hurt, he was responding with something idk. I leaned forward and limped my head downward, idk why, I guess I tend to lean into him a lot, but also when I do that I go limp too, idk why its stupid but Idk if I was trying to just lean into him for comfort or if i was fucking around again. I was tired I guess, but it was maybe a mix of those two. \n\nbut the moment I like leaned forward and let my head down limply he said something like, \"You shouldn't let your neck go limp like that\" and I suddenly felt him hit me lightly on the face. It wasn't hard enough to leave a mark or sound or even hurt really, but it was hard enough to move my head to the side and I was really stunned. He immediately freaked out, said sorry. I said something like, you've never hit me like that before and he said yeah I know. Idk im a very scared person (I grew up in a household with a lot of fighting- I've seen parents hit eachother). Me and this guy have a very very physical relationship (both are sadomasochists in the bedroom, and outside of the bedroom we love to roughhouse and hit eachother pretty hard but always playfully). But when he hit me here it was a shock because we both knew it was different and not playful.\n\nWe were both stunned, we then sat together and talked about it for hours. We're very good at communicating, and I ended up going home to think alone for the night. Then I ended up breaking up with him a day later. I was gonna give him a chance, he came up with a plan- an outlet for pent up emotions, he was gonna work out every day and I was going to do it too. It seemed good, he seemed willing to work on himself. But I was still scared, I don't know why. I talked with my sister and my cousin and they said I should leave and never go back, but I feel horrible. Really really really horrible. I care about this guy so much and he feels terrible. He came to pick up his stuff from my place and apologized to my sister to her face for hurting me. We both cried a lot when saying goodbye.\n\nI've never felt this way about anyone and he said the same. He's devastated and so am I. What's most confusing is that this happened out of random.. We never fought before, he is the nicest guy, we're so similar and we are so good at communicating. We never had any issues and despite our interests and physical nature I've never been scared of him ever. I wish this had a buildup but it didn't. It feels like it just happened so randomly, and it did. It shocked the fuck out of me and I feel like I had no time to process it. He says he didn't do it out of anger, he doesn't know exactly why he did it, it just sort of happened. He thinks it was out of fear and not knowing what to do. \n\nI feel like shit. I don't know if I made a hasty decision. I just feel horrible.\n Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So my younger brother is flying out tomorrow morning to go visit my mom for Thanksgiving. He’s driving down from college tonight and staying with me, and in the morning I’m supposed to drive him to the airport. The thing is, I work 12hrs a day, 5 days a week, so I have to be up by 5:00am to be at work by 6:30am to not get home until about 7-8pm. He needs to be at the airport by 4:15am so we’d need to get up at like 3:00am. I also have to pick him up from where he’s leaving his car(my apartment complex won’t let him leave his car here for a week) at 11:00pm tonight. Doing all this, I just feel like I will not be able to handle my 12hr shift tomorrow, as it’s pretty physically demanding, I’m just worried I’ll be exhausted. I was thinking about calling him a Lyft in the morning, but I’m worried that I will hurt his feelings. He and I have a bit of a strained relationship in that we both love each other but we often butt heads and fighting. This makes us both sad and he in particular sometimes feel like I think of him as a nuisance and am annoyed by him. For example he was initially not planning on staying with me tonight because he was worried he would “be in my way” I assured him this was not true and he was welcome over anytime, but the fact that he felt that way can be kind of telling about our relationship. I love my brother and I want him to know that, but would I be the asshole if I didn’t drive him to the airport tomorrow? I don’t want his feelings hurt, thinking I just pawned him off because I didn’t want to deal with him.",

For most of the stops, the door opens on the right side in the direction of travel with two stations that open on the left early on. \n\nI get on at the first of those two left side stations. Since I am riding the train for several stops, including past a few which are quite busy for people getting on/off, I generally try to get the spot just inside the left side doors along the divider. It not only provides teh most stability but also prevents you from getting overly squished when the train gets super crowded. \n\nToday, as we were approaching the second of the left opening stations, some guy stared me down waiting for me to move to allow people to get off train; however, there was a second lane next to me to get off which was clear. When I didn't move, he said \"This a\\*\\*hole won't move\", then pushed me as he went by. No one else had any trouble getting on or off the train (only 2 people got off in total). \n\nIn general, I do move if there are a significant number of people getting on or off. \n\nWho is in the wrong?",

      "description": "Last night, I got drinks and caught up with my friend (let’s call her Susan), as we hadn’t seen each other in a few months (we go to different colleges, so we don’t get to see each other often). Susan told me that she and her boyfriend of 6 months just got engaged.\n\nA little bit about Susan… she’s a very sweet person, but she sort of has a self-destructive behavior. She does a lot of drugs, hops from guy to guy, and has run into some trouble with the law, among other activities. Overall, I just don’t think she’s that mature of a person.\n\nBack to the conversation… after she told me, I started laughing, and asked if she was joking. She said she was not, and she started to get offended and asked me why I would laugh. I told her that her getting married at her age, at that point in her life (after all that she juggles), was one of the biggest mistakes she’s ever made. Then, I asked her what her plans were after they were engaged. She said that she and her SO will finish their respective degrees, graduate from college, find work, and move in together.\n\nShe started to cry, asking me why I couldn’t just be happy for her. I assured her that I am, and that I wish her nothing but happiness because that’s what I want out of my friends. I’ve only met the guy once; he seemed… fine, from the one interaction I had with him.\n\nI eventually apologized and said, “What I said before was just my opinion, you don’t have to listen to it. I just don’t think this is a good idea, but if you’re happy and you know for a fact that you’re ready, then that’s great. I’m happy for you, and wish you nothing but the best. I expect Christmas cards.”\n\nI don’t think she wanted to talk to me anymore that, because a few minutes later, she said, “I’m gonna head out, good seeing you.”\n\nNarrator: “It was not good seeing him.”\n\nI called her earlier this morning to check in on her, but she didn’t pick up. Then, I called her again this afternoon, and left her a voicemail telling her that I’m sorry for my initial reaction, that I wish nothing but the best for her and her SO, and that I’ll hopefully catch up with her again soon.\n\nSo, after reading all of this, AISTA (am I still the asshole?)\n\ntl;dr my self-destructive 19-year-old friend is getting engaged to her SO of 6 months, I laughed thinking it was a joke, she gets mad at me for not being supportive.",

      "description": "I love my dog to bits, but she’s an absolute menace and I hate to admit I’ve grown terrified of her. She’s bitten me more times than I can count in the past few years, and each time my mother insists I must have done something or that my dog is sick — she does have some medical problems, but nothing that could cause aggression. Most of the time she is a happy, sweet dog. But she gets aggressive sometimes and has given me multiple scars on my arms and hands. My sister has these scars too. She is fourteen and I am eighteen, if it makes a difference, but it definitely happened to me when I was a minor, if that makes a difference. My grandpa is in his seventies and had to be taken to the emergency room last night because of how badly my dog injured him. He has gauze up both wrists. I am afraid to be in my own home with her, as I am typically the subject of the attacks (along with my grandpa and sister, obviously) and I am counting down the days until college so I don’t have to be cooped up in my room half the time. My mom just keeps taking her to the vet for her leg pain and not getting her a trainer or anything. \n\nWe’ve had this dog for years and I understand how much my mother loves her. She is up to dare on all her shots so other than the actual bite there’s no danger of her hurting us. My mom merely gives me essential oils to help with the scarring and disinfecting (which doesn’t work that I’ve seen. When she’s done I wash it off myself with soap and water and use Neosporin.) She is a loved family pet but she even went after my cat recently. She has never hurt anyone outside of the family.\n\nAm I the asshole for not sucking it up and dealing with the dog for my other family’s sake? Or am I justified in not wanting her in the house? Clearly I don’t want another owner to get hurt either, but I don’t know what else to even think about. Thanks. ",

However, we do visit that city every summer (my husband's family is from there) and because I got the save the date, I planned the trip around the wedding date so we could attend. Today I got the official invitation and only I am invited, but not my spouse of 5 years. She has met my spouse many times but they are not close. They get along fine though. I am guessing that she doesn't have enough space or doesn't want to pay for an additional meal, especially if she wasn't expecting me to come. However, I know the venue minimum is 100 guests so it's not a very small wedding. I have a couple friends going who's SOs are invited, and I have not heard of anyone else's spouse being excluded. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I clarified with the bride that my husband is not invited? It could possibly be oversight but he was not in the online system. It could have been me messing up the save the date but I think all I had to do was enter my mailing address so I'm not sure that's possible. I'm not sure if it would be rude to inquire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I didn't attend if he's not invited? WIBTA to my husband if I did attend? I will have friends there and although they will have their SOs, I'm sure I would still have a good time if I went. I have heard that it's rude to attend a wedding that your spouse is not invited to, although my husband would be slightly sad but support me going.   ",

Your driving around at 4 am when you frankly should not be driving. You live at home and randomly pass out and you have already hit your head and almost died from it. It is most likely safer for you and everyone involved if you do go to a home so you can get the help and medical observation you need.\n\nShe got really upset with me and just stormed out\n\nIm not a doctor or a psychologist but I really feel nothing that I said was wrong but most likely none of those things are going to happen she will live at home most likely till she accidentally dies or gets into a crash.\n\nI feel really bad for upsetting someone whos already miserable and in the end accomplished nothing doing so.\n\nSo... AITA for upsetting her?",

      "description": "I'm 21F, in college, and this all happened at our local college bar/club a few weekends ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was dancing with my friends and there were a bunch of other girls dancing on top of this table/bar area that was elevated. One pretty drunk girl was dancing wildly really close to me and I saw from a distance that this guy behind her was leering at her this whole time. Like he was looking at her like a piece of meat. It was pretty gross but he was far away so I didn't say anything. \n\nWell eventually he started kinda pressing up on her and she was so drunk she didn't even notice. He then put his hands on her hips and kinda grinding up on her, no form of asking her beforehand whatsoever. She's so out of it she's just moving to the music completely unaware this is happening. My friends and I start kinda giving funny looks to each other and I try to grab her hand to make her kneel down so I could ask her if she's ok. She shakes me off and just looks completely out of it. \n\nAt this point this guy is really getting into it, running his hands down her body now and her head is kinda slumped forward (hair covering her face) so my friends and I got worried and I grabbed her arm and tried to pull her down to the ground and away from him. Well, she was in like 4 inch heels so instead of stepping down, she DIVED. Like straight into the ground. She yells in pain and looks at me in anger and is like \"what the fuck do you think you're doing??\" \n\nShe ends up limping out and I find out later that she twisted her ankle and missed like a week of classes cause she couldn't walk. I felt bad but felt even worse when people started blaming me and calling me a creep. My friends came to my defense and tried to find the creepy guy but he was long gone by this time. AITA for trying to help this girl but ending up hurting her instead?",

      "description": "I'm a senior in university, and one of the features of our graduation photoshoot is a creative shot in addition to our formal picture. It's fairly common practice, and the rule with the creative shot is that anything goes (people have done nude shoots, messy shoots, all sorts. But I digress.). That said, I was thinking of wearing an Indian-themed or Indian-inspired ethnofusion type dress (not really a full on saree, perhaps something more akin to a Punjabi salwar suit) and applying henna on my hands for my creative shot.\n\nThe thing is, I am a brown-skinned Asian, but I am not Indian, nor do I have any Indian ancestry. However, I spent my formative years in a country wherein I was heavily influenced by Indian culture, and it was a norm to see people walking around in that traditional wear. As far as I'm concerned, what I plan to do is nothing but respectful and my way of paying homage to a country that has formed such a big part of my identity as well as the people there who raised me...but I worry that it may be perceived differently by my peers here at home. With the discussion of cultural appropriation being especially fiery nowadays, I'd rather not be accused of that and receive any flak. The picture will be published in our official yearbook, after all.\n\nMy few close friends who know of me and my background are in support of it, but I am hesitant to even ask our Indian family friends of their opinion on the matter as I'm not sure how they will react. So, WIBTA?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to contribute to my grandmother’s funeral?",
      "description": "I have been estranged from my biological father’s family for around 11 years now. While I am acquaintances via things like Facebook, I do not keep in touch nor communicate with them in any sort of regular way. They are an extremely large family (my father is 1 of 14) and I’ve only ever kept in touch with 1 set of uncle (father’s brother) and his wife. My father was absent and very abusive, lied for years about his relationship with me, mistreated my mother and neglected me entirely. To give you an example, when I was 13 I had surgery and he came to see me after my mother begged him to. When I asked him why he wasn’t around, he told me our lack of relationship was just as much my fault (if not more) than his. He would mistreat me to get back at my mother. Real stand up guy. I cut ties with him in high school, minus the occasional birthday text.\n\nMy grandmother, my father’s mother, passed away this week and the services are to be held in 2 weeks. Like my father, his brothers and sisters weren’t exactly the most welcoming and kind bunch. His sisters treated my mother horribly; they were a catty, self loathing group and made prolonging a relationship between them and I very difficult. For this reason, I only ever kept in touch with my one uncle because he knew they were toxic and also kept them at a distance.\n\nI got back in touch with one aunt (father’s sister) and my father this week due to the circumstances. The interactions were kind and I had begun planning on flying home (I’m 1900 miles away) to attend the services. I just got a text from at least 11 numbers I don’t recognize saying that as the “cousins”, we should contribute something to the services. From what I can gather, these are a few of my first cousins and they are asking for contributions in the form of food, drinks, plates, and so on. Being a large family, they need to supply enough for at least 200 people. I have a feeling a particular cousin is responsible, she’s the worst person I’ve ever had the displeasure of knowing. She would gloat about bullying girls in high school and exposed me to sexual things when I was way way too young to be able to handle it. She would hit my mom when no one was looking and lie through her teeth. She turned into an MLM loving, morbidly obese horrible woman. I have not responded to any of her messages in the past, most recently regarding my cross country move, and so I think she included me in this thread in order to try to get some kind of reaction.\n\nMy initial thought is fuck that. I don’t know these people. I don’t feel I owe them anything. I understand the financial stress of a funeral but I really didn’t know my grandmother apart from my young childhood. She was always kind to me but I certainly don’t think I deserve to be called a real “granddaughter” let alone help out for the funeral financially. Just like her children, she never reached out to me throughout the years and from what I heard, she cried when I wasn’t around. But you know, where was that effort to pick up the phone?\n\nI’m a bit in awe at the audacity. It’s no secret how my father treated me and lied throughout my life. I am a stranger to them and out of respect, I wanted to attend the services out of respect for my grandmother and my uncle and keep it moving. But now I’m even wondering if I should go.\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n",

No, they are not wrong for being afraid of rape and assault but I believe the fact that they sit around and dwell in these things compounds their fears.

It is a chapter based on a text where people feel a bit religion, written a long time ago. In it, there is a guy who has 100 sons, from one wife. I am a logical guy who looks at things from a scientific perspective, I figured it’ll be minimum 4000 months for that to happen. Another girl, who’s a bit entitled, says that they has “super powers” and “in that time, stuff like that happened”. The theory is that the wife had the kids at once, she couldn’t hold them so their eggs were transferred somewhere, where they would grow. OK. \n\nI said I respectfully disagreed. I said paraphrasing, I believe this is a legend, an amazing work of literature, and by no means something to be applied in real life. I said I believe in science as a religion, and strive for logical reasoning. \n\nShe then started saying how I should “look out of the textbook” and “get a life”. \n\nAnd then, I did something which makes me believe I am an asshole, and this sub will probably get offended, so brace yourselves.\n\nI questioned Christianity, specifically how Jesus’ mother, Mary was a virgin. I realized that Jesus was an angel. I apologized profusely, but I guess the damage was done. I apologized the next day as well, but was told I am an asshole.\n\nSo, AITA?",

Nobody I know is around to talk about it with me.\n\nI'm nearly 22. I still live with my mother. (I have reasons for still being here. One of them being that I'm a full-time student, and have a hard time working because of it.) Have y'all heard of r/raisedbynarcissists? I frequent that sub. My mother is not exactly the most reasonable person.\n\nIn the US it's tax season. I just finished some exams and whatnot, and this week is spring break, so I'm planning to try and look for jobs, clean my room - you know, that kind of thing. I haven't been thinking about my taxes, but yeah, I should do it this week when I have time.\n\nMy mother mentioned to me today, as soon as I woke up, that we needed to do my taxes. She also said she wanted me to come do them with her, so that I can learn (...say what you want about me not knowing how to do my taxes, I've been trying since high school), which is fair. I asked if we could do them another day, though be fair, I didn't really have a specific reason, if she had said something like \"we can do them later today\" I wouldn't have said no. She didn't say anything, though, so my mistake here was assuming that it was okay.\n\nI did some regular morning routine stuff. All of a sudden she told me she had finished my taxes and that I needed to come pay. She explained how much I needed to pay and that I'd get a refund. I was confused, because didn't she want me to help? But I went upstairs and got my credit card anyway. When I came back down she looked at my card, then at me, like I was an idiot, and told me that I needed my checkbook, too, even though she didn't say that and I can't remember ever needing my bank information (I always get mailed a check). This is where I started to get a little upset.\n\nI went upstairs to get my checkbook. When I came down, I admit that I got a little more upset than I needed to for a second. My mom and I both have hormonal problems so I had a small outburst, but I curbed it immediately. Well, the fact that I had an outburst at all caused my mother to freak out, and she started telling me I was ungrateful, that I only cared about myself, that I was rude, and she tossed my tax folder at me. I tried to get her to calm down and listen to why I was upset but, like I said, she is not the most reasonable woman. She told me to go away, and now she is ignoring me, like she usually does.\n\nI do feel bad for having an outburst over something so stupid, and if it were any of my friends, I would've apologized, we would've talked it out, my taxes would be done, and I wouldn't be here. But this is my mom, who refuses to ever accept my apologies and talk to me like an adult. So I really don't know if I'm in the wrong, or if she's being unreasonable. So Reddit...please judge me.",

      "description": "I’m 16.\nLast week my Grandma died. I was devastated and in a very bad and low spot for a few days. I told my friends this and they were checking in on me and consoling me. Just a few nights later I was stuck in a burning apartment building choking and gasping for air whilst having a panic attack. I was rushed to the hospital for smoke inhalation and they lowered my carbon monoxide level to a 3 (it was originally a 6) and then I was discharged.\n\nDespite everything going on and my mom telling me I should just stay home I still went to school deciding I need something healthy like learning to keep my brain occupied. I probably wasn’t going to sleep much and me staring at my charred and now vacant building wasn’t going to help me.\n\nI had already told my friends everything that had happened over text so they were aware of what had happened the night before. They knew what I knew and the rumors around our complex. Most importantly they knew I was currently homeless as of that night and I had nothing but the clothes on my back and my phone \n\nWhen I got to my classes they kept asking me how I was doing and if I was okay and I finally just snapped. Obviously I wasn’t okay. With everything going on. So I slightly rose my voice at them and said “why does everyone keep asking if I’m okay when I’m obviously not okay.” And we left it at that. I was quiet the rest of the day not feeling up for the day.\n\nJump back in to the following Monday. I get to class and I go to one of my friends and ask her how her weekend was. She literally ignored me. Its not like she didn’t know I was talking to her. I looked right at her and spoke loudly and clearly and she didn’t even acknowledge me.\n\nI thought it was weird, but I brushed it off My other friend told me we needed to talk after class and was very short with me so I thought that was definitely weird. \n\nWhen class ended they confronted me and said “on friday when you yelled at us I don’t think that was right. We were just asking how you were and trying to be good friends and we really don’t think it was necessary for you to do that and it really hurt us.” And I was shocked at the fact that I went through two hardships in one week and they knew about it and were asking me to apologize. As someone who hates confrontation I apologized cause I did understand that I probably shouldn’t have been as snappy as I was. \n\nEven after I apologized I felt like I shouldn’t have and really didn’t need to. My grandma died, i almost died, I’m homeless, one of my cats is lost or dead, i lost everything, and I have no idea whats next. Yeah I’m gonna lash out at someone. I wasn’t mad at them at the time I just wanted to stopped being asked the question and I was just so angry at the world. \n\nI feel like they could’ve and should’ve understood all I was going through and realized maybe I didn’t need the extra stress of me thinking they now hate me (they were purposely ignoring me) and just let it go.\n\nHonestly, am I the asshole \n",

      "description": "About 2 months ago, my roommate and I decided to break our last lease and move into a new place that's a *massively* better deal for us, even considering the penalty for breaking lease/reletting fee.  The fees were spelled out in the lease, and we knew what to expect.  Except we got the fee two days ago in the mail, I tell him, and his face goes white.  I ask, \"Is that going to be a problem...?\" He had repeatedly reassured me that it wouldn't be an issue previously. \n\nI make a bit more money than him, and I was able to cover the fee. We talked about a payback schedule and he has a time in about a month where he'll have an unspoken-for paycheck coming in, and can afford to do it then. I trust him to do so (we've done stuff like this before, like me fronting money for a road trip and him paying me back once it started). And I'm not thrilled about this - I'm starting a new job and have some expenses coming up - so it definitely makes my life harder...but I don't feel like there was much other choice. \n\nThe thing I'm more frustrated about is his cat - or, rather, pre-cat.  He has been wanting one for a while and found out the coworker who was giving him one backed out, so now he's set on going this weekend to get one at the humane society.  Especially giving one a home who needs one.  But I can't help but get frustrated that he has money for this, but not to start paying me back with.  And I think he can sense my hesitancy around it, because it's been really hard for me to share the excitement with that thought nagging at my head. I do feel like a bit of a dick because I expect to get repaid on schedule...but yeah. ",

So we are a group of around 5-6 guys and during college winter break (a month ago) we would often get together and hang out. However, the problem is that we pretty much exclusively hang out at this one particular friend's house for whatever reason. He lives with his father and stepmother plus he has half siblings. We literally go to his house like night after night for like 5 days in a row and eventually his stepmother was like enough is enough you guys cant come over anymore. I personally think it was a reasonable request and I think it would be too much going to his house 2 nights in a row let alone a whole week. However, my friend calls his stepmother a demon and thinks its totally reasonable we hang out there as much as we want. We're usually well behaved but we definitely hang out too late like past 2am, sometimes on a school night/work day which means we could have been bothering his half siblings who are in midde/high school. I feel like we were the assholes but my friend thinks his stepmother is the asshole.",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. \n\nI (F18) made a friend (who we’ll call M) who I hang out with 2-4 times a week, and I always see her on weekends. M had a crush on me and would ask me if I was going to kiss her, if we were going to be exclusive with each other, etc. I’m not into her, so I let her down easy, mainly because she’s really clingy. She’s still really clingy and asks to hang out 2-4 times a week. She gets very emotional and is depressed, and I feel like she’s began relying on me for emotional support. When I don’t respond to her or I miss her calls, she thinks I don’t like her. I’m an outgoing, extraverted person. She’s an introvert. \n\nLast night, we decided to go to a party that her friends invited her to. Unfortunately, the party turned out to be nonexistent and so we decided to stay in. I really did not want to stay at her house all weekend because I usually end up getting stuck here with no ride home. \n\nSome friends invited me to cruise with them and offered to give me a ride home. I invited M to come and hang out with us and she got upset (jealous?) and said she would drive me back home instead. It was pretty late and she was drunk so I told her it was a bad idea. She begged me to stay, even though I offered her to come. The more and more she begged the more and more uncomfortable I felt. She said things like “are you really gonna do this to me right now, are you serious?” and “please please please don’t leave me.” She stormed out a couple times swearing and muttering under her breath, things like “fine whatever. I don’t give a fuck.”\n\nIt escalated and I began getting really uncomfortable.  I really wanted to go at that point so I walked out of the apartment and waited for my ride. \n\nShe was really drunk so maybe she was just being very emotional, but it’s gotten to the point where she does this with me 2-3 times a week.  \n\nI understand that she suffers from depression (I do, too) but I really don’t want to be someone’s main source of emotional support. I don’t want someone relying on me that heavily, does that make me an asshole?\n\n",

My girlfriend is Indian and comes from a Hindu family. I surprisingly get along great with her family, but my family acts a little cold towards my girlfriend. That brings us to last weekend, where I invited my girlfriend to my uncle’s birthday. She initially didn’t want to come but I begged her to come, as my family can be a little unbearable. My girlfriend and I make jokes about our skin colour all the time - eg. she tags me in those white people spicy food memes. Everything started to go wrong when my second cousins opened their mouths. They’re total dickheads. They started joking about how our children would have a “shit-like complexion”. I could see my girlfriend getting mad, so I wanted to alleviate the situation and try and make it into a joke. So I said, “yeah, she’s a little burnt, isn’t she?” and starting laughing. She did not take this well, at all. She was very quiet for the rest of the gathering and as soon as we got into the car we had a massive fight about that comment. She started talking about colorism in India and how darker women are discriminated against. I told her that I was just trying to lighten the situation and she snapped and told me that was the wrong way to do it and that I was an asshole. I got annoyed with the way she snapped at me and I told her that she was being a little hypocritical considering that she makes jokes about my complexion too. But she feels as though my joke was of a different caliber. Things have been awkward for a little while now. AITA?",

Basically grew up feeling like unless I had B+ grades at all times, I was a failure. I was also never allowed to hang out with friends unless my mom met their parents, and she never wanted to meet their parents. I even tried to get into the medical field so she'd shut the fuck up about me being a deadbeat, but I failed my physics class so I am now pursuing what I actually wanted, which is \"just a waste of time\" because it involves being at least somewhat artistic. I have also been dating my bf for about 5 1/2 years. \n\nSince I was 17 I started working, and I pay anywhere between 37%-100% of the rent for our house, the entire cable/internet bill, and my mom's EZ Pass. I am deoendent on her for car rides because I have neither a car nor a license due to my fear that if I drive, I'll literally die. I see my bf every Wednesday because that is our only days off, even then we sometimes have to skip it because we have to do stuff that day.\n\nTonight, my mom said, \"You're NOT going with him tomorrow!\" (Btw she was mad and yelling because I woke her up due to going to the bathroom and supposedly making too much noise when the loudest sound I made was closing my wet wipes shut)\n\nMe: ??? Why?\nMom: It will be cold out! WTF are you even going to do?!\nMe: uhm we wanted to go eat breakfast...\nMom: UHM NO. JUST STAY HOME. How are you even going to get there? You gonna pay for ANOTHER Uber?!\nMe: (getting annoyed because I pay to be under the damn roof too) No, he'll have [his parent's] car, he's going to pick me up.\nMom: AND THEN WHAT?? If he has the car they you might want to go to his place where there's NOBODY there! (Not usually true, but we do low key get intimate since it's our day and we deserve to do as we damn well please with our bodies)\nMe: Um no we won't-\nMom: YOU ARE NOT GOING!!\nAnd she angrily shut the door to her room.\n\nWIBTA if I just said \"fuck it\" and left my house to hang out with him all day tomorrow?? The first/last time I \"acted out\" like this was when I begged a family member to let me see him compete in a sports event they had in highschool after we'd only been dating about 2 or 3 months. Mom found out and smacked me so hard that she slightly busted my lip, and right now I'm so mad that I'm thinking, \"if I come home after being with my bf and she tries to hit me, I'll try to grab and twist her arm instead of just taking it as usual.\" I understand that it's fucked to think that but even after typing that wall of text I still sincerely feel no remorse for how I feel.",

      "description": "I am a Freshman in college, living in a house with 5 other people. One other guy lives in my actual room with me. I'd say about 4/7 days of the week he is gone, staying at his girlfriend's house. \n\nIt's fairly standard at this point for him to stay at his girlfriend's house until about 3 AM on Sunday/Monday, and then come home late and try to sleep until 1 PM on Monday. I don't have an issue with him coming home late. On Mondays I wake up at 8:30 AM, and attend class until about 11 AM. Then I come home, and see my roommate still sleeping. Today, with nothing else to do after I've eaten, I put on my headphones, boot up my computer, and start playing a game. It's about 11:45 AM at this point, and to be clear, I would not have headphones in if my roommate were awake. I get about 15 minutes in, until he growls and fairly aggressively says \"Hey dude, you've got to stop. You can't do that, I'm sleeping.\" He went on to complain that the sound my PS4 controller makes bothers him and is way too loud. Now, if it were 9 AM or maybe even 10 AM, I may have a little more sympathy. But it is nearly noon on a Monday, I have already gotten my day started, and it's not my fault he stays up until 3 AM with his girlfriend. I said \"It's almost noon man, my day has already started, and there isn't really anything else I have to do. Sorry,\" but still play my game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not having sympathy for him sleeping in until noon on a Monday, while the rest of the world's day has already started?",

The first child gets out at 2:30, the second 3:00, and the third around 3:30. I suggested in order to save a lot of money on gas and save hours of our time every day, the kids could ride the bus. Otherwise due to our different work schedules, my fiancé gets off at 6am and takes the first and I take the second two after I wake up at 7:40, she’d only get three hours of sleep per day, being 7 months pregnant because she’d have to pick up the kids from their schools since I have to be at work before they get out. She’s suggesting I don’t care about her or her kids by wanting them to take the bus and saving us hundreds of dollars and hundreds of hours a year. I’m trying to be efficient and trying to help her get many more hours of sleep...WHAT SAY YE?!",

      "description": "Whew. First post here. Also on mobile so excuse my formatting\nHear me out. \nI am an 18 yr old female\nI am currently rooming with a friend whom i love dearly. She is a a great girl and we've been friends for about 2 years now. When I first moved in, I had nothing. My parents and I were on super bad terms and essentially I ended up with my friend and her family after they were called by the police to house me because I was a minor in my country. So I end up moving in w them and they're absolutely lovely but it sucks. I get a job and I have practically nothing to wear so I try to ask said friend if I can borrow her clothes but she isn't there a lot of the time. So I just wore her clothes without asking and she never seemed to mind it. For things like shoes or important stuff I always asked or didn't touch them at all. This went on for a few months until I got my clothes eventually. Then, she started wearing my stuff. And i didn't mind. At all. It was okay for a bit. We were all good. But then she started wearing clothes I had just bought without asking.  Then she started wearing my fav shoes (now they're worn out and i can't wear them anymo rip). She started taking my makeup  and taking it with her places without asking or saying anything. andddddd ... You get the point. and it got really annoying. I really would let her if she just asked too... I feel indebted to her and her family for helping me out of a rough patch so I can't bring myself to say anything to my friend! So I can't help thinking I shouldn't feel this way. So I sent her a msg telling her how i feel and maybe I'm doing something totally wrong. \n\nSo.. \nAm I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "Hey guys. \n\nI’m from outside the US. My parents are divorced since I was a toddler. In my childhood, my father was never really supporting me, providing me and my mom with 300 bucks a month until I was 18. My mother had to give up college and everything to raise me and take up odd jobs to get us through. He was making at least 3000 during that time but that’s another story. \n\nI’m 27 now. Going to law school here in my country. Since I’m 18, my dad puts money on my account, around 500 each month, now it’s 1200 dollars. For the bar exam alone, you study at least 1 1/2 years with 9-10 hours a day. Which makes working next to impossible. I was fired from my last job because I could never complete my hours. He also lets me drive a company car for free. \n\nNow, my father is an income millionaire nowadays. He has another child and woman and lives in the richest area of my city (comparable to Bel Air or Beverly Hills in Los Angeles). I know 1200 is a lot, and sometimes I feel like he shouldn’t support me. The thing is, he’s still my father and my mom lets me live rent free too and buys all groceries. She raised me. \n\nThe thing why I’m feeling like an asshole is, I don’t talk to him. We have a very bad relationship. He is very abusive. I’m balding and whenever we see each other he keeps on telling me I’m a bald head. He says I’m a failure in life. He says he regretted having me when I was born while he was still a student. He told his friends I was his nephew when I was little because he was embarrassed to have a child. He still talks bad about my mom. Bad about me where ever he can. When I complain about my studies, he says I’m exaggerating. He says I look old. When I went to take pictures for my license for after the exam he told me I wouldn’t get a job like this. Basically, he takes any chance he gets to say bad things about me. On my birthdays, he just writes emails. He makes me feel bad for not spending my birthday with him and his wife and eat ice cream outside (wtf?) and betraying him because I want to spend time with my mothers side of the family because they actually care for me. \n\nThere are multiple times where we didn’t talk to each other for longer periods. Every time after he just acted like I was the asshole and I’m not a man for not talking to him. He makes me feel bad that I don’t care for his (spoiled) daughter who doesn’t even care for me. Me and my mom had to move in the middle of my exam last year. My mom paid for everything, new bed, table etc. Even my gf father helped. He or his wife didn’t do anything. Not even financially. He just gave me a moving box. This was a very stressful time which led me to have some stress related health issues. \n\nHe sent me to one of his friends after a doctor said I might have cancer (which I don’t thankfully). The guy wanted to give me anti depressants because he said I was making it all up. My dad said take them without any thought even though I told him his friend didn’t even talk to me before prescribing those. After that, I was diagnosed with GERD by another doctor. I asked my dad to drive me but he wouldn’t take time off work and then got angry because I told him when he doesn’t have time my mom will drive me in an angry way too. Since then, he hasn’t called me once. He didn’t ask about the results by the doctor. How I feel. Anything. I haven’t congratulated him on Christmas either or New Years because I just don’t wanna talk to him anymore for all the abusive things he does to me. He excludes me from his life and only kept calling me in the past because of guilt issues or to keep a facade for his younger daughter I guess. He got a license plate with her name for his new car. He never even acknowledged me in front of other people. He doesn’t even know what my friends names are even though he knows everything about her life. He still boasts about he once went to see my teacher in 7th grade as if he took an interest in my life. \n\nSorry for the long text... and sorry for the shit English. I hope my text makes sense. Well, the question is, am I the asshole for still relying on my dads money even though I hate him and don’t talk to him and not visit him and his family? And especially for my age? I feel like a failure but I also feel that’s still my biological father and I didn’t ask to come into this world... and he has the money and brags all the time how he makes so much money..",

      "description": "(Alittle background, I wanted to do a giant chocolate heart for Valentine’s Day just to do it so I asked for help from friends and two replied, one of them who replied, the person in question we had a disagreement but she never apologizes for it, that prevented us from talking for alittle while until recently)\n\nNow with that in mind, here is the story\n\nSo I showed my friend a video and said I was debating doing a chocolate heart for shits and giggles and she said that I should, all things fine, so I tell her a mutual female friend of ours is joining us and she was fine with that but she was busy for two hours the day. I wanted to do it so I told her that I would help our mutual friend do some shopping of her own and then pick her up so we can buy supplies for the heart since it would be more fun with the 3 of us after she was done then she said,” ok that’s fine”\n\nThe next day, I tell another mutual male friend what I was planning, and he wants to join, I tell him sure, and that I’ll message him when we are at the store so he could join me at my house for the process with the rest of us.\n\nThe day of the process. I get a message from another mutual female friend that she wants join aswell. And she is currently with the other mutual female friend. So I agree since they are good friends. Now it hits 2pm and I’m driving myself and both mutual female friends to get their shopping done and which we did and we had time left over so we headed to my house. So it hits 4:30pm and we start driving to the place the girl in question is at which is a fair distance but whatever, I didn’t mind doing it. However my car is not the most economical. I asked one female friend to message the girl in question that we might be alittle late since there was traffic, which she did, but never responded to. By the time we get there I see our mutual guy friend in front of us parked and he calls us, saying what are we doing here? and we respond we are here to pick the girl in question up and he responds he’s doing the same thing. So I get mad that because: first, I messaged her that, I would pick her up specificly, second she never responded to the message that we would be late, since that would have saved us half an hour of driving, third she has 2 days to clarify anything she did not understand. So I just say “fuck this” and drove off and hung up. \n\nNot too long after the girl in question responds to the we would be late message and a mutual female friend explains to her the situation and that I am angry.  So she starts saying the excuse that she thought we were all at same place in the first place when I specifically told her that I told help a mutual female friend do her shopping and then I would pick her up, so she starts crying to god knows what and I get a call from the mutual guy friend, I answer and mute it because I was angry and didn’t want to go off on him since he was a bystander. He hangs up and redials. I don’t answer. So he calls a one of the mutual female friends and she answers. He asked the question “why is he so salty” and by that statement alone I knew he already took her side without knowing all the facts, so i decide it’s not worth attempting to persuade him since he is already rooting for the girl I question. \n\nTL:DR - I wanted to do a chocolate heart for Valentine’s Day, a misunderstanding happen because of it, I get angry and leave two friends behind  AITA?",

      "description": "I have a baby mama that does not let me take our kid anywhere without her being present. She claims she is scared that something will happen to our daughter when she is with me. I've tried having several conversations with her over the years, all which come to the same ending: I cannot take our daughter anywhere without her being present because she does not trust me and is scared that something might happen to our daughter. I have done nothing to warrant this fear of hers. I have been in the picture since the day she was born, but was away at college for the first year and a half of her life (my daughter is now 3 1/2, I'm 26). I have now been home for college for 2 years and see my daughter 4 to 5 times a week, always at my baby mama's place. My parents and my whole family have been telling me that I need to take my baby mama to court so that I can bring her around the family more often. They don't get to see her much because my baby mama works (she works a job that allows her to bring our daughter with her) and says she doesn't have time to see my parents. So, I listened to them and filed for a court custody hearing. Granted, this is after several arguments and her refusal to let me take our child, even for a couple hours.. I can't help but feel incredibly guilty about this because:\n\n1. I went behind her back and filed for this custody hearing. She has no idea that I've done it yet and will be getting a subpoena any day...\n2. My daughter has developed somewhat of a separation anxiety from her mother. She loves me, but is around her mom 24/7 and gets a bit anxious when she's away from her for too long.\n3. My baby mama have dated off and on for the past couple of years, trying to make things work out.\n\nHere are some of the reasons my baby mama doesn't \"trust\" me with our child.\n\n1. There's a pool at my house. Apparently it's the #3 killer of all infants. She's absolutely terrified that I'm going to lose track of my daughter and she's going to find her way to our pool and drown.\n2. I'm forgetful- I always misplace things like my keys and wallet and tend to lose things often. She thinks this is a bad character trait and that somehow I will forget my daughter somewhere.\n\nTLDR: Baby mama won't let me take our child without her there, I filed for a custody hearing behind her back.\n\nAITA in this situation?",

      "description": "We moved in last August. There’s a back door leading to the deck out back. We live in a decent neighborhood, kind of in the transition area from good to bad areas of town. I would come home from work and find the door unlocked and would text my roommates to lock the door back when we go outside. I sent it to both roommates even though I know it was roommate 1. Anyways, about 1 or 2 times a month I would find the back door unlocked, sometimes in the morning when I know it had been unlocked all night. I would send a text every time and bring it up in person. I told roommate 1 that I’ve had my house broken into before and it SUCKS because it really does suck. This happened about 8 times and I was like “[1], LOCK THE DOOR. I’m not trying to get my things stolen!” sternly, but not yelling. He replied “yeah fuck you. I forgot. I forget sometimes. I FORGOT OKAY”\n\nAnyways, about a week ago roommate 2 had his car broken into so it worried me about a home invasion. The next day, I found the back door unlocked again (about the 10th time) and I was so sick of hearing they forgot. I sent a text (again, to both roommates, so as not to accuse any one roommate) saying “LOCK THE DOOR. LOCK THE FUCKING DOOR. DONT SAY YOU FORGOT. JUST LOCK THE GOD DAMN DOOR. LOCK. THE. DOOR.”\n\nAnd roommate 1 took it so offensively and said he was going to move out. He also put a hole in the bathroom door while screaming because it wasn’t him that left it unlocked, it was his friend that left it unlocked when she let her dog out. I just said “COOL. STOP BREAKING OUR HOUSE. THE DOOR NEEDS TO BE LOCKED”. Since then, he has said fuck you to everything I do or say and calling me an asshole for “overreacting” about the unlocked door. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My friend and I hopped down to a local brewery/bar last night to enjoy our Saturday night and get our drink on. I want to be clear that this is strictly a bar, like the kind if bar where they check your ID before you go in. It's not a big brew pub with restaurant food and plentiful seating, it's intimate and small and they serve primarily beer.\n\nWhen we came in, it wasn't super busy, but there was a family with two small children, under the age of 4. Weird, but okay. However, as we drinking and chatting, I start noticing that the kids at the other side of the bar are being fairly rambunctious, standing on their chairs, screaming, and well, just being kids. After two drinks, this started to get on my nerves, as it is a small bar and the noise carries. The parents were doing nothing to quiet their kids and were just letting them yell and run around.\n\nI tried to ignore them and focus on my friend, when I felt something body slam my leg. Yeah, one of the kids fell into my bar stool, and as kids do, it started to cry loudly. Mom came rushing over to get her kid and when she was picking him up, she looked up at us and chuckled, \"oh sorry, kids huh?\" \n\nMy friend, being more polite then myself, just shrugged and said \"oh no worries\". Mom then said, \"hah, they're cute but such handful\". Me, being irritated and tipsy said, \"I don't think it's very cute that you're letting them run around unsupervised.\" The rest of the conversation went as follows (to the best of my memory).\n\nMom: Seriously? They're just kids, they have a lot of energy.\n\nMe: Ma'am this is a bar, of all the places you could have picked to let your kids run around in, this is probably the worst place.\n\nMom: I think your rudeness is unwarranted, they aren't hurting anyone.\n\nMe: This is a BAR, where adults come explicitly to drink, where patrons underage are forbidden. I'm not sure why they even let you in. You have some nerve calling me rude while you ignore your kids and let them run into people and disturb our peace. \n\nMom: I said sorry that she hit you, but I'm not going to apologize for trying to have a good night.\n\nMe: Whatever you say, just know that many people don't appreciate kids in bars, and don't find them to be cute. Control your kids.\n\nMom: You don't need to be such a bitch. \n\nAfter that she walked back to her table and they stayed for probably another 10 minutes after the kids wouldn't stop crying for not being allowed to run amok anymore.\n\nI kind of feel bad today for what happened. My friend said I was harsh, but not an asshole. But what do y'all think, AITA?",

      "description": "This is a new account because my friends are part-time redditors.\n\nAlso, the title isn't 100% accurate, but I'll explain. \n\nI met this guy, Jack, and we hit it off. At least, I hit it off with him. Shortly after we met he began dating this girl. She's lovely and I hold no ill will towards him for it. I had already developed some feelings for him and they didn't disappear just because he's dating someone, you know? \n\nFast forward to nearly a year later. We're all part of a really good friend group. My feelings are present, but I've long accepted it's not going to happen, and everything is fine. \n\nWell, Jack's best friend, we'll call him Chris, recently asked me on a date. We went out a few times but I felt odd pursuing anything with him because he was Jack's best friend and while my feelings for Jack are less now than they were, they're not nonexistent. Plus his personality is very similar to Jack's and that also made me feel odd about dating him. I politely told him I wasn't interested and he took it really well. There was no awkwardness about it between us. \n\nFrom then on, every time I hung out with Jack or Jack and friends he would ask why I wasn't \"interested\" in Chris. I made several excuses first, but this went on for weeks. Finally I told him the whole story about having lingering feelings for him and feeling odd about dating anyone in the friend group for that reason. I made sure to say I wasn't expecting anything out of this and that it doesn't bother me in the least to be around him and his girlfriend. It's my is my own personal issue and I'd wanted it to stay that way, but after weeks of badgering...\n\nHe blew a fuse and was like \"How dare you tell me this knowing I'm in a relationship?\" and \"Do you know what kind of pressure that puts on me?\". I don't really, but I understand feeling weird after hearing a friend has had feelings for you for a while. I let it rest thinking he would talk to me about it eventually, but it's been a few weeks and he's still pissed. \n\nSo, AITA for telling him the true story? Should I have made something else up? Also, is it really that terrible to know a friend has some residual feelings for you? It's not like I've ever made or would intend to make an advance. ",

Another family sat next to us, and one of their young kids, maybe 5 or 6, sat on the edge next to me. As soon as they sat down, the kid started coughing and sniffling snot. He'd have a coughing fit every four or five minutes, and would sniffle constantly in between them. And these weren't small, dainty sniffles, these sniffles sounded like he was doing all he could to hold back a deluge of mucus from pouring out his face. To be clear, I'm not mad at the kid for being sick, I'm mad at their parents for bringing a sick kid into a public and quiet place. I thought about asking the parents to take their kid out or going to theatre staff to complain, but ended up not saying anything and just walking out because I didn't want to be a dick or make a scene. So, would I have been the asshole if I had complained? Either to the parents themselves, or to the theatre staff? \n\nTLDR: Sick kid sat next to me in theatre and wouldn't stop coughing and sniffling. WIBTA if I complained to parents or staff?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my (former) friend that her new bf is a dick, and ruining our relationship because of it.",
      "description": "Alright boys, I just want to preface this by saying that I’m a super preppy white boy, like full AP schedule, nationally ranked athlete gunning for the top college type guy. I try my best to be as nice as I possibly can to everyone, but I am admittedly a little socially awkward sometimes as a result of some fairly bad bullying in middle school (dw I’m ok now). But anyway, go ahead and get ya popcorn, get ya licorice, get ya root beer, get ya fuckin Stromboli, it’s gonna be a looong post. \n\nSo, flashback to sophomore year, I’m still a somewhat isolated kid, but I’ve grown into a more social being who can actually talk competently with people most of the time without trying some dumb gimmick to draw attention to myself. This was at a time when I was constantly stressed from APs and my sport (which I can’t mention because if I did it would blow my cover immediately), and I was desperately in need of a good friend. I had found a couple, but a lot of them were like me, socially awkward, but pretty fun to be around (though idk if I am fun to be around, I haven’t seen myself through someone else’s eyes lol), barring one exception who I am still friends with, and may or may not have a slight crush on because she’s great. Enter this freshman, we’ll call her Jane doe, I met her on the bus and we immediately bonded over our equally strange senses of humor. As I got to know her more and more, we started to become better and better friends, at one point I probably would’ve even considered her my best friend. At the time she was in a long distance relationship, and it was rough but going strong. Towards the end of the year, she breaks it off with the long distance guy (LD for short) and started dating another friend of mine, we’ll call him Joseph. \n\nThe year goes by fairly uneventfully, save for the fact that I got a gf at the end of the year who was amazing, and we lasted for about 8 months. Cut to the end of the summer, schools back in and the shit starts to hit the fan. Not only have I decided to take a metric ton of APs, a ton of social shit starts to go down, an entirely different friend nearly commits suicide and I had to try and talk her down, the aforementioned girl I said I may or may not have a crush on had broken up with her long time bf, but most of all, Jane had gone to summer camp where LD went as well, now Jane had broken up ish with Joseph, but wasn’t clear about it, and on this summer camp she decided to let LD have sex with her for her first time. She gets back, and Joseph is confused, and so she breaks it off officially with him, understandably being a little pissed. And when I asked her about LD she said “whenever we’re together, we’re together, but when we’re not we’re not” which I thought was utter bullshit and unfair to both guys, but I kept this opinion to myself.\n\nAnd here is where the final guy comes in, we can call him MH for meathead. Now, I had some experience with this guy, when I was riding the bus my sophomore year (remember, socially awkward as fuck) with a then crush of mine, this dumbass rolls up and sits right in front of us, turns to us and says “so are y’all fucking or what?” To which I awkwardly laugh and say no, he then looks me dead in the eyes and says “ahh so you got friend zoned then, I get it” and I respond with yet another laugh and a slight shake of the head. This conversation goes on for a little while with very little input from me, and some very explicit questions from MH. So when I learn that Jane is thinking about dating this guy I immediately advise her against it.\n\nAnd here at long last is the part where I admittedly fuck up. During a conversation with Jane, she lets slip the fact that MH goes to a program in my city that lets kids take college classes in high school at a community college. Now this program has a reputation for attracting kids that don’t really care about school and worry more about doing other things, which is fine for some, but a lot of the time it’s for kids who like to get high and party. I see this as yet another red flag and advise her against this dude again. During the conversation she seems totally chill about it and responsive to my advice. Now here is the part I personally take issue with. After the conversation at school the next day she talks to me like normal, as if nothing is up, but after school MH sprints up to me in the parking lot and yanks on my backpack fairly hard, and since I’m a skinny dude it pulled me back a good amount. This guy puts his arm around my shoulder, with his forearm and bicep around my carotids, almost as if he’s about to choke me. He pulls me away and says “hey, don’t ever make my girl mad again, aight?” Now there are many issues with this, first off they had been dating a couple days at most so she wasn’t really “his girl” yet, moreover, Jane had never told me she was mad at me otherwise I would’ve talked it out with her like a normal human being. So I tell her about what happened and she acts as if it’s my fault, and I apologize because that’s who I am, and admittedly it is my fault somewhat. Though after this my opinion of this guy declines, i don’t say anything to her because she seems happy about their relationship and I don’t want to ruin that. And to be honest, I kind of respect MH for doing what he did, he was protecting her the only way he knew how, which is better than not protecting her at all, though he could’ve just talked to me and I would’ve been even more respectful of him. \n\nThe next day I come into school and I don’t take to Jane all day, whatever. But after school I’m chilling at the bus stop with the girl I may or may not have a crush on, when I feel a familiar tug on my backpack. I turn around and lo and behold it’s MH with Jane in tow, the second I turn around he shoves me into the side of the bus stop, and again, skinny dude, so I go flying a little bit. The girl I was talking to asks if she should get involved and I said no, don’t worry about it. Then MH starts yelling at me almost unintelligibly because of his inability to form coherent sentences about how I should never insult him and that I should fight him right there. In response I tell him “no dude, I’m trying to get into a good school” to which he replies “bro what the fuck? Fight me right here bitch.” And i just laugh and look away as Jane comes in to stop him. They leave and I get on the bus without further incident. \n\nThe next day I’m going to term d-day for reasons that should be evident very soon. I show up to the bus that I take to school and find that Jane is on it, I say hi and sit next to her. We start having a pleasant conversation, and I think everything is all good. As we get to school, we start talking about MH, She starts telling me how after yesterday’s incident, they went home and had sex, and she told me in graphic detail how good he was for a virgin. Now the rest of the day goes smoothly until the end of school, me and Joseph (remember him?) are waking to the bus and MH chucks a bag of ice at the back of our heads. We turn and give him and Jane a look, but just keep walking. And when I get home I get a text from Jane that reads “bro quit acting like we’re cool, we’re not” at which point I explode on her, but in a fairly level headed way.  I say that I respect this guy but he needs to stop being an ass. I say that I’m the one who’s been saying sorry, but that she should apologize for his behavior, and I say that I love her, but this is no cool at all, and the coup de grace being me threatening to get this guy expelled if he keeps trying to hurt me and my friendsZ Her response? “Man, fuck you.” And then blocking me everywhere. After days of taking rant after rant from her about how “I was being racist because I said that the college program thing was bad and that somehow correlated to me saying it’s not hard for minorities to get ahead” and that “I need to give this guy a chance and chill” she can’t handle one from me? Fuck off with that. \n\nNow I see her talking shit about me behind my back in the halls, and just giving me glares whenever we pass eachother. Honestly there have been times where I have wanted to ask to talk it out, but what’s the point anymore? She was a good friend, but I think I need to let this one go.\n\nAnyway, sorry for writing a dissertation on this guys, but I’ve been wanting to get it off my chest for a while. Thanks for reading.\n\nTl;Dr: best friend dates an asshole and I tell her as such, dude tries to beat me up, and then she blames it on me. ",

      "description": "Earlier today, as my mom and I were leaving lunch, I go to get into the driver’s seat, but I realize I can’t. A USPS delivery truck had parked so close to my car that I could not open my door and would have struggled getting to it as well. I see the woman is sitting in the truck sorting through mail, so I wait for her to notice us to avoid interrupting her. As she gets out to deliver mail, I figured she’d notice us, maybe apologize for the bad parking job, and then redo it so we could leave, or she would park elsewhere (there were many other front row spots available less than 5 feet away). She walks past us without saying anything, so I stop her. I say “Excuse me, we cannot get into our car. Could you please-“ to which she cuts me off by saying “You’re just going to have to wait.”. As she walks away, I say that we are trying to leave but cannot get into our car. She replies by saying that her bad parking is a result of the parking job of the car next to her and that we again would just have to wait.\n\nThe thing is though, the car next to her was parked normally, maybe a little closer to the line than usual. The conversation goes back and forth like this for about a minute, all while she has the biggest attitude with us. I ask for the number of her supervisor, and she says again for me to wait. She walks away to deliver mail to 5 stores, and when she gets back 10-15 minutes later, she says nothing to us and starts to get into her truck. I again ask for the number of her supervisor, and she hands me a USPS customer service card. I ask for her name or work number so that I can explain to customer service who I was referring to, and she just points to the number on top of her truck and drives off. \n\nI haven’t had any luck reaching the number (USPS is another story as many of you may be accustomed to), but I’m wondering if this is even worth reporting. She was very rude to us from the start and increasingly more rude as the event occurred. All we wanted to do was leave, but she was very angry we asked her to make room for us to get into our car. [Here are pictures of the parking job and other available spots.](https://imgur.com/gallery/9ymSRKB). We are more upset about the way she spoke to us and handled the situation than we are the bad parking job, obviously.\n\nSo, AITA for asking her to let us into our car by redoing her parking job?",

      "description": "This fiasco happened last July so it’s all over now.  \n\nIt’s a tradition at my high school that at the end of senior year, the vast majority of the grade goes to the beach together for a week:  “Beach Week.”  For beach week, groups of about six to ten group up to rent houses together all in about the same area.  I was in a last-minute house with a few of the less popular people, but who were still more popular than me.  As our house was last-minute, it was separated a ways from the rest.\n\nWe were visiting another house on Wednesday which was about a quarter-mile away from ours when I heard that someone from our grade—let’s call him “Hap”—was about three miles away from where we were for a family reunion unrelated to Beach Week.  Hap had been asking a whole bunch of people where they were staying, but no one gave him an answer because they didn’t want him present.\n\nI didn’t think that was right since I knew he’d been looking forward to this week, so I told Hap the street name that all the other houses were on (note:  my house was NOT on this street).  I knew Hap wouldn’t be able to do anything with this information—what was he going to do, knock on the door of every house on the street until he came across on that belonged to us?—so I thought it would be ok to reveal our general location.  \n\nSomeone from the house we were visiting as I did this, who we’ll call Lad, saw me do this (in hindsight it is quite clear he thought I had given Hap his specific address) and approached me saying I shouldn’t have given away their location.  The visit ended quite shortly after that and on the walk back I let my housemates know what happened.  Even knowing I did not give away Lad’s actual address, they agreed I had done wrong.\n\nMy group did not get invited to any events the rest of the week, Thursday and Friday, and I was able to get it confirmed from someone in Lad’s house it was because of what I had done.  I felt especially bad because, as I said, the others in my group were more popular than I was... they only reluctantly had taken me in to begin with.  They were not made aware that I was the reason, though I am pretty sure at least one of them figured it out.  It seemed to me like I’d ruined their Beach Week.\n\nConsequences aside—the costs DEFINITELY outweighed the benefits on this one—was what I did on principle an asshole move?  And was Lad an asshole for excluding my group afterwards?",

      "description": "This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m feeling like a big asshole and you’ll see why below. I’m afraid to talk to anyone because I don’t know what the right thing to do is here. \n\nThe background to this story is that I moved in with a roommate, let’s call her Hannah, in August. We didn’t know each other before but got closer as one does when living together. Hannah was an artist, funny and we got on super well. She passed away just before new year’s in a bike accident. This was very hard for me, but nowhere as hard as it was for her family and friends. Her boyfriend Jake in particular was devastated. \n\nA few days after Hannah’s funeral, Jake asked for her keys to get some of her belongings. I was at work that day but when I got home that night, he was a sobbing mess. I don’t know Jake well, but he was crying in my roommates’ room, so of course I tried to help. Jake asked if he could stay the night because he could not handle going home now. \n\nOver the next couple of weeks, Jake sometimes stayed in Hannah’s room which I did not mind. I don’t know what it’s like to lose your partner but losing a roommate hurt so much already, so I can’t imagine what it’s like for Jake. Sometimes other friends of Hannah and her mom would come too. As her heir, her mother offered to pay Hannah’s part of her rent until they felt ready to deal with all of Hannah’s belongings. I told them to take as much time as they need. \n\nAfter that, Jake stayed over almost every night. But it started to change from him trying to be close to Hannah to him kind of living here. He would sometimes cook in middle of the night or watch movies without headphones, which would wake me up. As I was on semester break and was only working part-time, so I didn’t say anything about it. For context, Jake is a freelance producer and doesn’t have standard office hours. \n\nThey have started to empty out her room about two weeks ago, and I’ve decided to stay out of it because it’s part of their grieving and I didn’t want to disturb. Now, the room is empty except for her bed and her piano. \n\nOn Monday, my semester started again. I told Jake about this, that I would have to wake up early again and that I’d try to not wake him up. He promised to be quiet at night too but hasn’t. \n\nAdditionally, with the third rent coming up, apparently Hannah’s mom is unable to pay for it. Like for most people, having to pay for another place must be expensive for her. The landlord has been amazing and simply put the rent contract on my name in January. But this means that I’ll have to come up with the rent money from now on and this is a big burden for me as well. This is why I’m considering looking for a new roommate. \n\nIt’s Sunday afternoon, I’m sitting in my room while Jake is in the kitchen making lunch for himself. And I’m asking strangers on the internet if I would be the asshole if telling Jake about wanting to find a new roommate and asking him to go back to his apartment.",

      "description": "This happened yesterday, I was looking to send about 5k$ to my UK bank account and was browsing a bit and saw that one of my online transfer services was advertising using this company(rhymes with zoom) for us to Europe transactions. \n\nI realize this is a lot of money which needs extra security measures, I had to give my address, social security number, photo of id, photo of me now, all of my bank details including account user and password, and a few more things. \n\nNow after this I get an email saying to call to confirm or the transaction may not be approved. So I call and they ask me a bunch of irrelevant questions, like are you married, where are you now, how often will you use “zoom”. The thing that really threw me is they needed a phone bill. \n\nNow I don’t have my american phone bill, I’m in the uk and that phone has been given to my dad along with the number. For all verification purposes I assumed they would text the number to confirm whatever they needed right? \n\nNope. It HAD to be the phone bill. I told them it wasn’t in my name anymore and they said it didn’t matter, they still needed it. I asked what this was verifying and they said “we are not allowed to disclose our processes and reasons for security checks”.  \n\nSo I asked if you could make an account without a phone number, and they said yes. So I asked if I could do that and they told me no. \n\nSo now a company that is endorsed by “paybuddy” has all of my details and they don’t even allow accounts being deleted. I swear this is nuts. \n\nMaybe I’m wrong here? But they have literally every identifying info there is on me but they HAVE to get a phone bill. Ugh. ",

      "description": "So I was on my way to visiting my girlfriend at her place, on a 45-minute bus ride. The bus was practically full, with us passengers having no personal space since everyone was back to back. However, the vast majority of people where I was standing in were around 30-40 years old, and I am 19.\n\nAfter 20 minutes passed, someone got up from his seat and got off the bus. I waited for a couple of minutes to see if anyone wanted the seat, then sat down and opened Hearthstone. In front of me were an old lady and a 20yo man who mentioned that he had an accident with his motorcycle and hurt his legs.\n\nFor 10 minutes, everything was fine. I managed to win a couple of games and was enjoying myself. Then, another old lady entered from the back. Since the bus was full, she had trouble getting in and someone offered her a seat. However, they couldn't switch places easily, since the bus was full, so they had to push everyone for the man to get up, then wait till the old lady sat down. This seemed to annoy the old lady sitting in front of me. FYI I was sitting in the middle of the bus, and the trouble was happening in the back, so it was impossible for me to give my seat to the old lady in the back.\n\n\n\nOL: old lady sitting in front of me\nME: Master of the Eevees\n\n\n\nOL: (yelling at me) God's sake these youngsters! Can't you see the old lady in the back is struggling? Yet you're still sitting down playing these stupid games!\n\nMe: Excuse me but the old lady is already seated now\n\nOL: So what? Can't you see there's others in need of the seat?\n(I actually looked and there were no elderly people around. There were some middle aged people, but I thought that if they needed the seat, say they got tired or their backs hurt, they would ask for it. I was tired too, after all)\n\nMe: If anyone needed the seat, they could ask and I'd get up. Don't -\n\nOL: You shouldn't even sit down, these seats aren't for young people!\n\nAt this point I was furious because I'm not used to being yelled up by strangers, but someone from the back was waving at me to let it go and not reply, so I stayed silent and focused on the game until the OL\n stopped as well. Soon enough we reached the destination, which happens to be the local IKEA and shopping mall. From there I took the next bus to my gf's house, but was still furious about what happened. So I ask: AITA for not giving up my seat? ",

He is cool to talk to but he has one major issue, he is always in somebody else's business. He is always talking about other people's situations and talking behind their backs. I let him know quickly I didn't care about any of that and everything seems good with me and him. I just now have started doing my own work after being trained by the other mechanics for three months. The guy next to me never trained me. He and the other mechanics know I generally know what I am doing and will ask for help if I don't. Every since I started my own work recently, he is always coming over and inspecting my work and commenting on it. As a mechanic in my area, there are many ways to accomplish one task and to be quite honest we have to cut corners sometimes to meet time restraints. That is just the way it is. He will come over and tell me that's not the way this certain thing is supposed to be done even though I was trained by many other mechanics to do it that way. normally I wouldn't mind another suggestion on how to fix something, but his tone comes off as if he is trying to belittle me. It makes me feel bad. What makes me feel worse is I haven't seem him do this to anyone else. A few days ago I had enough. He came to my station early in the morning and spoke to me in that tone again. I told him \"I know you probably mean no harm in telling me what to do, but I would like you to stop speaking to me like that when you are trying to teach me.\" He was suprised when I said this and he just walked back to his station. Ever since then, he won't speak a word to me. I feel as if what I said was fair and could be worked out from there. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong, I'm new to reddit.\n  Okay so background knowledge, i(13F) have lived with only my mother for as long as I can remember. She really wasn't the best caretaker until recently.\n   She's been a pass out drunk for multiple years, including all throughout my later elementary schools(3-5th grade at least). She was always quite verbally harsh when she got riled up, and wasn't very calm when angered, going so far to throw chairs or chase me or my sister with a belt. She never hit us with it or anything, she just ran after us and stood menacingly on the stairs.\n   In my later elementary years, she would come upstairs and throw all our stuff into bags and put them near the garbage until we were panicked enough she thought we learned our lessons. One time she even actually put it In the dumpster.\n   Shes always had a worse relationship with my sister, yelling and hitting each other weekly, and once my mom even called the cops on her on a false claim of domestic abuse. My sister always drew her ire off me because I was really emotionally not ready for the screaming she like to take part in.\n   She wasn't abusive or anything, but she still had a really big effect on me, and I was always a bit scared her.\n   An incident I still remember is when she insulted me about something she knew I was insecure about (\"how does it feel to have a target on your head in pimples?\") And I threw something at her so she chased me, sat on top of me, and tried to wrestle my phone out of my hands by resorting to dirty tactics like hair pulling (I have a sensitive scalp).\n    She does love me and my sister, she just doesn't show it very well. I love her as well, but sometimes I wish she didn't exist.\n   Recently, she's gotten a lot better and stopped drinking. She hasn't broken a thing of ours or threatened me in a while. My sister has always had more of a strained relationship with her, and she's gotten along with our mother just fine, so I keep thinking I should just get over it.\n   I want to get over it, but I keep feeling this deep resentment whenever I see her sometimes. I'm really conflicted about it, but I just feel like I hate her, but also like I owe it to her to try to reconcile. \n\nShe's expressed being upset about it and I don't really feel bad, but when I confided in my close friend she called me an asshole for not getting over the past, but I just can't muster up the want to make our strained relationship good again.\n   I know this isn't an advice sub, and I'm not asking for it, I just wanted to ask for whether I'm being an unreasonable asshole or not, and that requires context. If the description of anything goes against rules, I'll delete or edit it.\nSo, am I a cold hearted asshole for not trying to be in a good relationship with her, and kind of hating her for our conflicts, even though she moved past it?\n(Sorry for format issues)",

      "description": "Hear me out! There are several reasons why I believe this coworker shouldn't have the promotion.   It would have been a promo from office assistant to executive secretary.  She wouldn't be my direct/main secretary but I'd still delegate to her.  These are a few reasons why I made sure an open position went from \"promotion/hire from within\" to \"open/public posting.\"\n\n1.  She's not even a good office assistant.  She has stacks of paperwork to file away but it takes her weeks to do it.  Her excuses have included \"I'm busy\" when she's clearly not, \"I am waiting for more files to make it worth filing away,\" and my favorite, \"I need an assistant to help do it.\"\n\n2.  She's in a fishbowl desk where anyone walking by can see what's on her screen.  She doesn't care that you can see she's on Amazon, Facebook, and celebrity gossip websites.  I've caught her on her personal tablet playing Bubble Witch Saga and Snapchat. Her excuse? \"Others do it/I've been here the longest/it is slow today\"\n\n3.  She gossips too much.  She will intercom me to tell me if another coworker was just getting back from a 2 hour lunch, a celebrity cheated on their SO, or the boss is on a date.  Who gives a shit!!!\n\nEveryone feels bad for her though. She's one of the most tenured employees so she (and everyone else) feels she's entitled to the new position. The bosses feel bad for her and while they acknowledge she's barely filling the duties of an assistant, they hoped she'll improve when she's promoted (\"maybe more responsibilities and pay will get her motivated\").   I'm more practical.  The person filling the position should be the most qualified, and how else to ensure we have the most qualified by opening it up to others, and that's how I convinced them to make the posting public (and by also reminding them how she is currently... tenure and entitlement aren't sufficient reasons for a promotion). \n\nIf she passes the interviews and HR review, then yes she can still potentially get the job ([I doubt it though....  there are other secretaries (higher levels) from other departments who are applying].  But at least she has to compete with others and the job wasn't just handed to her.  \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "For a little context, me and my girlfriend have been dating for 8 months now.. I'm a black man and she's half-white half-Chinese. She's the funniest person I've ever met and is a legitimately sweet and caring woman.  Safe to say, I'm in love with her, but recently our relationship hit a rough patch.\n\nOne night, she calls me and tells me to come over to her house. She usually only does this when she wants to have sex, so I jump in the car and get there quick. When I get there, it's clear that she's a bit nervous. She invites me in. I ask her what's up and we talk for a bit. She gets all flirty with me, but that's normal and whatever. Then, she finally pops the question.\n\n\"Hey, OP, can we try something different tonight?\"\n\n\"Depends. What do you want to try?\"\n\n\"I know this is gonna sound weird, but I need you to be open-minded and not judge me.\"\n\n\"I'll keep an open-mind, sure.\"\n\nShe reaches to the table behind her and brings out a pair of handcuffs. She explains to me that she always wanted to try a slave/master roleplay with me. She elaborates that she's always had fantasies about completely dominating \"a strong man like myself\", and how her status as a woman in society means that she doesn't have many chances to be \"in control\" when with a man, so she likes to play it out in the bedroom. However, as she goes on, I feel more and more on edge about the situation. Considering that I minored in African-American Studies in college and the simple fact that I'm a black man living in America, I think it's understandable that I'm a bit wary of the implications.\n\nWhen I bring this concern up, she gets defensive. She explains that this isn't a race thing and that she's done this with her non-black boyfriends in the past. She admits that she took a while to bring it up because of my race, as she didn't want me thinking she's racist. I leave, saying I need to think about it.\n\nIt's been a few days and I still don't know what to do. Ever since that night, whenever we've talked, she's brought it up and asked me if I felt that it was okay. I keep dodging the issue though. Every time she asks she seems more frustrated with me. Hell, I'm frustrated in myself for not just sucking it up and doing it for her. I get where she's coming from btw. I get that people don't really have control over what they're turned on by, I have fetishes myself that she's indulged in. However, my conscience is telling me that I can't really do this, and it's looking like this might be a dealbreaker for her and for me. She's perfect in every other way, but this fetish is so against everything I hold myself to.\n\nSo, WIBTA for wanting to break up with her over this?",

      "description": "Howdy, y’all. \n\nSo about a year ago, these 3 gals moved into an apartment in our building. We actually moved from that unit, to another in the same building. The ended up pushing their move-in date a week earlier, and bringing their parents to make demands on their behalf, but were generally polite despite requiring we suddenly clean up a week early for them. \n\nSince then, they’ve taken to ignoring us on the street. We’ve all just tried to be neighborly, but have since given up wasting time on it. The building is in a more expensive part of town, quite “unique,” and the rent is incredibly low. So “it is what it is” has become the motto for this dilapidated gem. Now, about the note...\n\nIt’s their first apartment. They’ve had issues with taking out trash for nearly their entire time here. While there are cans on the roof, most of us just go ahead and take our trash down to the dumpster. The place is owned by an older couple, and having the husband drag our trash all the way downstairs is something we and other tenants would prefer to avoid. Besides, there’s much more important work to be done around the place. \n\nBut these gals can’t even be bothered to bring their trash outside. They just let it pile up outside their door, inside the building, and stink begins to fester. So the owner eventually hauls it all the way outside and downstairs himself. I found him doing this one day, fumed over it for the night, and we wrote a note the next morning. It read;\n\n&gt;\t“Look-\n    Leaving your garbage up here is *trashy*. Leaving it up here to rot &amp; stink up the building is disgusting. But- making it such a problem that other people have to take care of it is **fucking shameful**. Get your shit together, ladies. \nSincerely,\n  Who cares, take care of **your** shit.”\n\n\n\nI feel kinda bad. The wording was strong. But the trash is gone. AITA?",

      "description": "Wife (32)/ me (33), Live in a fairly big us city. Holliday: napoli, Italy.\n\nBear with me guys, need input.\n\nMy (soon to be ex?) wife and me have been in a relationship for 7 years. We are two well-off people career-wise. My wife have a leader position in marketing, lots of social events at clubs, well paid job. i am living my dream as a fire fighter. However, i have had a shitload of inheritance, so even though she is making 7 figures a year we are equals money wise.\n\nWe have been unable to get kids. Though at first, but after a while we got used to the idea of living a double income no kids relationship, and we are focusing on work and each other, every 3 months enjoying at least 2 weeks or more of exotic hollidays.\n\nAnyway, to the point.\n\nLast couple of months my wife have started recieving texts at night. I am a fast sleeper, and normally my wife will use her phone in bed. She will also fart in bed, when she thinks i am asleep. I find this funny, so i am pretending to be sleeping and never mention. \nHowever, last 2 months increasing frequency of texting, seemingly going on for hours. At first i slept through, but after some days i kept on feeling the vibrations of her phone and started wondering. \nOne night i asked her early on who she is texting with. She just answered \"work stuff honey\" and smiled. I fell asleep, or so she thought, and she kept texting while gigling excitedly for hours.\n\nOne of the last days i couldnt help myself. In a moment of weakness i took her phone while she was out of the room, and snooped. \nI am a pretty shitty guy doing this, i know. Its just that this was something entirely new. She had the same job the last 4 years, and she never act like this for work. \n\nLook and behold, some guy she is texting with is sending pretty graphic pictures of a dick way bigger than mine. Worse, my wife is sending extremely graphic texts and PICTURES back. \n\nI didnt know what to do, feeling the need to puke and all shit falling apart around me. \n\nI did what i do best, pretended to sleep when my wife got back, and lied awake all night (listening to her texting!).\n\nNext morning i fake sleeping as she goes into work (she starts shit early and i was i the start of a 2 week of period). \n\nI dobt know what to do. I feel hatred and bitterness and sadness, but i am not up for a confrontation (this was4 days ago). So, seeing i was on a leave period from work, i go on and order plane tickets to Naples in italy. Before i go i call a locksmith to change the locks. This is my apartement (bought for some of the shitloads of inheritance money described initially), and i can do what i want. My wife still has all her clothes and some important work stuff in the ap.\n\nI hurry out, even taking a flight with a stop over in canada to be able to get the fuck out faster, and before she gets back from work. \n\nNow im in italy. Getting a lot of angry texts from wife and her side of the family. I responded one text with something along the lines of: have fun with mister big-dick, fuck off. Before i turned off my phone she wrote that we need to talk and sort things out.\n\nI am the asshole for isolating myself on another continent for two weeks? I just want to drink alot of red wine, eat pizza and escape reality. Do i have to answer? I mean i wont, but am i an asshole for escaping my problems this way?\nThank you for all advice! \n\n",

      "description": "Hey folks, first time posting here so it might be a bit long.\n\nI’m in high school right now(sophomore, but it shouldn’t matter), and am currently enrolled in choir. It’s the highest level choir we have, and performs 3 - 5 songs at every concert(we have at least 4 concerts a year). It’s a lot of work but I love it because of the work we do and the people I’m surrounded by. Anyways, right now we’re doing a concert about a lot of really tough things to talk about(LGBTQ+, racism, immigration, suicide &amp; depression, etc), and it’s a concert I feel really connected with due to a lot of past experiences I’ve had. One of the songs that another choir did brought up a lot of really hurting memories for me and I ended up bawling my eyes out about halfway through the song. People semi-comforted me, but afterwards when I stopped crying one of my friends(let’s call him Bryan) asked if I wanted to step out and talk about it. I said no because A. It’s an extremely personal family issue that got me, and not something I want to talk about unless it’s with my girlfriend or someone else I’m extremely close with and B. I just don’t like to talk about any issues I have. I know it’s unhealthy, it’s just something I do. But even after I said no he kept asking over and over, and it felt like he was annoyed that I didn’t want to talk. I don’t think he was being an asshole, but it made me feel bad because even though I didn’t wanna talk about anything, it seemed like he got annoyed that I kept saying no. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Okay, first off, I want to apologize for the possible funky formatting due to me typing this on my phone. \n\nThere was this guy—let’s call him “R”—that has been very flirty and outright with his feelings for about two years, although he got a girlfriend somewhere in that period and closed himself off. Now he’s been single for many months and positive that we are going get together soon, as told to me by one of his friends that was worried about how I felt about this belief he had. \n\nI was completely blown away. Looking back now, he had been very clearly expressing his attraction towards me since the day we met, and it just flew over my head. I have zero experience with boys so it doesn’t necessarily come as a surprise to me that all kinds of flirting and intimate gestures went completely unnoticed by me, but I was extremely panicked that it was R who was doing these things and not someone else that I could easily distance myself from. \n\nThe reason R and I had gotten along so well originally was because we were both a tad bit fucked up from our childhood trauma and resorted to humor as a coping method. The more he got to know me, the more it became obvious that my trauma was a lot worse than he expected, although that didn’t seem to deter him at all. Even after I attempted to commit suicide, he was still right there supporting me and listening to my problems. \n\nAt about the same time I discovered his feelings for me, one of my biggest secrets came out. I had been sexually assaulted repeatedly for the whole time I had known him and a year before we ever met. I was suffering from PTSD and could hardly go outside at this point, much less face him, due to the fact that one of his best friends was the man who had been abusing me all this time (R wasn’t aware of this because I’m far too scared to tell anyone who did it). \n\nAnyway, fast forward a couple weeks, and I’ve completely ghosted him. The last time we spoke to one another was when I confronted him and explained that I am scared of a good percentage of the male population and anything remotely sexual triggers a panic attack. I ended my rant with explaining that I couldn’t be in a relationship with him because I was too much of a mess and I was unsure of the possibility of entering a relationship with anyone within the next ten years because of my anxiety. \n\nHe responded with something along the lines of “we can get through it together and I can fix you” and ending it off with a “date next weekend? &lt;3” \n\nI feel extremely bad for ghosting him, especially because he’s apparently had feelings for me for a long time. But I don’t believe he understands what I’m going through and is more focused on our potential relationship rather than how I feel. \n\nSo was I correct in cutting him off or AITA for over-exaggerating my mental health issues and dismissing his feelings?",

Just let me fucking rest I'm clearly not fucking fit to make your video right now\n\nQW: You're lucky I am no Bank or a shark loaner or you will lose everything. I can give you time if you can tell me when. You promised that you will help me on Holidays cuz you need to study. Now, you're crying.\n\nI was pretty fed up at this point and wanted to think of a come back but I was too upset and tired\n\nMe: Seriously? Using the fact that I'm mentally unstable as a weapon against me?\n\nQW: I am saying that you promised me but now you're crying of whatever it's call. In this case, fine. You can delay the video. Just, try to get better.\n\nI feel like I was in the wrong in this case because I’m the one that owes him the video so tell me, am I the asshole?

      "description": "So my friend is getting over his second lung infection in a row and has been basically out of commission for 2 months. We used to go hang out quite a bit and go out and do cool things. I completely understand him being sick and know that he is unable to really go out too much. I have seen him a few times, but it is either at another friends house or at a coffee shop not to far from us, though he has turned down offers to do anything more adventurous (again which I completely understand and am fine with). \n\nTwo weekends ago he was just finishing up his strong prescription of antibiotics. We had plans to hangout. I had been recently hanging out with another friend that was just getting over the flu and was on medication so she was no longer contagious. He initially canceled on me because he was worried that I might give the flu to him despite me being perfectly healthy. My other friend had to call and explain to him that she was over the flu and not contagious. The antibiotics were strong enough to cause paranoia so again no issues.\n\nLast weekend he said he could not hangout as he still had some symptoms, but should be good by Wed. I texted him today for this weekend and he said that he thinks he might be getting a cold. I asked him if he had any cold symptoms and he said no but his professor was coughing in class... He is worried that he might get a cold and miss his trip he has planed in 8 days. He has been off of antibiotics for two weeks now. His paranoia about getting sick is driving me a bit crazy. I know that he is coming off of a bad experience and can understand why he is worried, but when does it become being a hypochondriac? I have not expressed my frustration to him, only trying to tell him that too much paranoia is unhealthy and thinking that you will become sick tends to be a self fullfilling prophecy.\n\nAm I being an asshole? I really want to make sure my friend is healthy, but am slowly being driven crazy.",

So after these 8 months, the guy, which we'll call A for simplicity, I've known him since I was 5 and we play baseball together, decides to dump the girl, G, right after school. \n\nI saw G right the next day on the school bus and she was looking sadly out of the window, normally she would be kinda happy or neutral. I didn't ask her anything as I already had some beef with A beforehand, because I said some dumb shit to him about G, thinking that it was funny I guess but being wrong.\n\nSo at school (we go to different schools) I ask my female bestfriend if anything had happened to G, and she says she has been dumped. Now a lot of people that don't really know me well think that I am just a guy who likes making people laugh and entertain people, which is true, but I also have a part of me which is concerned about the mental health of the people around me (because my Female Bestfriend once tried to, well you know) and I wanted to know if everything is alright with her.\n\nSo we start chatting and after a while I invite her to take a coffee with me at a bar on the 15th, just before the Climate Strike, to talk about her and what had happened, but she can't because she has a test. I don't think anything about it until the following day when A tells me that I'm a jerk because I invited his ex to a coffee.\n\nThank you for your time and sorry for any grammatical or ortographical errors",

      "description": "First of all I wan’t to give a little bit info.\nI am 16 and the only one in my school who likes music like The Beatles, pink floyd, boston, ELO, jimi hendrix, you get the picture. Where my classmates likes criss brown, lil pump, lil uzi, 6ix9ine, and that kind of music.\n\nI’m not the type of person to say my music is better than others because my music is older. I just like what I like. I don’t like what they like. I can here it when i’m with them because thats just what they are going to put on (they don’t want to play my music because they say its “shit”). I wouldn’t play their music at home or for myself though.\n\n\nSometimes after school we go over to a spot and smoke a little bit. Spring is comming so I got the idea to play Here Comes the Sun by The Beatles. They already knew about what I liked to listen to and I knew they would say no, but I still recomented us playing it on the speaker when we smoked. They said “no you listen to some trash music”. I answeared “you can’t say the beatles are bad they are legendary”. The one I was speaking to looked me straight in the eyes and told me “The Beatles is shit”. The others agreed.\n\nI’ve never told them their music is trash. I just told them I didn’t like it. I didn’t spit on what they enjoyed.\n\nI’m not saying they are badly raised for not liking the beatles (or same music as I like). Thats okay, you do you. But how can you say they are bad? They wouldn’t reach their legendary status if they were bad. Back in the day, before I was born you couldnt just upload your music to the internet. You needed to be talented, because you needed to get in to a record label. I don’t know all that much about how you used to do it. It IS before I was born after all. My point is you wouldn’t make it if you were shit. You can now. Proof is some of my friends made some music without ever learning what a note was and have gotton faily far. I am happy for them of cause.\n\nThem saying the beatles are shit is like me saying mozart is shit. Yeah I don’t like mozart. Yeah I wouldn’t listen to mozart. But saying mozart is bad wouldn’t make sense. Everything I listen to wouldn’t be pausible without it. \n\nYou are not badly raised for not liking something, but just saying something is bad because THEY don’t like it is my problem.\n\nDo you get what i’m trying to say? Am I the asshole? I’m really tired I think this crybaby needs a nap. I really want to know if i’m right in ANY way at all or if someone could formulate what i’m trying to say better than me, there always are.",

(I work at a fancy hotel) The employees used to park their bikes in a safe and secure spot by the clock in area in the basement, not open to the public. The bikes were perfectly fine there. One day, we were demanded to park our bikes down in the parking garage because we had just purchased a new bike rack, we weren't given a reason why. Most of the employees were unhappy about this executive decision due to the fact that our bikes were perfectly safe where they were. And you know the old saying, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” and that was exactly the case here.\n\nWe promptly followed orders and parked our bikes down in the parking garage basement, which was open to the public. My bike was always locked as well as everybody else’s. Three weeks in, one day after my shift, my bike was stolen. I know bad things happen, and I do my best to prevent things like this from happening, but I was upset, I was told our bikes would be safer there. I was hopeful that the hotel would help me cover expenses for a new bike. A day or two after the incident, all employees were immediately notified they can park their bikes in the original spot, where they are safe. \n\nThe day my bike was stolen I received a call from the director of finance about an hour after the incident. He assured me the executive team thought it would be a good idea to park the bikes downstairs in the garage, but admitted they were wrong. DoF said he would do what he could to help me get some sort of reimbursement, he repeatedly told me, “Don’t you worry, we’ll get this figured out, bud” that really helped at the time and I thanked DoF for his concern. After DoF called, I got a call from C in HR, she was sad about what she heard and strongly advised me to file a police report, which I did. She too told me, “Don’t you worry, we will get this figured out, you will get your bike back”\n\nI hadn't heard a response in 2 months and I felt avoided by staff. I got word today from a new HR director that the hotel will not reimburse me in any way. (She wasn't even employed when this happened)\n\nWe are so quick to refund hundreds of dollars to guests that complain about outside noise, a leaky shower, squeaky bed, and poor housekeeping service.\n\nBut when it comes to a stolen bike, due to a poor executive decision, where’s the love?\n\ntl;dr Bikes used to be stored in a secure area, the executive team asked all employees to move bikes in a garage downstairs, with no security, open to the public, no camera and well hidden from the public eye. It's an easy spot to steal bicycles due to its secluded location. My bike was stolen 3 weeks in, the lock was cut off, and the executive team decided they made the wrong decision in asking us to park down in the garage, all employees were immediately notified they can park the bikes in the original spot, where they are safe. My $500 Marlin Trek 5 was stolen and the hotel won't help in any way.\n\nAm I the asshole for asking my employer to help replace my bike?\n\nThank you all",

      "description": "The usual mobile formatting disclaimer applies. \n\nOkay, so I (21F) currently live with my partner (21M) in a house by ourselves. Last year we were sharehousing with another couple (21F, 21F). \n\nI used to be friends with the other couple who will be referred to as N and D. During our time sharing, our friendship sort of broke down. They treated my boyfriend very badly, told me I was too good for him, and were consistently hypocritical in what they expected him to do, vs what they would do (e.g. they wanted him to clean the lounge when it was their stuff, they would expect him to do things that they wouldn't do, clean the showers, etc) . \n\nBefore we moved in, I was very close with N, and after we moved out, I was willing to give her another chance as a friend, with the understanding that she could dislike my partner, but any negative thoughts she had about him would be kept to herself or I'd leave. \n\nI also said I'd try to mend our friendship, but she'd still not be welcome in my house, simply because my partner is not comfortable with her being in his home, and I side with him (my logic is that he pays rent, so he gets a say in who comes in our home). \n\nHowever, our wider friendship circle (who we kept out of the conflict because we didn't want them to feel like they had to choose sides) has started to comment on the fact that I never invite N to our hangouts and called me an ass. \n\nI feel like I'm respecting my partner's boundaries and his wishes about who comes in the house that he helps pay for. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not letting someone that makes my partner uncomfortable in our shared home?

      "description": "So this requires a bit of back story so bare with me. I have fond memories of growing up and visiting my moms parents. They were definitely the spoil us rotten type of grandparents. They would buy us gifts everytime we visited, would take us on beach vacations every summer, and would smother us with material things. When I was about 8 or 9 my grandparents sold their land to a big condo developer for millions of dollars. That's when I can remember things started changing. My sister who is 3 years older continued to get this treatment but I seemed to be pushed away ever so slowly. I remember that There were a few summers they only wanted to see my sister and not me. My sister would get lavish birthdays that cost thousands and every gift she wanted and I wouldnt even get so much as a card. These types of things escalated through the years even with them showing her more physical affection then I and refusing to give me a hug or say I love you.\n\nThe point that sticks in my mind is when we each turned 14 we were promised a week vacation to anywhere in the world for graduating middleschool and entering high school. My sister chose Italy and they went and gave her the royal treatment, all expenses paid, 5 star everything. When I turned 14 i said I wanted to go Japan, they simply said No, I said ok how bout Germany? Again they said no. I asked my Mom and Dad why they  acted like they loved my sister more and it seemed like they didnt love me the same. My dad and mom said they always wanted a granddaughter and not a grandson and my whole life they treated and loved her better then me. They were still well off and it wasnt a financial thing. I decided that my feelings had been hurt enough and refused to speak to them or see them anymore. When this happened they became verbally abusive to me and would leave voicemails calling me a \"fag\", a bitch and piece of shit for not talking to them. I remember one voicemail in particular my grandma said she would wait til i was asleep and cut off my balls so I would really be the victim I was acting like\n\nFast forward 2 weeks ago, i have not seen or spoken to them in 15 years. I received a facebook message from my grandpa saying \"hi matt hows my favorite grandson\" *its a joke im the only grandson* At first i wanted to respond but realized I just didnt care enough. The past few years their health has been declining so I assumed this is a last chance forgiveness thing before it is to late. I feel guilty that I still havent responded but its been so long that I really dont have any feelings about it either like...I just dont really care. I dont have any ill will towards them or anger but I feel like id be faking it if I replied all happy and excited with genuinely have zero interest in their lives right now. I know I should be forgiving and people ive talked to said that if they died tomorrow id regret it but I just dont see that being true...so what are your thoughts? AITA? ",

      "description": "Hear me out here. It’s quite possibly I am an asshole but at the time it didn’t feel like it. \n\nMy husband and I had been shopping, with our 4 month old. We returned to the car park, a large multi-storey affair and while my husband was loading up the car, I was stood next to the car with the baby in the buggy. The whole thing was less than 2 minutes and we weren’t dawdling. \n\nIn front of where the parking spaces are there’s a small walkway marked out for pedestrians to safely enter the shopping centre. This is where I was stood, with the buggy, by the car. I was in no one’s way. A space just adjacent to our car was free and a middle aged couple were manoeuvring to reverse into the space. (Crap diagram- https://i.imgur.com/oIWwpdZ.jpg - cars are blue squares. I am the red dot standing on pedestrian area next to our car) \n\nSuddenly I heard a bit of a kerfuffle and looked over, realising they were motioning and shouting at me to move. We were literally less than 30 seconds away from having baby out of the buggy and into her car seat, so I asked them to wait a minute.\n\nThey then pull their windows down and ask (well, yell really) again for me to get out of the way. My husband then said “there’s more than enough room for you to get into that space and my wife is standing on a pedestrian area.” \n\nThey huffed, but then managed to quite easily get into the space. Just as I was taking baby out of buggy they then purposefully drove forward out of the space straight at me and baby and shouted out of their window “Sorry just straightening up” \n\nAt that point I was thoroughly irritated. I shook my head at them, stared them both in the eye and gave them the middle finger because I couldn’t think of anything more inventive to be honest. \n\nI felt like a complete petulant child afterwards but there was more than enough space for them to get in, there were loads of other free spaces and we were already in the process of getting ready to leave when we arrived - they surely could have waited. \n\nAm I the asshole?   \n\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I recently moved in together. He is 25, and I am 18. We’ve been dating for four months. A couple weeks after we moved in together, I walked in on him masturbating. I kind of freaked out because I didn’t see why he needed to do that when I was in the house and he could have just had me. He explained that he sometimes wanted to just take care of himself and not go to the trouble of having sex every time he was horny. He also said that our relationship would be unpleasant if we demanded sex from each other whenever we wanted. I agreed with him and calmed down. He also had to convince me that watching porn isn’t a form of cheating.\n\nI don’t know how often most men masturbate a day, but I think my boyfriend must be above average. Since we had that talk two weeks ago, I have walked in on him masturbating five or six times. I decided to start knocking before I went into our room so that he could tell me if he was doing it. This failed because he always wears his headphones while doing it. I asked him to just watch it without the sound, but that didn’t work because he MUST have the volume on while he’s watching porn. He eventually said that he would stop wearing headphones but didn’t expand beyond that.\n\nThat just made everything worse. Now what he does is watch porn with the volume all the way up multiple times a day. We have thin walls, so I can hear it from any room in our apartment and I guarantee the neighbors can, too. Today, I stormed in on him and said that he couldn’t watch porn while I was in the house at all. He said that wasn’t fair and offered to watch without the sound, but I said things have gone to far. I no longer feel comfortable being anywhere near porn.",

Our kids like playing together and I often hear her telling them to go over to my place so she can have some peace and quiet lol.\n\nThat's ok but the thing is she doesnt bother to dress them. On the weekend, they will run around in only a nappy (diaper) and nothing else. I feel so bad for these kids they will literally be in what looks like the same nappy for the whole day. I really think they are well old enough to be using the toilet and some of the other children in the street including mine ask them why they still wear nappies. It doesn't really seem to bother them though.. the only one using the toilet is the 7 year old. \n\nThe other thing is they come inside my place without pants on and want to sit on the couch and watch tv and I feel like a arsehole coz it grosses me out these visibly wet with pee nappies and I ask them to please go home and put pants on or play outside.\n\nShould I tell their mum to pull her head in and toilet train her kids so they stop being teased at school. I have to add there is nothing stopping them from wearing underwear and using the toilet its just their mum being lazy.\nOr should I simply mind my own  business?\nAITA ?",

      "description": "I was on my way downtown to meet some friends on a nice hot summer day. I realized I forgot to eat lunch and probably wouldn't eat for a while. All of a sudden, a wild white castle appears. Of course I pull into the drive-thru and picked myself up some sliders. \n\nShortly after I got on the freeway and was stuck in some stop and go traffic. I noticed a homeless man on the side of the freeway panhandling. He approached my car and something came over me. I rolled down the window and handed him my entire sack of untouched sliders. Good, right?\n\nAs I was pulling a way to keep up with the traffic he shouted at me and asked \"Hey, do you have a drink in there?\" I did not get a drink from white castle because I had a bottle of water(trying to be healthy). I was somewhat insulted that he'd ask me for more after I gave him what would have been my lunch. I shook my head no in disgust, laughed(disappointedly) and drove off.\n\nAITA for not giving him my water?\n\nAlso, AITA for being upset that he asked me for a drink?",

      "description": "I know this seems bad, but hear me out\n\nI’ve been friends with this girl I know from school for about 4 years now, she’s the one who started talking to me, she’s basically the one who created this friendship. I found her extremely attractive, about a 8/10 to me. However she never expressed any interest in me other than as a friend. Yeah yeah, I’m friendzoned, I get it. She also has a boyfriend, so a lot of the times we hang out I’m being third wheeled. Anyways, about two weeks ago she shaved 90% of her hair off because she wanted to try a new style. I didn’t say anything, of course, because it was her choice, not my place to criticize her for how she wants to represent herself.  But I found myself WAY less attracted to her. Like, I don’t want to look at her any more. This allowed me to really be able to see her personality, rather than her body. And no, she’s not a bitch, she’s not a thot, she’s actually really nice. But she’s SO GOD DAMNED BORING. She barely ever says anything that interests me. She only talks about her weird problems that aren’t really that big. She always barely responds to my conversations. She’s basically just super dry. And I don’t really like talking to her any more. I’m not gonna ghost her, just maybe distance myself. I think that I’m probably an asshole for this, but I just wanted to hear your guys’ opinions.",

This past year I have graduated and since then been in the Army causing us to only see each other for about 2 and a half weeks in 9 months. She always tells me how much she misses physical affection and feels being loved in person. \n\nHowever, the past couple of weeks have been a change in mood with her once she met a new guy friend. She told me that they were going to go to the senior prom as friends which didnt bother me. As time went on I started to hear more and more about this guy and she would always tell me about how he comforts her and he makes her feel happy and that its nice to have someone there with her physically that cares. \n\nThe other day she told me that they went to the movies and to dinner alone together and that on the way home she held his hand in the car but she claimed it was an \"in the moment thing\" and that it didnt mean anything. After that I told her how i really felt about the situation but she is not willing to change anything. \n\nAm I the asshole for not liking their friendship and that I do not like where it is heading to?",

      "description": "This happened earlier today. I'm a Belgian teenager (16) and after the winter holidays, there was a new kid in our school. He is in the same class as my 2 best friends. They were complaining about him because according to them he's really boring and annoying. At first he followed one of the cool kids around but he just ignored and avoided him. By accident, I happen to stand next to him and decide to talk to him. He seemed a bit socially akward but not as bad as I imagined him to be. After our talk we move on.\n\nThe next day, we have recess and it's the only time our whole group can be together. After a couple of minutes of catching up with my friends, I notice the new kid standing behind me outside of our group listening to us while he was on his phone texting some people. Once my friends saw him as well they started to make eye contact with me. One of my friend decided to walk away and at first I was confused but I followed him and so did the rest of our group and the new kid. My friends got pissed that he followed them but they just kept ignoring him, moving from spot to spot. I thought that this couldn't go on so I talked to the new kid and took him away from our group. I introduced him to some new people outside of our group and I told those People (after introducing him) to take good care of him because he's new. The group I introduced him to are friends that I know like to take care of the new kids so I thought that it might work out. Later that day, during lunch, I saw the new kid hanging out with that group so I thought this mess was over.\n\nToday during recess I realize that the new kid is standing behind me again and one of my friends decides to bail again. But this time the rest stays and the new kid comes to stand in our circle. He is on his phone texting and occasionally joins our conversation By asking one question and then he goed back to textinh on his phone. I know he didn't mean to be rude but it really came over that way. Evertone realises that he's here but doesn't do anything about it. After a couple of minutes of akward silence I decide to Tell him that certain members of our group are not fond of him and that it was maybe better that he hung out with the other group. I take him to the group again and introduce him once more (there were different People in the group than the ones he met yesterday) and I informed them about the situation. They obviously said that I just wanted to drop him of here so I wouldn't be bothered. My defence was that if the new kid were to stay in our group that there would be trouble and such. (Which I didn't make up, I actually think that could have happened). I told them to really take care of him because he's new and I apologized to the new kid. He seemed disappointed but not mad.\n\nI just feel like that introducing him to new group and maybe letting him make some actual friends over there would be better than you say nothing and keep ignoring him in our group. It's obviously my mistake because I shouldn't have been so inviting as my friends told me later.\n\n",

      "description": "So basically to start, I’ve always thought I was good at creative writing. Hell it the only thing I *felt* good at. It just felt natural with me. \n\nUntil I entered creative writing class as an elective this year. I slowly started to notice everyone else was better than me and got really discouraged. I was debating whether or not to hand an assignment in when my friend, who I met in an English class last year asked to read my stuff.\n\nSo I reluctantly let her and another of our classmates read it. They praised the story. They offered criticisms of course, which I explicitly asked for. Multiple times. I even said that they should tell me if it’s straight up awful and I’ll just scrap the whole thing and start again. But no they said they liked it a lot and that it was clear, easy to read, and original. \n\nSo I trusted them and handed it in. After all, they’re better writers than me and must know what they’re talking about, right?\n\nWell either they didn’t or they lied to my fucking face. I bombed that assignment. Not only that, but the prof basically wrote in the notes section that completely went against what they said. While they said it was easy to read, clear, and original, the prof, (being an author himself) said it was clichéd, illogical, and incredibly confusing. He also said it doesn’t even sound like the writer know what he’s writing about. \n\nIt’s not the fact that he wrote that that gets me. It’s that my friend outright lied to my face. When I asked her to tell me how awful it is, if it is, multiple times. And I told her several times when we met for lunch and stuff that lying is by far the worst offence you could do to me. Aside from doing extreme things like killing my whole family and shit like that. But you get the point right? \n\nI hate being lied to. All my friends know this. I don’t care if the truth hurts. I need it. Because when I don’t hear it, I go and I embarrass myself. I feel deeply hurt and betrayed because I trusted what she was saying was true. I feel like an idiot. I’m normally forgiving but this is where I draw the line, and it’s the one thing I have a really hard time forgiving. (You could literally punch me in the face out of nowhere and I’d probably forgive you.)\n\nWIBTA if I told her I’m not going to be talking to her anymore? ",

And admittedly, part of the reason I was disgusted moreso with him than my gf was that she was clearly incapacitated while he was not so much, and we had been friends for ~10 years before this. You don’t betray someone you go back that far with, imo. \n\nMy friend group still hangs out with this guy, and when there are gatherings he will be at, I choose not to go because I don’t feel like being around the dude. However, others are saying I should get over it and come and hang out with everyone. I said I would if he’s not around, or if it’s an important event to someone (wedding, anniversary, etc.)\n\nThe old friend still tries to talk to me and apologize, and I tell him I forgive him, but I’d rather not be around him going forward. \n\nAITA for not accepting my old friend back into my life after a year?",

      "description": "My wife and I got married last year. We created a registry at Bed Bath and Beyond with all of the standard “young couple” items - plates, silverware, pots and pans, etc.  We got married fairly young and didn’t have a lot of nice, grown-up things.  My aunt is quite wealthy, very generous, and very old-fashioned.  At the wedding shower, she gave us four sets of Waterford crystal wine glasses and a Waterford vase.  She told us that “everyone needs to have a set of Waterford in their home.”  I expect that she spent about $1,000 in total. \n\nThe glasses and vase are very nice. We use the vase, but literally have not touched the glasses.  They are very fragile and they have to be washed by hand. We don’t want to use them at a party because we don’t want to break them. In short, they are a pain in the ass. \n\nI appreciate my aunt’s rationale, but I would have much rather received something from our registry, like plates and dishes. If she was going to go off the registry, and spend that much money, then I wish she had asked friends and family for some insight. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for being annoyed by my aunt’s generous, but useless, gift?",

      "description": "My wife and I recently purchased a home. We decided to finish the basement and live there while renting out the top of the house. In our search for a renter most of the applicants had pets so we decided to allow somebody to move in with a poodle and charge them a deposit and pet rent.\n\nThings have been mostly fine. Our renter mentioned there were some broken slabs in our wood fence in the backyard which we promptly fixed. Other small things have come up that we’ve fixed as well.\n\nUnfortunately, we’ve noticed that our renter doesn’t take the best care of their dog. The dog will be left in a kennel upstairs for hours during the day and it clearly has issues with this, barking constantly such that it sounds very scared. We can also hear the kennel moving around as though the dog is trying to escape. We’ve mentioned this to them, but nothing was done to resolve this.\n\nRecently, the renter’s mother came into town with her baby brother. I guess they don’t want to dog to be free in the house with the toddler around because they started to leave the dog in the kennel while the mother and brother were home. The dog’s terrified barking at being in the kennel must have bothered the mother because they started to leave the dog outside during the day. Unfortunately, the poodle received a typical poodle haircut, being shaved around the body with tufts of hair left on the head and feet. This is a problem as it can be very cold outside and the dog has been left out while it’s snowing with no dog house or shelter for it to stay warm in. I’d bring it into my part of the house but we have two cats that are terrified of dogs.\n\nThe dog has become restless and started to escape. We have a small gate on the side of the house that the dog has been squeezing through or jumping over, I’m not sure which. The renter is now insisting that we replace the gate ASAP and that she is paying us additional pet rent to keep her dog safe.\n\nAITA for taking my time replacing the gate and telling our renter that, although we’d like her dog to be safe, we have no responsibility in the matter? It’s her job to make sure the dog is well taken care of. Additionally, we’ve been clear that her pet rent and deposit is to protect our property against any potential wear and tear or damage that can occur as a result of her dog. The renter has become increasingly aggressive, suggesting that “we’ll have a problem” if her dog goes missing because it’s escaped.\n\nOn a side note, I’ve never seen her take her dog on a walk or interact with it in the backyard. She’s called it her most valuable possession, but she certainly hasn’t treated it like it.",

After dinner, i began to work on exercising, and then my dad barges in. He wants me to get off, but I'm barely even halfway done. He then proceeds to make me get off my game and go upstairs to bed. I was planning on sleeping at around ten, and I don't want to skip out on exercise even once because i fear I'll get back into my old habits again. He says sleep is more important, but I don't get as many good feelings from sleep than i do from exwrcise. Am i being irrational? Please let  me know, please and thank you",

      "description": "Notes: I'm 18, he's 17. We've been dating for almost 6 months and even though we're young, I see this becoming a long-term relationship. We've both been in relationships before and feel that this is our first \"true\" relationship. I also live in VA, which might be important when it comes to laws harboring minors and all that.\n\nI'll be calling him Adam.\n\nRecently, Adam has decided that he's running away from home. This is mainly due to his mom. She makes him pay for his own things (groceries, hospital bills) and she also leaves all the cleaning up to him, leaving him to tidy up a house that 3 other people live in (mom/stepdad/5 year-old/dog/cat). She goes out of her way to make things harder for him. He hasa job that pays well ($1600 every month) but I still think she should be buying necessities for her child.\n\nAn example would be him trying to take a shower and her deliberately turning the other shower in the house on to make the water cold. (Normally this is just an inconvenience, but he has a health issue where getting cold can cause muscle pain - he inherited this from his mother, who has the same issue).\n\nWhen he told his mom that he would be leaving, she threatened to call a mental health facility to send him to (he said the longest he would have to stay is two weeks). I can't really help him at all during this due to the fact that 1. I'm now a legal adult 2. I live right across the street from him. If his mom finds out that he's at my house or that I'm with him, she will call the police; not on me, but I think I would get in trouble.\n\nMy suggestion to him was that, as much as it sucks, his birthday is less than a year away and we could get an apartment near our high school (I'm graduating, but wanna move out for personal reasons and he'd be able to easily go to school for senior year) once he turns 18. He originally suggested this idea, but I think he wants to leave ASAP. I get it, emotional abuse is a lot to deal with, but I'm still not really okay with him just couch-hopping. I don't know a better solution, though, and I can't control what he does.\n\nHe says we can still hang out, just not where his mom would be able to see. This involves him getting out of Ubers (we don't have cars) and having to walk home because I can't be seen with him. His mom called my dad and made him aware that he plans on running away. I can't say that I'm going to hang out with him, and I don't really have other friends besides him. If I were to go out, I'd be lying to my dad. He's my only parent as of December and I'm working on building a relationship with him, and lying isn't the way to go IMO.\n\nDue to this, I don't want us to have to hang out this way. There's too much opportunity for trouble involved and I hate being secretive like this. I see it as this: Adam and I will see each other in class and we can call/text, but we can't hang out together until this all blows over. \n\nI feel bad shooting down his offers, but I don't know what to do.

      "description": "My wife and I had our separate bank accounts prior to getting married. Since I carried debt into the relationship, it was agreed that we would keep our bank accounts separate until I was able to get rid of this debt. Fast forward six years later and the debt is finally gone. It is replaced with new debt that both of us have incurred (mortgage, car payment, daycare). After talking with my financial adviser, he advised me to get rid of the easiest and most immediate debt, which was my car. He then stated that I should save at least 3 months worth of emergency money just in case something happens. After that, we should start making additional payments on the mortgage to reduce that debt as quickly as possible (my goal is to payoff a 30 year mortgage in 20 years). He also said all of this would be so much easier if both of you guys combined accounts so that you could maximize how much you save and how much you can pay towards a debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've brought this up with my wife on several occasions and she has been apprehensive at best about the idea. She responded by saying that she would offer any passwords to her bank accounts, but I told her exactly what the financial adviser told me. I stated that I trusted her, I didn't need or want to check her bank accounts and this was just about paying off debt so that we better manage our money. I also told her that if she doesn't feel comfortable combining our bank accounts, I would drop it, but I need to know so that I can manage my money as well.She didn't give me an answer and I haven't broached the subject again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs of now, the amount of money we pay for our living expenses is skewed. I pay much more monthly than she does (I pay for the house, insurance and car totaling $1700) and she pays for daycare, utilities, cell phone and groceries ($1300). I would also like more equity in the amount of money we are paying as I have asked several times for her to setup a transfer of $200 a month for house payments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for asking her to combine bank accounts and should I just completely drop the topic?",

      "description": "Posted this under a different account somewhere else and it got removed so here I am.\n\nTo sum it up, my boyfriend left his laptop open with an anime gif up on it. I went over to look and he was logged into an anime subreddit, so I clicked his profile history and he's very active in that community. This was weird because he never mentioned an interest in anime before. I didn't say anything but I started paying more attention and the next time he left his laptop open I seen he had an account on an anime viewing website and has watched *alot* of series.\n\nHe works in a lumber yard and is the exact opposite guy you would think would like anime. I asked him about it and he admitted he was a big fan and that he never told me because people look down on the community so we left it at that\n\nBut in all honesty it does somewhat lessen my attraction to him. I find it really childish, we're both in our twenties and I'd like my partner to be a bit more grown up and masculine. I used to watch some when I was a teenager but I feel like we should be past that now. I have trouble seeing him as the rugged guy I used to see him as even though I wish it wasn't like that. I know it's probably petty in the big picture, but I'm thinking about asking him not to watch it or to cut back.\n",

You also cab sit down on your terrace. And thats why (his city) is the greatest city.\"So when I talked to him about hit I said that I thought he made it so on purpose to be funny. He didnt so now he was a bit angry (we were 5 people in the conversation) then the other 3 started making jokes about it to and he got angrier and started throwing bottle through the room. I then said jokingly that we now have to watch bc he maybe hit us someday. After that he threw the bottle right at my face abd i had to go home. I was just wondering because yes i made fun of him a bit but I dont think i deserved to get hit with a bottle! What do you think? ",

      "description": "Okay, some background. I (24m) live with my so (23f) and we rent. We both work. \n\nWe had a rental inspection today (Wednesday), so spent most of the weekend cleaning/tidying the house to prep for that. I called in sick on Monday in order to spend extra time getting the house ready. We usually split the chores between us and assign rooms - I do the lounge room, bedroom, and toilet, she does the kitchen, shower  and outside. \n\nmy SO doesn't like it when I wash her clothes, because I (and I admit, this is true) make too many mistakes choosing cycle time/heat/wash-variables and have ruined things in the past. Fair enough. While tidying the house I collected all of her dirty laundry and stuffed it in bags and put it in a corner. There was about 3 of those big blue Ikea bags. I packed them neatly in a corner in the bedroom and otherwise the room was tidy. \n\nTuesday morning, I asked her if she could start to go through and do a laundry load of her clothes, and then went off to work. Tuesday is her day off so she was going to spend it all cleaning. I got home pretty late that day, about 11:30 and was dead tired. When I got home, I found she had opened all the bags and clothes were completely scattered all over the floor of the bedroom. In addition, it didn't look like she had made any progress on the kitchen or outside. Because I was so tired I went straight to bed and pretty much fell asleep right away (It was a long, crappy, hot (Australia) day and my office has no aircon)\n\nI woke up the next day and didn't mention anything, but after I got showered/dressed I started to tidy the room again. The inspection guy turned up at 9 AM and the house was still a mess. Additionally, my SO had decided to take a shower (without telling me) about 10 minutes before he showed up. \n\nI showed him around the house and so on, except we couldn't see the shower because my SO was in there, and at the end he told me he saw no major damage but we should make more of an effort to keep the house tidy and he mentioned to make sure all rooms were 'available.' I don't know if this is just my suspicious personality (is it?), but if I was a rental inspector and my tenant happened to be showering at the appointed inspection time, i'd be pretty suspicious what was in that room they didn't want me to see. The room was all clean/tidy though, so there was nothing to hide. She was genuinely just showering.\n\nOnce he had gone and my SO came out of the shower, I asked her (perhaps a mistake) why she had messed up the room so much after i cleaned it. She absolutely went off on me, saying it was my fault because I asked her to do her laundry, ect. We got into a bit of a fight, and I told her that I didn't appreciate her messing up a room after i spent all day Monday working to make ti ready for the inspection. I didn't mention the fact she didn't seem to have done her part of the house at all, but I was thinking it. She said she doesn't 'understand' how it can take me so long to clean 'a few rooms' and that she could have it done in 40 minutes. This made me feel utterly crap and unappreciated, so i said 'Next time, you can do the whole house then' and left for work. \n\nMy bus to work is about an hour so i've been mulling this and feeling crappy that whole time, and as soon as I got to work I wrote this post.

I’ve explained over and over to my friends and family that I’m not a Christian, I don’t believe anything in the Bible, therefore I don’t see a reason to participate Christmas. \n\nThis recently became a bigger issue than I think it should have when one a group chat that my SO and I are in started asking if anyone wanted to sign up for secret Santa. I couldn’t reply because I was at work so my SO took it upon themselves to sign me up without consulting me first. I’m all about gifting with friends/family and the idea of togetherness, but I celebrate that all year. I had no interest in participating. So I privately asked the person who started the sign up to take me off the list, then asked my SO to please not do that without asking me first.\n\nMy SO proceeded to spitefully tell the group chat and suddenly I’m “a grinch” and should want to participate with friends and I look like an asshole in front of everybody. But I don’t think I should be ostracized because of my religious standpoint and not wanting to participate. I host parties all year long with friends and family, I help them out in practical ways whether it be financially, materially, or just listening or lending a helping hand. I don’t think that my relationship to others should be tarnished because I didn’t buy a $25 gift for someone that they probably wouldn’t have needed or wanted anyway. \n\nSo AITA because I don’t celebrate Christmas and I don’t want to participate?

My needs are met, plus a little extra fun money and a vacation fund I manage to meet my goal on every year. I actually love the pace of it and always having twelve different deadlines to meet, I find it very invigorating. Honestly, everything about my job is perfect except for the way that people perceive it. I've gotten a lot of reactions along the lines of \"Oh, really? That's not what I would expect from you,\" probably because I am an outspoken feminist and people don't expect me to be in a job that's considered \"women's work,\" especially one where there is the perception that I am subservient to a male attorney. *I* know my job is more than making appointments and fetching coffee (not that there's anything wrong with that either,) but I have to admit that these little digs get to me. I've got pages of information on law school bookmarked even though I'm certain I don't want to be a lawyer. Usually it's enough for me to be happy with myself, but it absolutely stinks to be told repeatedly that I should be doing \"more.\"\n\nAnyway. One of my lunch buddies is an attorney and a couple of months ago he said he had a friend who would be great for me. I met him for coffee and we hit it off like I had never done before with anyone, and within a couple of weeks of the best dates and conversation I've had in my life, we decided to date exclusively. And my new boyfriend is, you guessed it, an attorney.\n\nHe doesn't even work at my firm, but the optics are terrible. And let me tell you that people have not been shy at all about pointing it out. One woman in document services told me I can quit and be a housewife now that I've \"pulled one.\" I've been asked how short a skirt I had to wear to get his attention. I know for a fact that there's been plenty of talk going around of me being a gold digger. Worst of all, someone started a rumor that I trade oral sex for longer breaks. Even my own mother told me that maybe now I should think of quitting and getting into \"a more family-oriented mindset.\"\n\nI don't want to give up on this relationship because my boyfriend is truly amazing. I know it's early, but I want to see where this goes. He's got a kindness to him that is so modest and genuine, and has such a wonderful outlook on life, and I feel like our personalities complement each other a lot because I am more bombastic while he is a bit softspoken, and I just...really like him. And knowing that people see me as a gold-digger who hikes up her skirt to get attention from some sleazy attorney absolutely kills me. I don't want people to think that I \"pulled an attorney.\" I don't want to have to deal with the sideways glances and whispers that stop the second that I enter the room. Part of me wants to end it while it's still early so there will be as little hurt as possible. I don't want to be two years into this relationship and be dying inside because I'm \"that girl\" at work. Would I be the asshole if I threw in the towel and said \"You did it, society, you beat me down.\"",

      "description": "Back when I was about 8 years old or in primary school, I had tons of tuition and enrichment lessons, as would any Asian kid. During the swimming lessons I would take a mouthful of water before resurfacing to spit it all out fountain style. I know that sounds pretty disgusting and tbh it is, but not for me back then. During a lesson, the swimming coach finally had enough of me for not listening to him to not do the aforementioned action and for the second time, grabbed me and splashed water in my face for more than a minute, last time was shorter, I could hardly breathe and when I got freeze ran to my mom and never went back, despite the main swimming instructor apologizing for his friend's actions and offering to teach me alone by himself (he was a much nicer guy overall). This happened in a public pool btw. \n\nI chose to never return there or see the coaches ever again after running away. But AITA for not listening to my coach and pushing him to splash water in my face for a minute which resulted in me being unable to breathe?",

I have made sure, or so I thought, that she didnt think we were a thing because I've been in a legitimate relationship for over a month now.\n\nI told her that's she's a good person and all, but I just dont like her that way. I mentioned the fact that there is a 3 year age gap, on top of the fact that I have a gf. She completely blew her lid, saying how I've been using her and how she's going to ruin my relationship. The kicker is my gf knows about this and thinks its absolutely hysterical. I was just wondering AITA?",

      "description": "Hello guys, this is a little weird, I don't know much about autism so I don't know if what I did was wrong or not, everyone seems to think I was an asshole, you tell me what you think.\n\nI'm currently on my second year of college and I happen to have a class with a professor that I know has Asperger Syndrome. He seems like a regular guy, he's a good professor and overall chill dude, but he tends to give his opinion about \\*\\*everything\\*\\*, he makes weird harmless comments like ''Wow your glasses are too big for your face'', ''You walk weird'', ''Your hair looks messy'', etc. In my case he just told me in a regular basis that I dressed ''weird'' because I always wear a jean jacket, I didn't pay him much attention and usually just laughed or ignored him, and pretty much all of my class did the same and didn't complain even if they felt bothered.\n\nWell, a few weeks ago, we were in class and I needed help with something and he suddenly said ''Wow you have a moustache'', I'm a girl so I felt a little embarrassed that he said that to me, but as usual I just laughed and shrugged it off, but then I think he noticed it bothered me because he started telling me the same thing everytime he saw me, even in front of the whole class he referred to me as ''the girl with the moustache'', day by day I literally shaved my not even visible moustache because I didn't want people in my class to laugh at me or my professor to comment on it, but nope, it didn't work.\n\nLast week, when he commented on it again I decided to call him out on it, it went something like this, P for Professor, Me for me.\n\nP: Wow you still have your moustache.\n\nMe: Yeah, so do you, everyone does, I also have eyes and arms.\n\nP: Yeah, but it's weird when women have moustaches.\n\nMe: It's not weird, it's natural.\n\nAfter that he kinda just laughed and left, and I thought it'd be the end of it but NOPE, every single class he commented on it, and even people from other classes knew about it. Today while at class I overheard him tell people some other things, I heard him tell a girl that she had a zit and a friend of mine that he was fat, he shrugged it off but he seemed a little upset about it, so when the time came for him to make fun of my ''moustache'', I told him that I was disappointed in him, when he asked why and I told him that I was disappointed that he was making people feel bad because of their physical attributes, he remained silent for a moment and then he said that he had Asperger and that he can't control what he says and just walked away.\n\nAll my friends told me that I was an asshole for telling him that and that I should've let him say those things because he has Asperger, the cherry on top is that apparently today is World Autism Awareness Day, I swear I didn't know but I still think that he perfectly knew what he was doing and he knew he was making people upset, so AITA?",

The issue is more that my friend says that if I want to travel on my own it means I don’t love my boyfriend and I should break up with him. She says it’s because if I truly loved him I’d want to do things with him and that she thinks he’s pretending he’s ok with it when he’s not. She thinks I should go with him. I always felt that if a relationship which isn’t co-dependent is the strongest. \n\nAm I the asshole or is she the asshole?

      "description": "So, if you’ve seen my comment history, you’d know that my mom is an anti vaxxer. Fun. For moths I’ve been trying to convince her through text that having this mindset could severely make her youngest son ill. She didn’t listen to me, saying stuff like “the CDC is being constantly sued because of vaccine injuries” and shit like that.\n\nOne day, I decided that if she wasn’t gonna listen to me, she MIGHT listen to someone who can easily get data that my mom is wrong. So, I asked one of my friends (let’s call them “Cream”) to text my mom and confront her about her horrible way of thinking. Cream agreed, and I gave them my mom’s phone number.\n\nCream basically said, in one big text to my mom, “Hey, I’m one of [insert real name here]’s friends. He’s been really concerned about you being an antivaxxer, and I have some data here which could be useful in convincing you that having this mindset is wrong. As a mother, I know that you’re concerned for your son’s’ safety, but you’re putting your youngest child at risk by not vaccinating him.”\n\nAn hour later, my mom responded, and she was PISSED. She basically told Cream a story about a friend she knew whose two month old baby died after getting vaccinations, saying that Cream should be lucky that “their child isn’t dead” Cream is the same age as me, and surprise, ISN’T EVEN A MOTHER. The only reason my mom said that thing is because she most likely thought Cream was referring to themselves when they said “as a mother”, when in reality, they were referring to my mom. She basically concluded by saying that Cream had to stay away from me, or else she’d launch an investigation on Cream for “interactions with a minor”. (My mom considers the age that someone isn’t a minor anymore at 21. Tragic). \n\nCream was sort of afraid initially due to the response, but calmed down after a bit and didn’t blame me for anything regarding the conversation, thank god. But then, my mom texted me, saying that a stranger texted her about her personal life, and that she wanted nothing to do with me because she thinks I “betrayed” her. I apologized to her, saying that I only did it because she refused to listen to me. She never responded, and I don’t even know if she read my apology.\n\nNow, I just have to know... am I the asshole here for what I did? I really wanna know your thoughts on the matter. Thanks for listening.",

      "description": "Some context: My ex \\[23M\\] and I \\[21F\\] dated for 3.5 years, broke up in February. It was a long time coming from December when he essentially accused me of trying to cheat on him with a high school friend of his. I wasn't and the accusation hurt me so much that a lot of the love I had for him kind of shriveled up right there, despite him expressing remorse about doubting me. That was the big nail in the coffin, but there was a longstanding history of us just not meeting each other's needs with varying degrees of both us being the asshole at times.\n\nRegardless, he still wanted to be together and \"come back\" from it. We lived together, I was in no place to move out and I wanted to believe that such a long and otherwise really good relationship could come back from that. The truth was I couldn't come back from it, and we mutually broke up 2 months later. During this time is where the apologies in question happened.\n\nWe have very different views on what makes a genuine and good apology, let alone if one should even be given, and we've discussed it at length. He asserts he doesn't believe in apologies. He does believe in accountability and reconciliation, so while he communicates that he is regretful about how things ended up and hurting me, he won't just say \"I'm sorry\". His rationale is that \"I'm sorry\" is how people deflect consequences and accountability, and real accountability is \"making sure it never happens again\"..\n\nThus, all of his apologies hinge on him making up for the transgression by bettering future interactions on the same terms. I find this unsatisfactory since he used that line as we were breaking up, when those terms of us being a couple no longer exist. There is no longer any context where he can, by his own logic, make up for it. Sure we're amicable, but it's not as if he repeat the transgression and accuse me of cheating on him a second time! He also kept saying \"I wish it wasn't this way, but you're a very smart girl and I know I'll never have to worry about you \\[succeeding\\].\" Which just felt odd to me and was not at all comforting.\n\nI've told him that not hearing \"I'm sorry\", along with his views + actions, has made me feel repeatedly over the years that he isn't actually remorseful and is incapable of acknowledging he hurt me. We've argued recently about apologies again because I brought it up. I shouldn't have bc it was bitterness-fueled, but I basically expressed everything here and he still didn't budge on his apology or views.\n\nAITA for thinking this final apology rings hollow?\n\nTL;DR: My bf of 3 1/2 years, now ex, doesn't believe in saying \"I'm sorry\", but tries to apologize with \"It won't happen again\". Since it definitely won't happen again, we're not dating, this apology seems almost like a cop-out to me, among other things. I feel my pain and response to him went and is going unacknowledged, so I'm kind of resentful despite us still being in contact and otherwise friendly.",

      "description": "Two years ago I bought a drumkit because I wanted to find a hobby that I enjoyed and that was good for relieving stress. At first I didn't realise how loud drumming was really going to be, and fair enough; it's loud.\n\nAs you can probably guess, the neighbour started complaining about the noise due to it preventing him from being able to sleep since he works night shifts. (For the record I live in a semi detached house but my room is on the other end that isn't connected to the neighbour and our house is on the end of the drive.) I was a little annoyed but I understood that listening to a drummer that has no idea how to play for hours would be really annoying even during the day.\n\nI made sure to play during the weekend and during the weekdays I'd only play for about a hour and a half after 4 but before 7 as I assumed that was a reasonable time. Things were alright for a while and as I got better, it didn't sound as bad as I learned to control how much power I put into my hits.\n\nHowever all of a sudden (after a good year of nothing) he started complaining again because his adult daughter moved in with them and she works graveyard shifts as well and can't sleep. By this point I'm working a 9-5 job so by the time I get home I can only really play for up to an hour before it's 7 and I stop. I want to soundproof my room so it's not as bad but I get my first paycheck on the 25th which means that until then I can't do anything about it.\n\nI've had problems with being able to play since October up until about 3 weeks ago because my cymbals cracked from shitty playing and it started becoming difficult to play for longer than 10 minutes without my arms cramping up due to those cymbals being uneven and difficult to hit. Keep in mind that drumming for me at this point has become a part of my life. Without it I have no other way to vent and I can be rather irritable. \n\nPoint is, I feel like I've already toned down my play time to a reasonable amount during a reasonable time of day and he's still finding a reason to complain about it. Soundproofing might not even help all that much because you'll still be able to feel it. This means I can't play again till I'm able to afford the stuff I need to keep the noise down because if he reports me I could get fined or they could even take the drumkit away, and I've sunk over £2k into it at this point.\n\nAITA for wanting to enjoy my hobby even after I compromised the hell out of my schedule for my neighbour? Honestly at this point I'm considering just giving up on the whole thing because someone's always gonna have a problem with it.",

      "description": "So I have had this friend, let’s call her K, for about three years now. We’ve never really argued or had any spats, but I guess looking back a lot of parts of our friendship were rather toxic (she would demean me a lot and was generally a super negative person) Anways 6-8 months ago I added her to a groupchat with all of my closest friends because I wanted her to get to meet them and talk to more people she had stuff in common with! It went great at first and everyone got along and I was really happy to see my friends like each other! About a month ago K and I got in a fight. It was over her new boyfriend and how I didn’t necessarily like him too much, which she called me out on because I would be quiet any time she brought him up and ignored every insta post with him. She lashed out at me and said I didn’t know anything about him or their relationship and claimed I was jealous that I wasn’t talking to her as much. I calmly explained every reason I was upset at the time and I thought that was the end of that. After our fight she started lashing out at me in the groupchat. She would say I was a shitty person, send tweets I made to the gc to mock me and would change the topic literally every time I talked. I tried to bring it up to her but she wouldn’t even text me back. The last straw was when she said in the groupchat she didn’t feel bad that I was assaulted so I simply removed her and blocked her on all forms of social media. She texted me almost immediately asking why I removed her and that she was upset because she was friends with a bunch of girls in the chat. Should I have just kept my mouth shut like I had before and tried to keep peacemaker for the sake of the friend group?",

I used to game my ass off, probably as much as one can without losing touch with school and other responsibilities. I cannot do this much anymore because, work/school/other things hold my interest more. The next Elder Scrolls will suck be back in for about six months and then I'm good for a while.  FWIW, we are a PC gaming household.\n\nMy 10 year old like many kids loves Fortnite. I see some problems with it from an addiction standpoint as well as from a financial standpoint. The Vbucks model is problematic to me as a parent because it is too easy to want to spend all one's money. We have not had any major problems with this yet, but every season, I get more requests for Vbucks and the desire to buy more things in-game and not just enjoy the game for what it is.\n\nHis practical access during the school year (because we have a regular regimen of after school physical activity- BJJ and gymnastics) is about one hour of screen time per day, plus maybe 10-20 minutes of YouTube time right before a reasonable bed time. However, I am thinking of limiting his Fortnite time.

      "description": "My parents have 4 kids: my older sister(23), myself(21F), and my two younger brothers(19 and 17). My sister and I both moved out within the last couple years, so my brothers, who have never gotten along, are the only two kids still there. Without going into detail, my family dynamic is screwy. Myself and my brothers don't usually talk to our parents beyond the surface-level \"how's life?\" kind of stuff. My sister gets along with my parents a LOT better than we do, but she isn't oblivious to what we had to put up with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell. My sister, mom, and I were sitting at the table when my mom disclosed that my 19 year old brother had recently(within the last month) been diagnosed with clinical depression and has started medication and solo therapy. Before I go on, let me say that I am extremely happy that he is open to accepting this kind of help. My parents tried a similar thing with me when I was 16 but insisted on atteding every session, which just exacerbated the problem. I know this is at least part of why I feel the way I do about this whole thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I told my mom that I'm happy that he's getting the help he needs, but I'm a little uncomfortable hearing this from her. I told her that this is his struggle, and a very personal one at that. I made sure to express that I know she needs a place to vent and how I understand that it must be tough on her as a mother, but knowing my brother I don't think he'd want us to know, at least without him knowing we know. She looked a little hurt, but said she understands and appreciates the honesty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course I care about my brother, but he is his own person. I live out of state so we only see each other a few times a year, but he's vented to me plenty. He knows I'm there for him. On one hand, I'm glad I know because this could open the door for me to continue to help as a part of his support system. On the other hand, I know my brother. If he wanted to include us in this, he would have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom has always wanted a close-knit, big, happy, nuclear family. But we are not. My sister says I was too harsh, but I truly don't think my brother would want us in on this, and if he did he would include us in his own way, when he's ready. I want to respect his privacy, but after this conversation I'm struggling to define the line at which family overrules privacy. Should I apologize to my mom? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Sorry for any mistakes, English isn’t my first language.\n\nI recently started working at an LGBT youth center. Aside from organizing a lot of fun events, we also try to educate people about different things (sexuality, STDs, queer history, etc.) and take care of various kids who have trouble at home because their parents don’t accept their sexualities. It‘s honestly a wonderful organization and I just love working there.\n\nThe other day I met up with some friends. I talked about how much I love my new job and they all agreed that it sounds great. There was one guy however (he‘s a friend of a friend, not sure why he even brought him along) who didn’t really... understand the point of the organization. He said it‘s not right to segregate children from each other because of their sexuality and there’s no need to send them to different youth centers since every center can essentially do what we do too.\n\nI tried explaining to him that not all youth centers do what we do and that it’s important for young LGBT kids to have safe spaces but he disagreed. At some point I really didn’t feel like arguing or justifying their importance to a random dude anymore so I just said „And what makes you think a straight guy‘s opinion on this subject matters?“\n\nHe got super offended, telling me he can comment on whatever he wants to despite being straight and that if the roles were reversed I‘d call him homophobic.\n\nI didn’t think much of it at the time but now I‘m wondering if my reaction was a bit extreme. For the record, I don’t actually believe someone shouldn’t be allowed to state their opinion because of their sexuality but sometimes it might be better to just LISTEN to people from marginalized groups and not add your own two cents, especially when you have no idea what you’re talking about.",

      "description": "Hello everyone! Last thursday I let my friend borrow my newly stringed acoustic guitar for his music class final because it had lighter gauge strings and thus easier to play. A short hour later he returns with the guitar, new strings broken. I tell him it’s no big deal, I’m not mad, I just want him to pay $30 for the new strings. He agrees so we take it to my local guitar center to get fixed up. \n\nFast forward to this tuesday. I went in and asked on monday when the guitar would be ready since i was leaving town for spring break on wednesday and wanted to take it with me. The tech said it’d be ready tuesday so I let my friend know ahead of time that he’ll have to take me around noon to pay for and pick up my guitar. Tuesday comes around and it’s noon and I hear nothing from him. An hour later he texts me and it turns out he was busy having sex with his girlfriend and now couldn’t take me because he had class. Now I’m pretty mad because I don’t really have any time on wednesday to deal with it and I had told him before hand so he’d be ready. \n\nNow it’s wednesday, I was leaving at 2 in the afternoon but I had a final at 11am so he said he’d pick up the guitar for me in the morning and drop it off. He picks it up at noon and goes home with it instead of driving it to my house and dropping it off. It is now time for me to leave and he’s busy writing an essay he should’ve done earlier and I have to leave without my guitar. I am, at this point, fuming. The one thing I asked for was for him to give me my guitar back before I’m gone for a few weeks on vacation. \n\nI let him know how mad I am at him and then both him and his girlfriend text me saying how rude and unreasonable I am being and how much of an asshole I am. Now I’m even more upset because I feel like they don’t even give a shit about me, my feelings, or my property.\n\nSo, reddit, am I really the asshole? :(",

      "description": "I've been with my fiancee for a total of 6 years now. With most couples, there were many ups and downs, and a couple close breakups. She is totally the light of my life and being with her makes my life that much more incredible.  Every time I bring up the subject of divorce, and my opinion that men seem to have to foot the bill, even when the other half is working, it leads to an argument. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer stance on it is that she was with me and supported me when I had nothing ($500 and a 200,000 mile Honda civic to my name) and she is with me now making a very comfortable amount of money with a retirement and that if I'm worried about divorce, we shouldn't get married.  In the unfortunate event of divorce, I'm all for actually splitting the assets 50/50 since we go out of our way to even split major expenses. My thought process is, I wouldn't go after her retirement, why should mine be on the table? In my line of work, I have numerous co-workers who lost upwards of 10-15 years of their retirement due to divorce (C.A)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to protect my retirement?",

      "description": "I live downtown in one of the few areas with housing. The street has pay parking but many (not all) of the homes here have driveways. We have no lawns, so the driveway is between homes or a home and a building.\n\nI moved here four years ago. I didn't have a car (nor know how to drive) back then. My neighbor who I only know in passing asked me if he could park in my driveway since I don't use it. He doesn't have one. They have a family of 5 and I'm just on my own, so why not save them some money? I agreed.\n\nAnyways, in September I finally got my own wheels and made mention to my neighbor I need the driveway now. My driveway fits two cars front to back, but it's not a perfect situation since one car needs to move to let the other out/in. He wasn't too pleased but it's my driveway and he conceded this fact. He stopped using it.\n\nFor a little while at least. Many times I'd find his car in my driveway over the last several months, at least once a week. I had to use street parking in the interim. I would knock on his door, even get in touch with his landlord, and either get no response or a \"I'll sort it out\" which leads nowhere.\n\nTo get to the point, two days ago my neighbor parked in my driveway. He parked just deep enough that I could park in front of him, blocking him in. He came by screaming and I refused to move it until he compensated me the $272 in parking I've accrued. I've kept parking tabs, took photos of his car in my driveway, etc so I have proof of his bullshit. Technically what I'm doing is illegal (it's considered a road obstruction) but it's been two days and he has not retaliated, at least not yet.\n\nAITA for being petty like this? He and his family have had to use mass transit since. I don't plan on moving until I get my nearly $300 back or cops come and tell me to I guess. I won't budge otherwise.",

SO i said something like: if you dont want to help me, maybe you shouldnt be with me.

With time my mom started to hate me and my stepdad took advantage of that by starting to sexually molest me while I was under age. Needless to say this left me with wild depression, anxiety and even the S- word. By the time I was time my parents wanted me to basically leave the house and they made it clear so by the time I was fifteen I was already working. My depression became so bad that eventually I ended up going to a therapist against my mom's wishes because it was making me so depressed my stepfather had basically cut my communication with my family and my mom had encouraged my half sisters to hate me. With my therapist which was a god-sent. I learned to get some self-confidence back and it was able to separate myself from my family but I wasn't able to move out until I finish college and find myself a full-time job. Now that I'm gone my family wants to make this fake Happy Family Image which I'm sick and tired of. I still love my mom but I can't be around them.

Another complicating factor was I found out I had genital herpes and he was afraid he caught it (turns out he didn’t).\n\nHe said I was a bad person and was throwing a pity party for myself over my reasons for cheating and some other angry and hurtful words, then blocked me for two months before reaching back out to me recently when he found out I had continued talking to his mom.\n\nHe says he forgives me and is sorry for the hurtful things he said and did and would like to sit down and talk like adults and let it go and be at peace for his mental health. He claims to still be troubled by it and still feels suicidal, but I don’t feel this is my responsibility at this point or that I have to forgive him for the things he said or see him again to talk.\n\nTL:DR - Cheated on ex with three people, he got angry and blocked all contact, now wants to talk and let it go for his mental health, but I don’t feel I should have to.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I work at a company with my friend, B. We work in separate departments but meet up on one of breaks to chat. Lately, I have also taken an interest in pro-wrestling, and B has made it clear that she does not want to talk about wrestling, and random side-bit that comes into play later, a few positions have opened in our company that we are both interested in applying to.\n\nMy slip-ups on wrestling (all on our break):\n\n1. Another coworker who also likes wrestling came over and he and I talked at length about it. Once he left, I apologized because I didn’t realize how drawn out that conversation would get.\n\n2. I mentioned I was irked because a wrestler that is similar to B got booked poorly. Ended, talked about other stuff.\n\n3. Talked about how my mom freaked out when I mentioned I may want to try out wrestling. Point of it was how my mom freaked out.\n\n4. Mentioned how I found it funny that another coworker who is fit and is interested in training for it is worried about being sore, compared to me who is not in shape.\n\n5. I showed her a video of a wrestling fan in a Q&amp;A having a comical breakdown. The only relevance to wrestling is that it deals with wrestlers. [Reference](https://youtu.be/jKECiyIsq3I)\n\nNow about the job positions, I was thinking about two, the Trainer position and Inventory Specialist. After consideration, I figured Trainer wouldn’t be a good fit since I wouldn’t be a good advocate for the company especially in front of new hires. B thinks I’d be a good fit, and mentions it each day for about the past week, even though I’ve voiced my concerns about trying to promote the company in a good light. Now B is also interested in the Inventory Specialist position I’m applying for, which I said I could see her doing.\n\nThis conversation happened today:\n\nMe: You’re gonna be disappointed in me, I don’t think I’m going to apply for Trainer\n\nB: Okay, just be aware both me and C are both applying for it\n\nMe: Wow geeze, way to lay the smackdown on me, listing off all the competition\n\nB: Well I just think you’d be a good fit for the Trainer position\n\nMe: Okay, can we respect that I may not want to apply for Trainer?\n\nB: Can we respect that I don’t want to talk about wrestling?\n\nI will say that I’ve slipped up a bit with the wrestling remarks, and  I did apologize after, but I feel like at least 3 of the points above aren’t really ABOUT wrestling, and yeah, I won’t talk about it anymore, but is it really appropriate to throw that at me when I’m trying to ask for some space on trying to find a good job for myself? B’s first line kinda struck me a bit and not sure how to take it. It’s either:\n\nA. She doesn’t think I can get it, which irks me a bit because friends should be supportive.\n\nB. She’s threatened by me and trying to make me think twice about applying (I hate this idea, since it feeds into ego, and I really try to avoid that).\n\nWell, that’s the lot of it. Am I the asshole, is B? Maybe we both are",

      "description": "For reference I went to a private, Baptist school, in a fairly large city in the south, with a majority white student body. There were only 60 kids in my graduating class, and about 200 total in the high school. \n\nHomecoming is a BIG deal to our school. Big competitions between grades and tons of stuff that didn’t really matter to anyone else except us. We loved it. I think it ended up getting so competitive my senior year, that they took a lot of the stuff out after my class graduated. Just people taking it way too seriously, I being one \n\nOur grade, they decided on the costume theme for our music day as hip hop. \n\nI heard some of my boys say they had decided to dress as the mother fucking NWA, and come to our BAPTIST SCHOOL as the NWA for homecoming. This was toeing a strange racist kind of line. None of us were extremely rich, but none of us were poor I’ll give you that much, and we did not identify with the struggles of the NWA in any shape or form. This felt like a really bad scenario all around, and I wanted to put a stop to it, I felt like it could really reflect poorly on our school if word got out about it, I was also low key worried that some idiot may come in black face. \n\nFirst I took it to the lead girl who was a student and had headed all of this up. I told her my concerns, and she basically said I hadn’t helped with input up until this point so why did I want to change it so badly now. We talked together with the teacher who was leading our grade, and she understood but didn’t think it was worth changing. That’s when I took it to the vice principal. This was a day or so before we were supposed to execute this theme. \n\nHe was not happy, he was not happy it was approved and he was not happy that he hadn’t heard about it. Also this guy was a dick, and he always gave me trouble about everything so I hated him. I wasn’t kissing his ass, and I wasn’t throwing my friends under the bus, I was genuinely worried we would be the next story on the news if this came to happen. \n\nSo finally everyone starts accusing me of being an asshole, and thinking I was “Holier than thou” and saying that I ruined the theme. Saying I thought I was such a good Christian but really I was out hooking up with girls and doing general misbehaving. I didn’t think I was a good Christian. It had nothing to do with my morals being superior. I just really thought it was a stupid idea, and I didn’t want us to all be the next laughing stock of the south. \n\nWe avoided the crisis, we checked down to a Christmas themed homecoming, and ended up taking first place. It was forgotten about by all in a week, as kids so often do. \n\nI’m 21 now, was 18 ish then. \n\nWas I the asshole?",

Sorry for had formatting, I’m on mobile.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for a few months now, and she makes me incredibly happy. She originally had gotten out of a bad relationship a few months prior me asking her out.  This ex, let’s call them X, has just started hanging out with her again. Let’s call my girlfriend G.\n\nSo G and X have been hanging out for a while, which I’m fine with. I’m a bit jealous, but fine. But X seems really really close with G, almost... too close. X is baking G food, buying them gifts, etc. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable since I know they still have feelings for eachother. (G told me.) \n\nI’ve tried going up to X, but she’s incredibly fake. She’ll be really nice and joke with me, and even start to even bring ME things to get her to not hate her. I don’t really know what to do, since I don’t want to be an asshole to her for no reason, especially since she’s been so nice to me lately. \n\nI’ve talked to G and she understands, but she assures me nothing is going to happen. I’m actually kind of afraid that I’m the rebound... I don’t really know what to do since I don’t want it break it off with G. \n\n\n\nThanks. If you have any questions let me know.\nBison\n",

      "description": "So context: My(M19) family and a few other families (we’re all Asians) went on a holiday together. So the families only know each other because my younger brother(12) is school friends with them. \n\nDue to our large group there are obviously going to be a lot of children about 11 in total aged 8-13 all boys. When travelling from place to place it was more convenient to rent a bus. So how it happened is that the young kids rush to the back to take the last row. As there’s only 5 sears on the last row it’s basically a first come first served basis. So the rest of the children would have to sit elsewhere in front of them.\n\nSo what happened is that the last 2 rows were occupied by children and I was sitting on the third last row with no one next to me. The bus ride to our next destination was quite long so I decided to take a nap. But half way to dreamland one of the kids(M8) was kicking my seat. So I politely asked him to stop. He then complained that it was because i reclined my seat a bit to lie down and sleep. Of course I told him he could recline his too. This was when I noticed the problem.\n\nThe children were arguing because the row at the back couldn’t recline their seats as it was the last row. So they took their frustration out on the children(younger than them) sitting in the row in front of them. And of course this was then taken out on me because I was on the third last row. The adults on the trip are pretty laid back and let their kids run a bit wild so I felt quite annoyed that the kids couldn’t solve this problem.\n\nAt first I tried to get their attention so I could give a solution, but of course, kids enjoy bickering and ignored me. So due to a long ride in the bus, and probably some frustration, I shouted at the kids to get their attention and told them quite angrily “Those that want to sit in the back you chose there so don’t complain when those sitting in the second last row recline their seats. If you don’t like it go sit somewhere else on the bus!” \n\nSo I was probably very loud and pissed off because all the adults turned to look at me. Later my parents told me that even if the kids were in the wrong I have no right to shout at them. It puzzled me a little because \n1. I sort of solved their problem \n2. Where do I draw the line between being responsible for these young children due to being an older ‘child’ and helping solve their arguments. ",

      "description": "Me and my fiancé went away for the weekend. I called the hotel before hand to confirm our reservation, let them know we have our pup with us because they have dog specific rooms and ask if I could purchase something nice to surprise my fiancé to be placed in the room for when we arrive. The front desk said they could provide champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. When I asked how much it would be the agent asked if we were celebrating anything? I told him our engagement and to my delight he offered the gift on the house. \nWhen we checked in the agent ( a different one from my earlier call) went through the regular welcome/confirmation spiel “Mr. Smith we have you staying with us for 2 nights in a pet friendly room...” so on and so on.\nMy fiancé wasn’t at the desk with me so I quietly asked the agent if they were able to put the gift in the room. The agent looked blankly at me and frantically at her screen. She told me she had no notes of the champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. She apologized and offered to bring them the next evening. I was so bummed they made a note of us having a dog ($150 fee) but not the gift I was willing to pay for i sarcastically told her not to worry about it several times making it known it wasn’t “ok”. So at this point it was a bit of scene and it became apparent to my fiancé something was wrong. As we walked to our room I explained the situation and she  said I didn’t have to make the front desk agent feel so bad about it and make a scene. So I guess IATA. ",

I’m not sure how I or my husband or my older son are going to deal.\n\nWe’ve had pet deaths over the years ending with a funeral and all, so death isn’t a foreign concept, however not seeing his aunt after so long like THIS could be past trauma and go into catastrophic nightmares.\n\nMy husband has been “checked out” since the news and is suddenly making noises as if our son is coming. He will be too distraught to wrangle our son and I can’t be there for the family, and keep tabs on an eight year old.\n\nI also don’t want him there because even I tried to keep him away from the viewing, 8 year olds are curious creatures and will steal a glimpse the first chance they have.\n\n",

      "description": "I'm a male that has been living with two female roommates for the past few months. I met both of them when I was in a long term relationship, that has since ended. Since this relationship ended I've been getting back out there on tinder and have had some luck.\nAbout a month ago I met this girl that I really liked and after going on a few dates, I invested her over to watch TV and then sleep over. Apparently my roommates had an issue with me bringing over a \"stranger\" to our house. They said that I should wait months before I do (which I though was an exaggeration) and at the time I believed it was an issue with us spending that much time in the common area and that they were mad that they had an interaction with her. \nSo the other night I went on a date with this girl who I had met on Tinder and had been texting for about a week. The date went very well, and we got pretty drunk, and since we were close, we ended up going back to my place. (It's important to note that one roommate had family visiting, but Im not aware of them being really religious). We tried to be as quiet as possible that night and the next morning. Knowing that it would be inappropriate for this girl to have interactions with my roommates and guests, we waited until everyone left before leaving my room and house. We really tried to be as courteous as possible. \nWell I got a text later that day stating how disrespectful and fucked up it was to bring a girl over and that if having casual sex in my room was important to me then I should move out.  I understand that this is our home, so if there are any rules, then we all have to abide by them, but I don't think it's fair to say that I have to wait long. Of time in order to bring over a guest to my room.\nSo am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My mother is a very generous to me and my siblings. She does not have very much money but she loves us all and would always try to help us all if she can. When I had some tough times, she helped me out financially, so I am not going to be a hypocrite and say that she should not help any of my other siblings. One of my brothers, whom I am fond of, is extremely feckless. He's recently acquired a property and has been spending several weeks renovating it. He's doing it full time. He has no job and no money and has bills coming up. My mother was worried that he would get into trouble, so she gave him some money. When my mother said this, I started laughing at her. I wasn't mad because she's a grown woman and can do what she wants with her money. She's helped me in the past, so I don't feel that morally, I can't say anything about her helping one of my other siblings.\n\nHere's the thing. Despite having had financial issues in the past, I have always worked. There was always money coming in and I have done my level best to support myself. Now, my mother, who has no pension and is surviving on savings, has funded my brother's attempts to, amongst other things, set up an artisan food business, a micro-brewery, and a tour company. All have failed. There is no possible way for him to repay her any of this money.\n\nWhen my mother started talking about helping all her children when they were in need, I started laughing. I pointed out that my brother owned a substantial asset, a property, and was perfectly capable of earning a living. He was refusing to do so because he knew perfectly well that our mother would bail him out. She has done so for decades and would continue to do so. When I suggested that she cut him off, she got really upset and started telling me that I had no idea what it was like to be a mother. I admit that I cut her off at that point and pointed out that as a father, I had the same responsibilties that she did and that if my son pulled the same shit my brother was doing, he would be out on his butt. Not because I didn't love him but because he needs to learn to be self-sufficient. I pointed out to him that one of my other siblings would be happy to pay my brother a decent allowance just to look after the family home but there's no way he would do it because he is lazy AF. That he's never been made financially accountable for any of his plain batshit insane schemes. I told my mother that if she left everything to my brother, he would burn through all the money in a couple of years and then find himself up shit creek without a paddle because she would no longer be around to bail him out.\n\nMy mother started crying and said that I was being mean to her. That she is an elderly lady and had a lot on her plate. This is true. She's caring for some relatives who are sickly.  Now none of this was said in anger. I was laughing when I said this because I knew that nothing would change and I just couldn't say nothing this time. We have had this conversation so many times before. I usually keep my mouth shut and say nothing but this time I couldn't let it go because she compared me to my brother and suggested that we were the same. I have made some terrible financial decisions in the past but I have got my finances back on the level, have never not worked, and have helped my ex raise our son. I am financially stable, have a decent job, and realistic plans for the future.\n\nMy mother has been financially generous to me in the past, so I have no axe to grind as to whom she leaves any money she has left to. But what worries me is that she is going to run out of money to support herself, and even worse, when she passes, my younger brother, whom, despite his fecklessness, I am fond of is going to be totally f***** because he's never been held accountable for his reckless financial behaviour. I admit that part of me realises that she's never going to chance and neither is he. Given that, am I the asshole for making my mother cry by pointing out that she's enabling reckless financial behaviour by my brother which may screw the rest of us (if she runs out of money) and will surely screw my younger brother when the money runs out and he has no viable means of earning a living?",

All of a sudden, I see this guy reach out and before I know it he grabs my GF's ass for a second and she makes a gasping noise. He walks away but as he does he turns and winks at us. My GF and I swear at him and call him a creep and all that but he shrugs them off and just walks off down another street.\n\nI asked my GF if she was okay and say we should report the incident. She says she doesn't want to that it's 'no big deal', and despite me asking again if she sure she was okay she said she wasn't that bothered. \n\nAnyway, when we get home I ask her once more if she is okay, as she's been quite quiet and I'm afraid she might be very upset. She says she's very upset that I didn't try to beat the guy up after he grabbed her ass and just let him walked away.\n\nNow she's not talking to me. Now, I don't feel like I should've attacked him. For one, I could have been arrested for assault as it wouldn't be in defense. Secondly, I'm quite a skinny guy at 150 pounds and he was BIG. By big, I mean he was built like a boxer, thick muscles and all. \n\nDoes this make me an asshole?",

      "description": "Okay here's the story. Sorry I'm on mobile and I'm heading into school so it might be a jumbled mess. Last night, I couldn't sleep so I grabbed my phone went to the downstairs bathroom and jacked off. Came back upstairs to my girlfriend asking if I wanted to have sex to help me sleep. I said, shit I just jacked off. I thought you were asleep. This is when the argument broke out.\n\nA little history to understand both sides:\nWe've dated 2 years. Lately we've slowed down on sex (she says this is my choice and not hers, she says she's always wanting to have sex). Its more like a once a week or longer type of situation these days. We used to have sex like 3-4 times a week. I could make a million excuses on why there's a lack of sex recently but it mainly just comes down to the fact I work construction and go to school and Im exhausted Monday thru Friday. Im never super in the mood to fuck. And on top of it all my girlfriend has been gaining a bit of weight of the last year. Its not like I'm not attracted to her because of this but she just seems to,botg care about her appearance anymore. I made the mistake of saying something about it last night. We were arguing and I told her she doesn't even try to get me in the mood. These days she's always in her grungy pjs and only seems to initiate when she's wearing these clothes. So I fucked up and said she needed to work on herself, hit the gym and try to be more sexy with initiating sex. I said this all in the heat of the argument. That was a dick thing to say but over the last six months I've bought her a gym pass she never used once. Done diets with her even though I don't need to diet. I've never flat out told her to lose weight before last night, its always been herself saying she needs to lose weight.\n\nAnyway the fight blew up real quick. I said some stupid shit and so did she. She told me I should feel like a piece of shit for jacking off when my girlfriend is laying next to me. I kept telling I thought you were asleep. Then she went off on me saying no guys do this shit and that I'm weird and then she was asking what kind of porn I was watching. I jacked off for literally 5 minutes.\n\nI don't know, I think what it comes down to is my girlfriend and I sitting down and talking. I guess I might just be venting here so I apologize for that. But really id like to know if jacking off last night because I couldn't fall asleep while I thought my girlfriend was already asleep, if that's makes me an asshole.",

      "description": "So I am a 17 year old who lives with my 2 brothers who are 5 and 6. I personally am trying to lose weight but me not being very in control of my own eating makes this a nightmare, this is mainly due to what kind of food is around the house and it's my own fault for just not eating right (also doesn't help that i'm pretty picky when it comes to healthy food) and exercising. \n\nI've been trying to get my family to help with it since in my mind if they support me with it maybe my brain will finally kick the whole \"LOSE WEIGHT\" thing up to 11. But it isn't easy due to my Step-Dad who refuses to budget around healthier food and brushes it off as \"too expensive\" (If they just stopped buying so much junk food and made sure to portion the food correctly it'd be a lot easier). Right now i can't buy food for the entire family due to me not having a job at the moment and the only thing i get is a monthly SSI check which i use to get things for the month (not what it's intended for but it's what i use it on). \n\nOn top of this my mom and dad collectively refuse to stop making sweet tea out of pure habit i guess and i did stop drinking it but once it was really the only thing to drink other than tap water i got tempted to start drinking it again. While this is mainly a thing for me to lose weight it's also out of protection for my brothers simply because i don't want them to end up getting made fun of at school (Like I did for years) because of their weight.

      "description": "Okay so I have this group of friends with 3 other people and just for name sake I'm gonna call my friends Josh, Amy, and Kate. Ever since we all met each other in order for us to hang out me and Amy would have to plan everything everytime we hang out, we would have to plan what time, where we would eat and what we would do after and we are usually the ones asking them to hang out. Everytime we would ask suggestions on what we should do Josh and Kate would usually say idk, or tell us that they are good with anything and when we are planning that's doesn't help at all. So me and Amy gotta find out something all four of us would like. \n\nRecently Amy got mad when I said I want to hang out. She went on a rant about why we always have to ask them to hang out with us and why they never ask us to hang out with them and why we always the one doing all the work just so the rest of the group will happy when we hang out. So we told the other two that if they really want to hang out with us then they plan everything for once. They were alright. So the day before we asked what's the plan and they gave a list of like 12 restaurants to chose from and told us to pick one and figure out what we will do after and they told us they can do anytime after 12 and told us to pick a time. Idk if that's just me but it sounds like they didnt do any planning and we are gonna have to plan everything. \n\nSo after they gave us the list of restaurants I said I was fine will all of them (trying to let them choose) a few hours late Jake texted and said have yall choose a restaurant and Amy was like we can do to Chilis if yall want. Nobody responded then Amy texted again and said \"So like are we doing anything or not..?\" Kate then said chilis \"we're going to chili's and hanging out idk what else to say\" Amy said \"...what time?\" Then Jake got mad and said \"☆Kate and me dont even want chili's and we gave yall options to choose from, so choose anything else, we ain't doing shit\n\n☆I assume that Kate and him have been talking in private \n\nI got mad and called them out on how me and Amy always making the effort to hang out and they do nothing. Adding on to that I said \"I'm sorry for asking yall to plan for once I guess that was too hard for yall\" (which I then apologized later for saying something rude like that.) There was this whole argument and in the end we resolved the argument and hung out with no problems\n\nI know it's such and small and dumb thing to argue over but I just wanna know am I out of line for wanting them to make a effort to hang with us and getting mad when that's what they came up with. I had no problem with planning but was it a mistake to bring it up and call them out on that in the first place.\n\n(These are my good friends and we resolved the problem and I dont hate or dislike them over this but it's just like... why dont yall ever come to us for once. We also have no problem with planning but we LITERALLY do it every we have ever hanged out)\n\n(Also when me and Amy ask them to hang out we are like: \"So Saturday I pick yall up at 1 and we go eat lunch at x restaurant then we will go to the mall for a few hours and we can go to my house and watch x movie. Does that sound good for you guys?\")\n\n*in the end me and Amy still ended up planning everything*",

      "description": "I [26m] have been dating gf [25f] for 4 years now, living together for 2. Generally, our relationship is pretty good - we rarely fight and our life together is fulfilling in all aspects except our sex life. Like most relationships, we started off having sex once a day, but that quickly tapered off. Around the 6 month mark she informed me that she does not enjoy sex that much, and would prefer it to occur around once a week. I would like it to be more frequent than this, but I respected her wishes and I generally initiate once a week. \n\nHowever, throughout our relationship she has enjoyed using her vibrators/dildos without me (yes, I have asked to use it on her and she has turned me down) 3-4x a week. I don't have a problem with this necessarily - of I course I wish she was using that energy with me, but I get that sometimes people can be in the mood for masturbating and not sex. I watch porn regularly and she doesn't like it, but hasn't explicitly asked me to stop. \n\nThat leads us to the issue -  recently, I purchased a sex doll for my own use. It has a face, but it is clear that it is not a real human. I enjoy it more because, for me, it feels more real. However, gf freaked out and told me to get rid of it. I feel like this isn't fair to me - I spent a good chunk of money on it and its not exactly returnable, and to me it seems like its basically the same as the toys she uses. After all, she has a dildo and it certainly isn't shaped like my dick. \n\nAITA for not wanting to get rid of this? (For the record, I'd much prefer to not use it at all and just have sex with her, but again, she doesn't want to)",

      "description": "I’ve been close friends with “Bob” for about 20yrs (since grade school, we’re now both middle aged). Since the last election, Bob has become open about extremely racist views I never knew he had. I’m not talking “wants to build a wall” but full-on Daily Stormer reading, whites are superior, global Jewish conspiracy type of shit.\n\nInitially I’d have (calm) arguments/debates with him about it. However, it seemed like this was just encouraging him to talk about his idiotic views, which maybe wasn’t worth the rare times I could convince him of any point. Lately, I just ignore the vast majority of racist/political things he texts me and only talk to him about normal things (hobbies, etc). I still occasionally mock him for thinking he’s oppressed despite being a white dude from an upper middle class family, having an advanced degree, and a very high income. It’s hard not to.\n\nOn one hand I tend to think it’s pretty lame to cut people out of your life over different viewpoints, doing so would reinforce alt-right narrative that liberals can’t openly debate their views, and I’m not sure what real positive difference ending the friendship would make. \n\nOn the other hand, he holds some terrible beliefs and as long as he’s voting to advance them that counts as acting on those beliefs in my book.\n\nAm I the asshole for continuing to have and enjoy a friendship with someone despite them being a self-described white-supremacist?",

I have ignored all of them as I'm really not interested in getting locked into a sales pitch over the phone.

Without consulting me or mentioning anything, she decided to end things with her boyfriend and pursue a relationship with me. \n\nFor a few weeks we got closer, began to flirt and started to plan to meet each other. \n\nShe then decided she had made a horrible mistake ending things with her boyfriend and tried to get back with him, he rejected her. She made me aware of her thought process and decided it was too crazy to end a relationship with her boyfriend for someone she hasn't met, which I guess is understandable. \n\nFor approximately a week her and I got closer once more, not as close as before. Although I felt rejected and that any relationship we might salvage is only a result of her ex rejecting her attempts to reconcile. \n\nI went out with some friends in a bar around this  time and met another girl. I went back to her house and decided I didn't want to do anything with her, I was drunk and upset by recent events so I went home. \n\nOut of anger and spite I lied to the American girl and told her I had a one night stand, and that I was over her. \n\nMonths later the American girl and I reconciled and decided to pursue a relationship. \n\nAfter around 6 months of being in a relationship now with the American girl. She admitted to me that she slept with someone on the night I had lied about my one night stand. I told her that I had been lying the whole time and she doesn't seem too bothered about this. \n\nI'm struggling here. I know I shouldn't have lied about sleeping with someone. The truth is though that I felt too guilty and hurt to sleep with someone but she did so with no issues. \n\nWas the asshole thing lying about it or was the asshole thing actually doing it as a response to me doing it?

      "description": "A little bit of backstory and throwaway account to avoid the coworker seeing this.\n\nI was raised alongside my best friend as our mothers grew up together. I trusted this man with my life and he always came through for me. He was the godfather of my three children and I'm the godmother of his two .Three years ago, he passed away in a car accident but before he did he left my daughter (then 11, now 14) an American girl doll that looked like her. She doesn't like dolls, hates them actually and was planning on giving it to her cousin but when she found out her godfather died, she kept it. It sits in it's box on a shelf in her room and anyone who comes into her room gets told not to touch multiple times. Even her brothers won't touch it when they're trying to push her off because she will break down.\n\nNow that the backstory is out of the way, here's the situation. \n\nMy coworker (Myra) wanted a weekend to herself and asked if her daughter( 13, Stacy) could have a sleep over with my daughter, Grace(14), I agreed. My sons had to go to their grandmother's house along with our dog before Stacy could come over and Grace wasn't really wanting a sleepover but was convinced into doing it by one of her friends. Stacy got told the rules of Grace's room which included not touching her doll. Everything was hunky dory until Saturday night when Grace found Stacy playing with her doll after she went to the bathroom. An argument ensued that ended with Stacy throwing the doll on ground and storming out. \n\nLuckily, the floor was carpet and the doll was okay but Grace was bawling her eyes out. I called Myra and told her I'd be taking home Stacy early because of what happened and when I was dropping her off, Myra was pissed but said nothing about it. I thought she was upset her weekend was ruined but understood. \n\nWell when I came into work on Tuesday( I had Monday off), apparently Myra had told everyone in the office that I had kicked her daughter out for playing with a toy my daughter said she could play with. I was able to explain my side of the story but people still think we (Me and Grace) overreacted by kicking her out. Am I the Asshole here or just overreacting. \n",

      "description": "Not much to it, but it's been baffling me for a while.\n\nEvery year I (15M) run a stand at a local science fair as part of a school club. Starting from a few years ago, my mum started to invite some of her friends and their children to volunteer at the same fair. \n\nThe only people stationed at my stall were myself, and two of my friends. About halfway through the day, some of my mum's friends' kids come over since their stands haven't been getting much traffic and they were told to take a break. Mine was a bit busy at this point, but I didn't have a problem.\n\nAbout 15 mins pass with no issue, but there's about seven people total sitting around in the tiny stand at this point, and traffic is increasing. I still didn't say anything, until one of the kids (~17M) whips out an empty vodka bottle filled with water and starts drinking from it. I tell him to put it away, but he ignores me. \n\nThen, a teacher from my club walks past and sees this happening. She gets (understandably) annoyed and asks me to tell the kid to put it away (the issue was that although this kid wasn't in the same school as me, my friends and I were in club uniform and strangers were looking weirdly at us weirdly). \n\nI tell the kid to put it away, and he again declines. So I tell everyone that since traffic was increased, there wasn't any room to loiter here anymore, so they all had to leave. After saying this a few times, they all leave after a little grumbling. \n\nI totally forgot about the whole thing until a few weeks later, my mum says her friend called her and said her kids had been crying because I kicked them out of the stall. So the question is, am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "One of the people I live with has some pretty bad acid reflex so when they eat large amounts of acidy foods or they don't take their medication they get pretty bad moments where they constantly throwing up. I don't know all the details, but when he goes through these moments that is what he says. Well a few nights ago he was having a very bad moment where every other minute or so he was throwing up, mainly just stomach acid though, and couging a lot. He usually sleeps in his bed with his partner, but he didn't want to that night because he didnt want to wake her with all of the noise he was making, so he asked me if he could sleep in my room, in my bed and I said no for the following reasons. \n\n1. My room is not connect to a bathroom or near a bathroom in the house and I kind of don't want vommit in my room. I know it might be rude to assume he'll vommit in my room but, he does somethings I consider odd and gross when he's having these bad moments. He doesn't like just sitting in the bathroom for extended periods of time, which I understand and respect, so instead he'll just carry a towel around with him and throw up in that instead. I personally find it absolutely disgusting, but I get that he has a medical problem, so usually if he's doing that in a room I'm in I will leave rather than asking him to leave. However, I dont want him to do it in my room, I really don't want vommit soaken towels in my room and I especially don't want them on my bed.\n\n2. He has been known to leave these towels just lying about. I have been in his car and seen the disgusting towels not just left in his car for extended periods of time, but also on top of things such as books, blankets, and other things in his car. Im afraid that if he was puking into towels in my room, he would not have the respect to keep the towels off of my stuff. \n\n3. In general, I just don't like people in my room when I am not, and I get that may come off as a bit snobbish or rude, but it's just a pet peeve of mine.\n\nAfterwards talking about the subject a few people (albeit mainly him and people who don't live with him)  think that I should have given my room up despite what I consider extremely valid reasons. So reddit, am I in the right, or am I the snobbish asshole?",

      "description": "At my school you have to pay for a parking spot. However the school doesn’t really check or enforce this policy unless someone brings up an issue. I hadn’t been to school for the whole week because I was sick for 3 days and I just didn’t want to show up before spring break. I decided to show up today to pick up a project that we had to do during break \n\nAs I was pulling up I noticed a girl parked in my assigned spot.(when I picked my spot I picked one of the ones closest to the door). I told her that she was in my spot. She apologized and said that she had just recently started driving to school and didn’t know we had assigned spots. She said she had been parking there all week and no one said anything. She said she didn’t want to move her car because that would make her late to 1st period, but she would no longer be parking there. I moved my car to the end of the parking lot, furthest from the school. I knew I was probably going to be late but I don’t do anything 1st period so I didn’t really care.\n\nWhen I walked in I was late and had to sign in at the office. There the assistant principal told me that since today was my 5th tardy for the month I would have to serve a 10 minute detention after school. I then threw the girl under the bus and told the assistant principal that she was parked in my spot and that was why I was late. The assistant principal erased my tardy and gave me a pass to class. At lunch he told me to move my car to my spot because the car there had been towed. They made an announcement contacting the owner to move their car but the girl had gone out to lunch in her friend’s car and didn’t hear it. After school she saw my car parked in my spot. I pretended to not know what happened and told her the spot was empty when I came back from lunch ",

      "description": "Hello, this is my first time posting here, I hope I do it right. Post might be a bit long.\n\nSo, I was in my first semester of college very recently and I got paired up with this girl. We hit it off well at first. We had stuff in common and had similar experiences going into college. \n\nThis seemed great and people thought of us as perfect roommates, but there were times where she deeply made me uncomfortable. In the first week or so, we both had horrible times adjusting and were both very stressed and sad. I had to wake up for class early and I made a little noise. I felt super bad bc I could tell I was so I left a note for her apologizing and I was going to be more mindful and make less noise when I wake up early. When I came back to the room, she started screaming at me. She said how horrible I was for making noise and went over to my side of the room and rattled my clothe hangers and screamed \"This is the noise you were making! They sound like fucking skeletons! Can you fucking imagine how scary that is for me?!\" And stomped around the room saying thats what I did. Honestly, I knew I made a bit of noise but she was exaggerating. I felt hurt and scared so I just apologized profusely and instead I'd lay out my outfits at night and shower at night and pack for class the night before to minimize noise. After that, I've made such little noise and she told me I don't even realize you are waking up. She still went to an RA to get to move out and told her she had PTSD which made her unable to have noise in the room (I'm pretty sure she does have PTSD and talked about her life before) but never got a single room bc she refused to talk to therapists as school to get a doctors note. She eventually apologized but this whole incident made me really upset and made me blame myself for stuff to come.\n\nWe generally got along well, but I found myself getting annoyed by things she did. She'd inject herself into every conversation and hit on guys and drunkenly talk about cheating. (while in a relationship with a guy back in hs) She also didn't hang out with me bc she found a friend group early on and that was good. I was happy for her, but at the time, I was still struggling and while I left the room a lot, I'd go back to chill out. She always came in with her friends and they were nice to me and we'd talk a bit, but my roommate would make comments? She'd have a tone that was kind but sounded rude? I am also in a LDR with my bf and was skyping him during this hard time and she'd always make comments how I'm always talking to him? I call him twice a day, one to just talk abt our days and then another time to say goodnight. I also would offer to hang up if it bothered her that much and sometimes she would say hang up and sometimes shed be ok with it. I didn't mind that much she always had people in the room at first, but she never asked me beforehand if they could come. She told me to always tell her before I invite people over and I agreed and asked the same or just a little heads up, but she never did.\n\nHer boyfriend and her are less than 2 hrs away and both have cars. He visits sometimes and its ok with me, I even leave the room all day and only go back to sleep so they have privacy. Her bf doesn't talk to anyone except her and pokes fun at some kids at my school. If I say hi, he doesn't respond or if I ask how was the trip, no response. However, my boyfriend visited once and we dont have our cars up there, so it's an 8 hour train ride or bus ride for us. My roommate knew my bf was coming and I even offered to sleep in a friends room or the campus center because of her sleep problems for a night and she said ok. We rested at night before we went to sleep somewhere else and my roommate came in drunk and demanded we watch her rap and then bragged about her fluency in Spanish. My bf was exhausted for having travelled so long in an unknown place and just watched for a bit and awkwardly complimented her and we left. The next morning my roommate was unsure what to take as a class, she really wanted to try Spanish she said.My bf said she should try it out and if it doesnt work out, there is add/drop. She later left and came back after my bf was gone to tell me how rude he was. I asked what happened and she said that he was overstepping and acting like he knew everything when he encouraged her to take Spanish. I was really confused because I didnt perceive this as rude at all, but I told him and he apologized. She later would tell me this made her uncomfortable when he visits so I should just go to see him instead. She later talks shit about my bf to me months later. It really hurt, but I wouldnt say anything. Id just kind of say I need to go out of the room to avoid this conversation. She even brought up that he was jewish to call him weird for having a bar mitzvah. this hurt, because my father is jewish and she knows it too. \n\nI eventually got a solid group of friends and we hung out a lot and I was barely in the room. My roommate's group fell apart in less than a few weeks and I invited her sometimes to come along with my group, but she ended up complaining or asking sketchy questions to me about my friends. (sketchy as in kind of racist, my friend group consists of black girls, a latina, and a jewish girl and I'm asian) She said that my friends who were black look exactly the same and was confused at first, BUT THEY LOOK NOTHING ALIKE! Different hairstyles, skintone, facial features and height! I stopped inviting her bc they made my friends uncomfortable and she'd always say she was dependent on me for social interaction which made me feel weird. I was in the room even less after that. She also talked badly about her old friend group all the time.\n\nA lot of other stuff happened, like her kicking me out of the room so she could study. Her blaming me for getting her sick even though we were both in different states for thanksgiving break and I wasn't sick. My boyfriend visited for the last time before the semester ended and she kicked us out so we slept in a different friend's dorm. Her making a scene at my birthday surprise party my friends threw. I eventually told her everything and I needed to leave. She took it well but said if she knew earlier she would alter her behavior. I felt bad bc I did not say anything to her, except once (but was shut down) about the stuff she did and how it made me feel. I felt bad because she saw me as one of her closest friends and told me she relied on me and also did really nice things for me sometimes and said such nice things about me and I didn't communicate until it built up. I also felt crazy for thinking she was bad bc all the nice stuff she did so that was another reason I didn't say anything and I was also scared of her. But it still makes me feel like an asshole for not being direct until the end.",

This has been going on for a good 4 months and I'm seriously so aggravated over it!\n\nThis is like an every other day thing and guess what day it is? I told him *again to turn it off or go to his workshop in the basement. He says \"okay jeez!\" like I'm overreacting. I told him to \"get a fucking pair of headphones before I run over the damn speaker with my car. I'm so sick of repeating myself!\" I don't ask nicely anymore because I'm just so fed up, but I didn't yell either. How many times do I need to say something? Was/am I overreacting or AItA?",

      "title": "AITA For Choosing My Work Over A Camping Trip",
      "description": "Hi All. Long time reader first time poster. This has been an issue that has eaten away at me ever since it happened.\n\nSo I lived with two other guys for about a year at the time this happened. The living dynamic was mostly positive at first. We were all graduate students in a wildlife conservation program at a medium sized university. We were all friends spending time hiking together, taking classes, and helping each other out with our research projects. However, as time went on I noticed some things about them I didn't really care for. \n\nThe first roommate we'll call Greg. He was a Marine before returning to college. He has a very nasty attitude about people. He belittles undergraduate students in our program and even some of the other graduate students. He has a very do-no-wrong mentality. When we first moved in together he made it clear he did not want to talk about issues because \"feelings are gay.\" Which I though little of at the time because I didn't think we'd have any problems. I like to think of myself as a somewhat decent human being and never had problems with roommates before. \n\nMy other roommate Steve and I became close friends almost instantly. He and I did almost everything together: working the same part-time jobs, birding, video games, etc. But as our friendship progressed I started feeling drained by doing everything with him all the time. At times he wanted to hang out and I just wanted to relax and what Netflix on my own. He would get angry many times when I wanted my personal space and would end up not speaking to me for days at a time. Then, like nothing, he'd start talking to me again like nothing was wrong. This also happened a lot when I went home to see friends. I live about 2 hours away from my university and still went home once or twice a month to spend time with family and old friends. I became frustrated with this after having it continuously occur. Despite needed a night to myself every now and again, I still considered him a good friend and being shut out became very hurtful. I tried speaking to him about it several times but he would just lie and saying \"nothing was wrong\" and continue to ignore me until he deemed it okay to talk to me again. Eventually I decided it was in my best interest to distance myself from him for my own sake. I still considered him a friend but just not as closely as I did before. \n\nAnyway, back to the incident at hand. Steve, Greg, and Greg's girlfriend Stacy were planning a camping trip at Stacy's family's property this past July. I had initially said I'd go. As a graduate student, I was responsible for several big conservation projects for my adviser over the summer. I was responsible for coordinating field work involving bat research. The research I was doing was funded and included my own master's thesis. My thesis has always been something that loomed heavily over me and something I took very seriously. The week before the camping trip the weather forecast got crazy. It was going to rain every day that week. When it rains we do not conduct research. It does not however change the fact that there were strict deadlines for research activities to get done. Despite this, I still thought I would be able to go camping. It was still early in the season and I had a few weeks to catch up. As the week progressed the weather forecast became more clear:  It was going to be clear Friday - Monday (when we were going be camping) and the following week was going to be all rained out again. My adviser and I met on the Thursday before we were supposed to go on the camping trip. He expressed his concern for me to be able to finish my research activities in time. In the field of conservation, you do research when you can do research whether that be during the week or the weekend. I knew what I had to do...\n\nEven still I was really worried that my roommates would not take it well. I was concerned that both of them would get angry with me about it and not speak to me for weeks. I had so much anxiety about it that I spoke to my girlfriend, my parents, and other friends about it to try and come up with a way to make them understand where I was coming from. In the end, I thought that it would be best to sit them down that night and discuss it with them instead of just texting them. That night (Thursday), the rain cleared and I actually had the opportunity to go to do research so I wasn't able to be home until 10 PM. I was concerned about giving them little notice so I texted them that I wanted to speak with them both when I got home. Steve continuously pressed me as to why, so eventually I sent a long text message to the both of them telling them I couldn't go. Neither of them responded. When I got home that night, Greg was sitting in the kitchen. He looked at me angrily and said nothing. I smiled and asked \"Do you want to talk about it\" to which he flat out responded \"No.\" I left and went to my room depressed and anxious. \n\nThe next day, I got a text from Steve saying that he was done with me. That he wasn't going to be my friend anymore because \"I obviously have higher priorities than my roommates.\" He began listing times I was able to go home to see my friends but couldn't find the time to spend with my roommates. He also was frustrated because it was such short notice and that it was hard to afford to go. He continued to tell me that everyone agreed to pool 50 bucks a piece to pay for gas, food, and booze (which I had never heard or agreed to). I offered to kick in 20 bucks for gas but he refused it. I told him that he was being selfish and that I was just a bad weekend. I expected them both to understand because they were in the same field as me, both pursuing their masters degrees. I thought they knew how important field work... \n\nAfter that I felt alienated in my own apartment. Neither of them spoke to me for months after. I was depressed and anxious all the time. In response I started going home more because I didn't want to be in the apartment. The used this as an excuse to say that their point was proven, that I had the time for others but not them. I eventually ended up moving out and don't really speak to them. \n\nAs you can probably tell, I haven't been able to let go of this... AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I am beyond embarrassed. My aunts funeral was yesterday and during one of the eulogies (there were many people who each had long speeches so it lasted a long time) I had the worst stomach ache. I had a milkshake the night before and pancakes for breakfast so I think thats what caused it.\n\nI was in and out of the bathroom all day, but we were all supposed to sit for the eulogy. I felt intense pressure in my lower stomach but I was afraid of standing up and farting in the person behind mes face. Plus I would draw attention to myself.\n\nMy strategy was to wait for a moment of noise or music and muffle the blast. There were a lot of people around so no one could link the potential smell to me.\n\nDidnt work out. \n\nI timed my release to a moment when I thought my grandpa would start speaking again, hes loud so it would be a great opportunity.\n\nWell, as soon as he was about to start talking he covered his face to wipe tears away. I completely missed my shot and ripped titanic ass in a silent, solemn ceremony while my grandpa was crying about his dead daughter. This fart lasted almost 5 seconds. 5 seconds of continuous \"Brrrrrtttttt\".\n\nThis fart was arrogant in how loud it was, it wanted people to turn their heads. The pews were wood and provided my ass with no cushion that could suppress the fart. It echoed across my pew as my ass shook. I completely misjudged how loud it would be.\n\nEveryone knew I did it. My mother looked at me with disgust and my father started silently laughing.\n\nMy face went from lily white to cherry red as I closed my eyes and started laugh crying. My grandfather waited until i stopped, and looked me dead in the eyes for 10 seconds before proceeding.\n\nMy mom was infuriated with me for farting and laughing and interrupting my grandpa. I feel terrible about it since my aunt was her sister. But its also something i didnt do on purpose. AITA?",

He’s rarely, if ever, praised me. Nothing is ever good enough in his eyes. \n—He has forgotten several of my birthdays. He even ruined three of them. \n—He always has to be right and have his way. Even if it means hurting the other person. Would never apologize.\n—He has hit my mother a few times during arguments, especially if they got heated. \n—He always tries to control my life and criticize my decisions. Even from afar. \n\n\nAt Thanksgiving (last year but one). When I accidentally knocked over a dish. He berated me and called me stupid in my own house in front of my wife. At that point I told him to get the fuck out of my house and told him that I never wanted to see his face again. Yes it was embarrassing scene but once again I stood up to him. \n\nI know his childhood wasn’t easy growing up in extreme poverty with a single mother and in a dysfunctional family but it doesn’t excuse the abuse that he’s put my family and I though.\n\nBut seriously am I an asshole or a bad son for cutting contact with my dad?",

      "description": "So this happened this past weekend at PAX.\n\nThe area where most of the \"official\" (paper) Magic games were taking place had a table to the side where people were dropping off cards that they didn't want after playing games. For the most part these were lands, but there was a bin labled \"Unwanted Cards\" that people would put non-land cards they didn't want. Mostly these were commons, some uncommons, with land/tokens mixed in.\n\nThroughout the weekend I would stop by and look through the cards in the Unwanted Cards bin to see if there was anything I wanted. Other people would do the same, sometimes at the same time, just looking through the bin.\n\nSaturday night I walked by the table, and there was sombody (let's call him \"Ned\") going through all of the cards. He had taken all of the cards out of the bin, was looking through them, returning just the land/token cards, and stacking all of non-land cards to the side that he wanted to keep.\n\nI walk over and look in the bin.\n\n\"That's just lands and tokens\", Ned says.\n\n\"What's that stack?\", I ask, pointing to the cards that he put outside the bin that he is going through.\n\n\"Those are cards I'm looking through\", Ned says.\n\nThen a player comes over to drop a big stack of cards in the bin. Ned intercepts the stack and puts it aside, not in the bin.\n\n\"What about those?\", I say, pointing to the stack of cards that were just dropped off, but never made it into the bin.\n\n\"Those are mine\", Ned says.\n\n\"But they were just dropped off and you didn't let them make it to the the bin\", I say.\n\n\"I know\", Ned says. \"I'm looking through them next\".\n\nNow I don't think that's fair (and yes, I know I'm talking about a silly card game, whatever), so I reach over and grab a chunk of the stack he had put aside, and walked off.\n\nHe wasn't happy. I didn't care.\n\nTL;DR: Some dude was taking all of the free cards intended for the community, so I grabbed a bunch that he had already gone through, and walked off.",

      "description": "My daughter is 10. I love her dearly. She’s smart and creative, a million times smarter and more interesting than me. \nShe enjoys reading and drama, and has friends but doesn’t like to spend too much time with anyone in particular. \n\nWhat she does like to do the most is create movements or oddities with her body. She’ll practice practice practice until she can do it, and then find another thing to practice until perfection. \n\nI wouldn’t mind so much if she chose things like beat boxing, or hand clap games, gymnastics or something similar. She isn’t interested in perfecting handstands or cartwheels or making music or learning dance steps. \n\nWhat she perfects is eyebrow raising, eyeball moving, ear wiggling, nose flaring, raising her leg sideways to her body, twisting her arms behind her head, bending her fingers backwards, walking in unnatural ways and her latest - getting her top lip to cover her nostrils. \n\nIt might not sound like a big deal, and it isn’t. But it’s ugly, especially the covering the nose with your lip one. \n\nMy sister and mother both do it out of habit and that’s where she saw it and decided to do it too. \n\nThe eyebrow raising, nose flaring etc doesn’t really bother me but I do have to tell her to stop sometimes because she’ll incessantly tell me to look, and it’s the same thing over and over again. \n\nBut I explicitly told her she isn’t allowed to do the nose to her lip thing because it doesn’t look nice. But telling her to stop just makes her do it more. What’s more, my sister encourages it because she knows how much it irks me. My sister said I’m stifling her creativity by telling her what she can and can’t do with her face.\n\nBut being able to do these facial things and weird arm and leg movements has no positive benefits I can think of. I can think of negatives though, like her hurting her joints when moving in unnatural ways.\n\nQuite simply, I don’t want her to do this. I want her to use her tenacity for something useful, or energizing. \n\nI’ve told her she’ll be punished (no tv, no phone, or something similar) if I see her do the nose thing again. \n\nAITA for wanting to control what my daughter does with her facial features?

      "description": "I, 29f, have had my location shared with my 40m boyfriend for months now. I never think about it. I have nothing to hide. He lives 3 hours north and I often drive up after midnight when I get off work and want to have it shared in case something happens.\n\nI work weekends till midnight. He knows this. He knows my schedule. I was with my family from noon till 2:30 PM today and left for work. That’s obviously where it would show me at.\n\nHe texts me about an hour ago demanding me to FaceTime him followed by a screenshot of it showing my location at some random location. I am at work. I work for a company that has members sensitive information. I cannot be on the phone inside the secured area, aside from texts and social media and stuff. (Weird rules, I know). I tell him I am not able to FaceTime him but tell him I have been at work since about 3:15 this afternoon, and the only thing I could do was send him a photo. \n\nHe tells me he doesn’t want my “g*d damn photo because you have plenty of photos you could use to be lying to me”. I tell him I’m leaving for lunch shortly and will call him. He tells me not to worry about it because he’s already shaking, angry, sad, frustrated, and upset. I didn’t respond. I, in turn, restarted my phone thinking maybe the location just hadn’t updated. He texts me “oh so you turn off the location now?? Good one. Clutch move there.” I send a screenshot showing I didn’t stop sharing my location followed by a bunch of question marks. He sends a half hearted text laughing about his name in my phone. I don’t respond.\n\nInstead, I turn off my location. I had already told him when he first sent me that message that him questioning where I am and not believing me when I’m completely honest makes me want to turn off the location period. And he told me to go for it, and said he never asked me to turn it on to begin with.\n\nDo I have the right to be angry? AITA? \n\nTLDR; at work, location didn’t update on boyfriends phone, he confronts me, doesn’t believe me, tries to laugh it off making fun of his name in my phone after the fact.",

      "description": "Just for context my Dad and I are pretty sure that Mum has some undiagnosed depression/ anxiety that she doesn't see in herself, so we try to be gentle with her mostly.\n\nMy mum has been drunk texting me and harassing me lately about how my degree is taking too long. I have opted to study part-time and have changed courses twice before (Engineering &gt; Engineering &gt; Comp. Sci.), so that I can work and live away from home.\n\nWhen my Mum drinks too much she gets really angry and takes it out on Dad and me. I don't really think living there would be healthy for me since I am being treated for anxiety. I have said as much to both my parents.\n\nMum sent me a video that was titled \"Your friends are making you depressed\", talking about how trying to please your friends leads to unhealthy lifestyles.\n\nI pointed out to her that I don't have anything to prove to my friends, they choose to be friends with me. I said \"I constantly try to get approval from you and it's draining.\" Then I said \"You try to seek validation through me and it makes you angry and sad, I hope you watch the video with this context\".\n\nDid I go too far? She kept texting me hateful stuff after that about how I don't forgive her for trying to be my mother and weird self guilt stuff that always ends up making me feel angry and guilty. I didn't reply to any of it.\n\nTL/DR: I thought my response was measured, basically just flipping what the video said from friends to family relationships. I tried to be curteous but I worry that I called her \"exhausting\" and have made her upset which she will take out on my Dad.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or tips?",

      "description": "\n\nSo, I’ve been dating my boyfriend (Charles) for a little over a year, and he and his brother (David) who is a few years older are very close. We have spent a lot of time with David over the past year as he was getting over a breakup, and I have come to really care for him as a person. We finally talked David into using the app that Charles and I met on just to get back out there, and after a few dud dates, 2 months ago David found a girl he seemed really excited about. Charles and I were super happy and excited to be able to double date and not make David feel like the third wheel. From what David told us, she was awesome and I was happy to possibly make a close female friend (of which I’m lacking in this town because I have moved around a ton in the past few years). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs you might expect, meeting her (Abby) went much differently than expected. Charles and I invited them on a double date to dinner and an arcade, and I spent the entire time feeling like *we* had intruded on *their* date. She constantly interrupted me and Charles, always had to 1-up our comments, and the only time she addressed me directly, it was to tell me why a game I like is stupid. She didn’t ask a single thing about me or Charles, though we made an effort to ask her about her life. She’s not shy, either. Our server accidentally got the wrong kind of light beer, and instead of wasting it, I just decided to drink it and clarify when I ordered another. Abby kept repeating that I didn’t get what I ordered and for me to give it to her so she could go get the right beer. No amount of “no really. It’s fine.” affected her, and she ended up snatching it out of my hand (already half empty) and marched over to the waitress. She’s also obsessed with her “connections” to some local bars/restaurants, and feels the need to drop that into nearly every conversation, even if we were NOT talking about that. She’s obsessed with being older than Charles and I, frequently dropping things like “oh, you’re too young to know what ___ is” when I was in the middle of commenting on that very thing. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe have hung out a few more times but each time seems to get worse. I have a holiday birthday known for drinking, and Charles and I invited them to come out with us to celebrate, being very clear that if they wanted to primarily celebrate the holiday or had other plans, that we would have dinner some other night. Abby insisted that she would use her connection to get us a rather expensive table at a bar. Well, most of the night it was just me, Charles, and David at the table because Abby had run off to other parts of the bar with her friends that she had invited to my birthday celebration (important later). Charles and I would have left to do our own thing, but David would have been left alone, so we stayed and hung out with him. When it was time to go home, we had to get an UberXL on a holiday night because her friends needed a ride too (surprise!) so we waited forever and spent much more $$ than I expected. While working out the Uber arrangements, David and Charles got into a disagreement about getting an UberXL or 2 Ubers. I’ve seen them do this kind of thing many times before, I told them both to stop arguing and that we’d deal with the money in the morning, and to just order the xl. Abby did not like what I said, and walked over to her friend to call me a bitch and complain that I don’t know David and shouldn’t be telling him what to do (all obviously loud enough for me to hear). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBasically, I find her incredibly off-putting, rude, and I just don’t enjoy spending time with her. Charles is a bit more forgiving (and I think is afraid of losing his brother), but he would rather not hang out with her either. David continues to ask if we want to hang out, and is starting to notice that we have backed off from double dates. I don’t want to stop Charles from seeing them, and I don’t avoid things like Christmas where everyone is around just because she’s going, but I kind of feel like an asshole for “causing a problem” now that David seems happier. AITA for avoiding spending time with her? ",

      "description": "This is something that has been burning away at me for years.\n\nBack in High School, I worked at a grocery store that is fairly popular in the Midwest. I was promoted to the Dairy Section within a few months of cashiering. This new position was heaven. I was only 16 working most nights all on my own with set responsibilities.\n\nWell after a few months I started to get bored of my new position and started to abuse my power. I would drink the milk and eat yogurt and throw it in the garbage compactor without anyone knowing.\n\nCue co-worker who I will name \"Ted\". Ted started in the Frozen department which has it's own cooler of frozen goods next to where the dairy cooler is. He would frequent into the Dairy Cooler to hang out and chat. \n\nOne day I caught him stealing raw cookie dough and eating it in the cooler. He pleaded me to be quiet about it. I assured him I do it sometimes too, but make sure you do it very seldom and throw away the evidence. Hours later, I caught him telling a mutual co-worker about how they can take whatever they want out of the dairy cooler. I stepped in and told them that to be careful. I don't want to get fired for this.\n\nTed then said, \"Check out this f****t trying to act tough. We will take what we want or we will report you for stealing.\"\n\nThe next few weeks were complete hell. They were constantly coming in and taking shit, and just leaving the trash in the cooler forcing me to clean up after them. I was finally done with that shit. One night I intentionally left open packages of cookie dough in easy to find hiding spots. The next morning my boss called me asking who was responsible for this. I told him that I see Ted from Frozen leaving our freezer every now and then. Not sure why. That afternoon, I came in for my shift and my boss was still there. I told him my \"theory\" of Ted maybe taking them.\n\nThe company decided to put Security Cameras outside the freezer door to know the coming and goings. I was leaving early one night but told Ted to help himself. I will be working in the morning so I can clean up what you leave. He was excited about that.\n\nThe next day I was told Ted was fired for stealing food from the cooler. They have him on camera going in and out several times with at least 3 empty yogurt containers and an empty package of cookie dough. They said they have enough evidence to assume he has been the sole thief and was immediately let go.\n\nMy friends say I am an asshole for sabotaging someone else for basically doing what I was also doing. AITA?\n\nTldr; used to steal dairy goods while working until co-worker joined the company and also started to steal dairy goods. He blackmailed me into keeping his secret and cleaning his messes or he will out me as the thief. Was able to get all the blame put onto him and got away with it.",

      "description": "A little background, there is a girl from my past that I dated for a long time ago. We broke up about 6 years ago, and it really fucked me up and my life in general for a long time. I’m still getting over it in fact, and I still get pretty depressed about it every now and then. But in the last few months things have been finally looking up, and I started dating this girl that I really like, someone I’ve known and sort of had feelings for going back to even before I met my ex. I really like her a lot (honestly probably love her.)\n\nBut I still think about my ex a lot and feel a lot of pain over losing her. Not in the sense that I would rather be with her than my girlfriend, but it still hurts. I have a certain personality disorder to where I form attachments to people differently, and my ex was the first person I’ve ever known in my life that ever actually loved me and treated me well (I came from a pretty abusive family.) A lot of the times I feel like I’m grieving someone that died rather than someone that broke up with me.\n\nAnyway, I go to a therapist who is very good. She’s told me I should find someone trustworthy to talk to and get support with for the feelings I have for my ex, that it would be helpful for me. And I figured, why not my girlfriend since there’s no one else I trust more than her. She also understands me better than anyone else that I know, and I don’t want to hide anything from her in the first place. I feel like I owe it to her to be honest about my feelings.\n\nSo I asked her last night if we could talk about something, because there was something I was having a hard time with and I needed to talk to someone. She already knows about my ex, actually my girlfriend was the first person I ever talked to about it in depth to after the breakup (we’ve been friends for a long time actually before we dated.) Anyway, I told her that I was having some troubling feelings about my ex. And she just basically asked me, like what? I didn’t really know how to explain it. I said something basically like, that it hurts that she’s gone still and I really miss her. At which point she looked kind of taken aback. I can’t really remember the whole conversation, I was really anxious during the whole thing so it’s kind of a blur. She basically asked me what my feelings for my ex were, and I said it’s complicated, but yes I do still love her. She was really quiet after that for the rest of the time we were sitting there, and I tried to elaborate but she didn’t say anything else after that.\n\nI tried to just end the conversation about it there, and I asked her if she wanted to watch TV or something, but she said she had to go home that she had things to do. I tried texting her last night and today, she didn’t respond when I asked if everything was okay last night and has been pretty short with me today, like one word answers the couple times she replied to me today.\n\nI feel really bad, I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, I just wanted to do the right thing, but I feel like I caused a problem and I just sort of feel like a dickhead in general.",

The man complained that since he was leaking out the seat and people were hitting him as they walked by. My friend is very nice and just accepted the situation. The fat spilled in both of our seats, my friend needs half the seat while I need the whole seat. His fat made my seat uncomfortable so I would move around to fine a comfortable position. My movement ended up squishing his fat and he snap at me and told to sit still. I said no, I didn't bother looking at him. \n\n We text to talk because we didn't want to talk over him but that annoyed him ( the vibration every time we got a text so we put it on silent, then the brightness of our phones even though it was day time and our phone had no brightness!!). After a while I snapped at him and told him to suck it up, he gave a aggressive look and I gave him a peak at my pepper sprays. That shut him up.\n\nThe man decided that he wanted to sleep, we were relieved until he started snoring and spreading out like a starfish. My friend already scolded me for my lack of patience with this guy so the first two times we politely told him to get off but the third time I threaten to pepper spray his throat. The man stopped for 30 mins then did it again. I wanted to nap off the annoyance do I faced the window and put my knees up ( I was still only in my seat), this super squished his fat making him yelp. I then asked him why he was still touching me. He ended up switching seats with the guy in the two seat row. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend believes I should have treated him with care but I believe people like that needs a piece of reality.",

I may be moving away for collage, and we may never see each other again, so I decided i didnt want to \"dirty\" the book with school notes or doodles. so i began writing everything i liked about him, taking about all the memories we had together etc. im about 20-30 pages in by now but here is my dilema.\n\nI wanted to give him that same book, but with all the 200 pages filled with our memories.\n\nbut. would i be an asshole if i gave him the same book? it hits my heart a little bit. but asking if what im planning would be justified?\n\nalso, if possible. educate me with better gifting ideas!\n\n\nTL:DR : S/O gives me empty note book. I want to return it, but filled with our memories. AITA if i use the same book?",

She didn't have any shoes on but had socks. And the conversation goes something like this:\n\nGirl: (calm but sturn) I need you to call 911.\n\nMe: what happened? Are you alright?\n\nGirl: I dont feel safe in my own house.\n\nMe: Okay! Ill call dispatch, their a couple blocks away, they'll send a cop down here to help ya out\n\nI got no idea whats really goin on here, she wants me to talk to them and refused to speak to them herself. So i got no idea what to tell them, and i dont want things to escalate. Anyway, the talk ended up going like this:\n\nGirl: so your gonna call dispatch instead of 911?\n\nMe: Just seems like the best move here...\n\nGirl: (rolls her eyes) ugh (kinda scoffs)\n\nThen she walks out! Keep in mind this whole thing maybe lasted a minute or two. She then stands outside the building for another 10min i swear on a phone of her own. I figure if someone really needs the help then why would it matter? Am i the asshole here? Something just seemed odd about the whole thing in the end.\n\n",

Since I was only going to be in my town for 3 months I always assumed it was a casual relationship, however Anna did not feel the same way. Today (Valentines Day) I met her briefly and told her I would rather be friends than have a casual relationship, but when we met my mind blanked and I couldn't come up with any definite, logical, reasons why. Anna ended up driving me home and she seemed very hurt, I felt like I was a terrible person, and at this point we will probably not be friends as I believe she doesn't want anything to do with me.",

      "description": "I'm sitting in a coffee shop in Baltimore that is frequented by the homeless community in the area. The shop is flooded at the moment because the weather outside is cold to a point where it's unsafe to loiter outside. I come here fully expecting to chat with whoever sits near me, so I don't mind it as long as the conversation doesn't totally derail the work I'm doing. Anyway. Today this guy came in and showed me $200 and said he's trying to get a ticket to NYC because he heard its a good city and can I help him schedule one online. Of course, I can't schedule him a bus ticket online with cash - so I told him where the nearest Megabus/Grayhound station is and he thanked me and asked me if I thought it would be cold in NYC. So I proceeded to tell him that he should skip NYC and get on a bus to Tampa Bay instead. He told me he's never heard of Tampa Bay, so I proceeded to minimize my work and pulled up photos of Tampa to show him, explaining that it would be a lot warmer than Baltimore and certainly warmer than NYC. After about 20 minutes now, the guy is walking around the coffee shop asking everyone if they've ever heard of or been to Tampa Bay. And after about a half hour now, I think I've got this guy totally convinced to go to Florida instead of New York...sooooo....yeah I did find some entertainment in convincing this guy to change his travel plans....but AITA for convincing this guy to change his plans for a warmer place?",

      "description": "Hey all. \n\nA pretty dumb teenage question incoming, bear with me. \n\nI've gotten my drivers license and have a spare car to drive, thanks to the graciousness of my parents. I now love the freedom it brings, but I must say, I dislike driving. Driving makes me so very anxious and I'm paranoid whenever I get behind the wheel.  \n\nMy parents told me that I was going to be getting my license because they wanted me to drive in order to get a job. I wasn't super thrilled (about driving, not the job), but they were being very generous in paying for all my expenses so I didn't complain and got it. \n\nHere's where the problem comes in. \n\nBoth my sister and I are in high school and pretty close in age, but she is younger by less than a year. We aren't close however and (in my eyes) she insults me and acts passive aggressive towards me, and if I defend myself, I am called sensitive (that is a whole other seperate AITA). Because of this, I generally avoid her because she makes me question if I should be getting hurt, and I just want to avoid getting angry. I've spent my time trying to make things work with her, and now I *really* don't want to spend time with her.\n\nI drive us to school without complaint. We're both going to the same place and it isn't costing me anything, as much as I don't want to be around her, and she is too tired to talk. There are also rarely any cars on the road. \n\nAfter school is a different story. She is very involved in a school sport and needs a ride home from school daily, at a pretty random time between 4-5:30. My parents are pretty fed up with her when it comes to this as they used to have to plan to try to make time to get her whenever she called, and the times weren't very predictable. They also believed her attitude to be disrespectful and it led to a couple blow-out fights in the house. Because I now have a driver's license, the responsibility has fallen to me. My parents pay me $5 for the trouble every time, which is *a lot.* But I still despise giving her rides as it's usually when the most amount of cars are on the street and she insults me on the ride back, which she calls her humor. I'm usually also involved with something else at home and I have to drop everything to get her. She has also, on multiple occasions, called me to give her a ride and then planned things with other people, making me drive to pick her up only to learn that she had made other plans. My parents have punished her for this.\n\nHere's where I'm an asshole: once I over a friend's when she called, and I wasn't available to get her. When I got home, she was there, and I learned a friend of hers had dropped her off. Nowadays, about 2/3 of the time, when she calls (especially around 5 when traffic is *really* bad and a parent is close to coming home to pick her up if I don't or a friend doesn't) I pretend to be doing something else in the hopes a friend will drop her off. Once, recently, it didn't work out so well and my sister waited half an hour in the cafeteria for my parent to pick her up. \n\nMy parents confronted me about it, saying that they were already paying me $5 for this and that I should be more available, and that if I don't step it up, they'll make it a requirement. I agreed with them and said I would start trying harder to make time, and I will. Deep down though, I hate having to drop everything to accommodate her, and I don't feel sorry for ignoring her calls. I don't think she should be committing to this thing when everyone in the house has to bend over backward for her. I realize though that my parents are paying for *everything* and are just asking me to do this one thing and that there's a very large chance that I'm just being an asshole.

      "description": "I have this group of friends that have been together since freshman year of high school. (We're currently late 20s.) Two of them (we're going to call them Hannah and Jack) have been bff's for most of that time. Naturally, they're the only ones who never realized they were in love with each other. We all decided to kind of stay out of the drama and them them work it out for themselves.\n\nStarting about a year and a half ago, we all *finally* thought they were about ready to hook up. They'd rented a house together, got a dog. *Eventually* they were going to figure it out, right? Along comes \"Jasmine\".\n\nJasmine isn't a bad person, per say, just emotionally immature and selfish. She can be very kind, and is bluntly honest, which I generally like in a human. Jack and Jasmine met through tinder and were both supposedly only looking for a FWB. But she pressured Jack into a more commited relationship than he was ready for, never really tried to become friends with the rest of the group (most of us have S.O.'s that have integrated just fine), and then complained that we were mean and cliquey and were trying to take Jack away from her. ... Naturally, her biggest issue was with Hannah from day one. Jasmine was consistently trying to drive a wedge in between them, to the point she tried to secretly move in with them for a while. (Thank goodness Jack saw through at least *that*.)\n\nThree months ago, Jack went to Jasmine's to talk to her about the trouble she was causing with the rest of us. We all thought he was going to break up with her. Imagine our surprise when he shows up a few days later to the pub saying they'd run off to Vegas to get *married*. \n\nHannah was a mess, but tried to keep it together and be as nice to Jasmine as possible. Jack, to his credit, did draw a line in the sand that Jasmine had to back off a bit, and for the most part the drama calmed down. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, Jack and Jasmine got into a huge fight and Jack went over to Hannah's to have a  drink and cool off (a bunch of us were already there). When we left, they were on the back porch talking and smoking. Apparently, some time after that, they hooked up. Multiple times. And it looks like it's going to become a regular thing until Jack leaves Jasmine. \n\nIt was wrong of Jack to cheat on Jasmine, I know that. But Jasmine saw what was happening between Jack and Hannah when she first started dating him, she just decided to disregard it and take what she wanted. When she finds out she's going to be crushed. But honestly, AITA for thinking she set herself up for this?",

She has gone as far as threatening her banks with shooting them up (she is banned for life from those banks.)\n\nI grew up with her as an Entitled Brat assuming this kind of behavior is okay, and only now in my Mid 20s do i realize how disgusting her behavior really is, I started to hate her behavior and feel shame and a lack of confidence in public when I was a teen still however...but she's my mother I didn't WANT to feel dirty just being associated with her.\n\nTL;DR I am a recovering EB with an ever horrible EM and I sometimes like to secretly laugh at the misfortune she has wrought for herself Am I the asshole?",

When I was living at home I gained a lot of weight through unhealthy eating habits. Since then I have lost a significant amount of weight and feel much healthier. Either my mom is trying to sabotage this or she really doesn’t listen. When I go home for the day to see her, she loads me up with food. I am not against food. I love when she gives me  chicken or veggies. However she gives me mostly junk food. I always tell her that I don’t need it and will just give it away. I have told her hundreds (not exaggerating she has extremely bad memory) that I don’t like Chex Mix. Yet every week I get a box of Chex Mix. I have now just started throwing it out. AITA for doing this as she is just trying to help? I sort of feel like she’s sabotaging me because she knows I have problems with healthy eating habits. ",

But my dad is really adamant that I help her in the kitchen more as she makes dinner nearly every night and does the majority of household chores and gets tired.\n\n I have another older brother who also lives at home but no one ever asks him to lift a finger apart from mowing the lawn every so often in summer. I get told that I should help my mum simply because I am a girl, and I am against this type of misogyny. A lot of fights happen because I think that everyone should help equally and it not be based on gender. These fights often happen when I refuse to do what my dad tells me to do \"Go clean the dishes\", \"Help your mother\" etc, when everyone else is sitting down not doing anything. \n\nMy mum agrees with me, but has been raised to agree with whatever her husband says basically so she won't cause any arguments. But no one else in my family will stand up to him, he drinks a lot and sometimes comes home drunk demanding food in the middle of the night and my mum has to wake up and get it for him even though I tell her to not put up with that.\n\nBut a part of me wants to just give up and give in and just do what I am told essentially as I don't like to make my mum do everything, (she doesn't ask me to do much because I come home with only a couple hours before I go to sleep and she likes that I'm kinda fighting for equality.) \n\nAm I the ass hole for not helping out my mum more just because my dad told me to?",

They had two kids together, my younger brother and sister, so even after the divorce, we would all go to visit him, because we (my other sister and I who weren't his blood) grew up only knowing him as our daddy. When I was 15, my ex stepdad remarried a cunt and my sister and I were basically banished from their home. The last time he was actually in my life was my sweet 16 birthday party when I asked him to present me and be my first dance. The last time we chilled for any amount of time was when I first bought my house (age 20) and he called out of the blue to stop by. We smoked, he bitched about his family, and then he left. I realized I was literally just a place for him to waste some time. I felt used, but whatever, at least he thought of me. FF to my brother just gets married. I haven't seen my SD in years, so when we see each other at the wedding, I literally give him a quick hug and he tries to talk about how he found some of my old social security cards or something, I tell him that he can send me whatever, I haven't moved in 17 years, then we left. This social media back and forth happened shortly after the wedding.\n\nScreenshot of the FB conversation: [https://imgur.com/9AuAdiH](https://imgur.com/9AuAdiH)",

      "description": "My good friend has recently given birth to a beautiful, healthy baby girl. Everybody is ecstatic for her and can’t get enough of her cute newborn. I’m happy for her as well, but I don’t quite feel the JOY that everybody else seems to be experiencing. I can’t help but think back to 9 months ago, when she was set on terminating but allowed her (religious) mother to convince her out of it. Though I completely respect that it was ultimately HER decision and will support her regardless, I can’t help but feel quietly angry about it. She was attending a big 10 college, is smart, beautiful, and had what seemed to be a bright future ahead of her. I know that teenage pregnancy doesn’t automatically “ruin” a woman’s life, but I’m afraid she won’t ever return to school and instead choose to maintain a steady job/care for her child. I feel all our friends are so entranced by the “miracle” of life that they aren’t seeing the potential reality behind the cuteness. I’ve only voiced these fears to my boyfriend and I would never tell her my true thoughts. I just want to know..am I an asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: This may not be relevant but I forgot to mention that this was the result of a hookup and the father is not going to be involved. When she discussed abortion with him, he threatened to murder her if she went through with it and is basically a psychopath.",

We actually just got one two days ago, but I didn’t have it with me because it was an unusual day and he didn’t sleep last night so neither did I and I forgot to put it in the bag. Seriously this kid is a runner and it’s terrifying.\n\nSo I picked him up from the babysitter and went to go grocery shopping before getting the dog from the groomer. We had an extra half hour to kill and we both needed cuddles after a longer than usual day, so I got him out of the car seat and moved him to the front passenger seat where there’s more room. Partway through cuddles and story time, a red coupe pulled into the spot immediately to my right, and the driver stayed in the car on her phone.\n\nThe groomer called and said the dog was done. It was pouring rain. I opened the car door, opened my umbrella (little one person only purse umbrella, it’s almost too small), and set my kid standing on the ground holding onto my pant leg. I stood up, went to put my phone in my pocket, and my kid dropped my pant leg and gave me that look, the one that says “I’m about to make a run for it.” I dropped the umbrella so I could grab his shirt before he could run off into the parking lot.\n\nThe driver’s window of the coupe opened up and this older lady with a speak to your manager haircut flipped out at me. I’m apparently a careless millennial and I need to be careful because she has a new car and I’d better not have scratched the paint. I said “I’m sorry, I kind of have my hands full and Kiddo was about to run into the parking lot.” She just yelled more about how millennials like me don’t know what things are worth and in her day they would have spanked a kid for running off and I’m clearly as shitty a parent as I am  a person. I couldn’t get away because I had to get my purse out of the car and my phone in my pocket and I’m trying to do it all as fast as I can without god forbid dropping my umbrella again and she made my kid cry because she was so angry. Finally I made it into the grocery store, and by the time I got out she was gone and my car had a fresh scratch. Ducking Karen.\n\nI’m about 75% sure the umbrella never even touched her precious car. There were certainly no scratches on the paint if it did touch it. The parking lot was basically empty - I was one of three cars in my row, and there were four empty spots closer to the stores all next to each other. She didn’t have to park right next to me, but I did drop the umbrella and it could have scratched her car, and as angry as Karen was she clearly thought I was in the wrong. So AITA?",

      "description": "Sorry it's kind of long and looks like shit cuz mobile... \n\nIn all honestly I was pretty lucky growing up. Military father, stay at home mom, dickhead older brother but all in all great childhood. I'm currently divorced and have a son with my ex wife. We live in separate states (she moved) and things aren't exactly good between us so times are hard with that but that's not the case in question. My family (Mom mostly... Dad is cool) are in constant contact with my ex wife. It's like they're best fuckin friends or something. I can understand wanting to know about your grandson but we're talking daily basis, small talk, all day type shit. There's no possible way the subject is constantly him. At best I get a few texts a month or maybe a phone call. I know I could make more of an effort to stay in touch with them but honestly not much goes on in my life so there's not much to talk about. \nThe situation came to a head recently when she was invited on a family trip to see MY grandmother and it was never even mentioned to me. I haven't seen my grandmother in a long time and I would've loved to go as she is getting up there in years and may not be around much longer. When I confronted my Mom about this she essentially blew me off telling me that she can invite whoever she wants to go on a family trip or to her home. This obviously upset me considering this is the woman who took my son from me. I agreed that yes she can invite anyone she wants but that didn't explain why I was excluded. She didn't reply for a couple weeks then messaged me like nothing happened. I decided this wasn't a hill to die on and let it go. Then comes Thanksgiving... a FAMILY gathering that I, once again, was not invited to. When I tried to call my son to wish him a happy Thanksgiving and see what he was up to I got no response from my ex wife. She does this shit a lot so I tried to brush it off and wished my mother a happy Thanksgiving instead. She told me that my ex was currently driving 7 hours to their house to spend Thanksgiving with MY family instead of her own.\nAt this point idk wtf to do. The relationship with my Mom has become toxic. When we do talk I bite my tongue but I feel like ripping her head off for treating me like shit.  I feel like my ex is driving a wedge between us and there's nothing I can do about it so I've been considering saying fuck it and just cutting that negativity from my life. ",

      "description": "I only recently discovered this subreddit so I’m posting this here.\n\nI (34f) met a guy (31m) last year.  Our relationship was 10.5 months long.  He moved in with his best friend (56m) back in May the 1st) and things declined from there.\n\nLong story short we went on a motorcycle ride that scared me.  He asked me what was wrong twice and I only told him after the 2nd time he asked me.  The next day we talked and he understood why I got scared.  He then told me I couldn’t ride for a few weeks but didn’t explain himself.  I told him “I think we need to think about what we want from the relationship and try to fix things”.  He ended it the next day telling me “I can’t trust you to communicate with me”.  When I texted him I was trying to open communication and that never happened.  Breakup was July.\n\nWe got back together in August and I told him I would have the threesome he wanted and brought up a few times.  That didn’t sit well with me 2 weeks later in September and I told him I changed my mind.  He broke up with me immediately because I didn’t want to have 1 anymore.  He told me “you put my dream on the table and took it away.”.  But he denied that being why he ended it and said I was fickle, irresponsible, and untrustworthy.  He also told me that I fucked up and asked if I knew what that meant.\n\nAm I the asshole for both those things?",

      "description": "There’s a lot of details here, so bear with me.\n\nI’m a senior in high school and I just got all of my college decisions back. It was a tough year in general, but luckily I got accepted into a really great university that is hovering around top 15 in the US.\n\nFor about a week, I was celebrating figuring out the logistics of being able to go there. I should have seen the issue at this point, as my dad (not my custodial parent) kept reiterating how I can think about going, depending on the financial aid package.\n\nFast forward to Saturday, I find out I would end up paying a lot. It’s private, so not a huge surprise but still disconcerting. I’m unsure of what to decide - I haven’t committed to anything.\n\nOn Saturday we got into an argument when he made it clear that the public state schools (which are good but don’t stack up to the private one) were my only option. He told me that he wouldn’t pay anything towards the private university (He’s pretty rich. He makes easily 3.5x what my mom does, and lives in a $3 million house - the university knew this when making the FA package) Since then I have contacted the FA office and described the situation, so in many ways the cost isn’t final. I think it was an asshole maneuver to help me with my application and essays for said university while knowing in the back of his head that he would never endorse it as an actual option, but whatever.\n\nYesterday, we went at it again. He’s done this in the past so I’m not shocked, but he complained how he “pays for everything” (child support) and that my mom spends her money “going to Hawaii every year” (a straight-up lie). At this point I tried to ignore him, but he kept escalating which led to me making a few comments in bad taste.\n\nHe then yelled how I was an “disrespectful” child (My mom laughed when I told her this) and that even considering the private university was “the most ungrateful thing I’ve ever seen any kid do”. IMO, this is where he is trying to justify his stance of forcing me into a university, and also sort of gaslighting me. \n\nI should mention that he went to a public university in my state for his undergrad (paid in full by his parents), as did my mom, but they disagree a lot on this.\n\nIn the aftermath, he was still very pissed off to the point where the borderline emotional abuse made me feel unsafe at his house. I’m currently making plans to stay at a friend’s house for tonight and I don’t plan on letting him continue to disrespect a decision that is entirely up to me. It’s my life, not his.\n\nI realize that money is a huge factor for college, but he’s already made it clear that his contribution would be $0 and he won’t co-sign on any loans. Fair. I’ve already had multiple people offer to co-sign as they are confident I’ll be fine. He doesn’t have to do anything - but he’s still fuming. Even if it’s coming from a place of care and concern, I can’t excuse his behavior and no matter what school I choose. \n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "I (M27) try very hard to avoid inconveniencing people. I also dislike being excessively inconvenienced by those around me (crazy right.) I think most people share that.\n\nMy partner (F20) and I got married within the past few months.\n\nWe all live and work in the same city.\n\nMy mother in law says she \"has\" to take her car into the specific dealership she bought it from, for some maintenance. Which is 2 hrs drive one way from our city. So she is planning on driving down before work Friday morning to drop it off and asked if we would pick her up and bring her back for work in the morning.\n\nWork starts at 7am for my wife and I(we work at the same facility)\n\nThis means we would have to get up at 2:30AM! To get ready in half an hour and be on the road by 3AM!  \nI guess I'm being a bit overdramatic as I could potentially call in late to work and get there at 9 which would be doable as my job is good to work with me but I would just have to stay later to make up for it. That would still mean we would have to get up at 4:30AM..\n\nI told my wife that I absolutely would not like to do it, basically said I wouldn't do it. I think it's a very inconsiderate request to make and I'm almost offended that she asked.\n\nI feel like most posts on this sub probably know the answer but I'm just wondering if people think that I should be willing to do favors for my family even if they are a big inconvenience at times...  The crazy part is that I bet my MIL would do it for me if the roles were reversed.. the only thing is that I would NEVER ask someone to do that. I would figure something else out.\n\nTLDR: MIL asked my wife and I to pick her up in a city 2 hrs away and bring her back before work starts on Friday morning. Work starts at 7AM. I said no because it's unreasonable imo. ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for over 5 years and living together for 4. We are currently getting ready to move about 90 miles away from where we live now. \n\nWe were considering buying instead of renting so I was checking up on my credit score on credit karma and noticed that my older brother still has me listed on his credit card. I used to live with him and his wife and they paid me to take care of my niece full time. The card was for nanny stuff or emergencies. I moved in with my boyfriend straight from living with them so it’s been at least 4 years since I used the account and I don’t even have a card anymore but the balance still shows up on my credit report. It’s not a huge deal just something I figured I should mention to him. \n\nMy brother lives on the other side of the country now so I see him like once a year but we text pretty much every day. Last weekend my boyfriend said I should ask him to remove me from the credit card account and I said I would when we talk on the phone. He’s supposed to call me tomorrow. I also have some special beers that I’m supposed to mail to him I just haven’t got the chance yet.\n\nI was away on a work trip until this morning. My boyfriend asked me again last night if I’ve texted my brother about the credit card and I said no I will ask him when we talk. I didn’t think anything else of it until just now when my boyfriend informed me that he texted my brother yesterday and said “hey man we’ve got your beers! also, can you take emilyjobot off your credit card?” My brother responded “cool I’m super excited! I’ll talk to emilyjobot about it.” \n\nI am LIVID. I think it was completely inappropriate for him to text my brother about something that has nothing to do with him- especially something money related. He says that we are at a point in our relationship where our finances are so intertwined that my business is also his business and that he thought I would probably forget to bring it up to my brother anyways. \n\nAm I overreacting or did he overstep?",

So I asked what it was about, and my GF said that this girl wanted to make sure I wasn't going to start any problems. This confused my GF so she asked what she meant by that. Apparently the girl said that i always get so butthurt when the guy mentioned above jokingly insults me. My girlfriend knows she hasn't been around our group long enough to know that he always does that kind of stuff to me, and we have a long history of him \"jokingly\" hitting and sexually harassing me, so she tries to explain the situation, but this girl doesn't care and just wants my promise not to start anything. So me and my girlfriend get pissed and just say fuck it because she didn't even deliver a similar text to the guy. I'm definitely not going.",

      "description": "I don't know where he falls in line for cousin, but he is my grandmother's sister's grandson. He is a few years younger than me (I'm 35) and I met him maybe a handful of times by the time I was 21.\n\nWhen I was 21, he chose to attend the same university I was attending. He stayed with my grandmother a few days before the dorms opened and seemed like a really good person. I don't know if it was an act or if he was severely corrupted during his first semester of college tbh.\n\nHe got his first DUI during homecoming weekend, so mid-way through the semester. He pleaded first offense and AFAIK the charges were dropped. He seemed fine the few times I saw him on campus after that. But I graduated the following May, so I can be certain.\n\nHe failed out after his third semester, blaming it on \"not being ready for college\". He moved home and got a job at a gas station. Within a month he'd gotten a second DUI. He also ended up getting fired from the job because he was drinking on the job and also didn't pay for the beer.\n\nOver the next 10 years he amassed a total of 5 DUIs. He also developed a nasty cocaine habit. Both of which had landed him in jail numerous times and lost him countless jobs. He was \"fortunate\" (if you can call it that) that he never injured anyone else and that all of his DUIs were single vehicle incidents or he was simply pulled over.\n\nTwo years ago he decided to kill himself because his addiction was so out of control. He wrote letters to his family members and apologized for his terrible behavior. He then drank an entire \"bar sized\" bottle of vodka and did a lot of coke. He got behind the wheel and ended up causing an accident. A child was killed. My cousin ended up in a coma for several months, barely surviving.\n\nHe has a traumatic brain injury. He has the mental capabilities of a young child. He has never been to court for the death he caused, nor will he ever be held accountable for his actions. He sits at home, watches TV, and receives assistance to survive because he cannot provide for himself. He lives with his mom and dad.\n\nEver since the accident, the family has come together to hold fundraisers and they make a big deal at reunions about praying for him to improve as much as he can. At first I politely declined to get involved. Then I declined pleasantly. Then I declined directly. And yesterday, after being told I wasn't being \"Christian like\" and that I was raised \"better than that\", I declined hostily.\n\nI have not had any contact with my cousin since his accident. I prayed for him, but I did not visit him or donate to his care in any way. I see him as a murderer. I will never see him as anything but a murderer. His sister told me yesterday, after verbally attacking me, that he's suffering daily for his actions and I replied with, \"He should be.\"\n\nEveryone seems to be treating him like he's absolved of his past actions because he's had a traumatic brain injury and I don't subscribe to that bullshit.

      "description": "The title is as accurate and straightforward as I can put it. My main reddit account is linked to my rl so im using a throwaway.\n\nI have been dating my girlfriend for five months. Its usually difficult for me to maintain relationships this long due to my own personal issues. I am very much into her and she makes me happy. I am very protective of her.\n\nFor the past month shes been receiving womens panties from a highschool classmate who had a crush on her. She is in her early 20s so we believe he just now sought her out or found her. He sends her messages on social media asking her to wear the panties and send them back to him.\n\nShe has told him numerous times to stop and at first she blocked him, but that didnt work as he keeps sending more packages. She has told him to fuck off numerous times and he wont listen.\n\nShe has filed a police report and we even have footage of either him or someone he knows (in a hoodie and couldnt see face) delivering the packages to her doorstep, to avoid a return address since we said we were calling the police. Nothing has happened yet and she doesnt want to spend money on a lawyer to get a restraining order.\n\nI messaged him on facebook. I told him to not contact her again or he will regret it. He told me to do something about it, and said that I was \"jealous\" of him (I have no idea what he means by this). He said that he could kick my ass irl.\n\nI began leaving messages on his social media pictures. Then he blocked me.\n\nHe posted that he worked at a local Petco. I went to the store and in the parking lot saw the same bmw we have on video dropping off packages.\n\nUsing that, I followed him home and watched him park on the side of the street next to his home.I waited until it got dark, and I smashed his windows in with a collapsible baton. I then threw some panties (new obviously) in the drivers seat and left as the alarm went off.\n\nI told my gf not to worry about it anymore. My father is a retired leo (corrections) and when I told him he was furious at me as I committed a crime. I doubt anyone saw me or could recognize me as it was very late and the guy would be exposing himself as a pervert if he reported me.\n\nHe knows I know where he lives now and I believe he will stop. Time will tell. This may sound crazy to a lot of you but I am telling the truth. It took me forever to muster the courage to do this.\n\nBut was I in the wrong, should I have just waited until the police finally did something?",

      "description": "Sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile because I don't have a computer. For a bit of context, I have very low self-esteem and I have a history of horrible depression due to problems in my past. I'm the kind of person that when anything goes wrong, no matter how little of it is my fault, if it IS my fault, then I try to take the full blame.\n\nI had dated this girl for two years starting in highschool, and at the time, as far as I could tell, everything was going great. I had gotten a decent paying job, and a house that we can live by ourselves. Everything I thought was going perfectly to the point where I was going to propose to her on Christmas last year. Then one day in November, I come home late one night to find a note on my couch saying that we were through. I was so devistated that I've nearly committed suicide twice now due to the overwhelming guilt and sadness.\n\nFast forward to a couple of months after she broke up with me, I meet her coming in with a friend at a place that we hanged out. She and my friend were already best friends even while we were dating so I didn't think anything of it. Later that night I finally talked to her alone about things that had been bothering me about our breakup, and how I regret all of the things I did wrong to her, and she apologises for not telling me what was wrong while we were together (during the time we were dating, she kept things from me as to not upset me because work had me stressed out, which I completely understood.) Then when my friend comes to check on me and her, I noticed something odd on how they were acting. They were very close to each other, VERY close. When I had asked my ex about if they were dating at all, she said no, but come the next morning when I asked my friend because I was extremely paranoid about it and I needed confirmation, he said that they were.\n\nThey had been lying to me for two months.\n\nI've never felt more betrayed in my entire life, and I've now fallen into the deepest pit of depression I've ever been in. Due to the pain I tried to commit suicide a couple of days ago after learning the news (I found out almost a week ago.) I honestly don't know what to think anymore and don't know what to do at this point. When I confronted my \"friend\" about it he acts like it's no big deal, and after consulting with my family, they've told me to just move on. Am I truly in the wrong for being upset? I await my judgement.",

      "description": "I (20f) live with two roommates, Mary (22), who is rarely around and whom I don’t know very well, and Mia (20), who is one of my best friends. Mia has a boyfriend, Mark (23) who I’m also good friends with. However, Mark is at my apartment all the time, sometimes when Mia isn’t even here (he has a key). He cooks, showers, and does multiple loads of laundry here. \n\nIn theory, this would all even out because Mia would do all this at Mark’s apartment as well, but that rarely happens. So, Mark just uses our utilities and shared food without paying anything, and it’s started to bother me a bit. I’m also a little annoyed that I almost never get to hang out in the common spaces of my own apartment because they are always there. This also means that I have to wait to use the kitchen/bathroom until he is done a lot of the time. They are also pretty loud until they go to bed and start right up again in the morning. I’m also uncomfortable that I can hear them being physical all the time.\n\nHowever, I have people over sometimes and it can get kind of loud, and so does Mary. So, Mia would probably bring that up if I tried to talk about Mark. And maybe it would be overstepping to try to tell her when she can have people over. But I feel like it’s a different situation because he basically lives here. I just don’t know if it’s enough of a problem that I wouldn’t be overreacting to talk to her about it. And I don’t want to ruin friendships over something that isn’t that big of an issue. Would I be the asshole if I told her he can’t always be here and that it feels like he’s living here for free?\n\n",

I know my girlfriend has been having some family issues for a little while but she won’t tell me and she won’t budge either. I do care about her, obviously but I’ve chosen to respect that decision rather than push to know. For the most part, she’s been alright.\n\nHowever, today, I get on the bus and it’s crowded so I can’t exactly make it to her. She sits down next to someone and I can tell somethings up. But cause it’s just a random person, I didn’t feel comfortable going over to her and asking what was up. I decide to just wait with my friends and I chat with them until the person sitting next to my girlfriend leaves the bus. I go over to her and ask “how is she and stuff”. It’s obvious that somethings up. She quiet, she looks upset. We’re getting to my stop and she won’t tell me anything. She does however say that it’s my stop and that should get off. I say that I want to make sure she’s ok before I leave. At this point, she’s crying, wiping her tears away. I’m horrible in these situations. I’ve never learned how to deal with someone crying so I usually end up sitting there like an idiot. I go past my stop but I say to her, ‘if you really want me to go, I will go”. She says to go. On my way out, I tell her best friend (who hasn’t noticed - in fact, I’m the only who has noticed I think) to keep an eye on her and make sure she’s fine. I then proceeded to leave the bus and walk home.\n\nAm I the asshole for leaving? Should have I stayed? What should I do now? To be honest, any advice would be helpful. ",

      "description": "I will preface by saying that I am an alcoholic, and I relapsed two and a half months ago after almost a year sober.  I'm slowly working up to a year again with help from my support system and the good people over at r/stopdrinking.\n\nYesterday was my brother's birthday, the big four-oh.  There was a party.  My brother has been one of my biggest supports in my sobriety, so I thought that since I was invited there would be no alcohol considering my relatively recent relapse.  I don't expect him to cater to me.  I just assumed due to his support.  Last minute he texted me that his wife had turned it into a BYOB party.  I said I would drop by, but probably wouldn't come inside.  True to my word, I went.  When I arrived I texted him I was outside.  He and his wife came out to greet me and I gave him a hug, told him happy birthday, and gave him his present.  We chatted for a few minutes.  He said he understood that I couldn't come in.  She said she was sorry for doing the BYOB.  She wasn't thinking.  I told her it was fine, because the party was for my brother.  Can't expect them to cater to my needs simply because I can't control myself around alcohol.  She asked if I wanted to come in for cake, and I told her it probably wasn't a good idea since everyone inside was drinking.  We made our goodbyes, and I came home.\n\nThis morning I woke up to a text from her saying that it was rude of me not to at least stay for cake and whatnot.  She said that my brother was \"extremely hurt\" by my not being there for his fortieth.  She said that as strong as I am, I should have been able to be around alcohol without losing control since we had had a St. Patrick's day lunch and she and my brother had been drinking then and it didn't get me then.  I explained that two people having a green beer across the dinner table is different from a house full of people drinking.  She said that she was upset with me for acting selfish.  I apologized for any unintended hurt I might have caused.  I have yet to talk to my brother about supposedly hurting him as he's sleeping off a hangover and hasn't answered my text.  I don't know where this whole thing came from, because they've both been super supportive of my sobriety.  Normally I would suspect drunkenness on her part, but she sent the text this morning.  It was what woke me up.  Regardless, I'm wondering if maybe I should have sucked it up and just gone to an AA meeting or something after hanging at the party for a bit.\n\nSo, Reddit...AITA for bailing on my brother's fortieth birthday to avoid the temptation of another relapse?",

Our 2000 Passat has seat belts that don't work and our Acura Legend doesn't have any airbags.\n\nI hate to admit it, but my primary concern however, was dinging up my car, as it's my first one, and the safety concerns came secondary.

      "description": "So a little backstory, my brother (28) have been dating this girl for about 3 years. As far as i know, she's his first girlfriend and to be honest - i don't like her. I always treat her with respect, but I don't work my way to be friends with her. \nSo, this relationship: It was ALWAYS in each other's houses. She would spend the 3 to 4 days in my grandparents house (he lives there) every two weeks, and he would do the same thing in her house. \n\nSo around december, my mom tells me that he was going to marry his girlfriend. I was shocked! First: even though they are together for a while, they never spend more than 2 weeks together  and ALWAYS had my grandmother's credit card to help them out(paying for EVERYTHING). They never gone through any hardships that a normal couple do, they never lived together to see if they are compatible to do so. \n\nWhen I ask her why in the world they would do something so stupid she said \"It's because it's easier to move to europe as a couple\". It seems that he'll be trying to do a master in education (he graduate in biology) and she'll be finishing her college there. They would spend around six months here and then will see if they succeed in entering in their respective colleges. \n\nAnd the last straw for me: They are gonna live in my grandmother's other apartment with her paying all the bills!!\nNow, my family (mother side) is not poor, they have a good wealth and something like that is possible to them, but i got so mad that he's marry her and expecting our elderly grandparents to pay!! I am REALLY angry at him, to the point of thinking skipping their wedding! My mom says i should be nice because she'll be family, but oh boy Im PISSED.\n \nAm i in the wrong to be angry? should i suck it up? Is it really that bad not going to their wedding? I really feel like this is the stupidest thing i ever heard him saying, but im afraid i'm biases because i really dont like my brother (personal reasons). My other brother (26) also thinks it's stupid, but my mom is excited to go to their wedding.",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend broke up recently. Our relationship wasn't good for a number of reasons but namely that our mental health clashed too much for us to be happy. \n\nI have severe depression and she has really bad anxiety. Throughout our relationship I was putting my needs on the back burner when she needed me because \"a depressive episode isn't as bad as an anxiety attack\". This mindset only made my depression worse. \n\nEventually I broke up with her because I realised I wasn't happy anymore. We stayed  friends to start with but had a hook up a few weeks after I broke up with her since then we've been ignoring and avoiding each other. \n\nAbout two weeks ago she got admitted to hospital with a high fever. I knew some friends were going to visit her so I didn't go, not knowing where we stood and not wanting to ask. \n\nThe other day, however, she messaged me, just asking how I was. I asked why the late message (since it was 2am) and she started to talk about how lonely she'd been at the hospital. And how \"i guess no one cares about me as much as i thought\". Obviously I felt bad for her, but it ws exactly this kind of talk that made my depression so bad I had to leave the relationship. \n\nI told her in no uncertain terms that \"I don't want to listen to this anxiety ridden self consciousness over and over again\" and that \"I'm not your therapist\". She responded that she only wanted to talk, but that she gets it. \n\nAm I the asshole? I feel like it \n\nTLDR; I broke up with a girl over her anxiety and then refused to talk about to her when she got out of hospital because it makes my depression worse. ",

      "description": "My little brother and his family were recently involved in a car crash, he was dead on impact, along with my nephew. I feel no sadness, no joy, no anger, no emotions at all when I think about it. The most feeling I can muster about this is that he was unlucky. He was hit by a drunk.\n\nI didn't hate my little brother, I had no animosity towards him, and we even had somewhat of a good relationship. We kept in touch through social media frequently as we lived in different parts of the country. Yet now that he is dead I just do not care.\n\nMy father is asking me to travel across the country, take off work, and pause my life to attend the funeral. I told him that I simply don't want to go as I have a lot going on right now, which is mostly true. He says that hes not going to tell my mother I said that, and hes begging me to come.\n\nOn reflection I don't think I would care much if my father died either, or my mother, or the rest of my family. I think about it and nothing really strikes me. My father and sister are both upset at me for not wanting to attend, especially since in their minds my reasons are unsatisfactory. AITA.",

      "description": "Last year my friends fiancé left him a month before the wedding. I let him move into my spare bedroom until he figured things out. The day he moved in he was already on tinder, and had a new girlfriend within two weeks. Then five months later he decided to move in with her in her parents basement, and moved out without even telling me. He left most of his stuff including his tv he took from his ex’s house and his guns. Being a suicide survivor I was not comfortable having the guns in my house, a fact he was well aware of, I asked him constantly for a month to come get the guns until he finally did. Fast forward eight months later I was talking to his ex at a wedding, since i was friends with her well before ever meeting him, and told her the tv was still at my house and she could take it if she wanted. She took me up on the offer since it was originally her tv. Three months later his current girlfriend shows up at my house unexpectedly demanding the tv. I explain to her why I don’t have it anymore. Both of them later text me calling me an asshole for giving his stuff away, and messaged his ex saying she stole from him. In my opinion you can’t move out of an apartment and leave your stuff there until you feel like picking it up. Why should my house be any different? Especially since he didn’t even ask or tell me he was moving out ",

Last year while I was in the car with him, when someone was trying to cut him off, he swerved in front of them while they were speeding by him. I told him if he ever acted aggressively like that again, we would be over. Yesterday, while were crossing the street (not in a car), a car was driving very slowly down the street and was not stopping. I stopped to let the car pass while he kept walking. The person didn't stop and he flipped them off and slammed the hood of their car. The person got out of the car and was ready to fight him, but returned to their car. \n\nIn the moment, as I watched him do it, I knew it was over. I could not be with someone who refuses to stop for a car that was obviously passing by slowly or someone that needs to act that way toward a stranger that wasn't driving recklessly or anything. \n\nI feel like I sound like a petty asshole. We've been together for about three years, but this behavior seriously sets me off. I personally, loathe that behavior and would NEVER even think to do something like that on the street.

But about five minutes later, it happens again,\n\nand again\n\nand again. \n\nAt every key scene, every action sequence, every romance scene, every cool cinematic, this lady starts clapping loudly as all hell. After the movie, I express my extreme annoyance to my brother about this lady, and he calls me a killjoy and says that it happens all the time at theaters in larger cities and that I have no right to be annoyed. I disagree. I paid for a movie, and I want to be able to enjoy it damn it. But my sisters agree with him, saying that because I occasionally make casual conversation with them *AT HOME* sometimes during movies means I don’t get to be upset. Few key notes with that. I only do it if I don’t understand what is going on and I feel that I missed something, and I always stop if requested. However, I can see where they are coming from and have to ask, AITA here?",

      "description": "I'm 14m, my friend Ben is 15m. We're both freshman now, sophomores next year. And the thing about Ben is, he's rich- like 'I don't know why he goes to a public school' rich- and he knows how to use his money to have a hella good time. For a freshman in high school, that is. And I love fun, but my career comes first. I want to go into economics. So I emailed local econ professors, financial firms, etc, asking if I could help out and do an internship. I know it's a long shot, but I am a bit of a math whiz- I've taken honors algebra 1 and 2, honors geometry, precalc, and ap calc and am now taking ap stats as a freshman- and am taking AP Macroecon, so I hoped there was some chance. I didn't get any emails back in a month, so I thought I knew 100% I wasn't getting an internship. I wasn't too bummed, though, since I knew Ben was planning a blast this summer. I told him I'm in for whatever he has planned, since the internship thing hasn't panned out. What he has planned includes:\n\n- Hanging out the country club, which entails golfing (very badly), swimming, riding around in a golf cart, etc\n\n- Flirting with cute girls \n\n- Watching a 'Netflix bucketlist' that has a total of 27 shows and 29 movies. \n\n- Going to Argentina in July \n\nEtc. You get the idea.\n\nAnd I was really looking forward to this. \n\nBut just 3 weeks ago, I got an email from a professor saying he might get me an internship. He was morbidly late, but I'd still take whatever, so I replied back and scheduled an interview, which was Saturday. Just today, he emailed me I got the internship, so I had to tell Ben I had to cancel the summer plans. He said I could get an internship any time and I'd essentially just be pouring coffee this summer. I said that's true, but the way I see it is, if I do grunt work this year, I can make some connections, and hopefully work myself up before next year. He was understandably upset, but I don't think I'm in the wrong here for wanting to pursue my future career.\n\nOr am I?",

      "description": "I work at a restaurant as a manager.  Also for the record I am a non-smoker.  There are only a few employees that smoke, which are the older folks in the morning.  We also had a manager that smoked too, but recently left.  So now the only people that smoke in the restaurant are the few older employees in the morning.  It used to be a problem with the manager because he could sneak out every few hours to smoke.  I didn't like that because he left the store unattended.  The older folks will beg for a smoke break after lunch, and then go sit in their cars and smoke for a bit.  It's annoying, and I would sometimes give in for the sake of getting along.\n\nWith the manager who smoked gone, I thought it was time to institute a new smoking policy.  I wanted to enact this rule in fairness to all employees right now, and for the future.  Right now the rule is:\n\nNo smoking is permitted on the property at all.  This extends to any time before, during, or after your shift while you are in uniform.  If you are uniform and are smoking, you must leave the property to do so.  There are no more smoke breaks at the restaurant.  If you work long enough to get a break, you can use your break to smoke.  \n\nI have a few reasons for this:\n\n1) Fairness to other non-smoking employees.  It's not fair to allow some employees to take a short break and not work.  I feel this could be seen as favoritism towards certain employees, and that could cause others to feel resentment towards the management or the smokers.\n\n2) Image and Look.  We work in a restaurant serving food.  Seeing someone smoke, or smelling someone reaking of smoke, could put someone off their meal.  I know it sure does for me.  We want to promote a fresh and clean image, and I think seeing someone smoke can ruin that image.\n\nThis isn't directed at any one employee in particular, it's just a good time because there aren't very many smokers right now.  Out of the 4 employees that smoke, I ran the idea past them.  2 of them are okay with it, and say it might give them a good excuse to quite.  One was upset but said they will deal with it.  The other is super upset and wanting to put in his two weeks.  He got all in my face saying it's discriminatory.\n\nSo here is the AITA part.  I am completely unsympathetic to smokers. I have never smoked in my life, nor will I.  I understand it's an addiction, but I don't think that's an excuse.  If I can go 5 hours without a cigarette, I think you should too.  I don't think it's discriminatory to say to a smoker that you can't take a smoke break for your 5 hour shift.  Tell me, am I the asshole for not allowing smoke breaks anymore and making it harder to smoke on our property?\n",

      "description": "Ok so I am Indian. One of my close friends, Jenn (we met in college) is getting married. She was born in India but was adopted when she was 2 years old to a white family. She wasn't really raised in Indian culture and (according to her) didn't grow up around a lot of Indians and has only been to India once since being adopted. She was raised Christian but is not really religious. Apparently growing up her parents tried to give her her Indian food and celebrated a few Indian/Hindu holidays to try and connect her with Indian culture but there were all very surface level and from a white perspective. . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe guy she is getting married to is not Indian. He is half black half white. They are both kind of creative artsy quirky types. Jenn has decided that she wants to incorporate many Indian Hindu style elements to her wedding. Now Jenn is a sweet girl but she honestly doesn't know much about Indian culture. Everything she is doing is based on research off the internet and since I am her closest Indian friends she keeps on asking me questions about Indian weddings and traditions, where to get the best Indian clothing, etc. It's honestly rubbed me the wrong way. She is literally picking out parts on Indian/Hindu culture that she likes and incorporating it into the wedding and then if she thinks something is weird she doesn't include it. She is also including all these spiritual Hindu aspects that she doesn't really understand because he thinks they are \"cool\" . It's like a big quirky art project to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I decided to tell her that I honestly don't think she shouldn't have an Indian wedding because she doesn't understand it. I was just being honest because it came across as tacky to me. The wedding is still in the planning stages anyway beside the venue and date  so I thought it was best to tell her earlier. However, she then broke down and started to play the victim and said I didn't know what it was like to be adopted and she wanted to feel connection to Indian culture. She then said she didn't want be to be her bridesmaid anymore and is now ignoring my texts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here? Honestly I just thought the whole thing was messy. If it was just wearing an Lehenga (dress) and sari it would be fine but she is incorporating so many Indian elements to the wedding that she doesn't understand at all that I felt I had to say something.

Nowhere close to hoarder/true slob level, but just.... clueless maybe, to certain cleanliness concepts.  And I'm no neat freak myself, don't really mind clutter, will have some crumbs here and there in my kitchen, and last nights dishes in the sink. but hers is... just gross. I've brought it up many, many times over the years. Given advice, been understanding and helpful etc. I can deal with other stuff like clothes on the floor, lid never being on the toothpaste etc. But the kitchen stuff just makes me feel repulsed in a bad way. \n\nCaked on gunk to the floors, weird crumbs and residue in the little crack and corners of the counters, slimy cabinet handles, smelly refrigerator, the works. I go in as little as possible, to grab a glass of water, help chop something for dinner, I'll even take out the garbage and sweep up the loose stuff on the floor. But otherwise I block it out of my mind and pretend it's not there. Just glancing into it and seeing the stuff stuck to the floor makes me feel icky inside and lately I just say I can't go in there, I can't relax at all if it's in my view. \n\nShe gets pissed and extremely sad at me every time I bring attention too it. Says she's so busy (no more than an average person working 40 hrs/week), I'm being overly critical because it's not my place, I'm not perfect either, I'm a dick for hassling her for it etc etc. I've said that's why we could never live together on a couple occasions (brutal honesty), and that's made her cry each time. She's a total sweetheart in just about every way, so this makes me feel completely awful. \n\nShe does try to clean, she'll sweep/vacuum and lightly wipe stuff down. And uses the dish washer at least every couple days so no moldy dishes in the sink thankfully. But this place needs a  TON of elbow grease. On a couple occasions I have sucked it up and scrubbed a portion of it, like hardcore clean. She wouldn't even notice if I didn't point it out. \n\nShe's thankful when I do it and says wow how did you do that. She just has no idea and I've run out of ideas about how to get her to work on it, like to read about what a mop is or whatever. Or that when you spill something sticky, clean it up really well immediately. I'm not interested in taking that level of cleaning into my own hands anymore.\n\nSo am I the asshole for totally refusing to go into her kitchen?\n \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I need to provide some background. I am posting from a throwaway but I think it's still important to use the real towns so an idea of the distance involved that our house keeper was travelling every day. \n\nWe live in La Jolla, California outside San Diego. We live in a pretty big house overlooking the ocean and we have had a housekeeper who comes four days a week to do basically whatever we need her to do. I love her to death and she fits right in even though she's only been working for us since the new year. She lives in El Cajon which by driving is about 45 minutes away. Her son drops her off every morning since he works at Scripps but I found out her combined trip home in the evening was taking her almost 2 hours. She was walking, then a bus, taking SDMT, transferring, another train and then either walking the rest of the way home or if she was lucky her daughter would come pick her up from the El Cajon stop. \n\n\nMy parents basically pay for a car service for my brother and I since they aren't ready for us to drive yet. It's kind of like a personal uber that I can use whenever I want. I have no idea how much it costs because I basically make a call, a driver shows up and takes me wherever I want to go. I guess my dad get's the bill at the end of the month or whatever. \n\nWell when I found out about our housekeeper's trip home I told her it was crazy and I just started calling the car service for her every night that she worked for us. I thought it was crazy that she had to take care of our house all day long then spend 2 hours doing nothing then go home and take care of her own house. I thought it was a very generous thing to do and 1:15 minutes minimum savings was huge for her. I also feel its a better use of the car service than my brother going to get hookers and weed downtown which is what he uses it for. \n\nMy dad just got the February bill for the car service and he freaked out. He basically told me that if she wanted transportation, she should have negotiated for it. I told my dad it's meaningless to us because we have so much but it means the world to her. My dad told me that he already pays her 1.5 times the going rate for a housekeeper. He told me to stop immediately. \n\nI feel so bad because I feel like she counts on this time now and I can't be the one to take it away from her. But my dad made me feel so bad by getting mad at me, that I don't know what to do. \n\nAm I the asshole for starting this?",

      "description": "Pre Pacfic North West snowstorm my two nieces (8 and 2) are sick and possibly my nephew (less then a year old) are sick. My brothers GF (BGF) brings them over daily because its a quick stop off before school. Yes, she sends the oldest to school a few days while being sick. Then she keeps the youngest home at my house, not her house, and has my mom watch the kid all day. Then she starts keeping the youngest home but leaves her at my house for my mom to watch her. \n\nAfter a few days my mom gets sick from this. The snow storm hits. As everyone is worried about power going out a BGF does not have a fireplace she brings the kids over incase the power goes out. Myself, my mom, and my GF are now trapped in a house with them. This last for 4 days. The snow stopped falling two days ago. In that time I almost lost my shit with the constant kids running around, screaming, and yelling. BGF parked the kids in front of the TV the whole time, right outside my room and sat at the table to study. She pawned the toddler off on my mom who was sick and should have been resting. \n\nThey dont leave until later despite being able to as they dont have a car stuck down a hill like I did. When they finally leave I had to tell my mom she needs to tell them no, they cant come over again until shes better. She sent them a text message stating so.\n\nToday I was just about to head to the door to leave for work when BGF walks through the door with the kids. The first thing I say to her is \"I hope your not keeping the kids here today. My mom is sick and needs to rest.\" \"Oh she is?\" \"Yes and she hasnt slept all night.\" and I walked away. I was told they stayed for nearly 3 hours after this.\n\nMy mom is in her mid 50s, doesn't work (laid off, would need to go back to school by that time she would retire anyway), and does not have healthcare insurance. \n\nAITA for looking out for my mom and telling my BGF to not bring her sick kids over, and to give my mom a break to get better?",

      "description": "This is rather long as I feel that some back story is required but I would really appreciate some insight into my situation. \n\nPosting from a throwaway since she also uses reddit. \nMy ex best friend and I had a really great friendship for the past ten years. Like y’know, I thought we’d still be friends until we were 80. \n\nI do freelance writing and over the past few months, I’d been getting requests for far more work than I could handle. She had just been moved to part-time at her job and needed some extra cash, so she asked if I could assign her some writing work too. I was hesitant as she had previously flaked on a 9000 word project before. \n\nRegarding the previous incident, I had given her a 3 week deadline and asked every two days how it was coming along, whether she needed help, etc. I had my suspicions that she wasn’t getting as much done as she was letting on, but I thought surely she wouldn’t fuck me up like that. I assured my client that my friend was very responsible and could produce high quality work (and she could, when she wasn’t procrastinating) to which my client agreed to let her take on the project. I’m sure you can see where this is going and sure enough, during my 12 hour (10am to 10pm) shift on the day before it was due, she told me that she couldn’t do it. She sent me 1000 words that I couldn’t even use as she hadn’t even followed the instructions I had given her. \n\nAt the time, she was going through some shit so I decided to just drop it. She was my best friend after all. So when I got home after work that day, I had 10 hours to jam out a 9000 word project. \n\nFast forward to the most current incident, I agreed to give her a project which was due in a month from the date of assignment. Again, I asked every single day whether she had started, whether she needed help and told her that she needed to let me know ASAP if she couldn’t finish it. A week before it was due, we had organised for her to come over and we would work on our projects together. \n\nShe had originally stated that she would come at 6pm after work. At 5pm, she messages me and says that she’ll go home to pick up some stuff, then come over afterwards. I had a feeling she wouldn’t come but I had anticipated it earlier on anyway. At 10pm she messages and says that she’s way too tired to come since she’d been at work and that she needed to sleep. \n\nSo now I had about 30,000 words worth of projects to complete by myself within a week. I’m having a full blown meltdown at this point cus I’m aware that I shouldn’t have entrusted her with my stuff.\n\nThe next morning, my sister shows me that my friend hadn’t been sleeping but instead went out and got drunk. She uploaded some drunken photos and videos of herself to her Snapchat and it’s at this point I realise that she’d blocked me from seeing them. \n\nSo not only did she flake, she also lied which was a double smack in the face. I really thought of her as my own sister. I tried to just leave it and try to get over it, but ended up blocking and deleting her off everything a week later. She called me to ask me what happened but thought I was kidding around. When I made it clear that I knew she lied and tried to hide it, she immediately says “ok I can’t do this if you’re gonna fight with me cus I’m in the middle of something now”. So I just hung up and we haven’t talked since. \n\nThe reason I’m asking if I’m the asshole is because her grandpa passed away on Christmas Day and I didn’t message or say anything to her. Before our fight, she told me he was very sick and that she was pretty cut up about it. \n\nObviously my reasons for cutting her out of my life aren’t limited to this one event, but this seems to be the place where I should draw the line. My work is extremely important to me and it seems like she doesn’t care about my professional reputation or my clients. \n\nAm I justified in wanting to just cut off all contact with her? Should I have said something about her grandpa? ",

      "description": "Let me give some backstory.\n\nMe and my friend (let’s call him Ron) have known each other for more than 10 years since school and he is a very intelligent and creative guy especially in film making.\n\nA couple of years ago, he suddenly left college unexpectedly and said that he is pursuing a career in music. Note that he said music not rap so I assumed he was going to play a guitar or a cello and have a prestigious career in an orchestra or writing music because Ron is an incredibly intelligent guy.\n\nNearly a year goes by where I haven’t heard from him and he gives me a surprise call saying how am I and that he wants to show his music album off to me and a couple of my other friends from our old social group back in school.\n\nIt was good to see Ron although he looks really tired but brings it up on his laptop to put it on the speaker and my jaw drops. \n\nIt’s bad. Really bad. He was trying to be a Lil Pump knockoff. He mumbled through the whole song on a mediocre, generic rap beat about cars  and money for 2 minutes and then went “uh” for the last 20 seconds before it fades out.\n\nMe and my friends go quiet because we weren’t expecting this low quality from Ron. He asked how we liked it and a few of my friends went “Eh” and “Alright” but my big mouth told him bluntly about how he’s mumbling and that there are no lyrics.\n\nHe argues with me about that there are lyrics and that this is today’s style of music. I then told him that he wasted a year on making this and that’s went he went quiet and I decided to leave.\n\nI think my choice of words could have been better because he has taken it bad. He probably knows that the end result was bad but didn’t want his closest friends to tell him that. Was I in the wrong for saying it was cheap Lil Pump and that he wasted a year of his life? Am I the asshole for giving my opinion that he asked on a  friend I really think can be successful in any other field except for rap?",

      "description": "I (25M) first became friends with P. (24m) when I was still together with my ex-girlfriend. Things seemed normal at first, I tried to be as supportive as possible when he came out to me, and even when he later confessed to me that he had a crush on me. I made it clear that I am not gay and nothing would ever happen between us, but I tried to be as nice as possible about it. He seemed to just accept that at first, but a few weeks later send me a lot of texts about how attractive he found me and how much he loved me and wanted me. I told him that his behavior was super inapproriate and that I did not want any contact anymore, which he then tried to turn around to me being a homophobe, then he tried to get pity from me because he was so alone and felt so unaccepted because I did not want him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few weeks and things have ended with my ex. I start spending a lot of time with a friend (lets call her A.) who happens to be in the same social circle as P., which leads to us having contact again. I want to give him a second chance, and things seem to have improved at first. Recently however, things started to get a bit weird again. First he wanted to go on activities alone with me, which I did not think of as odd, but then he wanted to help me with a paper I had to write and while I was at his place tried to turn it into a sort of date. That made a lot more sense to me later when I found out that he had asked A. if she thought he might have a chance with me now that I was single.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings somewhat escalated when we went drinking two weeks ago with some friends and two people who did not know P. yet. At this point A. and I are officially together. P. usually gets drunk really fast, and after he had his first drink started to make inappropriate comments and attempted to flirt with me so hard that I chose to change seats. He followed me to where I was now sitting, and continued, up to the point where when he went for a bathroom break, the two people who did not know him beforehand asked me if he had a crush on me. All of this in front of my girlfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we were leaving he insisted on giving me a hug, even though he knows I do not like hugging people, and pulled me in really close and, calling me by an affectionate name that, while it has no translation to english, I can assure you no one has ever used outside of a sexual context. I felt super uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe texted me the next morning and we basically talked a bit about how he was uncomfortable with there being more people then he had initially thought, while I tried to tell him that he had made some weird comments and I thought his behaviour was not okay. The next day he texted me trying to make smalltalk, I have not yet replied to that because neither I nor my girlfriend want anything to do with him after the way he behaved. Usually I hate it when people just ghost others, and I would normaly not want to do it that way, but I believe he will just try to turn around anything I say to him to me being the problem, and I just really do not want to talk to him because of the way he makes me feel.",

Yes. I WAITED for THREE HOURS for the message, and then I go on my switch, and it says she's offline. I go on discord and ask her why she's offline. She responds with:  \"I was playing BOTW and didn't have my phone, chiiill.\" Now granted, it may have come off as rude, as this is what I said:  \"are you there? you're not responding to my texts so I WOULD assume you are asleep but you just got off botw, so...\" but i did follow it up with: \"sorry if i came off as rude, i was just getting kinda mad because i texted you on like 4 different places and you didn't respond. sorry for spamming you lmao.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to play some stardew valley?",

      "description": " \n\nThis is partially a WIBTA, and partially a rant because there’s a lot I need to get off my chest. TLDR at the bottom. Here we go!\n\nFor a bit of background, I live with 4 other people. My SO, my SO's mother, her roommate, and her roommates daughter (7).They'll be refereed to as SO, M for SO's mother, R for roommate, and D for his daughter.\n\nMy SO and I are renting a room out of M’s house, for roughly $500 dollars between the two of us. M is a bitch, R is a slob, and D is a spoiled brat. I absolutely can not stand living here with them.\n\nR’s room, which is down the hall from ours, is so dirty and disgusting we can smell it from halfway down the hall. He doesn’t clean, he steals my cigarettes, doesn’t use soap washing dishes which leaves greasy pots and pans for us to rewash, and constantly begs for money to buy beer. He wastes any income he has on whatever his daughter wants. \n\nD is fairly well behaved for a 7 year old, and all of her shortcomings aren’t hers to blame, but R’s for not teaching her. She stays up late into the night playing fortnite with R, hides her homework so she can go home and play games, soaks up my internet running Netflix while she sleeps, throws her toilet paper in the trash across from the toilet, and won’t eat anything but candy because he allows it, already causing her barely new adult teeth to rot out.\n\nR and D have separate rooms, but D’s room is so full of whatever shit she wants, that she still sleeps in Rs room. Which I feel being a single father, sharing a room with your daughter when she’s 7 is a bit inappropriate. But maybe thats just me. That does though lead to me and my SO sharing a tiny ass room between two adults and one whole room left unused because of D. \n\nM is where it gets tricky. As said before she is my SO’s mother, and would particularly be the one that I would screw over. She isn’t too terrible of a person and I don’t want to dislike her due to the fact that she will in time be my mother in law. The thing is, she constantly bitches about R and D to no end, but refuses to do anything. She won’t get them out, she won’t take D’s room away. She’ll just complain. She’ll complain and bitch about everything. The most recent being me leaving a single pot on the stove. I get a text at work from her going off about how there are a million dishes in the sink. There were quite a few dishes in the sink. ONE of them was mine, and that ONE was the only one there when I rushed out the door already late to work. Did I mention R will hoard our entire kitchen in his room and bring it all out at once, tossing it in the sink? Yea. He but the blame on me. So she bitched and bitched all day about how she won’t clean after grown adults, if she has to clean messes she wants more money. She knows my income is tiny, and that Im about to be a full time student. It’s entirely disrespectful how she handled it, immediately calling me out over text without trying to assess the situation at all. And this shit will happen at least once a week. I’m getting sick of it. \n\nNow to the WIBTA part. M is struggling to make ends meet on the house, which I believe is the only reason R and D are still there. She gets the majority of money from me and my SO. When I first moved our plan was to move out asap, but I decided I wanted to take it slow and give her plenty of warning so she could make arrangements for a new roommate or however she wanted to handle losing our income. But now after nearly a year of being treated with complete and utter disrespect, I’m about to say fuck it. I no longer want to give her that luxury due to the way I’ve been treated here. I’m about to come into a monthly stipend for school from some benefits that I have. Enough to get a decent apartment. The second that money is in my pocket, my plan is to move out within the month. If my SO and I were to leave with hardly any notice, she would more than likely be forced to sell the house. Would this make me the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor clarification, this is not an official landlord-tennent situation. There's no drawn up papers, official agreements, or leases. We all pay her under the table rent month to month to live in her house.\n\nTLDR: Awful roommates, “landlord” treats me like shit, if I were to move out with little notice, she would no longer be able to make her payments, and would in turn lose the house.

I sent back something like 'ah rip I'm 6ft' and he replies back 'so?'. I then kinda told him I just didn't really want to date anyone shorter than me and he launched into how I'm a horrible shallow person and I'm like every other girl wanting a guy that is at least 6ft. Not going to lie his rant kinda shook me a bit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike maybe it is shallow but god damn I just want to feel like a female for once and feel small and protected.

      "title": "WIBTA For Cutting Off My Mother Because She Wants Me To Divorce My Wife, Even Though She's Pregnant And It's Not Mine?",
      "description": "Four months ago, my wife of five years cheated on me. She went out with several of her colleagues, had far too much alcohol and ending up sleeping with one of her male co-workers. I ended up finding out the next day, when she got home and confessed everything. She was so genuinely regretful and seemed terrified of losing me, that I ended up forgiving her.\n\nHowever, we're now facing a different problem. My wife is pregnant and we both know it's not mine; I'm infertile. My wife swore that, if I wasn't comfortable raising another man's child, she would be willing to get rid of it or go it alone. The thing is, we've both desperately wanted children from the start. IVF wasn't something we could afford and we're fairly certain we'd never be able to adopt. After a day or so of thinking it through, I told my wife that I wanted to keep and raise the baby. \n\nMy wife is now roughly four months pregnant and we just broke the news to my parents. Knowing about my fertility struggles, it didn't take long for my mother to connect the dots and realize that the baby wasn't mine (I had gone to her after my wife confessed for advice). She didn't take it well AT ALL. Since she found out, my mother has been constantly telling me to divorce my wife and let her raise \"the mistake she made\" on her own. When I refused and told her that I want this baby, she switched to instead guilt tripping me about how the baby's real father will want to be involved. (Spoiler alert; he doesn't. He doesn't want kids and refused to even talk to my wife after she told him she was pregnant.)\n\nShe's gotten worse over the past couple of days. She was so supportive when we considered using a sperm donor last year, so I'm utterly baffled as to why she's suddenly decided that I shouldn't raise a child that isn't mine. Last night was the final straw. She decided it would be A-OK to give me the ultimatum - make her get an abortion or divorce her. No. Fuck no. I love my wife more than anything. Yes, she made a mistake, but I am not going to hold it against her. I've known about this baby for a little over a month and I've already grown attached, even though it isn't mine. \n\nMy mother's behaviour is driving me up the wall. I haven't let my wife see any of the messages she's sent me yet, though I worry she might start harassing her about an abortion soon. I'm considering cutting my mother out of my life until she pulls her head out of her rear. This behaviour isn't okay and I'm not having her upset my wife over a mistake we've both moved on from. Yet, I hesitate to actually cut her off because...she's my mother. I love her and I desperately want to see her come around.\n\nWIBTA if I cut my mother off for this?",

      "description": "Characters\n\nMe = Me\n\nOLG = Obsessed Landwhale Girl who's a catfish\n\nF1 = My friend 1\n\nF2 = My friend 2\n\nBackstory\n\nOLG liked me a lot. I was oblivious. Recently broke up with Ex (it was a nice breakup so like no hard feelings) and there was a party soon. Was @school when I get a message off F1 saying \"OLG is gonna try and come onto you at the party\". I had never thought of OLG like that &amp; I was a little surprised.\n\nI'd never actually seen her in person. On insta, she was hot. I thought might as well pop-up and get to know her, as friends. We started talking on Wednesday and the party was Saturday. I never made the conversation sexual. I had a rave on Friday.\n\nMain Body\n\nHer convo was dead so I thought I'd just speak on Saturday.\n\nNow, on pills, I get stupidly confident and the result is I pull more girls than normal. This did result in me taking a girl back to an airbnb and sleeping with her. It was all consensual and we both had fun so I didn't see an issue here (I still speak to the girl as a friend).\n\nI left the airbnb at like 12:00, when the owners said we had to leave and went straight home and slept till 19:00 meaning for the afternoon, I was unable to respond to messages. I thought any normal human would understand. I wake up to a stupid amount of missed calls and messages from a number not saved in my contacts. I read the messages and deduced it was OLG. I sent a message saying something like \"Hey, sorry, I was sleeping, see you later :)\". Nothing flirty.\n\nI get to this party at like 21:00 and everyone is already fucked up so I start drinking. I see F1 and F2 and they rush straight over and tell me how OLG has been chatting shit about how I lead her on and then didn't answer her calls. I'm tipsy at this point and really didn't care. I had saved the snap messages so I could prove I didn't lead her on. Then one of our mutual friends comes over (a female) and goes all Karen on me saying I'm a dickhead and that I should 'give her a chance'. I thought to myself, a girl likes me, I might as well give it a try.\n\nI don't approach her for a little while but when I do, I realise HOLY FUCK SHE'S NOT WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE IN THE PICTURES! It's too late though. She see's me and goes \"omg hiiiiiiii! Where have you been hiding all night?!\". I start doing small talk but keep it all non-flirty as to make sure I don't give off the wrong impression. Me, F1 and F2 have a signal that basically means 'get me the fuck out of here'. It's literally just getting eye-contact and opening your eyes wide at them. F1 rushes over and gives some shitty excuse as to why I need to come with him to another room and yay I get to stop talking to OLG.\n\nI talk to F1 and F2 about how she's a massive catfish and they agree. I avoid her as much as I can.\n\nLook in comments for rest of story.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my daughter to spend time with my in-laws?",
      "description": "I had my daughter two months ago and she has only seen my husband's parents a couple of times despite the fact that we live in the same small town. The reason being that I don't want to see them whatsoever. \n\nThroughout my entire pregnancy, particularly the last few months, none of them made any effort to spend time with me. When I tried to make plans, they would say they were busy and not try to reschedule. I live in my husband's hometown away from my family and friends, so I found this to be a very lonely period in my life.\n\nHis step-mom offered to throw me a baby shower, but didn't want to pay any fees to have it held at the bars and restaurants she suggested. The fees weren't terribly high, but I'm on a strict budget, so I couldn't pay them myself. She and her husband are rather well-off, so I was surprised she wasn't willing to pay the extra $50-100. My husband's mother ended up offering to host the party instead. His step-mom called me in complete hysterics because his mother wanted to plan the party, since it would be at her house. I felt very uncomfortable being between them, and was grateful anybody wanted to plan it at all, so I stayed out of it. Other than she shower, his step-mom only ever talked to me to try to go to my doctor's appointments. I found it really uncomfortable since I was often told to be undressed from the waist down and they asked about my vaginal discharge and other very personal things like that. I let her come to one of the appointments and she embarrassed the hell out of me by being so over the top and loud the whole time she was there. She also took pictures the entire time, which I didn't appreciate since I only had a sheet covering my lower half and my shirt was pulled up exposing my stomach. My husband agreed and said it stressed him out having her there. I didn't let her go after that. She wanted to be present for the birth and was really insulted when I said I wasn't comfortable with that. \n\nFast forward to the baby being born, I was in the hospital incredibly uncomfortable and miserable. I had finally built up the courage to try going to the bathroom for the first time, and his step-mom came barging into the room. My husband asked her to wait outside because there is no real divide between the bathroom and the room in that hospital. I knew I wouldn't be able to use the bathroom with her waiting and let her in the room. She came in and immediately started covering me up more, saying I looked indecent, as I was in a bathrobe. His dad only kept them there for about five minutes, he reeked terribly of beer. When his mother came to visit, she was so excited to see the baby that she didn't listen to a word I said. I was telling her about the labor and delivery and she never once looked at me or responded to what I was saying, then she left. \n\nHis step-mom called every day after I came home from the hospital and I said I wasn't ready for guests. She threw a crying temper tantrum and his dad called us to complain that we were keeping her granddaughter from her. She was apparently upset that the baby wouldn't know the sound of her voice. I caved and let her come over. When they did, I excused myself and sat in another room with my dogs whom I hadn't spent time with since giving birth. My husband stayed in the room with them the whole time. I thought the visit went fine.\n\nWe went to visit his mother at her house. I asked her not to kiss the baby since it is flu season, but she ignored me and kissed her all over her face. I was very frustrated and left soon after. \n\nA month after the baby was born, it was Christmas. I didn't want to go to the big family gathering for fear of germs, but his dad said we had to. So we went to not cause any drama, but my pediatrician recommended not passing her around because there were going to be so many people there. Everybody was heavily drinking, so I decided when I walked in that nobody would be holding her anyways. His step-mom asked to hold her, but I said I would be more comfortable holding her myself with everything going on in the room. I sat there talking to his family for two hours while they all opened presents, I received none. I decided not to care about it and just moved on. We left and I thought that, overall, the gathering went well.\n\nHis step-mom texted me around midnight that night and went off on me for not thanking them before I left. I apologized and thanked her through text, though I thought I did in person. She went on to tell me how I'm so ungrateful and she does so much to include me, but I never appreciate it. She said how rude I was for not spending time with them when they came to my house. I told her I understood that she was upset, but didn't think this was the best way to handle it. A month has now passed since that happened and she has yet to try to talk to me. His dad asked if we could all gather for dinner, I said no thank you. I was so insulted by what his step-mom said to me and do not want to socialize with them until I get an apology.\n\nI posted a picture of the baby on Facebook recently, and his mother commented on it saying, \"I can't wait to see her soon! I'm not as excited to see you two, sorry not sorry!\" I have no idea why she said that, maybe she thought it was funny. I've assumed that is how she felt from the beginning and have no interest in spending time with her now. \n\nI personally don't see why I would let my infant daughter spend time with them. They have no respect for me and no interest in what is going on in my life. My husband feels caught in between me and his family. I don't know what to do at this point. She is their only grandchild and they are making me feel horrible. I don't want to see them and I do not want to send her off without me. She is too little and that would stress me out way too much. Am I the asshole for not sucking it up and avoiding them?",

      "description": "I know some people are going to read the title and completely my assholeness off of that, but let me give some context.\nAlso, apologize for any grammatical errors. English is not my first language.\n\n\nSchool has *never* been my strong suit. I've always struggled with keeping up with the others and the social aspect. I cannot sit down and learn for eight hours. It causes me extreme distress and anxiety, sometimes to the point where I will go to extreme measures like vomiting or punching myself to stay home. I cannot tell you of a time where I was happy being at school or had a grade higher than a D in the past 5 years. I really do try my best but I get anxiety attacks when I have to talk to people, including teachers. I know teenagers are cruel, but can you imagine getting called slurs for most of the day because of the gender you like and identify as? \n\n\n\nMy parents bring up the one year I was actually doing fantastic, but that was back in third grade and it was to impress a boy. But last night was my breaking point. I slept for 3 hours and the rest of the time was me balling my eyes out about how I didn't want to attend school. I'm already eight credits behind and in my sophmore year. I'm going to take two extra years at this rate. I've asked for help, tutoring, alternative schooling-you name it. I was diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder. Im taking medication for it too. Doesn't help me in the slightest. I hate disappointing my parents who just want me to do good in school and risk getting grounded over it. I've just reached my breaking point with public school.\n\n\nI took online summer school to get back 2 credits I lost freshman year. I procrastinated at the beginning but excelled later on. I think I'm going to drop out for online school. No college will accept me with my current GPA, so I either get a GED or finish my diploma online. The paperwork is pretty much all filled out, I just need a parental signature.\n\nI get it, school is hard for everyone in some aspects.  It's exceptionally hard for me. I do understand where my dad is coming from though. I go to the same HS he went to as a child, and he wants me to graduate from it as well. He wants me to have a good future for myself and get good grades so I can a good adult life and experience things he wasn't able to like college. When ever I talk about dropping out, he understandably gets emotional. He's tried to help me with my HW so I can atleast try to get DS, yet I quickly fall behind again. I can tell how bad my grades are hurting him. It would hurt him more if I dropped out considering how close we are. \n\nSo AITA for considering dropping out?",

      "description": "So before i get into it i will give a bit of background.\n\nMy wife and i had two sons before we got married. we were both in our early 20's when she got pregnant with my oldest son. At the time she got pregnant we were in a \"friends with benefits\" stage as we had split up. Before either of us new she was pregnant i decided to leave the country and Travel for a year. It happened very quickly, from the date i decided to go to the time i left was less than  months. She was extremely upset when i told her i was going but we weren't together and were fighting a lot at the time. I really didn't see a future for us. When i was a few days from leaving she told me that she could tell me something that would stop me going, however, i never found out what it was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out she was pregnant. I had been gone about a month when i found out she was pregnant. She told me to continue my travels and enjoy my year that the child would be there when i got back. I thought about it for a few days and decided the right thing to do would to be come back. So a few days later i was on a flight back. To this day i do not in any way regret coming home. We talked when i got back and decided to try work things out for the sake of the child. In fairness it was me who ended the relationship as i was going through a lot of things mentally (I had a horrible childhood), so i was happy to give it another go. Knowing i has a child on the way i went full steam into finding a way to provide for my family.  I got a job and fast forward a few years later i have had several promotions and was making good money. I was providing for my now two sons and wife but i was deeply unhappy. \n\nI was working 50-60 hours a week to make sure they needed for nothing. Then in 2016 my mental health issues spilled out and i became suicidal. I look back now and see that it was always there from my childhood just below the surface. I ended up leaving my job cause it was killing me inside how much i hated it. My mental health got worse and i was hospitalized for my own protection. After a very long stay in hospital and a lot of counselling and hard work plus medication and now i m doing a lot better. I know for those 2 years i was sick i put my wife through hell, her not knowing if i would take my life was extremely tough on her. She became the provider for the family while i was unwell and she still is to this date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now my issue (finally!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn September of last year i went to university to follow a dream i had since my childhood. The degree i am doing has a big workload. I had consulted my wife about this before i took the course and she agreed i should do it that we would make it work for the 3 years. Since i have started i constantly get pulled away from doing college work. I barely get the chance to stay late to study as my wife keeps taking overtime so i come home to take care of my sons. Once at home i try to study but the kids are constantly needing attention. They are both between 8-11 so they are big enough that i don't need to keep my eyes constantly on them but not old enough that they can mind themselves. I am barely getting a chance to study and i am exhausted trying to balance everything. As a result i am failing my course. I want to tell my wife she needs to put me first and do less overtime. She also constantly goes over to her sisters house leaving me at home saying the kids are in there rooms so i should be able to study. My sons been the age they are constantly fight so i do have to stop them and cant get to study constantly for a few hours.\n\nI constantly gave up things i was interested in, went without so my kids could have whatever they wanted. paid all the bills so my wife could mind the children. I think it is time for them to give me the freedom to do the degree. WIBTA to say to them that i gave up everything to give them what they wanted and now its they're turn to give me what i want for three years?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He does this no matter who is in the car with him, and has done it ever since I was a kid.\n\nWhen I was younger, my mom reminded us to put our seatbelts on whenever he got in these moods and always double checked to make sure we were wearing them when he stepped on the gas. For about ten years, I have ignored this request. I feel like if he’s going to drive recklessly and put everyone in danger to prove a point, I’m willing to let him kill me so that he has to live with the guilt of killing his daughter for the rest of his life.\n\nI know this sounds harsh, but I absolutely HATE people trying to bully people into agreeing with them and he’s always done this.

      "description": "As a quick background, I am living in a shared appartment with a very close friend of mine since November '15 and as the title suggests I sometimes had trouble paying my rent on time, especially in the earlier days when I started my apprenticeship. We talked about this and my rommate said it wasn't a big deal as long as i tried to pay it back as soon as possible, which i did. Most of the time i just payed double the rent a month later. But due to stupidity or severe lack of money i missed out on a few. I was pretty sure I missed only three and he trusted me on that.\n\nA few weeks ago i finally had enough money at the end of the month to pay him back fully. Wich felt really good, because, even though we never really talked about it, it was a huge weight on my chest for the entire time.\n\nToday he checked his accounts and found that I am still missing two months of rent, I double checked, and he is right.\n\nSo whats the big deal just pay him back, right?\n\nNo, here is the problem I thought about a lot everytime it came to paying back rent. In about mid 2016 his girlfriend basically moved in with us, it was never really offical but she had a key, slept here every night and so on (which is not a problem at all, as far as I am concerned, I like her and we get along very well) but she lives here rent free.\n\nShe at the time, and still, does not have a lot of money available and I never talked about how we shoud maybe rearrange rent distribution, since I am basically paying part of her rent.\n\nSo would I be an asshole for addressing that i might not owe him anything since I payed half of the rent for his girlfriend for about two years?\n\nI am really hesitant about this because I don't want to get into an huge argument over money, just doesn't feel right, but simply paying doesn't either.\n\nI guess I just want to know if i have any moral ground to stand on or better just suck it up and pay.",

      "description": "So I've just come back from being away for a few months. I knew I'd be traveling during this time and wasn't sure how much time I'd have to play with my Nintendo Switch, so I left it at home (my mother's home). \n\nMy sister (17) and her boyfriend (18) enjoy using it so I said they could play with it when they wanted whilst I was gone. It's probably the most expensive thing I own and I love it to bits, it's very rare that I'll splurge on something like a game system. So I warned them several times to be careful with and if they broke it then I'd expect them to pay and replace it. They're not little kids and are pretty responsible teenagers so I wasn't to worried.\n\nObviously I get home and it's broken. \n\nOne of the joy cons is drifting, essentially one of the control sticks is stuck forward slightly, it's so bad that it's essentially unusable. I've looked it up and it's a pretty common problem which can be solved with some electronic cleaner but sometimes you just need to get a new controller and they're expensive. They probably left it out and it's collected dust under the control stick.\n\nI asked about it and they said it was like that when I left, it definitely wasn't. I played it with them the night before I left and it was fine. This really pissed me off because they're not taking responsibility for it and it means they knew about it and didn't try to fix it or anything.\n\nSo I'm going to try some of the fixes but if it doesn't work would I be the asshole for making them play for the replacement even though it's something that could have happened if I'd kept it with me?",

Remeber that he isn't just my ex. He was my bestfriend.

      "description": "I know it sounds like click bait, but I need some perspective here. Usual on mobile formatting blah blah blah.\n\nMy group of friends have been playing a new game (Apex Legends) a bunch lately and this happened last night. We drop into a city and immediately start fighting 2 other groups. We kill them, but another group shows up at the end when we have no health. I down one guy, friend L downs one guy, but the guy that I down has downed out other teammate (friend B). There is still one guy around somewhere, but friend B is right next to me, so i start to revive him. Friend L gets in a fight with the remaining guy from the other team and is killed, but i finish that guy off. Shortly after that, another squad pulls up while friend B and I are healing and wipes us. \n\nAs we are going back to the main menu, Friend L tells me that I should have went to him and found the last guy before I started to revive friend B. He says it in a way that makes it sound like advice, but I think it is a way at him being salty about dying and me not helping immediately. I told him I was reviving our other squad mate that was right next to me, and he just says that I should have found the last guy before reviving. I said \"whatever, hindsight is 20/20\" and he said \"it's not hindsight, it is what anyone should do in that situation\". I am getting annoyed and say \"whatever buddy\" (in a condescending tone) and he flips on me and says I don't need to get mad about it, he was just giving his advice.\n\nThis is the thing that annoys me the most, since he is the one who brought it up and used the guise that it was just advice, but I know what he was getting at. This friend could sell sand in the desert and is really good with words, when I get kind of flustered and feel like I can barely speak my native English in these situations. It was dropped later on, but I could tell that he was still pissed off and truthfully I was also. \n\nSo, AITA here?",

I let one of them drive the boat because they said they want to buy one for themselves.\n\nThey drove us right into an oyster bed. Damages from bow to stern. Exposed fiberglass and all. They felt bad, apologized and all that. But after that - not a peep. I got my estimate for the repair and now I feel like a douche for even trying to approach them to see if they can either cover the entire amount or at least pay half. I feel that I’m entitled to at least half because I’ve worked really hard for years for this as my reward and now it’s damaged. But the other side of the coin is - they meant no ill and it was an honest mistake on top of me allowing them to drive in the first place instead I could have just said no. I make more than they do combined so that’s another reason I feel bad for accepting or even asking for them to pay.\n\nAm I the asshole for taking their money to repair my boat? ",

      "description": " As a bit of background my BF makes more money than I do, comes from a richer family and is very experimental. He likes buying things, and probably enjoys replacing things if they break down/are damaged etc because he gets to try something new. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI on the other hand, am more of a minimalist, I like to have one good version of each thing and treat it very carefully. I expect it to last a long time. For example if I buy a tent, I spent a lot of time researching tents, what I want out of it, look after it and I expect it to last at least 10 years unless something horrible happens to it. He is more likely to be happy if it even lasts 2-3 years. He is more likely to try and cook from sitting inside the tent which in my opinion is too close and would damage the cover, definitely warping and even making holes in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I bought a second hand car, its small, manual and quite zippy and fun to drive. On long drives we alternate who’s car we take based on how much stuff we need, we both share driving. In my opinion he drives my car ‘like a rental’ , he obviously has a lot of fun driving it. I don’t love driving and he really enjoys it. But the way he drives it hurts my feelings. To be honest, this is exactly how he treats his own car too. He said if he burns out anything he will replace it. But I don’t want that wear and tear on my car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is more likely to drive a car until its too expensive to fix, where as I am wanting to treat it well and sell it in a few years. Am I an asshole for wanting him to drive it more carefully?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nMy boyfriend and I treat our material possessions very differently. I want him to treat my stuff with a bit more respect, but he says he will just replace it if it breaks. ",

      "description": "(We're all college students sharing an apartment/room with each other. We moved in in September, so we've known each other for a while now. This happened several weeks ago with her then-new boyfriend.)\n\nUsually, when they want to have sex, they will ask for the room for a few minutes and lock the door. On this specific occasion, I blacked out drunk at a party the night before and slept like the dead, until the early afternoon. At which point they decided to have sex in our room. I guess in my blacked-out state I had submerged completely under the covers, and they didn't see me in there when they got started. Also, I'm on the top bunk, and she's on the bottom. Apparently, my room mate checked beforehand to make sure I wasn't there (going so far as to climb my ladder), but she still didn't see me.\n\nI woke up well into them having sex. As soon as I woke up, I realized what they were doing, but I could also tell that they had max 30-40 seconds left. Something triggered in me to play dead; I immediately woke up with the thought, \"They must not know I'm here, oh god\". I thought that maybe I could sneak out afterwards. Unfortunately, on her boyfriend's way out, he happened to spot the back of my head. As soon as he left the room, I bolted, but they were both aware by now that I had been in there. We all apologized, laughed, and that was it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, one of my *other* room mates walked in on them having sex. I guess the door was unlocked. They were all talking about it a few minutes later, and I joked, \"Wow, (room mate), you're two-for-two now\" and laughed. She didn't think it was funny. She immediately started yelling that it was my fault for not \"making as much noise as possible\" when I realized what they were doing. I suppose that that's true, but I was never mad about it happening in the first place. I pointed out that I had been more asleep than I previously thought humanly possible, and that I only woke up towards the very end, but she wasn't having it. I also didn't see anything, if that's worth mentioning. Still, she said that it's my fault that it happened, and she's mad at me about it. Personally (and this might make me the asshole), it seemed weirder in the moment to start yelling at them for not knowing I was there. I never really raise my voice in the first place (it's a big problem, I can barely even honk when a car's gonna hit me), and I didn't want to have a huge falling out/argument about it (we're a \"sex-positive\" apartment, so I figured that it might be spun the wrong way in conversations about me later). I tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal (because with all the shit that happens in this house, it's really not). Maybe joking about it made me the asshole, I don't know.\n\n  \nTL;DR: woke up to my room mate finishing up having sex below me, didn't interrupt, a month passes, I joked about it, and she's pissed about it.

She ended up sleeping right up against and \"cuddling\" this other guy in the bed the whole night. Nothing else happened.\n\nMy girlfriend and i have been together for a year and a bit, shes 19 im 20 and weve yet to spend a night together because of her strict parents.

      "description": "I’m posting on mobile so sorry if it looks like crap. \n\nThe souring of my relationship really started long ago but I’ll start with last year. My mother was watching my kids while my wife and I went on a date. My daughter got sick. My mom told me about it and I asked “Did you give her anything?”\n\nHer reply”I don’t know? Kids Medicine.”\n\nI obviously knew that was shady so I got in the car and asked my daughter what she was given. She was almost 8 at the time. She said specifically “green medicine in a triangle shape bottle”\n\nThat’s Vick’s NyQuil if you don’t know and that’s definitely not kids medicine. \n\nSo my mom lied and it put a definite burden on our relationship. We haven’t spoken much this year and my mom has skipped all holidays and birthdays with us. She’s been spending most of her time with her fiancé this year and not had much time for us. \n\nI think so far up until now I’ve been very understanding with her and not asked much of her. \n\nJust this morning my wife was supposed to go with the kids to my mothers house to go suit shopping for my boys. Unfortunately my youngest boy has had a stomach bug and wasn’t feeling well. \n\nMy mother being unconcerned with the well being of my son said “I guess the boys just won’t be in my wedding then.” And then proceeded to swear at me and call me names. \n\nSo I lost it. I hung up on her before I said anything I’d regret in a minute. \n\nI was prepared to leave it at that knowing time would calm her down. \n\nThen she started texting me, accusing me of blaming her for all my problems. She accused me of keeping the kids away from her (despite inviting her to all functions) and accused me of not caring about her happiness and also accused me of lying about my son being sick. \n\nMy response was to tell her that she was being self centered and selfish with her timend that she was the cause of her not seeing my kids. I also told her I was still disappointed in her for lying about the medicine earlier this year. \n\nShe was irate. She told me to go fuck my self and she was done with me. Have a nice life. \n\nAs I was typing this up my mother sent a voice message to my daughter saying that mommy and daddy won’t let her see them and when she turns 18 she can come see her for the truth. Am I in the wrong here? ",

      "title": "AITA For Having a Friendship Ended Over A Misheard Word?",
      "description": "Throwaway Account and Long Post (will answer questions tho)\n\n \n\nHey Reddit! This has been eating me for a while recently as I am approaching my last semester of College as this is also probably a last chance to try and repair a friendship with someone. Granted this had occurred in 2017, and most haven’t been acted upon since Early 2018, however, I still want some outside input on the situation (whether it’s because I want to know that this was a messed up situation or whether I did something wrong). Also sorry in advance for this long thing.\n\nFirst, The Players, ie the people involved\n\nMyself (Fix): was 21F. I am the type of person to have a low social battery due to myself being introverted. I also can get easily emotional and apologize for a lot of things, meaning a lot of them (I rarely say sorry and not mean it). My hearing is also not the best and sometimes mishear stuff and have to ask for a repeat, while also being a bit daft as a board and thus needing someone to explain it plainly to me. Despite this, I try to be a good person and be treated how I would like to be treated. \n\nFriend A: Was a 22M. Was a much calmer personality and liked to see and do different things, and pretty much never seemed tired, as well as seeming to be a tech wizard. However, in some events, he did rely heavily on others to agree to last-minute plans or have others work out times in short windows of time. Seemed to always have a problem that was worse than others.\n\nFriend B: Won’t talk too much on this fella as he is literally important to the event and the effects afterward. I thank this person so much, along with all my friends that stuck around with me through this! We are still really good friends to this date\n\nSecond, The Situation/Story\n\nTo start this off, I should explain that Friend A and myself met in a College class when I first started going to college (2014) and during this period, I was worried about not making friends so tried to puff my chest up with confidence and make the first impression (this died out after the first week of class; I also meet more friends including Friend B during this period). So, we built up a three-year friendship of meeting up with each other and hanging out in between classes or catching a movie and lunch during weekends, sometimes with other people. Along with this, we also did games on some weekends and this is also where I was asked to buy Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army so we could play together. Granted I wasn’t a fan of the game due to me being pretty scared of Horror games (even tame ones) and not a giant fan of Zombie games (also my aim is terrible). However, I took the plunge and bought the game, which we then found out it was buggy and didn’t even work (cause it to be shelved). I also caught a lot of different movies with Friend A, and some of which I wasn’t fond of but still went because I believed that is what friends do; You do stuff that may make the other person happy because, at one point or another, they will do the same for you. I also was getting to know people online and becoming friends with them, while growing in a Discord server. I also tried to talk to Friend A about maybe joining in on some stuff (one of which was an online DnD session, though he turned it down due to it being online and not physical). Along with this, it sometimes seemed that Friend A’s problems were deemed worse than my own problems when we discussed them (ie we both were bullied in Grade School; Friend A was bullied by this one kid and it resulted in him quitting something he loved due to this but would later “be redeemed” (my words) as he would be having a good High School life, I, on the other hand, was bullied and unfortunately let it dictate my life which might have led to me being quieter and not having a very social able life \\[I was probably a lone wolf type in High School\\]. Both are bad in their own right, but I always felt like my bullying wasn’t as bad as his bullying). Again, everything seemed to be going fine till Spring Semester 2017. \n\nBefore Spring Break, Friend A and I were both looking for places to intern at and it was mentioned by Friend A that he was planning to hear about something over Spring Break (he NEVER told me or hinted at what this was, it was just “I don’t want to jinx myself so I won’t tell you anything about it”). Friend A also mentioned that if he also wanted to go see a movie over Spring Break, to which I told him specifically that seeing a movie was fine, but HE NEEDS TO TELL ME. I don’t know if he blew it off or expected me to text him over Spring Break despite what I had said, but I didn’t text him, thinking to myself that he was busy with his important thing that I knew next to nothing about as well as during Spring Break, I got word from my mother that my grandmother (her mother) had an incident that caused great worry in the family (my grandmother is currently my only living grandparent as I lost my grandfather \\[my dad’s father\\] a year prior in October and it seemed to be leading toward a funeral). With all this stated, I got back from Spring Break, unnerved on the whole situation and worrying about an impending funeral. I meet up with Friend A a day or two after Spring Break and was greet with conceded anger over the fact he never received word from me over Spring Break to make plans. I apologized and told him that I had asked for him to text me when he was available and mentioned I was concerned about my grandmother due to her scaring my family over Spring Break. He blew it off, or it felt like he did as he still seemed quite mad at me over the situation and telling me throughout the day that he told me to text him over Spring Break for plans (AGAIN, He made a big fuss over this unknown important call he might have gotten, so I didn’t want to bother him and make plans with this unknown thing). This resulted in the straw that broke the camel’s back situation. We were sitting in a quiet space (no loud talking) and I was sitting on my computer checking in on some of my online friends as well as working on a Discord server (I think I also was trying to cheer myself up and I didn’t feel like talking to Friend A would be good at that point). I need to quickly explain something hear which is the fact that I do try and hide certain events from my friends, online and in person, unless I deem it necessary for the person to know. This is kinda-of where that second best thing comes into play, where I think someone else is suffering more than me and I don’t need to vent my problems to them. Along with this, I also use a sona to hide myself on the internet which is considered to mainly be fire based but I am usually water-based (this will be important later). Anyways, I was distracted on my computer, working on the Discord server and communicating with friends, when Friend A told me he was heading to the loo. Or so I thought that’s what he said. I told him that was fine and I would head off to class as I had one in a few hours. Some time passed and I texted him, telling him that I was heading to class and would meet him afterward, and packed my stuff up and headed to class. I got there early and was waiting for the next class to get out when I noticed Friend A text me back. This message basically said that I had left him, a depressed person, alone on the garden roof in which he could have committed suicide. This leads to the fact I misheard roof as loo. I was so upset and that’s when the class prior was getting out and in walks in Friend B (I had talked with Friend B so little during the time due to most of my time hanging out with Friend A however we maintained good contact), who noticed something was up and went over to me asking if I was alright. I don’t recall very much of what happened except handing my phone over to Friend B and having him walk me away from class because I believe I couldn’t think straight. After that, it was a blur which ended with me driving home and crying in bed. Looking back on what memories I have of the event, I can vaguely recall seeing Friend A walking up to Friend B and me just walking away. \n\nI don’t recall very much else during that week and had to rely on screenshots I had taken during that period when I was relaying this to a few of my closest friends when I had asked for their opinion on everything (granted I don’t know if they were biased because I was their friend and the situation was fresh). I remember inviting Friend A to see Beauty and the Beast with me and another person, however, it resulted in him complaining about the theater location and me not wanting to make plans after that (I was invited by my other friend and this was not my plan). \n\nSo following this event, Friend A texted me something (don’t have that) with me responding to it with a “Sorry?” (genuine sorry, though confused as I didn’t fully know what to apologize for at the time. Do I say sorry for being a bad friend? For not being a smart person and going like “Why did he say loo?”? For not being a mind reader?). \n\nFriend A: Why does it matter to you?\n\nMe: Because you are my friend and I worry about my friends\n\nFriend A: Why do I believe this is truly the first time for me, in all of the recent event?\n\nMe: I am terrible at social interaction (At this point, revisiting these, I don’t EVEN RECALL being fake to Friend A. Truly I do care about all my friends, and I will openly admit I don’t pick up on social queues and really do require my friends to flat out tell me of stuff. I never did tell Friend A this information, as this is just what I pick up on)\n\nFriend A: My wounds are still bleeding out\n\nMe: I am sorry to hear that and am hoping they get better\n\nFriend A: I can hear the irritation in your tone. Just do something for me, don’t start getting irritated over someone’s plea for help, and if it so happens, don’t c",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my aunt or my mother in my life anymore (21 F)",
      "description": "I am a few weeks into my junior year in college when I recently realized thaf I haven't spoken to my mother in almost 2 years and my aunt in almost 5 or 6 years. \nOkay....so my aunt is a begger. Everyone in the family knows that. She can barely keep a job (I think. I've never seen her in work close the entire time I knew her), She steals, she lies, and she was just a bad example when I was younger. Now I understand people talk about blood is thicker than water but I don't care. Even if you're family, If you fuck me over or play me, I will cut ties. Multiple incidents occured when my aunt decided to visit on many occasions. One I vividly remember is the day my dad came home angry. I was in high school so lets say like 15 or 16. I asked him what had happened. Apparently my aunt asked my mother for the pin to the EBT card because she wanted just a little food. My mother gave it to her. Not surprising to me she spent pretty much like $200 or more on groceries even though she just wanted a few things. My dad was pissed and so was my mother. My aunts response: You should have never given me the pin. \nWtf? \nShe gave you the pin because you asked to get A LITTLE food. Not feed you for the next month or two while we haven't even gone grocery shopping yet. The next incident was a couple weeks before me and my dad moved. I love animals. At the time I had a cat that I named Noah. He was the love of my life and everyone knew that. Now I dont remember what started the little argument. There was no yelling. I remember having an attitude because of something she said and I WALKED AWAY FROM HER. I wasn't in the mood to argue. Then she came up to my dads room where I was sitting and said: \"blah blah blah. You need to get over it. You ain't gonna have your cat for long anyways so say goodbye\".\nI fucking snapped and I told her off and made her cry. I didn't care. I knew I probably would be able to bring him and I was already upset about it. Now you want to make me feel worse. That ain't gonna happen. I would also like to add that one day she let him outside and I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN! I didn't get to say goodbye auntie. When we finally left, I didn't say goodbye to her and I haven't spoken to her since.\nThis is getting long but I am going to keep going.\nNow my mother. She...is okay. I mean if I had a choice I would obviously choose my dad over my mother. She wasn't really there for me. She drinks until she passes out. She also can't hold down a job or an apartment. She never has her own money and when she borrows, she pretty much never pays it back. She goes to jail more than anyone I have ever known. She does and sells drugs, another reason she ends up in jail. She choose horrible boyfriends. I've had much more fond memories of my father taking care of me when I was sick, coming to my rotc competitions, getting me my first pet, helping me with prom, college, drivers test, etc. When I think of my mother, I can remember the times she obviously took my money without asking, her drunk, her making a scene on a bus for literally no reason, asking for money, yelling, and more. I should love my mother but I can't say i do. I mean she can say I love you and kiss me but I remember always just saying I love her back and then wiping my cheek when she wasn't looking. She always ended up disappointing me in one way or another. Not coming to my high school graduation, getting put in jail the day before my archery competition, just not showing up period. It gets tiresome. Now she is in jail. We haven't spoken in a couple of years. I really don't want to speak with her. I know she is going to just end up in jail again as she always does and I am just left here with people asking me \"How is your mom doing?\" And having to tell them in jail and their response be \"What she do this time?\". Am I the asshole for being done?",

      "description": "Throwaway because people know my reddit account. I didn’t think I was an asshole, but after  thinking about it some more, I’m not sure. This shouldn’t be very long. \n\nWithin a group of friends of mine, there is one person that nobody is really close with, but it seems as though he doesn’t have many other friends then us. Let’s call him Mike for simplicity’s sake. Mike is a little bit strange and is kind of hard to get close with, and upon first meeting him I didn’t really like him. \n\nSometimes, Mike acts as though we are all best friends. The truth is that nobody really knows him that well, but we all continue to hang out with him. Other times, Mike, while he’s with us, appears bored and is on his phone/not participating. That’s fine, he is free to do what he wants, but I have found that it makes it harder for me to get close with him and try to like him. \n\nRecently, he has been talking to me personally more often, I guess trying to get closer, but as I have said it’s very hard to do this because he keeps becoming distant again. Other people have noticed this too, but I always try to defend Mike. I do that because I don’t like talking about people behind their backs. I think what I’m really asking is AITA for mentally agreeing with my friends that he is a little weird, but defending him when they say that and always acting like we’re friends when I’m with him?\n\nI realize that this is badly written and it might get called out as SHP, but I hope somebody understands what I’m trying to say and can judge me properly. If anything needs clarification I’ll try. ",

      "description": "This is gonna be a lengthy and heavy post so sorry in advance. \n\nHere’s some backstory: My dad passed away on thanksgiving of 2018. He overdosed... and his entire life was a huge battle with his addiction. My mother loved him a lot but she couldn’t continue to support his habits so she separated from him when I was 3 years old (20 now). Me and him had an okay relationship... we would keep in contact and see each other occasionally maybe once a month. \n\nAround the beginning of the May he had told me he met this girl and he was in love with her. Look, I KNOW my dad so well... if he wasn’t using I know for a fact he would’ve never fell for this girl. She was an addict as well, half his age, and using him for his money! Then comes May 22nd they go to Vegas and get married. \n\nOn thanksgiving day my dad called me after not speaking to be for 2 months and asked if I would go to dinner with him. It was that day that I found out he was married... 6 months later. Later that night he went home and I got a call around 10pm saying that he overdosed and passed away. \n\nMe and my mom drove to the doctors and the Dr. told us that his wife drove around with his body while he was overdosing because she was crazy high on meth as well. My father could’ve been given medication to combat the overdose but since she continued to drive around he died. For this reason I hate her SO much. \n\nFast forward to the end of November.. we start going through the things that need to be done and I find out that my dad listed me as his only beneficiary for his life insurance. He had an amazing life insurance claim because he was a longshoreman for 23 years. His wife was upset, and I assured her that me and her would both continue getting medical insurance for life, and I would allow her to pick up his last checks and keep them (around $5,000).\n\nHERES THE TWIST! I get a call from her saying that she’s going to be suing me for half of the life insurance so that she’s able to put herself through rehab. I told her that not my responsibility and that if my dad wasn’t high all the time he wouldn’t have married her. I’ve had to go through so much with this woman. She didn’t even go to my dads funeral then the next thing I know she’s asking for half of his life insurance?! \n\nAITA here?!!!!",

I constantly get insulted by her and I literally can’t do anything to fix it bc, as most parents do, the little sibling always wins (she’s 14, I’m 16, by the way)\n\nSo I kind of just knock something off her desk or do something small to piss her off for shits and giggles whenever she insults me, but today I felt like shit (emotionally and physically- I forgot to eat breakfast with my coffee and it caused me to feel like shit, especially because I don’t normally drink coffee anyways lol), when I get home I usually walk through her room because my stepdad likes to smoke cigars in the living room, and the only other way around into my room is through hers.\n\nShocker, I get the usual insult, this time it was “stop walking before you cause an earthquake” (I’m like 230 lbs, some of its muscle but most of it’s just fat tbh). As I said, I felt like hell today, so I decide to fuck with her a little more by unplugging her PlayStation. She flips shit, and I just kind of chuckle and walk away. Fast forward like an hour and my moms screaming at me to come into her room and “fix her thing”. Apparently there was a hardware update on her PlayStation that’d been going all day and I stopped it. \n\nI got into a huge fight with them about “not fucking with her all the time”, which pretty much ended with me telling them both to go fuck off, and that I’d start throwing genuine insults around the house to see what they think about it. (Note, the insults have been going for a solid year almost every day and I really don’t fuckin appreciate it, whenever I talk about it I just kind of get blown off) \n\nNow my families talking about my “issues” and talking about me as if I’m some sort of fucking psychopath. I think it was justified in doing what I did, because the constant flow of insults, even from my own siblings, really take a toll on my already low self confidence and frankly I’m fucking sick of it.\n\nAm I the asshole?

But as time passed, A moved on and etc, and has started hanging out with another girl from my school (studying etc.)\nAnd then, we were 16, in (sort of) the middle of the school year, B went to ask A to get back together because B still has feelings for A. A either refused immediately or he said that he will think about it (i think he refused immediately)\nAnd B essentially told C what happened. So C went to A to persuade (AKA annoy in his books) him to get back with B.\n\ni should add that up till here, i had no prior knowledge of what had happened. \n\nSo one day, I went to get A for our group tuition together and saw A and B together in the room, being all lovey dovey. I'm surprised but okay cool, not my business. We leave and I'm left alone with A. And I tease A asking him, how it happened etc etc. And he tells me that C quite essentially annoyed and forced him to say yes to B's request because apparently, it would be better for B since it was the most important exam of OUR lives. (Note: This is what he told me, whether it's true or not, I don't know fully. But I believed so because it seemed right that C would be the kind of person to do so)\n\nAnd of course A tells me that he doesn't love B anymore. Which leads me to wonder what sort of a normal human being does that to a friend or even a close friend? By having them live in the fantasy of imagined love?\n\nBut it's all good, A's secret is safe with me, since i don't see anyone getting hurt. Once again, none of my business. That is until B contacts me, asking if A likes the other girl I mentioned above, and I say no, because I've seen the way they interact. They're more likely to hate each other as best friends more than be in love with each other. And this is where me and B gets closer-ish. \n\nAnd we go on to text each other and she's asking me if A said anything to me cuz A's not replying her as how he normally would (AKA asap and also lovingly) back when they were together. and I'm telling A to at least reply her and just tell her himself. He refuses. \n\nSo fast forward just a few weeks later, B's crying to me while we're studying about how A doesn't seem to love her at all anymore and that she feels so lonely etc. etc. \n\nAt this point, I'd consider myself close to her, and as a friend, I really don't like seeing such shit happening to my friends. So i quietly excuse myself, call A and ask for his permission to tell B on his behalf so that everyone gets to have their answers. He agrees and I go ahead with it. B cries and all and says she expected it etc etc. I'm just yea okay, I hope you move on quickly and I'll be around to help you out with it.\n\nNote: I believe this was at the start / end of our very important exams.\n\nAnd then remember C? B goes to C telling him what happened and that it was over. C immediately goes berserk, goes to find A, give him a scolding (which A promptly ignores cuz he really doesn't like C all that much). And then C calls me to scold me, and threatening to show up at my place, i just kept quiet and ignored him throughout the call. (If I had the spine i have right now, I'd tell him to fuck off.) C then goes on to do what is basically a weekly humiliation of me in front of the school, and I ignored all of this, cuz i really didn't wanna get in on this shit. \n\nSo tell me reddit strangers, AITA? or rather, WasITA?",

      "description": "It's currently 1:56p and I literally just woke up at 1:06p. I got a text from my coworker at around 10a asking if i can cover for him today. I told him that his request is kinda last minute and im sorry i dont think i can. But then he said that he has \"something to take care of\" today. He didnt say it was important or anything or give me any details about it. Although he did offer me a ride to and from work which is super considerate because i live 20 minutes away. I reiterated that it was kinda last minute and that i need like a day or 2 to know before i gladly take his shift. Cuz hes a great dude and i would usually be willing to cover for him. But from my perspective, today i woke up hella late not expecting to go to work today at 5p. I already covered 2 people last week and worked 5 days in a row from friday to tuesday. I feel like i need a little time off and im already working tomorrow. And ya know, i got stuff to do myself. He wasn't very specific when he said he has something to take care of so it doesnt seem all that urgent. Like i very sympathetic guy if not awkward, but ive been learning how to tell when someone really needs help vs when they are just trying to get a day off. Now that i think of it, i kinda fall under the latter category. So my perspective might be pretty ass, so am i the asshole?",

      "description": "TLDR: I (26F) and my gf (30F) has been together for just over a year. A friend who I had one-sided feelings for 5 years ago, planned a trip together with me this weekend, we had invited my gf but she refused to go. Originally it was a trip of three friends. But the third friend backed out. My friend and I still want to go. Everything is booked and paid for. — but once learning it’s gonna be a trip for two, my gf absolutely refuses for this trip to happen, and instantly told me to cancel. \n\n—-\n\nI (26F) and Friend (27F) has been friends since middle school. Same high school. Same university. We had always been close friends. 5 years ago, I had developed feelings for her, and was promptly rejected. We were/are incompatible and she didn’t return my feelings. We drifted apart for 2 years, I lived out of town for 3. — but my main little group of friends include my Friend. And she is still one of my closest friends (we had mended the friendship in the recent year). \n\nFor the longest time, we had always talked about taking a skating trip to another city close by. We had done it in first year university and had a great time. We wanted to go skating again. This year I’m finally back in town. We promptly planned it. Invited other people, but they were all busy, and one flaked out. We had invited my gf, she did not want to go. Then we planned the trip for a later weekend in Feb, but my gf wanted to spend that weekend with me instead (even though we live together). And insisted on changing the date of the trip. \n\nSo it was changed to this weekend. When my gf isn’t in town. —- my gf asked us to change it! And my Friend had to rearrange other plans in her life, as had I, to make it work. \n\nThen the third friend flaked. I didn’t tell my gf. It just didn’t occur to me that she’d have a problem with this. I want to go on the trip. So what if it’s a two person trip instead? — but I didn’t neglect to tell her intentionally. I just didn’t think it’d be an issue with her. Gf never had insecurities about this Friend before. \n\nLast night, she asked me again about the details of the upcoming weekend trip. Fair enough. I was honest. Clarified it was just gonna be two people. \n\nInstantly, gf freaked out. Went berserk. — saying this is a date instead. A two night three days date. That how could I do this to her. How could I betray her trust like that. — that this trip I’m taking is akin to cheating. \n\nShe instantly started to set rules and boundaries for my friend and I. Apparently I can no longer take the initiative to talk to her. I cannot hang out with her privately. I am to intentionally drift apart from my friend. \n\nI’m flabbergasted. If I am going to cheat, or had the intention to, it’d be so easy to cover up. Gf isn’t in town. I don’t post on social media. She was even invited to the trip, and, we even changed the date because she wanted more time with me. — and WHY would I cheat??? If my heart and mind isn’t just set on my gf, I’d have just separated with her. \n\nJust ‘cause I liked my friend for three months 5 years ago, I have to throw away the friendship and the trip? I can say, without any question, that it’s just pure friendship now. And I do not foresee anything festering. Friend is a friend. \n\nI then refused to cancel the trip. And told my gf we should both reconsider our relationship. She instantly felt personally attacked and is blighted by “You are considering breaking up with me because of HER?” \n\nNo. I’m considering breaking up with you because of your unreasonable controllingness. Your lack of trust in me. And my sadness that you are forcing me to cut off a good friend. \n\nShe didn’t understand. And she couldn’t stand talking to me anymore. Deleted me via the chatting applications. Told me she will not consider Breaking up with me. I can consider alone. And tell her the results via email. \n\nSo. Here I am. AITA? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I just had a girl I’ve been on three dates with (SEVERAL HOURS AWAY) say she’s not ready for a relationship and I’ve been crying a lot. Not to sound crazy but I had feelings for her. I was venting about this in the group chat when\n\nME: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Some of my friends just convinced me that she’s right when she says I should get over her, and we just agreed not to text for a while, and I am pure cry\n\nTHEM: that really sucks but it probably is for the best ): hopefully things get better soon\n\nME: I know it is for the best. Literally everyone including her has been telling me that for the last couple of days, and I finally listened. It hurt so bad right at first, and there is probably going to be more pain as I deal with it, but at least this way I’ll actually move on and not do the same thing to myself that she was doing to herself that created this situation in the first place\n\nTHEM: I think the lesson is to be careful about getting invested too quickly, especially before you’ve talked about what you’re looking for\n\nME: I’d rather not have anyone trying to tell me lessons to take from this. I knew exactly what type of pain I was risking throughout this process and actively chose to take that risk based on my personal values. I took that risk because I knew I would have to tools at my disposal to deal with this pain if/when it came, and now I’m going to work through it, and that work is going to include some crying and complaining as I let myself feel the pain for the time that it needs to be felt. Please don’t try to preach to me about how to handle these types of things again. If I want advice rather than an ear to vent to, I will ask for it.\n\nTHEM: 😅 nvm I guess, back to the poly stuff (what everyone else was talking about while we talked about this)\n\nME: I don’t mean to go off 😂 I just know where I’m at the process that went into the choices that I made in a way that you don’t because I haven’t posted enough context on this server for any of y’all to, and getting told what I should take from this by someone that does have that full context just rubs me the wrong way, especially while I’m still in this painful place about it. No worries though 😊😊\n\nTHEM: I was trying to help bc that’s what I did with the girl I liked before this one, and especially because no one else answered your message. It rubs me the wrong way to have it taken in such a negative way and I don’t know what else to say about it given that. Good luck with dealing with all of that, it’ll eventually get better no matter what\n\nI didn’t answer. ",

We run independent institutional review boards that look at human research and I’m a meeting coordinator (i.e. assist the chair during the meeting and take determinations/minutes/notes on the decision for each study). The meeting I run is at noon today, which is also when my office is having their luncheon (for which I brought in homemade spinach pies). I asked one of our admin assistants if she’d mind making a plate for me since I’ll be at my desk conducting the meeting (our board members all call in). She said to just send an email as to what I’d like but she was a little short with me and I want to know if I’m the asshole for asking, because I feel bad about it. I did say thank you, and will say thank you again but I feel like I’m putting her out a little. ",

He’s a very good family friend, practically considered to be family honestly! Well something happened at the office that made me uneasy.\n\nAfter his appointment, he gets a text on his phone saying nothing but “hey”\n\nHe replies and asks who is this?\n\nIt turns out it was the nurse who took his blood and thought he was cute. They start texted and she even sends him selfies... not explicit ones. But definitely suggesting that she wanted to get with him.\n\nThis is so illegal it’s not even funny. She got his number from his medical record because she thought he was cute? He trusted me and told me everything and showed me the texts.\n\nBecause she was a single mother, my friend and I made a deal. The deal was he tells her that she needs to never do that again and he’ll just drop it. \n\nA week goes by and I ask him, “...did you tell her?”\n\nHe didn’t tell her. \n\nSo I told the people in charge of the office and she was fired within 30 minutes. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? Can’t the office be liable for things like this? Thankfully it was my very good friend she did this to and not just an average patient!!! Does this make me an asshole?",

I told the professor it was appropriate because when we used to live together, she had a Republican flag up on her wall and I had a Democrat flag up on mine.  I felt as though that anecdote was relevant and funny.  Rebecca proceeded to approach me after class and said I made her feel “humiliated and isolated” for “out”-ing her as a Republican in front of the class.\n\nFor context, we go to a very liberal school in California (I bet you could name it) and most people are Dem or at least identify as liberal.  I think that she doesn’t want to deal with the social repercussions of her political beliefs, but I also understand that I should not volunteer information about other people that they may not be comfortable with becoming public.  I feel awful about making her feel these negative emotions.  However, she is also a political science major and just attending the university we go to begets political conversation, and she’s not secretive about her conservative ideals.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Context: We were friend in high school, we were on the volleyball team and I'd occasionally play basketball/go to Sonic with him for a few years after. I've been aware of his autism since we met in elementary school but we had similar interests and I have an autistic brother myself, so I could handle being around him well. He did have a bad temper growing up and holds grudges easily. I kept reminding him in the years after high school that high school was over now and we have no reason to even think about people we went to high school with again. We're now in our mid-20s and our friend group has drifted apart anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI moved to Europe for a year in 2017 and that's when I first noticed him making posts against people from his past. As I hadn't spoken to him in a while I didn't feel a need to respond to them. However, starting in 2018 he started referencing me and my friends by name. He started to say things like \"They're lucky I don't punch them if I see them\" and things along those lines. He's posted them every few days for about a year now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, this week he said \"I hate people from my past, never trust a person named u/bruins125 .\" Seeing this I felt the need to call him out. I sent him a message saying that I've been following his messages and that if he needs to talk I'm here and would be willing to meet up again but if he says anymore threatening messages I'm contacting the police. I ended with saying \"Ball'sin your court, hope you're doing well man.\" He never responded to my DM, but instead 2 days later he put on his story \"If the balls in my court I'm gonna strike you on the head with it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother former classmate I was also friends with at one point stabbed two people in the public library of our home town, one of them fatally. This classmate had been going insane for years before, started off by admiring the Virginia Tech shooter and harassing classmates online (myself included). He also said threatening things to me in the past and I feel like he was looking for me/other former classmates before he did it (the person he fatally stabbed was a year younger than us). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still feel guilty about the attack, as he said threatening/definitely illegal shit to me when he was starting to go crazy and I feel like if I said something the murder wouldn't have happened. I'm now getting deja vu, except now I'm worried this other guy is going to attack me. Some of my friends agree and want to contact the police as well, but others think he's harmless and say he's only saying those things because he's unemployed and lonely. I want to believe the latter, but at the same time I'm worried for both my own and some of my old friend's safety. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA? Thanks in advance!",

Keep in mind that I have not seen him since January. (It's now March so 3 ish months I haven't seen him.) So we are talking and everything is good when a of a sudden he asks, \"Hey can we actually leave on Saturday around 4pm?\" My smile turns into a frown. \"Why?\" I ask. He avoids the questions with \"just cause.\" Now I'm getting really upset because the only time where we would have time together is going to be cut short. I keep asking why and he says \"Because my friends are leaving on Saturday and I want to say goodbye.\"\n\nNow, im super upset at this point. Reason 1) he's been spending time all this week with his friends till 1-2 am in the morning. Reason 2) he's cutting our time in half just to go say good bye when he can say it before he leaves to see me. Reason 3) I haven't seen him in so long that I yearn for someone to hold and when I get the chance, it'll only be for a night and half a day considering we would be waking up late.\n\nHe calls me selfish, but am I the asshole for getting upset that he's cutting our time in half when I haven't seen him in so long?

Sometimes it gets really bad. Not that often. I estimate once every month. Sometimes more and sometimes less. \n\nI have a boyfriend (22M), we’ve been together for 6 months now, so not very long.  Before we got together I was honest about all my problems and that I will be annoying sometimes. And that I will need help and support. I gave him time to think about all that and he chose to be with me.  \n\nWhen I’m sad I can usually deal with it on my own. But sometimes it gets really bad. (When I really believe everything is lost and there is no hope and I should just.. end it). In those moments I really believe those things. I can’t see a way out. I panic, I cry, I think about doing it.\n\nI don’t think I will ever do it honestly.\n\nTonight is a bad night. I want his support. Being with him helps. \n\nBut he’s going out drinking with his friends. To a party he said he didn’t even want to go to at all. I asked him and explained it but he’s not coming over. He said that he promised he’d be there.\n\nI feel like if he would explain the situation to that person he promised they would understand he can’t be there one night.\n\nI understand it isn’t fair or fun for him either. Being with someone who is sick like this. It is hard but all the good moments are worth it. I am not sad 24/7.\n\nI’m not close with anyone else about my depression. I have friends but not close enough. I am to my psych ofc.\n\n\nI’m not sure if I am right about all this. AITA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Background: I'm 28f, hubby's 28m, 2 daughters (3&amp;1) and a third on the way. \n\nI don't even know where to start. Obligatory 'this is long and rambly' apology.\n\nGrowing up, I thought I had a pretty good childhood. It's only since I met hubby that I've started to come out of the fog. Still struggling with it, because now I can't tell if some of the shit that happened was wrong, or if I'm being an ungrateful brat.\n\nMum &amp; Dad were that couple that never wanted kids (Dad had a pretty dramatic childhood, Mums a textbook enabler) but as long as I was able to pull myself together and act like an adult, I was pretty alright in their book. \n\nAfter some pretty bad bullying, I ended up begging to leave school part way through year 11, which they allowed, as long as I either studied or got a job. So I did both. Worked full time hours at McDonalds and studied at TAFE (Australian version of community college I think?). Always worked 1 or 2 jobs from there until they moved us to where we currently live when I was 17, and they bought a Resort. I started working there on Front Desk, and I'm still there now. I like it, it is pretty cruisy, and allows me to spend time with my girls while they're young.\n\nHubby's a mechanic by trade, and currently working for my Dad (not using his trade). Dad got sick for a while and was struggling to look after the business on his own, and hubby was looking at leaving his last job, so they figured hey, two birds one stone. He now wants to leave to take on another apprenticeship, related to his first one but a slightly more specific field.\n\nTo try and cut a 28 year story short, there's been a lot of decisions that were made when I was a sweet summer child and fully believed my parents were geniuses and would never do anything to harm me.\n\nE.g:\n- Bought a car worth roughly $4,000 off them for $10,000, since it was the one they lent me and I was scared to be without a car where we live (I trusted it was worth that money without checking, my fuck up)\n- Paid for said car with a loan from them for the full amount, which was taken off one of their credit cards and I paid that back, with the interest included\n- Haven't been paid superannuation since I started here, because they reassured me that I'd get a payout when they sold the business and they'd look after me (needless to say, it's looking unlikely)\n- Only just got my own contents insurance because they assured me my whole life it wasn't worth the money and was a con\n- We bought the apartment we live in off them without a deposit, effectively gifting us $50,000. Amazing, yes. But that money was apparently owed to me through the way their tax is organised, and it definitely, 100% wasn't a favour. Until we moved in. And it's been thrown in my face ever since.\n- Told my husband today that he shouldn't leave working with Dad to get this second trade because 'trades aren't worth anything' and 'his pay was going up next week anyway'. (Was never about the money, we're actually taking a pay cut to do it)\n\nObviously, there's been a lot more, but this is a bit of a snapshot. \n\nLong story short, I trusted them implicitly for so long, and now I'm watching Dad literally drink money down the drain and Mum not be able to say anything. I feel like I want to cut all lines of dependance to what I see as a sinking ship, to try and protect my family and girls. But my God do I feel guilty. So....AITA?",

      "description": "This one is kind of a doozy so strap in.\n\nBackstory, my family are kind of irresponsible with money imo, my sister is aged 30 with tons of credit debt and my parents have large debt, some of it their fault and some not. I have some intense medical issues that have cost lots of money over my life, but luckily I seem to be towards the end of needing expensive treatment, and I also have a trust created by my grandparents to help with my medical situation (in their will they split their money 4 ways, 1 each to my sister and I and 2 to my father.) Because the money that I spend on food/entertainment and most of all medical costs (over 40k last year) is in a trust that my parents are the trustees of I do not have direct access to the accounts to see how much money is there at any given time, and here lies the problem.\n\nRemember how I said my sister has debt? She needs to ask my parents for assistance a lot to pay bills or if an emergency comes up, even though she got the same amount of money as me she still ran through it in under a year while going on 3 vacations etc. Recently (past few months) ive found out that my mother had been taking money from my trust to help my sister out without talking to me, this upset me and I began to distance myself, which upset my mom and she started saying stuff like \"I've done so much for you and I mess up one time and its the end of the world.\" \n\nI get yelled at, or at the very least have people aggressively raising their voices at me, at least a few times a week specifically around me not being super friendly to them. I have never really felt at home with my family because of differences of opinion but to be openly told that the way I feel is wrong and that I should \"think of how other people feel too\" is just too much.\n\nI recently have been having much more issues with suicidal ideation and when we had a \"family meeting\" to discuss household affairs and I said that I would like people to be more quiet around my room because loud noises cause me physical pain(I have tinnitus) and that having no place to be comfortable was stressing me out a lot, my sister's response was \"so because you cut yourself your feelings are more important than mine?\"\n\n\n\nThe truth is whether I'm the asshole or not I cant be comfortable around my family when I know there is a clear favorite (my sister) and when they have violated my trust so many times, I just feel they dont respect me as a person, not from their words but their actions. Can you guys just tell me if my mother is correct and I am the problem?\n\n\nTLDR: Parents take money from me to help my sister, tell me im being disrespectful for being upset at them for taking said money, sister clearly does not care about my well being if it goes against her preferences, am I the asshole for resenting my family?",

      "description": "So I had a friend (a really good friend at the time) for 10-15 years and he was in a relationship. We had a large group of friends that hung out \n\nIn this group of friends, I started to see that he was hitting on other girls and I confronted him about it because he had a girlfriend. He said he was “sharpening his fang” incase he ever broke up with his girlfriend, and his girlfriend was accepting of it.\n\nIn the end I realized he was harrassing our girl friends groping them and even sending dick pics and I thought “wait what? This is not normal”. So I confronted him. Because all the girls wouldn’t confront him personally but would send me screenshots of his behaviour.\n\nOnly thing that happened was we got into a shouting match, he was insinuating that I was putting women on a pedestal (like r/niceguy behavior) but I just thought this was abnormal behaviour and I belirve in girls and guys just being friends in a group\n\nHe ended up sending our text conversations to everyone (excluding key parts of course) but it became very dramatic. I wanted to send all the screenshots of what girls were saying about him (how he was sending them dick pics and saying he was on break with his gf) with their screenshots as proof but all my friends said I was making a big deal out of this\n\nI still think its wrong, but maybe Im the asshole? I never talked to his girlfriend about it but they broke up later on, I ruined all my friendships in this group because I called them all cowards for not doing anything about it. I called the girls cowards for not standing up to him more affirmingly to let him know that it was not acceptable if thats how they felt\n\nI’ve been told many times “thats not how you should end a 10-15 year friendship though” but I could really care less about that or him. I care that I was the only person that viewed this as a problem, maybe Im the odd one and an asshole? Im not a r/niceguy for just wanting people to behave civil, right?",

      "title": "AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend at her birthday party",
      "description": "\nUsing a throwaway and changing some details because she is a redditor. In the title I say girlfriend but we never had the conversations that defined what our relationship was. I had been seeing this girl for about 3 months, the last month and a half we have been spending almost every day together, she would stay at my house or I would stay at her house 3-4 days a week, so I had just assumed that we were exclusive and that the conversation defining our relationship was soon to come.\n\tHer birthday was a week ago and she was having a birthday party that weekend to celebrate it. She asked me to come over and help make some food for the party, so I arrived at her house a few hours before the party had started. I had just assumed I would be spending the night over there since we hadn’t seen that much of each other (besides on her birthday we went out to dinner and had a great time) that week because of the holidays, so I brought a bag with a change of clothes and a toothbrush, ect.  So I helped her set up for the party and her friends and co-workers start to arrive. This was my first time meeting a lot of her friends and the night was going really good. It was a small party maybe 10-15 people, her friends all seemed really cool. The whole night she had been giving me a lot of attention (sitting on my lap, holding my hand, taking me aside to kiss) until her co-worker “bob” showed up. As soon as he walked in the door she got really excited ran over to him and gave him a big hug. After this point she began to completely ignore me and was pretty much hanging off of “bob”. She had introduced me to all her friends before bob had arrived but after he arrived she was just all over him.\n\tI try not to get jealous, but watching this person who I care about flirting with someone else can really get to you. after about an hour of her ignoring me and flirting with this other guy I was starting to get angry, so I stepped outside to have a smoke. From the front porch you can see into the living room and I watched her and bob go over to the couch and she sat in his lap and began to kiss him. At this point I was pretty drunk and very angry, so I called an uber went inside to grab my back pack and as I was at the front door she came over to me and asked were I was going and I yelled at her “I’M FUCKING DONE WITH YOU, GO BACK TO  BOB!” and went home.\n\tThat night I received a bunch of calls and texts from her calling me an asshole and that I ruined her birthday party, I didn’t respond to her. The next morning I called her and told her I was going to come over and get my car if she wanted to talk. When I got there we talked and she said that she didn’t feel like she did anything wrong because we had never talked about being exclusive and that I was overreacting. I pretty much told her that I guess it was my mistake for assuming we were exclusive but what she did was still fucked up and that we are still over. This past week I have been receiving messages from her and her roommate calling me a piece of shit for ruining her birthday party, and that I am over reacting. Maybe I shouldn’t have yelled at her in front of people but I feel that making out with someone in front of the person you are dating is an asshole move.\n\nTD;DR: girl I was dating made out with her co-worker at her birthday party so I broke up with her in front of her friends.\n",

      "description": "I (31F) live with my boyfriend (31M) and his best friend (30M). His bestie, let's say John, who I held in high esteem and also considered a good friend, has brought home several prostitutes from Tinder while I am at the apartment over the past two months. Go-go boots, mini dresses, tons of makeup- John brings them straight to his room, and has even tried sneaking one around the back deck. John has also been dating a local woman (25F) on and off over this time, who I have hosted at my dinner parties, on Thanksgiving, and have befriended while she is often over. We live in a developing country, where sex tourism is thriving, and many expats find hooking up or dating local women much easier. He is a staunch libertarian, believing that he can choose to do what he wants within his moral framework, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone/trespass on anyone. We had a respectful chat, and he apologized for me for making me uncomfortable in my own apartment. Now that I have been exposed to his actions, I still feel uncomfortable \"keeping his secrets\" from his girlfriend. He argues that it's not a secret, it's simply his private life during their 'break ups', comparing it the privacy of one's bank account. He also told me that his girlfriend would freak out if she even knew he had the Tinder app on his phone, which he admitted he keeps hidden. I feel guilty that I am an unwilling player in his game. Am I the asshole for wanting to move out? I know that will put my boyfriend in an awkward decision to choose between his GF and BFF. Am I the asshole for wanting to tell his girlfriend? Moral obligations aside, I just feel anxiety \"faking\" it in front of her, knowing there is something her boyfriend has done that would hurt her. He says he always does what's best for him and I should do what's best for me. I'd love to hear from libertarians on the issue of prostitution, especially of escorts that come from developing countries or impoverished backgrounds.",

(If he was a real guy, but who knows.). Anyway, I look exactly like a person with this heritage is expected to look: really curly hair and a huge nose. By huge, I mean HUGE. It’s enormous for my face and it has a big bump in the middle. I’ve been made fun of mercilessly for it ever since middle school. No guy has ever wanted to be more than friends with me because of my nose. In 10th grade I heard a guy I had a huge crush on talking to his friends about how big and ugly it is and it honestly scarred me for life. \n\nI’m graduating high school this year and my parents have offered to get me really special. I think they were expecting for me to ask for a trip. Instead, I asked for a nose job.\n\nThey’re both really upset. They’ve been telling me this means I’m rejecting my Jewish heritage and that I shouldn’t want to change because that’s just giving in to the bullies. The Jewish heritage thing is big for them. We live in the South and we’re the only Jews around for miles. They’ve told me off a lot for trying to act like my goy friends to fit in. But honestly my heritage has brought nothing but trouble, I’m tired of people feeling my hair for horns and the anti-Semitic remarks have increased a lot since the 2016 election. \n\nI don’t want to denounce being a Jew and I consider myself a Jew both culturally and religiously. I just want to have a chance in college. I want to be able to go about my business without people making fun of me. I want to be able to date guys like a normal person. \n\nMy parents are still really upset. My mom is giving me the cold shoulder. I feel like the asshole.\n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "My roommate (29F) and I (30M) have been living together for quite some time, about two years. She is generally quite nice to be around albeit a bit messy (usually leaves a messy kitchen), but lately things have taken a bad turn. While we have never taken to discussing in full what she does for work, I believe her to be a sex worker. She uses very careful dialogue to describe her employment to random people but anyone with half a brain can tell she is an escort/prostitute. \n\nVery recently she met a guy she really hit it off with and things have been going very well for them. Which I am happy for, I want her to have love and a nice life! However, because of the relationship she no longer wants to work, since it would be disloyal to her relationship. No work means no money, so she has been late on all her bills with excuses like \"she will get a job soon.\"\n\nHere's the deal. I get it. You were a sex worker and you found love and now you're on hard times. Fine. I can hang with that, hell I can even help you skirt the bills a bit while you get it sorted out. My problem is that at every turn when she isn't with her boyfriend she is doing coke and getting drunk constantly. That doesn't look like she is trying to find a job. That doesn't look like she's doing anything. That, I have a problem with.\n\nI work 40 hours a week and I clean the house. It sucks coming home to a giant mess in the kitchen while she's just been doing blow all day while I'm the one paying all the bills. Just doesn't add up. I want to kick her out, but I feel like if I do that she's just going to roll into her boyfriend's lap and he seems like a really nice guy with his shit together. He even has a kid! I don't want to be responsible for all that energy just getting dumped on him. So what's the verdict here reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "My fiancé (M43) and I (F21) have been together for two years. Lots of people can’t get past the age part, but I would ask that you ignore that for now—I just added it for a little extra context. I am an incredibly helpful and kind stepmom type of person to his 13 year old daughter (but I’m not quite viewed as the stepmom, it’s a funny in between). I take her and her friends to and from school, to dance every day, help with homework, make them food, do all the grocery shopping , etc. I bust my ass every day to be the best family member/stepmom thing possible. \n\nSo this week, I have had an insanely busy schedule between my full time school, teaching piano, helping with his daughter, cleaning the house, and still trying to take care of myself. I am worn thin to say the least. Every weekend, his daughter and all her friends (which is always a lot, she’s pretty popular) come over and trash the house, and no one is responsible for cleaning up besides me. We have tried to work some sort of cleaning/chore list out, but so far it has been very unsuccessful. Because the house gets trashed every weekend, weekends are not exactly relaxing for me—in fact, they’re quite the opposite. Having his daughter and her friends at the house causes me insane anxiety, and I always feel like I have to be trapped in my room because it’s so uncomfortable for me to be around the kids (because I’m pretty close to them in age). Yesterday I spent the entire day doing homework, driving carpool, cleaning, working, that I didn’t get to work out (which is really important to me). Meanwhile, my fiancé is watching movies and played 2 hours of tennis. \n\nI am so worn thin that this weekend I needed some peace to myself. My fiancé is on a road trip with his brother and I am to stay home to rest. His daughter thinks we are both on the trip though, and because the house is empty, she is not allowed to have people over or be over here at all. \n\nFast forward to me right now hiding in the master bathroom trying to make an escape while 15 teenagers are blasting music in our living room. She has obviously broken the rules about not being over here, and doesn’t know I’m here. I am so so bummed and I’m crying because I’m so exhausted and just wanted to have some peace to myself.  \n\nSo would I be the asshole for calling my fiancé to have his daughter leave?\n\nTL;DR: Would I be the asshole for secretly asking my fiancé to arrange for his daughter and her friends to leave our house?",

      "description": "So last week I met this really cool girl in a class I transferred into. We texted back and forth over the week but since we were both busy we didn't get a chance to go out. We sort of set up an informal plan to grab dinner after our lab last night. \n\nI suggested we go to Outback since I really enjoy it, its somewhat affordable and it was a quick drive from the shuttle parking lot. She said she would rather eat glass than eat at Outback. I asked her where she wanted to go so she suggested like an overly expensive, farm to table restaurant that was almost an hour drive away. It was already going on 8 and I was starving but it also meant that I wouldn't be at home until at least 11 with all the driving and I had an 8AM class this morning. I agreed to go but it was clear that even me suggesting Outback had killed whatever spark had been there. \n\nWe said our goodbyes and she sent me a text while I was on my home that said \"thanks for a miserable time, lets never speak again.k.thx.bi.\" I was literally dumbfounded because the girl I was texting with last week didn't even seem to have such stupidity in her vocabulary. \n\nAm I the asshole here? Maybe I'm not hip or whatever, but am I an asshole?",

I am currently looking for a job in the area to get to know people, but have yet to really find anything. I am trying to put myself out there, but it is becoming very difficult to make any friendships here.\n\nSo I decided to turn to tinder. I am a straight male, and have had some matches with girls in the area, but nothing has really worked either. So I turned my preferences to both male and female, because I tend to get alot more matches with guys than girls. In my bio I do say I am not gay and just looking for friends to hang out and drink with. It has worked much better, but is it an asshole move to use a dating app to find friends?",

      "description": "I’m on mobile and I’ve been really debating on how to ever ask this.\n\nI’m adopted, I was adopted a few months after birth. My mom had a friend who was going to abort the baby unless my mom wanted it. So I came into the picture. It was just me and my mom for a very long time. Everything was great. Uncles, cousins, aunts, my grandma.. everyone would visit us. Our house was just the one to gather at.\n\nAt some point I asked for a sister. This is my biggest regret. Eventually my mom began fostering children. Most of them were rather troubled and came from bad homes. I didn’t mind this but slowly all attention left me. Of course as a child this hurt me. I never complained though, I understood these kids needed help. I said nothing.\n\nA couple kids later my mom moved in a girlfriend (Wes). Wes was awful, jealous of all of us in the house. She complained constantly about the kids, got into screaming fights with my mom. I hated it. Not long after she became physical with me and would hit me and such when my mom wasn’t around. I never mentioned it to my mom because ever since she began bringing kids into the house she was only ever stressed. I thought Wes made her happy. Then during an argument Wes showed up at my moms job and outed her. She had to quit because of the treatment she received from her coworkers regardless of working there for 8 years at this point.\n\nWhen I was about 13, roughly two years after Wes left I told my mom that she beat me. My mom got upset and didn’t believe me. I don’t think to this day she does.\n\nFast forward. I’m now 18. I have four other siblings and she doesn’t know how to raise them. She has raised three entitled children and never disciplines them. Technically I had to raise them for the most part of my teenage years. I care for two of them but I don’t see them as siblings. The other two I couldn’t care less about. I hate them. They’re practically leeches on my family. My mom knows hardly nothing about me anymore because I stay in my room to avoid the *constant* screaming and cursing that ensues. My mom used to never scream. I wasn’t a problem child when I was young but I did struggle for a couple years as a teenager. I don’t feel like her child when her favorite is present. He’s eight and acts like he’s three. He talks like a baby when he wants to be spoiled and throws tantrums. The other is violent. He tells my mom no and has said he wants to kill her. He’s seven. He physically lashes out at the others if he gets mad while playing. I resent them. My mom is a great woman, she’s not abusive, she tries... but I think she bit off too much than she can chew. Family never wants to be around anymore and they’ve ruined everything. I can’t find a drop of care for the worst two and I’m almost indifferent with the other two. I know I shouldn’t hate them and if I wanted to mend things bad enough not to give up but I’m so so tired. AITA?",

      "description": "This happened a little while ago, but I feel bad about it, and I want to know if I'm in the wrong.\n\nBackground:\n- I am a music producer, I make electronic music, so I feel I know a decent amount of producing, although not the same genre.\n- This kid goes to the same school, and is pretty popular, most people know him (I'll call him John).\n- He makes rap beats, which I don't know as much about\n\nSo a lot of people follow him and like his beats, including one of my friends, who is, apparently, a fan. My friend pulls up John's beats quite a bit while we are waiting before school, and he plays them off his phone and shows me. I usually tell him that John's beats are good, but I don't like the genre: big genre difference in what we produce. \n\nOne day I was taking with my friend, and I told him that John's beats all sounded the same to me, because that is what I honestly thought. This is most likely because my friend plays John's beats off his phone, which doesn't give the best quality playback. (I listened to them later and they weren't as similar as I thought, although still pretty similar imo.) \n\nAt this time, my friend, the fan, says \"You want to tell that to his face?\" and jokingly I said sure, because I didn't know John was walking up to us. My friend says \"Ok, let's tell him\" which I then started saying \"nuh nuh nuh nuh no,\" but my friend walked over to John and told him that I thought all his beats sounded the same. Since this is true, I wasn't going to deny it and I said \"yeah, they sound similar to me.\"\n\nLater, John posted on his Instagram which said \"Being told all your beats sound the same is the worst fucking criticism you can get.\" Now I heavily disagree as a fellow producer, there's much worse things you can be told, but my friend showed me this and I felt bad (and still do), because it was never my intention to hurt John or attack his beats.\n\nAITA?",

Not his girlfriend he told me, just a friend and that they'd had to take an introductory course when they started and then just stuck with it. \n\nSo I'd continue seeing him around, said hi, talked now and then, helped each other out when he or I needed someone to spot, and then we'd also hang out outside the gym sometimes and became friends. \n\nI also got to know the girl and while she is very cute I found that our personalities didn't seem to match at all so I never asked her out or anything. \n\nStill friends with the guy now and we see each other somewhat regularly.

      "description": "TL:DR I went into roommate's room behind their back and found that the condition of their room is likely causing a busted a/c unit, along with spiders and roaches in the apartment.\n\n*Important pre-context:* roommate isn't just some random person. They've been one of my closest friends for about 15 years and they recently moved in with me because they were having some financial trouble (by *trouble* I mean reckless spending and no personal budgeting to the point where they couldn't handle their rent on their own).\n\n*Also important to note:* while we're generally comfortable acknowledging each other's personal space at this point, I totally get that it's not typically okay to go into somebody's room without asking first. They've told me since they've moved in that if I needed anything for the common areas that they haven't yet unpacked or we initially didn't think we'd have room for, I was welcome to go into their room, and 'rummage' through their boxes to get it. I still feel like a shitty person for going in though, so I'm having trouble deciding how to feel about and approach the following situation.\n\nBefore they moved in, I was already aware that their cleanliness isn't all that great. So I made a point to make sure we had an understanding that I don't care what they do behind closed doors in their room and bathroom, as long as they respect the common areas and to keep in mind that my apartment has been known to host spiders with a cockroach or two (gross, I know), especially during warmer weather. Because of this I've always been super anal about making sure my place is clean, as in no food or dirty dishes lying around, no clothes on the floors, nothing that could potentially make these asshole critters think I'm running a buggy-brothel. Basically I told them, obviously it's your room, your bathroom, do what you want, but be mindful about the basics.\n\nIt's been about three months now. Their door is always closed and we're on completley opposite sleep and work schedules, so aside from the weekends, it's rare that we even cross paths. Noticed a week ago that the central air didn't seem to be cooling. I had this problem last summer, so I told my friend that if it got too warm or stuffy, just open their window and let me know that way I'm not trying to force the air unit to overwork with windows open. They insisted they were fine, but okay. Air seemed to be okay for a few days until it this week, I noticed it again. Except this time the register was reading under 60 even though my bedroom and the living room felt like a sauna. Asked them if they had the window open, and if they noticed the warmth at all. They said no, they were fine. Figured I'd just put in a maintenance ticket tomorrow morning and have them look at. Brushed it off, turned the unit off and opened all the windows knowing I went through this with them last year.\n\n*continued in comments due to length*",

      "title": "AITA for telling my friend she should get tested for STDs?",
      "description": "  \n\nLast semester my close friend and now roommate started a casual sex/FWB sort of situation with a guy in her class. It was on and off because this guy was a major dick who constantly tried to convince her she had feelings for him, called her stupid and made fun of her body. She would get upset at him and block him, but then he would find ways to talk to her and say he just wanted to be friends, only for them to fuck again and him to start being a dick to her again. He heavily implies that he has feelings for her all the time. Also at the beginning, he asked her to get on the pill so they could have at it without condoms (she refused, by the way, but this is relevant.)\n\nShe makes a new friend and the friend is complaining that there’s a guy she’s been wanting to date but he keeps saying “I want to commit, but I don’t know that I’m in a place for it. Just give me a few months.” He’s been doing this for over a year, and she’s turned down some amazing guys as a result. Eventually, the two realize they’ve been complaining about the same guy. They also realize he regularly fucked them right after the other. \n\nThey go to confront him, he gaslights them, says stuff like “I fucked her to make sure I really liked you” and is just generally a terrible person—no shock. I wait outside for them for support, and to make sure they were safe and drive them back to the apartments. On the way back they’re making a bunch of realizations, like “Oh my god, that’s why he was in such a rush to get me out of his apartment last weekend,” “That explains the condom I found one time!” etc. \n\nRecalling these incidents, my friend goes, “God, he could have half a dozen girls on rotation and none of them might even know…” and the other girl goes, “He wouldn’t be above that!” As my friend and I are going into our apartment after saying goodbye, I tell my friend, “Maybe you should get an STD panel done, just in case.” Allow me to reiterate that she and I are very open about our sex lives. My friend simply goes, “Oh yeah, good point. I’ll make an appointment.” The other girl overhears me saying this and gets furious:\n\n“Are you implying that I have STDs? That jackass stole my virginity!”\n\nI apologize profusely to her, explaining that I didn’t think she had any STDs, rather that there’s no way of knowing how many girls were involved, and that given his desire not to use condoms, he might have something. She gets even more mad, calling me insensitive for suggesting that she was further duped and for bringing up such a sore topic so soon. I apologize again since it is, after all, a very fresh wound and I understand why she’d be upset.\n\nShe and my friend haven’t talked since, and I feel like I am partially to blame. AITA?",

      "description": "If you've driven on a college campus then you know parking garages are cut throat. In a full garage, a parked car directly in  front of me turned on their reverse lights about to free up their spot. At the same time, a car searching for a spot \\~1.5 car lengths ahead of me put their car in reverse and backed up to the spot (no reverse parking allowed on Campus, this car would have to be where I was in order to legally park). She then waved me to go around her so she could have her car where I was in order to park in this spot. I just laughed at her, while we maintained eye contact through her side mirror. She is now screaming (not sure what, my windows were up) and flipping me off. She then backs as close to my car as she possibly can (thus blocking in the neutral third party car just trying to get out of their spot). And she stares at me, waiting for me to leave. I just smiled and shrugged (I know this can be particularly frustrating when you're mad at someone and they just smile at you). She gave up after about 30 seconds and drove away, alleviating the parked car and giving me the spot.  This is the point where I wondered if I technically should give her the spot? I mean I was pretty certain that one isn't entitled to a spot behind them but her conviction really seemed convincing. However, sh decided to reverse her car again, parking it perpendicular to my recently parked car and rolled her window down. And I quote: \"You are a bad person. You are a piece of shit for this.\" I just smiled and laughed again \"I'm a bad person because you didn't get your parking spot? I guess it's so, I'm evil.\" She got peppered up by this also, raising her voice \"Do you know what karma is? You're cursed with bad karma for being an asshole. Fuck you.\"  I had to get one last question in; \"Why would you think it is okay for you to reverse into a spot?\" \n\n\"BECAUSE I SAW IT FIRST YOU FUCKING IDIOT\" she screamed as she sped away. \n\nI started to insult her, but before I could get the first syllables out she was gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here?

      "description": "Early on in our relationship my GF and I discovered sex was quite painful for her. She said she had only 1 previous partner so she was unsure whether it was from being her first time at the time but we quickly confirmed this was not the case.  \n\n\nWe were still intimate and things led to sex here and there but less and less so from either her not wanting to hurt or me not wanting to hurt her. We looked into our options medically and psychologically. Both of us had seen a documentary on Vaginismus some time back and believed it may have been that. We looked into treatments, tried dilators, as well as numbing agents, switched condoms in case of latex allergies and even looked into extended or alternate methods of foreplay.  \n\n\nAfter a while my GF stopped trying. She stopped the treatments we were trying and discontinued looking into anything else. The intimacy fell off somewhat but we were still affectionate, sex stopped entirely. This continued for a few years with her avoiding the issue until one day a friend in an open relation propositioned me.  \n\n\nI had reassured my GF that I loved her and had no intention of leaving her due to her medical condition on many occasions, that being said I thoroughly enjoyed sex, especially with her. So I brought it up. I explained to my GF that I had been propositioned and though I would prefer having sex with her, seeing as that was not a viable option was the only reason I would seriously consider having sex with someone else. After a couple weeks we had agreed to give me a hall pass of sorts, I had gotten the friend to get tested for STDs to take that worry out of the equation after which we arranged our get together.  \n\n\nLong story short, the sex didn't happen. I learned some things that made me call it off. Over the next two weeks my GF became more distant then broke up with me. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings I think people might ask about:  \nMy GF and I were mildly size incompatible. I am of above average girth and she was below average size. (lil humblebrag)  \nShe was unable/unwilling to fit me in her mouth and her handjobs were terrible. So, anything I did was not reciprocated.  \nShe was adamantly against butt stuff, so we did not try it.  \nThe relationship lasted 6 years. We confirmed that sex was painful for her all the time at 3 months.  \nShe stopped being willing to try treatments at 2 years. I was celibate for the remainder of the relationship.  \nWe (us+doctors) figured the problem was either Viginismus or Vulvar Vestibulitis but were unable to confirm either.  \nShe did have some signs of possibly having been sexually abused but I figured she would share if she felt comfortable and wanted to so I didn't ask.  \n",

      "description": "So two of my friends are in a conflict for the past 3 months by now. We are doing our masters together and we know each other for almost 2 years by now. Both of them are part of my closest friends, while he is part of a (male) buddy group of 4 (including me), she is just one of my dearest and the person I can about everything (e.g. family). Their conflict started with an argument about sustainability and to be honest I don't know too much about it for sure, since both sides have told me their part of the story and since they are quite different. I always told both of them that I want to be friends with both of them and therefore I won't pick a side in this.\n\nNow today a lot of people from my master were at our library, since everyone is working on their thesis. So that's her, me, and a couple of other friends. Starting today we have a stand at our university selling wine (we have those around the year and it changes from wine, to beer to mulled wine, depending on the season). He, being at work in another part of the city asked me if I wanted to meet up and have a wine. Where I was like \"sure thing, I am here anyways, looking forward to it\". and he told me he would be around at 7.30. After that he asked me if I know about someone else who's at the library and if they would come aswell. So at the time I didn't know who's at the library and I didn't care since I was knee-deep in several articles about crypto economics. So I told him that I don't know. Another friend of mine then messaged me because of something different and we talked about it and I asked her if she wanted to meet up and have a wine aswell. After that the group grew and grew, without me really knowing about it. And in the end it included the friend he is in a conflict with. So when he wrote me he's on his way know I told him where we are and who is with me at the moment. He just replied something like \"phew\", realizing the other friend would be there. To which I replied \";)\". Half an hour later (he should have arrived like 10 minutes after those messages) he sent me something like \"Nah, maybe some other day, I do not have the patience for that. Not coming at all is easier than the confrontation\". I didn't reply immediatelly and he sent me another message saying: \"if you had given that piece of information earlier I could at least have saved the time I spent on the way here\".\n\nI'm not sure what to reply, since they both know my stance of being friends with both of them and not even wanting to have to choose. Also I told her, that he was coming, and she was like \"sure, I don't have a problem with that, I just won't talk to him. But we are like 10 people, so I dont have to.\". So in the end I am asking you... AITA?\n\nEDIT: Spelling in the first sentence",

      "description": "Hey everyone. Throwaway for semi-obvious reasons, and as always, apologies for formatting since I'm on mobile.\n\n\nI'll try to keep this short. I'm a high school senior at a public school, and we've all been going through the college application process for the past few months. I'm in a friend group of six people, and we've all been supportive of each other throughout the months of applications and now through decision time.\n\n\nLast December, I realized that I really liked one of my friends' dream schools--a school that I had told him I wasn't originally planning on applying to because of the city it's in. I texted him asking if he was okay with me applying, and he said it was alright, so I did. We don't know who got in yet, since they don't release it till early April.\n\nToday, one of my friends told me that he is resentful of me for applying. It's a quite small school, and therefore it's unlikely that they would accept both of us, and I have somewhat higher test scores, which I think he's worried might edge him out in the college's decision between us. I feel really guilty, but I don't want to withdraw my application, since I really like the school--I'm hopefully visiting it this weekend and I'm super excited. But this has all been a recent change of opinion on my part, so I think he may believe I applied on a whim, and I see his point. He's not been very nice to me over the past few weeks, and I now know why--but he's not mentioned this at allto me since I applied.\n\nI'm really at a loss about this. I tried to keep this short, so if anyone needs more details, I can provide them.\nThanks everyone.",

      "description": "This is going to be fairly short, so I don't think I need a TLDR. I'm also fairly sure I was the asshole here, but I'd like some feedback anyway.\n\nIt was fairly late at night and I was walking back to my room. It gets pretty deserted around here real fast after dark, so there was barely anyone around. I had headphones on and was pretty much just daydreaming about my bed, so I don't notice her at all until she started waving her hand, not quite in my face but a short distance away.\n\nI'm a bit confused, so I take off my headphones and ask, \"Hey, can I help you?\"\n\nLady: \"I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable walking alone with you around. Could you please cross the road and walk on the other side?\"\n\nI totally understand her being concerned about her safety, but I was tired, hungry and  had a frustrating day, and I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way. I got pissed off and said, \"I'm not going across the road twice for you. Feel free to do it yourself if you like. I'd be delighted to walk far, far in front of you, though, so you can keep me in your sight. In fact, let me get started on that.\"\n\nI started storming off, and from behind me she calls out to me to wait. I flipped her off and put my headphones back on so I couldn't hear her anymore.\n\nI felt really guilty about it once I reached my room and the frustration wore off. I am a major feminist, and I totally understand her concerns. I guess I just had a bad day, and when she asked me I took it the wrong way.\n\nWow, on rereading this, I feel like a colossal asshole. Lady, if you're reading this, I'm really sorry. ",

      "description": "Very recently, I put in my two weeks notice with my boss after having worked at the company for 5 months. He didn’t give me the best reaction, saying I “should have told him I was thinking about grad school during my interview” and that “maybe if you had told us, we would have chosen someone else”. Well, if you would have chosen someone else, then why didn’t he ask what my short term plans were? I’m pretty sure during an interview he’s the one asking the questions, not me. Plus, I really wasn’t sure at the time whether I’d end up leaving soon or not. I was genuinely interested in the position. In my opinion, my boss should’ve been more supportive since I’m a young guy still trying to figure out what to do with my life. The company definitely has enough money to survive without me, and his response showed just how little he cares about the growth of the people beneath him. The work policy states I have the right to terminate my employment at any time, so AITA for resigning so soon?",

      "description": "This is long and rantish and im sorry. My main questions are at the bottom.\n\n\nSo every Tuesday my boyfriend goes to our friends house to watch movies. Usually they'll play games til around 7, then start a movie and at the latest be done by 10. I started going with him when I lived with my parents still so I had a curfew of 11pm. Reasonable. Then we moved in together, and started working tuesdays so i had to stop going. I was okay with it and every once in a while id have a Tuesday off where I can go watch movies. \n\nSide note: he also has game nights at our apartment 2-4 times every week that usually last past midnight. I have issues sleeping so its hard for me to fall asleep with a lot of noise and when he comes to bed eventually. \n\nSo today I was getting off at 2 and he gets picked up near me at 4, so i decided to go. I cant have my phone out at work, so I never got any of his messages which he knows. He first tected me saying movie night might be cancelled, which happens sometimes. Then he said WE were going to play games at friends house. We do this sometimes too, and try to wrap up around 10 so no one has to drive very far at night (the farthest someone lives from friemds house is 40 miles/about an hour in our area even at night)\nI texted him when I got off saying id be okay with that. \nSo we show up at friends house at 4:15, its not 12:30am and they decided to play smash for 8.5 hours. Never inviting me to play, they didnt stop for food, and they only played the same fucking game the whole time. \nThis isnt the first time its happened and hes even called it a \"date night in\" before. The closest thing weve had to a date in the last 8 months is one of these movie nights we went to see a movie in theaters. He has work every week day and has to get up at 5:30am and complains about being tired all the time. \n\n\nSo now to my questions\n\n1. Would I be an asshole if I told him he needs to stop having all these game nights past 11p?\n\n2. Would I be an asshole if I told him he both A) needs to be WAY more clear as to what \"we'll\" be doing if plans get cancelled and B) i will not be going out with him and his friends unless I know whats going to happen?",

      "description": "My bf is a 30/m and I’m a 25/f. \n\nHe doesn’t compliment me and takes little jabs at me when he can. \n\nFor example, I got a Brazilian wax last month. He never commented on how smooth or nice it felt. I even was like mmmm I like how soft my vagina is and he looks at me awkwardly and says nothing. Three weeks later he was like wow, did you shave recently because it looks stubbly like it’s growing back in? I was like what the fuck kind of weird fucking question is that? \n\nAlso, I was wearing nice lipstick for a holiday party and my lips looked freaking good and I did my makeup all nice. He doesn’t say a word about my makeup or anything but later says wow, you got some food on your lip. And when he kissed me he was like mmm... you have some dry skin on the side of your lip. \n\nI just started to wear more makeup. I was nervous about looking terrible but I like doing it and wanted to get better. Literally the next day after I start trying to do my makeup more we are watching a movie and he comments on how this girl on TV is wearing way too much makeup. He has never said that about any tv character ever. \n\nHe also said he knew my Boobs were fake cause they’re too perky (no one has ever in my life made any negative comment about my tits) and sometimes when we lie down he tried to smoosh them down to make them flatter. He also won’t touch my boobs unless I ask him to. \n\nHe also made some shitty remark at my holiday party. I dressed up all nice and my friend put his scarf on my head and my boyfriend leans over and says jokes on him, your dandruff is all over his scarf now.\n\nAlso, he has lots of trouble cumming when fucking me. He fakes orgasms at times. He initiated sex but stops often in the middle and says he can’t get off because he jacked earlier that day. He mentions trying to workout more to help him be better and have better sex. I workout often and ask him to join me and he often declines. \n\nHe regularly takes over a day to respond to my messages also. \n\nI never make him feel bad about anything. I always am positive, happy, and every time I see him I make sure to thank him for something or compliment something about him. He says he loves me because I accept him and he can be himself with me. I dunno why I never feel that way with him though. He goes to an event of mine. I thank him five times for going out of his way to be with me and tell him how much I appreciate it. \n\n**TLDR: am I the asshole and being too sensitive about my boyfriends little negative remarks and difficulty with as ?**",

      "description": "So my ex and I have been broken up for two years, we dated for three years. I broke up with her because we were in a long distance relationship for 2 months (we both had to go different colleges) and I felt extremely depressed (being in a new environment, not knowing anyone or anything, being alone) and confused about life. So I messaged her telling her I wanted a breakup, telling her my situation and she basically didn't give a shit. So after breaking up with her and even though she didn't care about me, I instantly regretted it and felt even more alone, wondering how someone could be so cruel and uncaring after I spent 3 years with them, and fell into an even deeper depression. I felt so bad I even had thoughts of self-harm. Five months later I felt horrible and I felt so alone, so I texted my ex, telling her I really missed her and that I loved her and she coldly told me to stop contacting her. I've sent her a few texts over the years but I think she blocked me and is mad at me since she hasn't responded (though the texts I've sent are very friendly). Thing is, I think things have really cooled down, my depression has gotten better, and since we haven't talked for over a year, I was wondering if I would be the asshole to try and smooth things over and possibly get the relationship back or is she the asshole for not even trying and listening?",

      "description": "Hello everyone,\n\nI wanted to ask for your opinion on the following situation:\n\nI started college this summer (in my country, you start college at around 16 y/o so that's the age of everyone including me in this story), and of course, new class, new people, some you'll like, some that you don't, whatever. But this one guy keeps annoying me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe continues to just take my stuff without my permission, and I'm not sure whether I'm the asshole for getting upset.\n\nIt happened a few times already, with him just taking away my electric eraser in art class after I told him I didn't feel comfortable to lend it to other people because I already nearly broke it once, and was afraid someone else might would, and that it was nothing personal (also he didn't really need it, our teacher does offer normal erasers, I just tend to press really hard with my pencils, and because it takes more force to erase my strokes, I often wrinkle the paper, hence I use the electric eraser). I am sure that I wasn't at fault for being mad in that situation, but then this happened:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I tend to make long summaries about topics for studying, because that's the way I learn best. They contain my notes, and everything I think is important from Word documents, handouts and books, and they take a lot of time. I share them with a friend, and she shares hers with me so I don't have to make one for every class, and I made one for our last Chemistry Exam. I didn't have much time the weekend or the days before the exam, so I wasn't sure I knew everything and minutes before the test I'm anxiously reading through this printed-out summary I made, and this guy walks up to me and asks me a question. I already know I'm not going to know the answer and interrupt him, saying that I don't know, and continue to read my summary. He then grabs the paper and yanks it out of my hands. \n\nMe: \"Uhm, what the heck?\"\n\nHe: \"I'm just looking for the answer, I need it right now\"\n\nMe: \\*getting upset bc this isn't the first time and I don't know shit for this exam\\* \"Yeah, well I need it too. And it's mine, I worked hours on this, I want to read through it now because I don't know everything either, and you didn't even ask. Give it back to me.\n\nHe: \"I just need to loo it up\"\n\nMe: \"The exam literally starts in like two minutes, we don't have the time to both look through the whole thing. I need it, you can't just take my stuff! Give it back to me now!\" \\*grabs it back\\*\n\nHe: \"Wtf chill I just wanted to look for the answer to my question\"\n\nI then ignored him and proceeded rereading everything. It wasn't like I was looking through the page that he wanted to read too, then we both could have looked at it. I wanted to finish the part I started reading then, because I couldn't remeber the stuff there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not letting him read through my notes? I kind of feel bad, I understand that he maybe was nervous too, but he wasn't polite about it, and if we had more time I would have let him borrow it to look it up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Some important background information is that I really don’t like being touched. I used to cry and scream when I was a kid and strangers tried to touch me. I’ve gotten better with it as I’ve gotten older but it still makes my skin crawl. It’s also important to know that my natural hair color is a little unusual and my hair is really long. \n\nI was at the grocery store standing in like when I feel someone tugging on my hair. I turn around and I see this lady holding on to the end of my hair in one and and her phone in the other, trying to take a picture. She drops my hair and I instinctively take a step back. \n\nThis obviously isn’t word for word but, to my best recollection, this is the conversation we had:\n\n&gt; Me: What are you doing?\nLady: Your hair is so pretty! I wanted to take a picture to show my stylist so that she can dye my hair that color. You must let me take a picture!\nMe: I’m really not comfortable with that and I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t touch me again. \nLady: You can’t have hair like that and expect people not to touch it. It’s just too pretty. Here, let me take a photo. \n\nAt this point, the lady reaches out to grab my hair again and I instinctively bat her hand away. She looks shocked for a second and then starts to get angry. \n\n&gt; Lady: How dare you hit me. I was just trying to take a photo to show my stylist. What’s wrong with you?\n\nNow everyone is staring and I’m starting to tear up so I drop my basket and walk out of the store. I told my husband what happened when I got home and, though he agreed that the lady was being rude, he thinks I escalated things by batting her hand away. He thinks I should’ve just walked away. AITA? \n",

One day later we met at the park and kissed a little bit top. Then I grap her ass and she said \"don't do it.\" and didn't do anything. In the evening we started texting and I want some nudes from her. She said that she can't do it, I was totally fine for me and I kinda felt that what we did, it was wrong. I told her I don't wanna see her for a long time and it was disgusting. She said she love me and she wanna hug me, she wanna text me, emojies and lots of bullshits. Then she told this situation whole class and now my whole classmates hate me, don't want to talk with me. I know what we did it was wrong but we did it together. And the worst part they are still talking with her and they just hate me. I really don't know why do they hate me. Am I did something wrong? AITA ?",

The are probably 30 years older. A few weeks later we turned on the sprinklers one morning after a hot period. Have never used them before. We go to the store and as leaving lady neighbor asks if we knew they were on and I said yes, we turned them on because of the past heat. She says, \"oh thank you, I was painting\" we say sorry right away, I guess the ones nearby hit her? We go to the store and our ring goes off. She has taped the county approved times to our door. Since then we do the approved time, hardly anyone in the neighborhood adheres to this.\n\nAnyways I feel like they ignored us a long time and we've finally gotten back into saying hello. Last night was the second new year's here. We live in a hoa community and fireworks are illegal in the state but definitely not enforced. Second year in a row they have set real, big fireworks off on their driveway. Our houses are maybe ten feet apart. I didn't say anything last year but this year one went crazy and ended up in our backyard. It bounced, went off and shot out everywhere really low.\n\nI got fed up and went outside. I said \"hey can you guys cut it out? That last one just went off in my backyard.\" The guy neighbor said \"happppy new year\" and I said \"seriously, it's 9pm, I have a baby sleeping, come on\" Then the lady neighbor said \"whaaaaat?\" I just said \"very neighborly\" and went inside. Now I know we will be back to ignoring each other and I'm just wondering AITA?",

      "description": "Backstory: i work in a small retail store. There are only 5 of us. Store manager, 2 assistant managers, and 2 cashiers. I am a cashier, the person in question is an assistant manager and was hired about 4 months ago by a temporary store manager while our boss was out due to surgery.\n\nThis person has caused issues in our store from the very beginning. Money mistakes, paperwork mistakes, improper stocking, etc. It has caused a lot of extra work for the rest of us. His explanation for all this is a brain surgery/brain damage issue from 4 years ago. Fair enough, although he did not disclose this when he was hired. We've all done our best to help him. He's been trained and retrained. It's just not sticking. \n\nThough he's been driving me nuts with basically still having no idea how to do his job, I've been patient and kind due to his condition. I figured he really just couldn't help it. But lately I'm beginning to wonder. For one, a lot of his mistakes really just look like he wasn't even trying/paying attention to what he was doing. I've ignored that feeling because i am definitely no expert on brain damage. I don't know what it's like for him. It's some comments he's made recently that have me straight up pissed. The other night he made several math mistakes on the paperwork. We can't leave things incorrect so i pointed them out (gently), and he responded by basically saying he didn't care, the store manager could sort it in the morning, and he didn't care if he was fired. He has made similar comments at other times, both to me and other employees. \n\nIdk, i feel like a giant asshole for judging someone who has a serious medical condition, but I'm not even entirely sure that's the problem at this point. I can no longer tell if he genuinely has trouble understanding things, or if he just has no desire to do his job. I am constantly having to either do his job, or explain his job to him, which isn't even my place because technically he is my superior (i am trained for his position, but haven't taken it on due to availability issues. On paper he is still above me though). Am i an asshole and just need to have more patience? Let me know if more info is needed. Not trying to be vague, the post just got long.\n",

      "description": "So two years ago, my parents split up suddenly.  Long story short, my father was having an affair with a woman in another country and decided to pursue that relationship and leave his 43+year marriage in the dust.\n\nThis was a traumatic on my mother, whom I pretty much took care of afterwards for months until I moved away to another city. Anyways, he pretty much packed up his stuff and left without saying goodbye to my brother or I. Everything about my childhood made sense to me in how I grew up and all of the tension in our household and it just all clicked to me. He gambled hundreds of thousands of dollars away, he always disappeared on business trips, we never went on any vacations or did anything as a family.\n\nWhen my father walked out, I didn’t hear from him for a few months. After then, the only time I heard from him was when he would email me about how he’s cutting auto insurance, health insurance, cell phone, etc. as if he was trying to get me to talk to him or something. Every time he threatened to drop something, i did what I needed to in order to get my own coverage since i didn’t want to play his game.\n\nAbout a year and a half later, he finally called me and I blew up on him.  I called him out for not being there when growing up and how I have no real memories of our family doing anything but arguing and blamed him for it. I got left with picking up the pieces of the family and rolling with it while supporting myself in the real world with no one I could fall back on.  I told him that I never wanted to speak to him again and that him being out of my life at this point is the best thing for me. I also told him that I would never treat my future family and kids the way he did and that he will never meet them.\n\nTLDR: Dad divorced my mom for his mistress and walked out on our family all the sudden. Broke my mom, broke my family, cleared up a lot of stuff in my childhood.\n\nAITA for cutting off my dad from my life? He was the one who walked away and I was the one stuck with putting what family I had left back together.\n\n",

Me and my gym teacher are less than best friends because my mom questioned why i lost my gym grade after an injury halfway through the quarter despite taking tests. During our time in the classroom we've been spending time on google slides projects on fitness. Usually the boys in my class would go to the locker room before getting dismissed by a male gym teacher and we went to the class. After 2 periods of us doing that we stopped. My Mom questioner why i had a 80 as a performance review even though gym was a pretty easy 100. My gym teacher said it was because we didn't show up to class on time. After reading the email my teacher was being very rude and said several times,\" Should I tell your mother you were here on time, should i text your mother. After she said that to me I just kind of looked at her awkwardly. She didn't stop \"Should I text your mother, answer me\" I dryly said, go ahead. She kept talking about how I was late the other days and how bad my work was and how i didn't hand in my project despite having a couple more days to finish it.

I ask her why she’s buying it and she explains that she forgot the cord in the hotel room. I get a little irritated and ask why she said she had it in her bag when she didn’t. Both my parents get very defensive and essentially overpower me from talking even though I know that if I had done the same thing, they would have made me feel bad the entire day about it. AITA?\n\nTo add context: my mom insists on carrying the bags when we’re out and about. ",

      "description": "This actually happened back in December of 2012, when I was 14 years old. I guess I’ll start off by saying Im an animal lover, and I love cats in particular. I come from a mildly poor family. I’ve never had to miss a meal or anything drastic, but “pleasure” spending was rare in my household. I am very close friends with an upper middle-class family, since I am the same age as the two sons. We were, and still are, best friends. Anyways, they made plans to go on a family vacation to Kauai, HI, and knowing my family’s tight budget, they very generously surprised my sister and I with plane tickets to join them. They payed for everything- hotel, fancy dinners, souvenirs, even private surfing lessons! It was amazing, and I was excited to see all the cats that roam the island. My sister and I were extremely grateful, and we made sure to express that profusely. At one point, we were beach-hopping, and we visited a  beach that was famous for having black sand. As we were walking towards the beach, I noticed a pair of malnourished kittens. At that point in my life, I don’t think I had ever seen an animal in that bad of shape before. Regardless, It broke my heart, so I stopped to feed them some leftover chicken from my sandwich. The rest of the family and my sister stopped for a second, and then continued to the beach while I stayed behind. I was not far at all from the actual beach, maybe 50 feet or so. I stayed with the kittens feeding them and petting them for about half an hour or so, until everyone decided to head towards the next beach. When we got in the car, the dad, who paid for everything, was very angry at me and proceeded to yell at me for not being on the beach with everyone, instead choosing to be with the kittens. He said, “I did not spend $600 for you to play with cats. You could have stayed home and it would have saved me the money.” I was completely taken aback, because it hadn’t even occurred to me that I might have been doing something wrong. Still, I apologized and everything was fine. But I still wonder- despite his angry use of wording, was he right? AITA for stopping for the kittens and not enjoying the beach with the rest of the group? After all, he was the one who paid for everything.",

When my other friends and I found out about this censorship we were upset that out friend thought he had to right to limit what we could say, and he was reluctant to give a reasoning behind his ban.\n\nWe recently learned that the ban was put in place, because it reminded the owner of a \"dark time in his life\". We have all acknowledged this fact and have agreed to monitor out usage of the word, however the owner still refuses to remove the ban. Even though we now know what the word means to the owner and have promised to be more considerate of what we message each other, we still feel that it's not the owners' right to monitor what we say, considering that the server was made for all of us to talk to one another, and some of us see this as an abuse of power.\n\nAITA in this situation or is the server owner?",

      "description": "Hey guys, this is my first reddit post and it might be a bit of a log one so just fair warning. Let’s yeet this \n\nSo I just turned the big 18 a few weeks ago and was throwing a house party to celebrate with the people who mean the most to me. Me not knowing my limits, invited over 70 people but let’s not talk about that.\n\nSo my “best friend (let’s call her Janet) has previously expressed how she disliked about 90% of the people I invited to my party and labeled them as either “bitches” or “douchebags” (when they’re honestly some of the most lovely and genuine people I’ve ever met) That ticked me off but I decided to let it go because everyone is entitled to their own opinion.\n\nJanet had said how she wasn’t gonna come to my party if a coworker of mine that I had invited was there. She made the effort to go off at me multiple times about how she never saw me hang out with my coworker and how I’ve never talked to her about it. (For context, Janet and coworker had a falling out the previous year) \n\nFirstly, I’ve known my coworker for over 4 years and I told Janet that she didn’t need to know about every single person I am friends with and I wasn’t about to justify why I invited 70 different people to my house. So Janet went on and on and I tuned it out, seeing as it was my birthday and I invited my friends.\n\nFast forward to my actual birthday and the day before the party. I was ecstatic as I was finally a big boi. My family and I were celebrating with some dominos and champagne when I got a message from Janet. The message said and I quote, “Hey, boyfriend and I are coming for the party tomorrow but not for long because of the other people invited” \n\nThat hit hard, I started crying on the spot. My family was confused out of their minds and told me I had enough champagne for one night (which was probably true) I just replied with a simple “K” and ignored her \n\nSince she had sent the message, I was hurt and angry so I started ignoring her a bit (seeing as she would only message me about her boyfriend or if she needed something) and if I would reply, they were blunt and short.\n\nAt the party, I was still quite upset but trying to put it behind me, I decided I won’t let it ruin my day. My coworker couldn’t make it and Janet was quite happy. She walked in like everything is normal and I smiled and gave her a hug and then pretty much ignored her again for the rest of the night. She left about 2 hours after she arrived and I was M A D\n\nTo think that Janet couldn’t put aside her petty bullshit with other people for one night to celebrate her so called “best friends” birthday broke my heart.\n\nA few days later, I was out with a really good friend of mine and wasn’t really looking at my phone much. As I got home, I saw I got 3 messages from Janet \n\n“How do you print photos at Kmart”\n\n“I don’t appreciate being ignored”\n\nAnd the last message being a paragraph about how I need to get my priorities right \n\nI sent her this long ass paragraph letting the last 6 months worth of bullshit off my chest. I told her how upset I was when she would constantly ditch me for her boyfriend when I dropped so much to be able to be there for her. I talked about how she bad mould all my friends and then explained how upset I was about the stuff leading up the my birthday. I did also apologise for how harsh I was right after because I was in the moment and fired up \n\nHer reply was “have a nice life xo”\n\nAITA here?! Should I have handled this differently? Am I in the wrong? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I promised myself to never be an A ever again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, today I was hanging out with my ex, he was my first bf (I was his first too). When we were younger and dating, we were 12 at that time. I used to make him give me 20 euro every week on Monday at 8:00 and if  he was late or didn't have it, I would leave him or not talk to him. He was so used to apologise to me even without a reason, because his worst nightmare was that I will leave him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a 12 year old he really used to like/love me a lot.  I used to tell him that I love him too I never loved him but I did like him a bit, he is really the most handsome human being I ever met in my entire life (he got more handsome now, he even made muscles he looks older), I used to automatically stare at him. Also I liked how fun he was and how a lot of girls liked him. It was never his fault, it was my fault, I was just a horrible human being. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a year of dating, I accused him that he likes another girl as a reason to dumb him. He really was so broken, he even used to follow me when we are done at school and swear for hours that he doesn't like her. He stopped after that and changed school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes I was that horrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, we got into contact again after all that time. when we were hanging out today everything was fine until, he said ''my heart still beats when I see/look at you, I still love you a lot. I thought I forgot about you''. I didn't know what to say so I said ''its better for you to forget me''. Then he said that we should give each other a new chance, that we were good in the past, that we are a lot older now and can have a serious relationship. Then he asked me if I like him, he said that I also used to like him a lot and that what happened was because of being young, that I shouldn't have believed others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I saw he was trying to hold his tears he looked miserable. Then that's when he started to beg me, he literally started to cry a lot,  he became silent for some minutes. that's when I realized I destroyed his life. He said that he misses me a lot, that he was me in his dreams, that he always thought of me. Then he said he just one chance for us, he even hugged my belly and kneeled and cried more. He said that she shouldn't have met me, that if he knew he will become like this that he would have never met me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't know what to say, he didn't even wait for my response, he was embarrassed, he just stood up and left without saying good bye. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not asking if was the A in the past because I clearly was but now, AITA? was it my fault he knelt down and cried? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are both 16 now btw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "*Obligatory apology for using mobile, making this post so long and not being a native speaker*\n\nSituation: \nI (24f) was friends with a girl (25) since 2010. We befriended at a time where I didn’t know I was an introvert and that it is totally okay that I am not people-y etc. (had no self-esteem because I was so awkward, had no introverted friends who‘d understand me, spend my weekends alone, you get the idea) and she lifted me up, made me feel better about myself, got me out of my shell. After some time I actually gained my self-esteem, made more friends, met the love of my life and was more outgoing and confident. I first thought she would be happy and proud that I „made it“ and finally loved the person I‘ve become - just like she seemed to be. I was very thankful and we had a very good time since then. I also met and befriended her friends, we were a wonderful group.\n\nAfter we completed school in 2013 and had to choose what to do with our lives, the contact stayed but she started acting weird. Would cancel plans we had for weeks hours, sometimes even minutes before the get-together and  often without a real reason (e.g. „I suddenly don‘t want to go to a restaurant, I have difficulties choosing what to eat.“ „My mom wants me to clean the house.“ - ?!). That went for years. It pissed us off and we stopped making plans with her (we still invited her but in 90% she would cancel it on the same day and we wouldn‘t be surprised and disappointed).\n\nWhat made me think she hates me:\nShe had a best friend since we knew each other. I know him as long as I know her and naturally we became friends, too. One day she suddenly went apeshit crazy and yelled at him and he called me after that. I was shocked as I never saw her acting this way and couldn‘t think of a reason. He then said that she asked if they could meet for a bbq and he asked, if I could join them - she began accusing him that he liked me more and said something that really hurt „Why is she always so overrated?!“. She made hints on this topic before („When you are there, nobody talks to me, I get ignored. Could you stop wanting to be the middle?“). I never had the feeling that I‘m being the „center of the conversation“ (I‘m introverted as I mentioned, I hate being in the middle and she should know that). But eventually I stopped talking to people when she was there so that she could be the center of attention. I really don‘t need peoples‘ approval. \n\nWhat made me snap:\nWe were on a festival together last year and she started acting terribly. A friend and I arrived on wednesday to get a nice camping spot (festival started on Friday). It was exhausting, but eventually we found a spot after hours of searching and discussing with other campers. We were proud and sent pictures. She started going crazy that the place was shitty, even threatened to sell her tickets if we stayed on that spot. I felt like being hit in the face. We could not move, there simply was no other space for a group of five. When the rest and her arrived she started yelling at us two in the middle of the night and acted like a total bitch. We ignored her after some time and the rest of the festival was fantastic. She never apologized but started behaving like the friend I knew, well, up to that point. \n\nThis year we went again to the festival and she started behaving the same way, being passive-aggressive while planning how to get there etc. I snapped and deleted her and the groups we‘ve been together in - I just didn‘t want her to ruin the festival again. \n\nI didn‘t answer to her calls or bother explaining anything to her - I was and still am done with her and don‘t want to see her anymore. And I‘m pretty sure she exactly knows the reasons but wants to pretend everything is fine and that we‘re still close friends after last year‘s incident. She eventually started talking shit about me but I don‘t care. Our mutual friends ended contact with her over different situations (many don’t even know about me breaking the contact) and those who know me wouldn‘t bother anyway.\n\nThere were many more occasions that lead me to the conclusion that she hates me but I don‘t want to make this post any longer - sorry for that 😅 but if there are questions I‘ll answer them.\n\nBut AITA for not explaining anything to her? Should I reach out and tell her what went wrong? Or should I continue being happy without her knowing my POV? I often dream about us talking about it, but I think she won‘t be as rational irl as she is in those dreams 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nThank you for reading this mess. And happy holidays if you celebrate them 😇\n\nTl;dr: I found out a very good friend of mine hates me and everything I do is either overrated or shit. I quit contact without explaining anything to her. I‘m sure she thinks I‘m dumb and that nobody talks to me about what she talks behind my back. ",

      "description": "I am a senior manager at my uncle's company. I am struggling with the decision to fire a junior manager who has been downright disrespectful but good at her job. Lets call the junior manager \"Cruella\".\n\nMy uncle is an asshole and that is why none of his children help in running the company- they all work outside the country away from him. My uncle controls all power in the organisation and micromanages everything.  However, he is old and has only me to leave the company to. I mention all this because I have reported the problems that Cruella causes and my uncle does not do anything because she is his favorite. I also do not have the power to fire her until few weeks from now when my uncle's retirement date comes up.\n\nI have 3 managers under me and Cruella is the only one out of them who disobeys my orders, especially if it means that she has to work for me. My uncle gave her control of a division of the company that is very new and profitable, and this has gotten to her head. She refuses to give reports that would help us maximize efficiency and profits in the division. She only gives reports when she feels like. The irony is that when she needs help and has exhausted all options, she runs to me. I have cautioned her numerous times but she never cooperates knowing that only my uncle has the final decision and power to punish her. \n\nMy uncle covers for her because he wrongly thinks that she is making the profit for the division she controls. She gets her staff working like clockwork and she works hard. However, she costs the company about 30 cents on every dollar of profit as her delayed reports deprives us from adjusting on time to certain costs. The issue here is that she did not set up the division- I and my uncle did. She also is not good with numbers as I have to correct her reports consistently.\n\nTo show you how nasty Cruella can be, she even got rude to my uncle's oldest son (my cousin). Can you imagine that she had the nerve to try to remove my uncle's son (who is a silent partner and technically her boss) from a staff meeting? Of course, my uncle covered it up and apologised to my cousin for her. That was when I decided that I would fire her when I have the power. Also, my cousin gave me his blessing to fire her after that incident as he was pissed with both my uncle and Cruella. \n\nCurrently, I am thinking of firing her and not giving her either a severance pay or her would-be last month pay.  I truly want to punish her for being insubordinate and for abusing the favour that my uncle has shown her. The funny thing is that we are in a country that has very weak labour laws. I can fire her without any problems. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I fired her without pay?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I was asked to stand up in a wedding by a casual friend/ex coworker who I've known about 10 years. We aren't overly close and I live several states away. I would say we go on average 6 months to a year without even really acknowledging each other, most years. He needed a woman to stand up on his side because his bride will have a guy on her side, so they needed to balance out the genders. She's having 12 stand up on her side, he's having 10, So he picked me. I was flattered and said yes but had NO IDEA how much this was going to cost me.   \n\n\nThey are going ALL OUT. Expensive dresses ($300+ before taxes and alterations),  I need to pay for travel and hotel while I'm in town for the wedding (\\~$800 conservatively). The bachelor party is in another state and the hotel he chose is $300 a night (\\~$1300  for 3 nights + airfare, before taxes). None of this counts all of the side charges that I have to spend (hair, makeup, shoes, undergarments, bachelor party activities or gifts.)  \n\n\nSpeaking of gifts, their registry is full of $200 bowls, a $500 duvet cover, $600 sheet sets, $200 a set china. I know that etiquette says you should spend as much on a gift as they are spending on the meal for the reception and I want to give them something nice and not be a penny pincher here but this all seems so over the top.  \n\n\nI know this is all pretty standard, but I'm feeling like an asshole for feeling like I'm being taken for everything I have right now. I'm not a rich woman, I live alone and pay my bills on my own, I have an average paying job and don't live a fancy life myself. We are casual friends and doing the math and assuming I participate in the bachelor party, I'd be in for about $3500 .... for someone else's wedding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I The Asshole? I feel like the asshole. But I just don't have an extra $3500ish. It would even be different if I could end with saying \"but I love him, he's a great friend,\" but I can't even really do that. We're casual friends. I know it's on me for saying yes initially but I had no idea they were going to go balls to the wall.",

      "description": "Kind of misleading title.? Sorry, I couldn't fit all this into one sentence.\n\nThis hasn't happened yet, but one of my best friends is planning on moving in with me in mid May and for the most part, I'm pretty eager. We briefly lived together while she was still looking for an apartment and it wasn't too bad. She's moved 3 times since last August because her roommate was flaky and ended up getting them both evicted. Anyway, living with me would finally give her a dependable place to live.\nMy only reservation about her moving in is that she's best friends with my ex girlfriend, to the degree that my ex has come up to our city just to visit her, which I always dread but try to come to terms with. I'm worried that if she moves in, my ex will stay in our apartment whenever she visits. Just that thought gives me anxiety. In fact, my ex is going to be in town this week for her Spring Break, which is why I'm here on reddit. We have plenty of friends in town who'd be willing to host when she's visiting; they've done it before for other friends. \nI thought a lot about this when my friend briefly lived with me, but since I knew it was temporary, I never communicated it with her. Sometimes I heard her on the phone with my ex and even that annoyed the hell out of me. It being late March already, I'm worried I'll be TA for giving her an ultimatum kinda close to when she is supposed move in. \n\nSo, will I be TA if I tell my friend that if she moves in, my ex can't stay with us (or even be in the apartment) when she's visiting?

      "description": "So this friday me and my friends went to this youth center thing we like, like we always do at the end of the week. We basically fuck around and play some games and just shoot the shit. This place is part of the museum/library in my city, and as such, often holds art exhibits.\n\nApparently, the new exhibit is some really left-wing political thing, with posters about \"masculinity\", \"intersectionalism\" and other stuff, which logically shouldn't be allowed there, since this youth center is municipally owned, and is considered an apolitical space, meaning that the youth centre is not allowed to endorse or promote political stances. Despite these rules, the whole place was plastered in left-wing propaganda shit, including a whole section on Karl Marx and class struggles.\n\nSo me and my friends, who run the spectrum from left wing feminists to anti-immigration rightwingers, all joined in and started making fun of the posters, reading them out loud to each other and mocking the exhibit. We were having a laugh, taking the piss out of the stupid shit on the posters, and I posted to my snap story, basically trash talking the posters. I especially singled out the Marx and class related posters, since I'm fiercely anti-communist, and actually got rather upset that they would allow this stuff here. Do it at a private business, say it online, or whatever instead.\n\nI basically went off on the posters, shittalking Marx and communism in general, and a girl I know quite well screenshotted the story, and appeared to have gotten fairly upset with me. Things are already shaky with this person, so I fired back in a private snapchat story, explaining to anyone upset that I stand by my post, and went further to say that I've never met a good or honorable communist in my life, name-dropping a person I know she's friends with, one who has also groped my best friend without her consent, and calling that person a \"commie asshole\".\n\nI deleted that post after a while, since I didn't want to actively name and shame a person, even if I honestly want to kick him in the teeth everytime I've met him, but I still stand by my post, and made it clear once again that I think supporting communism basically makes you an idiot in my eyes. She's still upset with me it appears, and she hasn't talked to me since I refused to apologize. \n\nAm I the asshole here, for taking a stance against what I perceive as communist propaganda, angering a friend in the process, and firing back by shit talking communists as people, singling out a guy she's friends with as an example?",

      "description": "Just to make it clear, im female, 17 y/o\n\nLet's start with the fact that my family never had any real problems with money. My mom works as a teacher and my dad used to work in a school as well, but doesn't have a job at the moment. \nI never really had to be economical, but I love saving money and knowing I can afford to treat myself with a nice piece of clothing or a fun gadget, as my parents won't buy me anything unless I really need it (especially when it comes to clothes and technology)\nI don't have to accualy work for the money I save, It mostly comes from my relatives (dad's side). Always when we visit they give me some and tell me to treat myself, so I consider it mine only. \nNow my parents will sometimes borrow some, when it gets tight. It's usually not a problem, as I know they'll return it eventually, but they have a really different attitude towards the \"dept\".\nMy dad doesn't take much or often and whenever he does, he keeps apologizing and he always returns more than he took, but my mom  sometimes takes all of my savings and doesn't return the money unless I keep asking and reminding her all the time (often she doesn't even ask as she knows where I keep the money)\nA couple of months ago, she took the money she KNEW I was saving for a Kindle. At the time I didn't have enough yet, but now, If I had the money from before, I would.\nI have talked about getting a Kindle for quite awhile now and tried mentioning subtly how much I am missing and how it would help if I had the money for before but she still hasn't made any move to return it.\nMy brother is in college, so that adds to the expense, but college in my country really isn't that expensive (I live in Europe).\nShe just bought some new shoes and a dress, so I know she can return it, but just doesn't think it's that important. And anyway, she always has money for cigarettes and a beer...\n\nAm I the asshole for getting mad at her for this? Will I be the asshole if I confront her? And also, should I consider the money I have as family money, not mine, as I don't feel like I had to do much to earn it, only visit my relatives from time to time I guess?\n\nTL-DR Mom likes to borrow money from me, but doesn't feel like it's important to return it in time.\n\nDisclamer: I love both of my parents and I feel really bad about talking about either of them in this way, but this is something that has been troubling me in quite some time and I would really like to know if I am a bad person for feeling this way.\nAnd also thank you if you took your time to read this, as I feel like this will for most of you seem like some spoilt kid complaining (If so, feel free to judge me in the comments, it's why I came here)\n",

      "title": "AITA for parking in the neighbors unassigned parking spots",
      "description": "Background: I am 2.5 months into owning a condo after previously renting an apartment for years. The condo community is primarily retired or close to retired people. I myself am in my mid 20s. I have received multiple “notices” from my neighbor that I have been parking in their “spots”. The lot is fully unassigned parking with way more spots available than residents.\n\nNow to the actual story...  \n\nDays before I moved in I went on vacation and parked my vehicle in the condo parking lot. I unknowingly parked next to a large amount of vomit. With it being 3 am and my vehicle going to be there for multiple days I decided to stay in that spot. I return days later to find a cardboard sign on my car saying “please clean up” written in a very certain style. I’m aware that it looks like the vomit came from me (it did not). No biggie though I just throw away the sign and leave the condo area. \n\nFast forward 1.5 months. I am now all moved in and really enjoying the condo life. A friend of mine stops by to take a coffee table and tv stand that I no longer need. As he is putting the coffee table in the car, the neighbor comes by and asks when he will be leaving. He says he will be leaving shortly. Once again no biggie. He takes out the other table after a few minutes and sees the neighbor is parked in the “driving” area of the parking lot waiting for him to move. This is my first actual “run-in” with the neighbor but it’s not really an issue at this point. Days later my girlfriend who just moved in the prior day is unknowingly parked in the neighbors “spot”. And here is where the story starts. The neighbor shows up at my door and the first thing she says “what is with that [License plate state] car” in possibly the rudest tone I’ve ever heard. I respond that it is my girlfriend and she lives here. The neighbor states she is old and can’t walk well ( she is semi-old and walks fine), but we will take care of it and I close the door. It’s 7:30 at night and we are in the middle of dinner. We certainly were not going to move her car since 75% of the parking lot was open and after she complained about where a guest of mine parked. \n\nAt this point the neighbor has complained about 2 people parking in her “spots” over the course of 3-4 days. I am a little frustrated since the parking lot is fully unassigned parking. \n\nFast forward a few more days. I arrive home from work in the afternoon to see the neighbor,  “who can’t walk” outside chopping ice from the parking lot. She has also left a plastic box with a sign that states “No parking ice melting zone”. This is certainly unusual but I’m leaving 5 minutes after I get home so I really don’t pay attention to what she’s doing. I arrived back home after it had been dark for a while and ended up parking in the spot next to her “ice melting zone” because there were cars in what she would deem “my area”. Hours later I come out to my car and the sign is on my windshield and the box and ice pick are sitting right in front of my garage. Safe to say I am stunned. My girlfriend takes the box and ice pick and sets it in front of the neighbors garage and proceeds to rip up the sign and throw it in the box... one would think it would end there, but it doesn’t. We come out a few hours later and the box and ice pick have been set right in front of my car. Unbelievable. I toss the box and pick right towards their walkway entrance. At this point I’ve had it with the neighbor and her antics. \n\nI also happened to take a picture of the sign and sure enough it is the same exact style as the original sign on my car from earlier in the story. This lady has now placed 2 signs on my car over the course of 2 months. This is more signs on my car over these last 2 months than over the previous 10 years before I moved in. \n\nA couple days later due to people parked in “our area”, my girlfriend has to park in the neighbors spots. We go outside later that night to find the neighbors vehicle parked right next to my girlfriends car and 1 foot away at most. This is clearly intentional by the neighbor. There were no cars at least the next 3 spots over...\n\nThis is all that has occurred so far. I have tried calling the condo association manager however, he has yet to answer his phone. \n\nAre we the assholes for parking in the neighbors unassigned spots?",

      "description": "My GF is 42, Im 43. She has a 17yr old daughter and an 18yr old daughter. I have a 17yr old son that lives with his mother, but visits every weekend. GF allows her daughters to have BF’s spend the night and a daughters friend move in and has WRECKED the bedroom she stays in, then they all smoke weed on the porch every night. Nobody has a job worth anything. (Part time at Saladworks, part time at Ann Taylor, Part Time at Merry Maids). My GF asked me to move in about 10 months ago when it was just her and her 17yr old (then 16) who graduated HS early and was planning to go to college. I moved in and rented my paid off home out. This 17yr old has perpetually been getting in trouble with the law as soon as school ended and  does nothing except give attitude as well as refuse to do anything around the home. I’ve stayed out of most everything to do with their personal lives as I feared overstepping boundaries. Finally, today we have discovered she is pregnant. I have made no secret that I am done raising kids and the thought of irresponsible people getting pregnant makes me furious, I had a vasectomy years ago and have spent the majority of my life trying NOT to get anyone pregnant. Of course I said get an abortion, institute some rules and then enforce them. Everyone is pissed at me now. I am a new realtor after owning my own successful business for 20years and have zero plans to raise any more kids. My GF works for me in my new business ventures and all I can see is her having to take off work all the time for this new infant (if they don’t have an abortion). I admit I have always been a ruthless boss with little tolerance for calling out or basically anything that interferes with making money and I foresee problem after problem on top of the nonstop problems that arise every week. (Oh yeah, we complained about the blunt smoke that wafts into the house so they open all the windows and then cover up with blankets and put space heaters under them. Of course I pay the power bill)\n\nTL/DR: AITA for wanting to break up with my GF because her irresponsible daughter that lives at home is pregnant? AITA for suggesting getting an abortion?",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to go to gaming parties because I'm tired of losing all the time?",
      "description": "Once of my circles of friends and I have been playing video games for decades and we have made it a point into our adult lives to periodically meet up to play games a couple times a month to play the games we did when we were younger, and to try out some new games as they come out.\n\nAs time has gone on the amount of time I can dedicate to games has diminished greatly.  I am married with a child on the way, and between family and work obligations I probably only play a few hours of games a week compared to the 2-3 hours a night I was playing several years ago.  This isn't a big deal for me as games just aren't the priority they used to be, but the rest of my gaming buddies still play almost as much as we did as kids.  They are all a bit younger than I am and have plenty of free time and disposable income to dedicate to the hobby.\n\nAs a result of all this my skills at games have dropped off while they are all still very skilled at the games we play resulting in me losing every single game we play so hard I might as well have not even bothered playing.  I am not bothered by losing.  Even when I was at my peak I was pretty average within this group so its not like I was winning all my games or anything, but I actually can't remember the last time I finished a game in the top 2/3rd of the scoreboard.  \n\nNow this hadn't been a major issue initially because we also played a lot of co-op and non competitive games like Rock Band, and some others which was great, but lately the group's focus has been on competitive games.  Primarily they want to play some old school shooters and the new Smash Bros.  Well for context for those that know Smash over the course of 10 matches I only managed to take 5 stock off my opponents in total.  They obliterated me so completely that by the end of the last match I just wanted to jump off the map so I could end the game quicker and save us all the time watching me get beaten to death.\n\nRealizing I wasn't having any fun I started asking around to see if maybe we could play some less competitive games, but the group as a whole really wanted to keep playing those games for now.  I totally get it.  If they are having fun I have no right to demand a change just for my sake.   I sent the following message in the discord for the group of 12 players as a result.\n\n*\"Hey guys I'd like to sit out the next meetup since there will mostly just be Smash and CS being played as I'm just not having as much fun playing the competitive games like I used to.  I can't really keep up and play them very well.  I'd still love to join you guys later on when there are more co-op or casual games to play though.*\n\nA few members were understanding about it, but a couple of the others started messaging me asking me to keep going and to stop being a sore loser.  I tried to explain to them that it wasn't about losing, but about the extent to which I was losing and that I wasn't having fun basically being a punching bag for everybody in game all night long.  I was then accused of being overly dramatic and immature because I can't handle not winning all the time.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  I kinda see why they think I'm a sore loser, but I just don't see it that way.  I still lost a lot back when I was good at the games, but at least then I was keeping up with people and able to play the games and have fun.  Am I supposed to just suck it up and keep going to these things if I'm not having fun?",

      "description": "A little background:\nWe're hosting a foreign exchange student for the school year, he is 15 going on 16 and I just turned 16. I share a room with him.\n\nFirstly, he always is picking on my 4 year old half brother, bothering him, etc. It is already hard enough trying to correct my half brother's behavior that he picks up from his dad's house, but with the exchange student bothering him constantly, good moods go out the window. Secondly, he eats a ton, he thinks he can just help himself to other people's food, and I mean food other people have set aside for themselves. He expects us to clean up for him, for example, we have a bird who was screeching a lot the other day, so I stuck him in the bathroom, and the exchange student goes in to take a shower and comes out to tell me the bird pooped in the tub, standing there like I should be rushing to go clean it up. He will just leave his messes laying around, be it in the bathroom, the kitchen, or the living room, he will leave wrappers, cans, food, etc laying around. He will eat food in the room we share, and is always eating crackers, so his bed is full of crumbs and he hardly cleans it up. He has the bed closest to the door and will always leave his shit in front of the door, so it is a challenge to open the bedroom door sometimes. He will also play Fortnite on our Xbox, which I don't really care about, even if I don't like the game, but he will cancel other peoples' games/updates for his Fortnite updates, and will sometimes just loaf up the game then sit/lay on the floor and scroll through his phone.\n\nSorry for the long winded post, it began more a vent than a question.",

      "description": "Okay so I will try to keep this as unbiased as possible. Basically the title is the reason my ex-girlfriend keeps telling me the relationship ended.\n\n**So to start, heres some background info that may be important:**\n\n-  We were friends for a year, then we were together for a year.\n-  Weed actually helps my anxiety. I use it recreationally too, but I wouldn't say that's the main reason I smoke \n-  My ex has told me in the past she would rather me use prescribed anxiety meds rather than weed\n\n**Beginning of the relationship:**\n\nWhen we started dating I was a fat stoner. I smoked multiple times a day. She smoked too, but not as much. In the beginning of the relationship, she told me we should both cut down on weed. I agreed because I was under the impression she would leave me otherwise (which was an actually possibility if you know her). So I stopped smoking for months. During this time I told her I wanted to smoke still and she told me she'd be okay with me smoking like a couple times a month and only around her, so I agreed because I didn't want to lose her.\n\n**Towards the end of the relationship:**\n\nSo recently, we just moved into an apartment together. After weeks of being deep in thought, I had come to the conclusion she was being controlling (this is just what I thought, this is why I'm going to you guys) so I told her that I was going to smoke more anyways and she was reluctantly okay but still wanted me to limit myself. So I did.\n\nThen out of nowhere she tells me she needs to talk. She told me she was deep in thought and cannot marry a stoner and told me if I don't completely cut weed out of my life then we couldn't be together. I told her that telling me I can't do something for the rest of my life wasn't going to work out and we both ended the relationship.\n\n**After the breakup:**\n\nShe is now telling me that smoking more caused me to become lazy and stop planning dates with her, but I only started smoking when we moved into an apartment and were low on money. I had friends that provided the weed btw. I warned her that we wouldnt be able to do much, but she still told me I was bad for not taking her out. During this time I spent $20 on weed and she told me if I really cared about her I would have used that to take her out.\n\nShe also told me that I prioritized weed over her. I tried re-assuring her that she was my #1 priority during the relationship, but the fact that I did choose to leave makes me question that and feel like an ass even though in my mind it was more of a freedom thing than weed.\n\n**tldr:** Ultimatum: Either you cut weed out of your life completely, or you lose me. I chose her\n\nBut why I feel like an asshole is basically because ultimately I did choose weed over her. Even if I had personal freedom in mind, it still came down to me saying I want to smoke more than I want to be with you. I'm still trying to get over her and its been a couple weeks. I don't know this just sucks\n\n",

      "description": "Ok this is how it started out. I am in 11th grade back in 2013 and just got transferred to a new school because of bullying and my friend became friends with someone who just transferred to my former school. I messaged her and we had a bit of a friendship now lets go to 2018 where this all starts.\n\nI am currently in college and she is in high school 12th grade to be precise. I tried to date her before and she said no I accepted that and later she became a lesbian. I am fully supportive with her choice. We had generally talked day to day but when she would be upset, I would ALWAYS take her side and tried to calm her down. This would work and I tried to make her feel better. She would also talk about killing herself and I told her not to as that would make people feel horrible.\n\nMay of 2018 she had gotten a girlfriend and we were friends on facebook. I like always supported her choice and continued to be friendly with her. Every now and then I would see if she wanted to meet up and hangout, This never happened. She would post on facebook that she needed help with certain things and I always tried to give her information on where to buy this or sell that. \n\nNow in June of 2018 this is where my patience was no more. She was extremely upset and said she wanted to kill herself and said it would be better (this after she had a girlfriend who never was seen on her facebook by the way). I tell her to calm down and that we should meet up to talk about this(I was hoping that meeting a friend would help her calm down more). She blew up on me after that.\n\nHer: You have always been trying to date me and wanting to meet me and never leaving me alone.\n\nHer: my girlfriend says I should call the cops on you for trying to meet me.\n\nBy this point I gave up and told her off.\n\nMe: I have been trying to help you and I don't want to date you I even tried to help you sell stuff. So fuck off and leave me alone.\n\nI then blocked her on facebook and haven't talked since.\n\nJanuary 2019 I had checked on the old messenger where we would talk and I saw a message from july 2018. I no longer have the message but to sum it up she said no she really doesn't have friends anymore for being a jerk and yelling at them.\n\nThis was my horrible experience. I don't really care what people think of me here I just had to let this out someway.",

      "description": "Met this girl on tinder and she looked really hot, all face pics though which was suspect and they had a good amount of filters on the pics from what I could tell. I didn't care too much because basically every girl uses filters on pics and she was funny and had a nice face. We met up last night at this resto/bar place and right when I saw her I was like WTF this girl is huge. Like 250 lbs probably, I'm 6'1 and she def weighed more than me, I gave her a hug and we went into the place. I was pretty bummed out about this but she was really happy to see me and had an outgoing personality from what I could see so I just thought I'd stick it out. But just staring at her more as we were talking and I knew I couldn't do this anymore and didn't want to waste any more time here with her as I'm not attracted to fat women. She went to the washroom and I texted my buddy to call me in 10 mins pretending our other friend had a medical emergency and is in the hospital and I need to get there. So he calls and I play the part on the phone, apologize to her profusely and quickly pay the whole bill and run off into the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went straight over to my buddy's place (same one who called) to have some brews and catch the end of the Raps game and I told him what happened and he's like bro that's a dick move, you're an ass but was kinda joking when saying it. But it got me thinking am I an asswipe for this? Also she texted me this morning saying she had a good time and asked how my buddy is doing. ",

We grew up Catholic so we’re used to writing a $400 “donation” to the church and keep it moving. But this new church she wants to be apart of is methodist and they don’t want money, they want some sort of commitment..like be a member of the church. This requires one meeting once a week for 5 weeks.\n\nThen they asked her to sing in the church choir which requires us to now have to go to church on Sunday. This is an issue because she works 3shift so she will work 12hra straight and then go sing a church. On top of all that, she signed up my oldest daughter for all these extra curricular activists\n\nMonday- feee\nTuesday-dance\nWednesday- tee ball\nThursday-choir\nFriday-free\nSaturday -tee ball\nSunday- church\n\nI basically have no time to relax.

      "description": "I'll try to make this simple. My Girlfriend (30f) and I (36m) have 100% custody of my 5 year old Daughter. My daughter's biological mother moved out of state to pursue a career opportunity. \n\nA little background - my Ex-wife left me over 2 years ago for someone else and hasnt been much of a mother since. My current girlfriend has effectively raised my daughter with me for a little over a year and has done a tremendous job as a step mother.\n\nMy Ex-wife moved just a couple of weeks ago and now my girlfriend and I have 100% custody. As a \"parting gift\", my ex made a scrap book for my daughter with pictures of my daughter, my daughter and her mother, and lastly.... my daughter, my ex and myself. There were 2 pictures total that included the 3 of us. \n\nI noticed my girlfriend tearing something apart and my daughter telling her to \"STOOOOP! SHE WORKED SO HARD ON THAT!\"\n\nNot knowing what was going on I stepped over to see what the commotion was all about. This was the first time I had seen or heard of the scrap book, and was unaware of its contents until I witnessed my girlfriend removing all of the pictures that displayed my ex-wife. She was even throwing away pictures that didnt include me and were of my daughter and her mother only.\n\nI abruptly put an end to the destruction, and have been on non-speaking terms with my girlfriend since the event. (8 hours ago) I have tried to explain that I dont want the pictures for myself, and have even stored the in the garage in a box that I keep with all of my daughters report cards and neat school projects and art. However, my wife thinks we should destroy all evidence of my ex, even though her current leave of absence is not guaranteed to be  permanent. \n\nShe was raised similarly and I asked her how she would feel if her stepmother threw away all pictures of her biological mother, just because she moved. She agreed that she would be upset, but argued that it doesnt matter now that SHE is the one raising my daughter. \n\nI'm so lost as to why she thinks this is ok. It's like jealousy and ego have gotten the beat of her and her true self has disappeared. I'm so dumbfounded by it that I'm not certain that I'm not seeing this clearly. Am I missing something?  AITA?\n\nTLDR- my girlfriend doesnt want any pictures of her stepdaughter's mother in the house (anywhere, even in storage) because she is raising my daughter, and bio mother doesnt deserved to be remembered.",

      "description": "Let me give a bit of background here. I was raised in a household where waiting until marriage to have sex is a big thing. And I’ve always liked the idea of being a virgin until marriage anyway. Well, I met my current bf and told him this (as I had lost a lot of potential dates because I feel this way) and he said he was completely fine with it.\n\nFast forward 5 years, he’s slowly been introducing me to stuff. At first I would push it away but he’d insist and in the heat of the moment, stuff felt good so I let it happen (not saying I didn’t give consent because I did let it happen and enjoyed it so no complaints here). He’s only fingered and given me oral, that’s it. For a while I’d feel guilt after stuff but now I’ve been learning not be ashamed of my body and doing certain things. However, when it comes to doing stuff back, I never feel confident enough or am always worried of getting caught (still live at home and my parents are nosey and love to pop in announced every so often to see what we are doing). If I get caught, it will ruin my life (I’m Hispanic so all this in my culture is huge). I’ve tried to do some stuff back but I feel awkward and uncomfortable and he always wants to push me to do it but I just can’t.\n\nNow lately he’s been getting angry at me for not reciprocating. I’ve told him my reasons and that I just can’t and really just wanna wait to get married to continue doing stuff. I don’t DEMAND anything, I’ve even told him not to do stuff to me anymore since he gets mad I won’t reciprocate. And I’ll often stop him and shit just to avoid arguments. So I thought he was over it and a few days ago initiated and I tried to stop him but he kept on, assuring we won’t get caught. I gave in. He wanted me then to reciprocate and I told him he know the answer to that and that I didn’t make him do anything to me (even kept refusing but he kept insisting) and he got mad at me again and basically ghosted me all of today. It got to the point where I said no multiple times and he didn’t stop insisting until I said he was making me uncomfortable.\n\nWe are not teenagers and haven’t been for a couple of years. I feel like at the beginning of the relationship he respected my decisions and then it gradually went to making me come into understanding myself sexually but then wanting to push past where I’m comfortable. A lot goes through my head: getting caught, not doing it right, not having experience, feeling guilty afterwards, it’s hard to explain. But I tell him and he just says it’s bs because why can I get it and not give back? And I’d agree if it wasn’t for me expressing exactly how I feel and not demanding he does anything to me (even push him away) to avoid the argument. I can do what he wants me to, I just need time and the proper conditions (not living at home, married, etc so I don’t have a guilt following me that eats me up). Anyway, I’m rambling.\n\nAITA for not reciprocating?",

I left the house when I was 18 and moved out of the country but kept in touch with my family sporadically. \n\nOver the years, my stepfather changed a lot, attending AA meetings (he has not had a drink in 15 years) and has expressed his regrets for treating us the way he did. I thought I got over my childhood issues and could move on with my life, until a recent incident : last September, my sister, half-brother and I were summoned to a family meeting. There, my stepfather announced that he had contacted a lawyer to ensure that when he dies, his money would not end up in my sister´s and my pockets. \n\nBasically, according to the law, if he dies before my mother, she gets half of his estate and my half-brother gets the other half. And then, when my mother dies, what she owns gets divided into 3 equal parts going to her 3 children. But my stepfather sees that as unfair and he does not want the part she´d get when he dies to go to anybody else but to his son. He asked my sister and I to sign a letter the lawyer wrote which said we would give our part of the will to our half-brother.\n\nOf course, we refused. My brother looked embarrassed but did not express any objection. My mother, as always, was silent. Seeing how we would not sign it, my stepfather asked us to think about it.\n\nFast forward and here comes Christmas, and we are all again reunited. The subject comes up and my stepfather becomes very irritated when we tell him we would not budge. That same night, all the abuse I suffered as a child started to resurface and the next morning, I decided I was going to pack my bags and leave. My stepfather was not there so my mother took the brunt of my anger : I told her that I would never forgive her for not protecting us, that she was as guilty as he was and that I was going to do something that I should have done when I was 18 : break up with them and never see them again. \n\nMy sister respects my decision but my brother said I was being too harsh and asked me to reconsider. Apparently my mother and stepfather are devastated by my decision and have tried to reach out to me, but I am very reluctant to accept them back into my life. I don´t think I could ever forgive them. And it is not even about the money, I would actually prefer they donate everything instead of starting this drama.",

      "description": "So, this is my girlfriends story, she just wanted me to submit it for her under the alias A.A.:\n\n\"Oh boy do I have a fun little story to tell about a terrible experience with a little a-hole at my school!\nFor context, this boy admittedly wasn't a normal kid, he had behavioural issues. He has outbursts, giggles at people's pain, and makes bets only small children would make. Thing is, while he is certainly a special ed kid, he doesn't have a special ed teacher with him, unlike this really nice girl at school with extremely mild autism. Him not having a teach actually leads him to slack off since nobody watches him, and he tends to be disliked be a lot of kids, though that doesn't justify this story...\nSo, it was Friday morning, I was in art class and all packed up to head out to my next class. I stepped to the door, and as I was the first one there, I stood beside the door knob, to make exiting as quick as possible. There was about two minutes to spare, and this kid comes up to me, and gets right in my face, telling me to move. Of course I said no, because I was there first and had no reason to agree since he was being rather rude...\nHe got mad and asked me to move again, with more authority in his voice , and I said no again. I was already getting grumpy from this kid, and before I know it shit hits the fan. He starts berating me with insults! Calling me a \"jerk\" and a \"terrible person\" all because of where I was standing! I calmly asked him to please calm down, and he proceeded to say \"Don't talk back to me! You're a girl!\"\nThat, made me feel like absolute shit if I'm being honest. At this point, three other kids tell him he's being very rude and ask him to stop. Unsurprisingly he starts going off on them, calling them jerks as well. That day we had a sub, who reached between us, not to stop us, but to flip the lock so the next period could get in. Such a great sub. I had to lean out of the way for the sub to reach the door lock, so the second the sub left, the boy just elbowed me till I moved and said \"Was that so hard?\"\nI was tearing up at this point, looking down and trying to hold it in. And he just giggled at my tears! Then the bell rang, and he was still berating another student! He delayed the exit by a minute! So why did he want the spot in the first place?!\nSo we left, I walked begrudgingly to my next class, Spanish, and sat down, looking down and trying to stay strong. My friend came and sat near me, asking how my day was going. I looked at her, and she instantly shifted to concern, and as I tried to explain what happened, I broke. I start crying uncontrollably and my Spanish teacher along with my friend had to calm me down. I explained what happened to the best of my ability, and my Spanish teach emailed my art teach. This Tuesday is my next art class, and I am not excited for the outcome ...\"\n\nMore to come whenever all this is over, and we see what happens. \n",

      "description": "On mobile, sorry for formatting etc.\n\nSo, a bit of context - I am a 15 year old guy, pretty tall (about 185 centimetres), pretty skinny, but a bad temper (not a short fuse as such, more a long one attached to a large pile of C4), which I got pretty good at controlling. I mostly just want to be left alone, actually,My Mum has a friend with 3 kids, the oldest is an 11 year old boy, who we’ll call Harold, and 2 daughters (9 and about 7), who I don’t mind. I don’t like Harold very much, but I tolerate him, because he has abandonment issues from his Dad (his Mum and Dad are divorced, but he cared much more for his 2 sisters. He recently stopped caring so much, and has spent more time with his Mum).\n\nSo, my Mum had them over, along with a friend of theirs. I have virtually no interest spending time with them, since we share no common interests. Harold, however, considers himself a “gamer” (i.e he plays Fortnite on the Xbox), but I play Portal, Darkest Dungeon etc. on my PC. My Mum bitches at me if I don’t play “with” him. I’d got fed up of him asking me to download Fortnite so he could “try it on PC”, and decided to just cut my losses - I’d rather not play and not have him bother me.\n\nSo I head downstairs, and I’m hanging out in the living room, and I’m playing some Daft Punk on an Echo, when Harold comes in on one of those stupid hover board things (yes we have one, no we don’t use it often), which belongs primarily to me. He proceeds to bash into the sofa, leaving a mark on it. Then, he changes the music to Cardi B. I call him hilarious, then put the album back on (I was pissed, as I was right in the middle of Harder Better Faster Stronger, and I had to start it again). He complains, somehow doing the mental gymnastics that he had put it on first. I put my phone down, and stand up (a full head taller than him, even with the board), and tell him to leave, getting in his face. My temper was flaring up at this point. He refuses, and starts shouting (everyone else was a good few rooms away, laughing loudly), so I outshout him, once again telling him to leave. He doesn’t, so I lift him off the board, and put him down, telling him to (you guessed it) leave. He doesn’t and things get “physical”. I put “physical” in quotes, because there was virtually nothing he could do to hurt me, and I wasn’t hurting him, put I was mocking his arm swinging. He threw a weak punch at my stomach, which just bounced off, andI shepherded him out of the door. He didn’t get my Mum or anything, so there’s that.\n\nI felt at the time that I was completely in the right, but looking back on it now, I feel like what I did was unnecessary, especially with the age difference. I also feel that the reason he hangs around me a bit is because he looks up to me a bit. Look, I know I was a bit of a bellend, but I think I was understandably so.\n\nQuick note - I hadn’t had a great day. I had shit schoolwork, shit lunch, and had a headache. I felt like this was the straw that broke the camel’s back, because I’d not had a proper temper outburst for about 8 months, which, oddly enough, also involved him, but he was the asshole on that occasion.",

      "description": "Hi all! \n\nLong time lurker, first time poster on this subreddit! I'm currently in a bit of a pickle and seeking opinions.\n\nTo preface this, I am an insomniac and so it takes me a while to fall asleep. That initial moment of falling asleep is so crucial for me because if it gets interrupted, I end up staying up longer and there goes my productivity the following day. I should also mention, I share a room with my 3 sisters. \n\nThe sister who this post is about, has a boyfriend who she's been with for a few months. They talk every day and every night. It's gotten to the point where they fall asleep on the phone together and if the call drops, he rings her back. You would think common sense would prevail and he would assume she is sleeping, but no. He rings and rings and rings.\n\nNormally I just suck it up since I'm already awake and there's no way of me going back to sleep. But last night was the final straw for me. It was 1 am, I could feel myself drifting off to sleep, and he fucking called her!! She eventually picked up and was whisper-speaking to him. \n\nI've had it with the ringing. I want to approach her and ask that they enforce some boundaries for e.g. No calls past 9pm. WIBTA for asking her to create some boundaries when it comes to phone calls? \n\nTIA",

      "description": "For context: My sister is in grade 3, while I am in high school.\n\nSo basically, my sister, was falling quite far behind in her school work. My parents thought it was the teachers as she (apparently) has dyslexia (never been officially diagnosed but she shows alot of signs, so understandable). After doing alot of school searching and hopping, my parents were somewhat angry that no school they desired would take her (they obviously went after ones with high reviews, however the only ones with placements left were more...undesirable), so they put her into a private school, costing around 600$ per month, in the hopes that she gets more 1-on-1 time and help with her work, due to overall lesser amount of classmates and the like. I was obviously annoyed by this, but their defense was that I have never struggled with grades (Which is true) and never needed any help with work. This wasn't helped by the fact that they changed after 2 weeks at the new private school, and chose an even more expensive private school afterwards, which is almost double, at 1200$ a month. While I understand that she needs more help than I do, I can't help but feel tossed to the side as my sister gets this special education I wasn't allowed. I still think I would benefit If I went to private school at this stage, but of course my parents deny it, claiming that my grades are good enough that it wouldn't benefit me. (And it's not a money problem; my parents earn quite alot and could easily afford for me to go aswell). I admit (maybe selfishly) would love to be able to put on my resume/CV that I went to a private school; and I am sure I WOULD indeed benefit grades wise if I went.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been living with my boyfriend for six months. We had small fights and misunderstandings, but we were always able to solve our problems. Except this one:\n\nFew days ago, I was at work and  was texting my boyfriend at the end of my shift, told him I was coming home soon and asked him where he was. \nHis reply to my question was kind of odd, he just asked when he was supposed to be home. I insisted on getting an answer, so he told me. But he didn't want to tell me with whom he was. \n\nIt made me not only angry but also scared. Later that evening we had a discussion about that, when he told me that I have no right to now where he is or who is he with, that it's his private sphere. So I got that disgusting feeling in my stomach,because I started to think that he's hiding something big from me. I really love him and I want to trust him, but something is fishy here. \n\nHis friends are really important to him and I know that. I also have nothing against him being outside without me (I mostly don't have time to go out and don't enjoy it that much) but I always wanted to know where I could find him (although never even tried) and he never really wanted to tell me. This was the first time he straight-up refused to reveal his company. \n\nSo i would like to ask you (especially men on reddit) am i wrong? Is he right? Do i really have no right to know? \n\nTLDR: Boyfriend went out last night and didn't want to tell me with who. Am I the asshole for asking?\n",

      "description": "I was playing minecraft skywars on my phone and i teamed up with a girl named amy for that round until it was just us two. We wandered around the map for a while until she killed me without notice. I was a little upset for like 2 seconds since it's just minecraft obviously. We met again at the spawn in the lobby and she looked at me and slowllyy walked into the \"team\" skywars. (I never play team mode, I hate it) but it was 1:30am and i felt like following her. On one hand it was because we were probably still teammates and on the other hand it's totally just because I wanted revenge because she killed me without warning. So the game started up, I emptied the chests on my island blah blah and i IMMEDIATLY start searching for any. Conveniently she was on the island right next to mine. I didn't interact with my teammate at all I just immediatly started building towards her island. She hadn't noticed me building to her since she was focused on her own bridge and her teammate was nowhere in sight. I dropped down behind her and immediately threw her off the edge. She turned to see me during her fall but it happened so fast I doubt she even noticed it was me. Felt like I just killed my best friend. Then get tammate came out and threw me off the edge and i opened reddit to tell everyone what happened",

In this package there was Wisconsin String Cheese. The package came and she had 1 piece of cheese and then flew to  New York where I am from and where I was visiting my family. We then fly back on the NYE. I didn't touch the cheese until the 2nd where I had 2 pieces. I had  2 more pieces on the 3rd and then 2 today. She then sees that the bag has 2 left and gets furious. I can't help but laugh. I didn't know how many pieces were originally in the bag because it was already opened by her, and there isn't a set number in these bags. I also didn't know that she was so attached to this cheese until she flipped out. She's also been talking about getting into shape and eating healthy so I didn't even know she wanted it that bad. AITA for laughing because she got mad that I ate so much cheese that her mom sent both of us?\n\nTL;DR: My fiance's mother sent us Wisconsin String Cheese and I unknowingly ate most of the package. She got furious and I laughed because I thought it was funny that she got mad over cheese. AITA for laughing?",

      "description": "A little back story. I have a bad case of mono. Not sure if I got it from my new girlfriend who doesn't think she ever had it or my nephew who had it last fall, or some rando sneaking in my food and giving it to me, whatever the case I got it bad.\n\nAt it's worst I was sleeping 20 hours a day, jaundice skin, inflamed spleen, beach ball neck, and had trouble lifting anything heavier than a Harry Potter book. \n\nI am getting better and I have actually been back to work, but if no one keeps me up I fall asleep 4pm. On Friday my girlfriend and I went on a date night and I ended up falling asleep at the store we were shopping in around 630. Today she wanted us and her daughter to go to a movie at 4. I figured if I drank soda I could stay awake and be caffeinated enough to drive home after without falling asleep at the wheel. \n\nSo we went out and had some ice cream. While getting ice cream I went to the theatre website to get tickets, but it turns out the movie isn't until 5. I told her I didn't feel comfortable staying out that late yet. At this point I am already tired enough to fall asleep and I am just forcing myself to stay awake because I want to spend time with them. I offer to hang out until the movie starts but she doesn't want to. She suggests skipping the movie at the theatre, driving back to town renting a movie and watching something at home.\n\nIf we did this, the movie would still not start till after 5 but now we would have a kid who was told we were going to the theatre and then got denied that we have to watch the movie at home with. So I would rather cut out and go to bed at this point. We make plans to go see dumbo this weekend and I ask her if we can hang out tomorrow, but instead she gives me attitude and insists I don't want to hang out with her so she will just see me later.\n\nIDK, I see it as I don't want to fall asleep at the wheel and die on the way home, but she makes it seem like I am an uninterested asshole leading her on.  \n\nAm I being an asshole here?",

(Hella spoiled I know)\n\nAnyway, in my shop of Plumbing and Heating, theres this kid who I will call Steven. Steven is quite oblivious to how he shows himself to others. Hes an unabashed fan of Pokemon and Dragon Ball and countless other anime. Hes so oblivious that he demands us to call him either Goku or DarkFire instead of Steven because we have multiple Steves in our class. During shop time, hes constantly on his ipad watching this shit, to which he misses valuable info from lessons. This has made him so laughably incompetent in shop that its sad. I will note, he is not innocent. He will act like an asshole, and we all give him shit equally for that.\n\nMe however, I’m a very easy person to irritate. A person can easily tick me off by the way they act, and the fact that Steven misses so much information and doesn’t seek it out out of pure laziness pisses me off so much. So I have constantly given him shit. Constant. Even when others weren’t. I wasn’t even realizing it.\n\nNow here I sit, 11 at night and I’m barely able to sleep. I’ve thought over how Steven acts, and from previous friends and their knowledge, Steven is 100% somewhere on the spectrum for Autism.\n\nI can barely sleep right now because I just realized I’ve been bullying a kid who might have autism for the past month or so.\n\nI will also mention he survived cancer, so thats also there for making me the morally wrong one.",

I'm getting married in August to the love of my life, I can not tell you how insanely in love and happy I am with this man. But my an unlucky twist of fate, my first name rhymes with his last name! (Think Julia Gulia from The Wedding Singer)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I could keep my name, but I love the idea of sharing a surname and sharing that name with our future children. In the sweetest gesture I could ever imagine, my fiancé has offered to change his name from Harty to Hart, so that the rhyme isn't so obvious and jarring. It's an idea we completely fell in love with, and we're even planning on getting little anatomical heart tattoos after the wedding to commemorate the day! (We're big tattoo folk)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's the tough part. His family and my family have been judging us pretty harshly about it. My brother thought it was outrageous so ask a man to change his name. My fiancé's brother thought is was ridiculous, that we were throwing away the family history, and that we might as well change our name to anything if we were going to do something so crazy. My partner is very sweet and he obviously takes this very much to heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm honestly lost about what to do. Every time I've mentioned my possible new name (with the rhyming Harty) to people, they always laugh a good bit and it makes me very self-conscious. I don't want to feel awkward about my name for the rest of my life! But I also don't want our family to think I'm pushing my partner into this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suppose most importantly, my partner seems 100% happy with the decision, but I don't know if I'm expecting too much.

      "description": "So, I am in a polyamorous relationship with 3 other people, two boys and a girl. One of the menfolk... we will call him Cthulu, got in a fight with my gf's mother yesterday. I don't know much about the context, or even what transpired as I wasn't there, but as a result he decided to leave the relationship. He posted his departure in both of our groupchats, and then left the chats themselves. \n\nFor some context, I am the most recent addition to this poly group, so I feel that my position is really unstable within it. I felt the need to reach out to my gf and ask her how Cthulu leaving would impact she, the other bf, and myself's relationship. She said she wasn't sure, and I said OK and told her to keep me posted. Besides this private question, I decided to stay entirely out of the fight. I didn't have enough information to have any sort of opinion, and I didn't want to force myself into a conversation I didn't belong in. I never privately dm'd Cthulu, because I felt that doing so would more likely get me tangled in the drama than it would make anyone feel better. What is more, this isn't the first time that he has threatened to leave over a small fight, and it is generally frustrating whenever he does it, so I doubted I could be very consoling.\n\nToday, Cthulu messages me and tells me I made the fight about myself, and that asking how his leaving impacts me is selfish, especially since I didn't dm him or try to comfort him. I'm really confused, because besides asking my gf about how the fallout would shift things, I stayed entirely out of it. Was that selfish? Am I an asshole for keeping to my own business within our relationship and not trying to mediate situations I didn't know much about?",

My friends both joined the club this year, and I took part in the first practice this year. However I did not enjoy the practice and realized that maybe the club wasn't for me. I told everyone that I was unlikely to come to the next practice (which was against another school). The day of, my friends asked me if I was coming and I told them I wasn't interested in the club any longer. The team lost the practice. Now the first actual match is coming up and my friends want me to participate. They told me that the team will likely lose without me and that they want to win this year very badly. I told them no again. When they asked me to do it as a favour I said that it wouldn't be fun and to stop asking me. My friends seem upset with me and are convinced that they will lose again this year because I no longer play. AITA? ",

      "description": "My sister (21F) has a displayed disordered eating for about two years now, I’m pretty sure it’s stress-related and I’ve tried to help her out as much as I can. She’s fainted from low blood sugar several times, she only eats an average of 1 meal and snack a day, and she often throws away the food I meal prep for her lunch. \nI’ve tried sitting her down and asking her what goals she has (if she wants to be slim, get fit, be healthy, have a butt, idk) and have taken her to the gym to show her workouts and what a nutritionally satisfying diet looks like several times. I’m not qualified in nutrition but I have a personal interest due to starting weightlifting and such. I’ve encouraged her to seek out therapy and offered to drive her to a clinic so she can get professional help. Or see a nutritionist. She refuses to admit she has a problem, my advice to her tends to be ignored. I  called my own doctor to ask what I could do, and he basically said I can’t force her to do anything since she’s an adult. She’d have to come in herself for any sort of treatment. \nSince I’ve been living at home with her and our parents since Jan, I’ve been trying to cook meals for everyone’s lunch, stock the fridge and pantry with snack foods, make dinner a couple times a week, and overall just be helpful/supportive as much as I can since I’m the only one who doesn’t have a commute to and from work. But what annoys me is that my parents seem to enable her eating habits by telling me to buy x food because my sister ate it this week, instead of addressing the problem.\nMy sister will binge on a certain food for days until it’s gone but if I try to buy the same foods again, she will not touch them. She has a very limited list of foods that she has deemed ‘healthy’ and she will eat but if I prepare them in the wrong way, she also won’t touch them, (for instance, chicken is healthy but if I flavor/season it with something she doesn’t consider healthy, she won’t eat it). I’ve asked her what she would like to eat repeatedly. I’m getting really frustrated at this point because she will straight up ignore me and pretend she didn’t hear my question and I’m exhausted trying to find new foods she will actually eat or work around it. It’s basically a guessing game of what’s going on in her head. The lack of communication is what really irritates me. I’ve been spending a lot of time either cooking last minute alternates or stepping out to buy foods when she suddenly decides she won’t eat y or z foods, when last week y and z was acceptable. \nI know it’s a mental health issue and I feel like the jerk for resorting to this, but WIBTA if I stopped trying to cater to what she eats and just say: Fuck it, this is what I made for today. Eat it or leave it. ",

      "description": "(Sorry if i make grammar/suntax mistakes, english is not my primary language)\n\nSo there is this girl in my class, let's call her Helen. I don't think we could ever be friends as we're really different people (she's not loud at all, a little childlike for her age etc), but she is a nice person and I've always been kind towards her. The problem is that for the past few days, Helen had been trying too hard to get my attention. She would agree on every single thing i said, interrupt me when i was talking with my friends about a tv show/singer to say that she loved it too (she sits behind me in class and it could get pretty weird, especially when I didn't even know she was there) and many more things. It kinda made me cringe but i kept being polite towards her, avoiding her without making it too obvious and doing all the things you're supposed to do when you're stuck in a situation like this.\n\nHowever, she did not get the hint and kept acting this way. It got to the point that whenever she saw me alone in the hallways, she approached me trying to start a conversation, which resulted in me making excuses to leave. Another time, she wanted to show me something on instagram and i saw that my account was her top suggestion. It was creepy.\n\nAnyway, me and this girl have a mutual friend, ''Lena''. She is not one of my best friends, but we're pretty close. When I asked my friends for advice. they told me to talk to her, as she is one of the most trsutworthy people I know, and so I did. Lena said that she had already noticed and suggested something along the lines of ''Look, I am gonna talk to Helen, tell her that I've noticed the way she acts towards you, that it seems like you are trying to avoid her as the way she is trying to approach you is really weird and that you two are really different and it is okay that she are not in your friend group, as you like her as a person anyway''\n\nI thought this was the best solution and I agreed. However, when Lena spoke to Helen it didn't go that well. Lena told me that Helen looked a bit sad but kept her feelings to herself and told that it was okay. Now, Helen won't talk to me at all in class. \n\nMy friends told me that this doesn't make me a bad person, because if I was one I would ignore Helen/straight up tell her that I am not interested in becoming friends with her, but I still feel a little guilty. So redditors, what do you think, am I the asshole here?\n",

Eventually I just said what hell what have I got to lose and after I found out this girl liked me we started talking. Long story short we started dating \n Anxiety, however, had other plans. I felt physically sick and missed almost three days of school. In this time I had seen this girl three time in school since we’ve started dating the rest had been over text. I decided I wasn’t ready and needed to get help for these issues before I was ready to go into the dating pool. \n After we had been officially dating for a week and those three days I missed and a Saturday passed I decided to break up with her on Sunday. I decided to do so over text seeing as 85% of our relationship had been over text. \n I probably should add that she took it extremely well and completely understood and respected my reasons and we are still friends today.\n\nTL;DR: I broke up with a girl over text because most of the relationship was over text.\n\n(Also for anyone wondering I did get help with the anxiety thing and I’m good now.)",

      "description": "This happened about a year ago. I keep hearing that whoever got my former coworker fired is such an asshole. Only out for themselves. Most people don’t know what happened. The executives have been pretty tight-lipped, thankfully.\n\nFor about three years, this coworker would make comments or whistle if he was walking behind me. He would press himself up against me if I was climbing a latter. He said he was trying to make me feel safe, more comfortable because I am really afraid of heights. His reasoning wasn’t believable because of the comments and noises he would make. He also tricked me into looking at a dick pic. Once on a trip to another location, he pulled off on a dirt road, “accidentally” touched my boob and commented about how nice it felt, then told me we could get paid to fuck. When I said no, he got out and took a leak. I was terrified.\n\nHe told me about the various employees at other locations that he slept with and other things they did. He made comments about all different women all the time. I’m pretty sure he’s a sex addict.\n\nThe thing is, I’m terrified of confrontation. I was also afraid the executives would choose to believe him o er me. So I only clearly told him to stop after years of this. And I only told my boss after making a comment about him and getting prodded for what I was talking about. He was gone in less than 24 hours and wasn’t told he was fired due to sexual harassment. He was informed his behavior didn’t line up with company values.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not being clear about saying no because I was afraid and then getting him fired for it?",

      "title": "AITA if I don't go visit my uncle in rehab?",
      "description": "Some backstory: I live in the south (read: Louisiana).\n\nI got a decent size family of about 30ish people, for reference. Now, before my grandma died, she was kind of the glue that held the family together. We went for the holidays and the \"holidays\", if you know what I mean.\n\nI don't attribute the family drifting to anything negative, honestly. People got older, a cousin got married and moved to Illinois for work, my brother got into a college over in Wyoming, that sort of thing. Hell, I moved several hours away myself on a promotion with my job and met my wife.\n\nWell, we made a half assed effort to get together for major holidays after her passing. A time or two a year, we managed to get most heads under the same roof, but I guess it was never really the same.\n\nWell, two years ago, one of my younger cousins finally got married. She had a really pretty wedding relatively close to the hometown and everyone in the family made the trip to go see her and experience her wedding. It was great, because I brought my then-girlfriend and had her meet the family.\n\nThe wife and I got engaged afterwards.\n\nMy wife is enormously well liked in her hometown and ended up inviting around 600 people for the wedding.  I ended up inviting about 40 people to the wedding, including the family.\n\nHere's the kicker. 9 people I invited showed up. My immediate family, a friend and her spouse, and an aunt and uncle (not drug head).\n\nI was angry, truthfully, because I got RSVP's from most of them saying they were coming and they just...didn't come. I got no message from anyone.\n\nMy wife spent 10 months planning this wedding.  Our wedding cake was frankly was one of the most delicious cakes I had ever tasted. The reason I mention the cake was because my brother had taken a large chunk of it for some family members and I caught him and took the cake from him. I told him very frankly that if the family wanted cake, they could have drove their happy asses down here and gotten some.\n\nAfter that, not really much happened, honestly. Like I said, nobody has spoken to me.\n\nWell, the rehab thing comes into play because my uncle after 18 years of serious drug use after his wife died has finally hit rock bottom and is checking himself into rehab to get help. My mother called me and asked me to go see him and to let him know I care (his rehab is really close to my wife and I's home).\n\nMy uncle was in a really bad place when my wedding happened. I don't necessarily blame him for not coming because he was hospitalized with gang-green in his leg. So me not visiting him is just a shot at his children and the rest of the family, WHO BY THE WAY DIDN'T GO SEE HIM EITHER, SO THEY DON'T GET TO USE THAT AS AN EXCUSE, K?\n\nI declined visiting him. My mother is LIVID about it, and I'm sure if my family was speaking to me, they would be too.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n*A lot of pertinent info (I think) is missing b/c of AITA's 3000 char limit.*",

      "description": "Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language. \n\nTwo weeks ago I received an email from an ex I hadn’t speak with in 5 years. \n\nI met him in college and we dated for a couple of months. Looking back now I can see that he was a terrible boyfriend, never listened to what I said or seemed interested in my hobbies, while I spend many very boring hours doing the things he wanted to do or hearing him speak about himself (he got a HUGE self-esteem). But I was young (21) and he (23) was one of the hottest guys I had ever spoke to, so I didn’t mind being the giver in our relationship. Everything was fine until the day we tried to have sex. Tried because there was no penetration, just mutual masturbation. However he thought I might got pregnant and panicked, breaking up with me as soon as I got my period confirming that I was indeed not pregnant. We haven’t speak or met since then, five years ago. We don’t have any friend in common and he doesn’t has any social media account, so I don’t know anything about his life nowadays. \n\nAnd then, two weeks ago and out of the blue, he send me an email saying that he thinks about me a lot, asking for me to forgive him and commenting about some aspects of my life that he can only know through my social media accounts. \n\nHonestly I hadn’t thought about him in years and now, after having dated more boys and experienced how real love feels like, I can see how one-sided our relationship was. He was never genuinely interested in me, only in my body and having someone who will listen to him speak. I wondered if I should answer to his email but I have no interest in having any kind of relationship with him. \n\nI usually try to be nice with everybody and reply all emails, but remembering how many times he told me that he loved me only to get in my pants and how much it bothered him when I did not reply to his texts immediately (even when he wrote them way after midnight), I can’t help but smile :)",

The main issue here is that it’s been the same lady that brings out my food, each time I awkwardly laugh and apologize while putting a pile of change on her tray, and might I say I always make sure there’s a couple cents extra then what the actual price was, so that I positively don’t underpay. Anyway, each time I’ve gone and had this interaction with the sonic lady she looks super pissed and I when I say thank you she just walks away. Am I an asshole for paying in change? I’m debating whether to go right now because I’m afraid she’ll spit in my food or something. Contemplating just having some sleep for dinner to skip the whole thing, but 2 Jr breakfast burritos after a hot shower sounds really nice also. ",

      "description": "I work at a startup as a programmer. I'm a decent programmer, but my real interest has always been in the business side of the operation, so I've been trying to get promoted. Problem is, there's this woman at my job who's the around the same age as me (25), let's call her Jenny, and a far better programmer than me. I knew I couldn't beat her for a promotion with my programming skills, so I considered my other options. She's really shy and doesn't have that much social skills, but I've always been a pretty extroverted, social person, so I started a two-part strategy: 1) I found ways to become more productive and optimize work time, so I could get all my work done quickly and then have free time 2) with this free time, instead of going home, I used it to zuck up to my boss, becoming pretty good friends with him.\n\nJenny obviously caught onto this, but she couldn't do shit since she's shy and has bad social skills. Ultimately, I ended up getting the promotion. After this, she left me a note on my desk saying I 'played this unfairly' and that she's a much better programmer. \n\nI wrote her a note back pointing out the promotion was to a management role, not a programming role, and besides, befriending your boss isn't unfair at all. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "Backstory: lets just call him Jay, he’s been a very close friend since early in highschool and we are both 20 now. Jay has never been great with girls and has alot of trouble putting himself out there due largely in part to lack of confidence. He also is lacking direction in life and seems lost(which is not necessarily a huge problem now but can become one in the near future)\n\nI hang out with jay on a near daily basis, and not to act like i know everything or I’m some kind of social genius, but its very easy to see where he goes wrong. He puts very little effort into presenting himself well (dresses poorly and somewhat poor hygiene. He also is very lazy and unmotivated, smokes weed very often and drinks often. His physical fitness has also tapered off and he’s looking rather fatherly at a young age. \n\nNow i get it, who am i to judge his decisions and lifestyle?\n\nWell heres the catch, jay complains very often about how he hasnt had sex in a very long time and has a mostly negative outlook on most aspects of his life. Ive tried to give friendly encouragement for him to possibly present himself differently to people (girls in specific) if what hes doing is currently not working. He is generally bad at recieving constructive criticism and advice, and usually reverts to “i dont want to have to change myself to impress someone” yet he constantly complains and directs his negativity about the situation to his friends. \n\nI think jay is a really great guy and has so much to offer, hes a very knowledgeable and interesting guy. Also very generous and loyal. I want my friend to be happy and find someone thats good for him but at the rate hes going he CONSTANTLY gets ghosted by girls and this does nothing but worsen his mental state. \n\nMy main problem here is trying to find a nice way to tell him that he needs to rethink alot of things in his life. I think the only way to get through to him is to tell him the hard truth: he needs to dress better, take better care of himself, and learn social cues from girls better, although i am certain he will take offence to this\n\nPersonally i dont think its about “changing himself to impress people” because his personality is great and i wouldnt suggest him to change anything about that, but its certain lifestyle choices that are clearly holding him back from being confident and successful in the social sphere. \n\nI feel like by not telling him these things his confidence will never improve and he will continue a downwards spiral to isolation\n\nSo, AITA???",

      "description": "So a classmate of mine asked me if she could log into my phone's messenger quickly so she can send some messages to her parents. But she forgot how to log out. I was casually browsing internet when I found out that she forgot to log out. I was intrigued and curious, so I read some convo with her friend, who **was** dating my boyfriend today. Turns out she was talking trash about me and my boyfriend. Her friend, mainly talked shit about her ex-bf but I got dragged into the convo, saying I was \"ugly\" and phrases like \"why would she replace me with that kind of girl?\" \n\nI was very disappointed in both me and that classmate of me. I thought we're chill and cool because we often talk and laugh about things, I actually considered her as a close friend. \n\nAnd then she found out I read their private conversation and of course, she was angry at me. I couldn't say anything because at first hand, it was my fault. But if I haven't read their conversation, would they stop on talking trash about me? \n\nLater on that day, they also apologized via chat. But they didn't stop. I already apologized and owned up to my mistake. But they didn't stop on nitpicking me. They were continuously posting some shady stuff about me. Even right after her friend apologized to me, she posted some nasty stuff that was obviously directed to me. So I tried to confront her about what she was saying against me and she only said \"It's my account and I can post whatever I like to post. I think it's only fair.\" \n\nI stopped talking to the two of them, for the benefit of my mind and myself. But nowadays, they still can't get over the fact that her ex left her and dated me months after they broke up. They are always trying hard to act like everything's fine. They still continue to post shady things from time to time, when they get the chance. They're trying to start ~~fake~~ nice conversation with me, but I don't want to be involved with them anymore. \n\nTL;DR: I read a private conversation of a classmate of mine. Found out they were talking shit about me and my bf. I apologized, they also apologized. But they didn't stop on posting some shady stuff that was obviously directed to me. Stopped talking to them.",

      "description": "So I have this friend (code name: Sam) who I met on the first day of 10th grade (American high school) and we didn’t really hit it off originally. Since we were sitting next to each other we talked about our majors (this high school has majors). We were both arts majors so we liked to draw. I had a more semi realistic style and she had a more simplistic style like Charlie Brown. (This is important for later on) \nI had only thought of Sam as a classmate I got along with at that moment so I didn’t really think of her as a friend, more like an acquaintance. \nI’m not very social and I don’t talk as much with people unless I am needed to or I trust the heck out of them so that if I say something rude or bad I can trust them to call me out on it. \n\nSam wasn’t really on top of all her assignments so she didn’t really do a good job in the classes we had together. A pet peeve I had was when she always asked for help. At first I gladly helped her, but then when i kept helping her I felt like I was doing a step by step process for her projects as if I was doing the project for her. At some points she would ask for the answers instead. I tried so hard to multitask by helping her and doing my own work. I was exhausted. Also when I tried to break free from her to try to work on my own she would  be like “ugh fine..” In a rude tone. From then on I would tell her to ask the teacher because I just couldn’t deal with her any more. (Note: when in group projects usually our group did all the work while Sam just drew her characters  or looked up images and memes of cartoons she liked.)\n\nI never realized how rude she was. She would sometimes say she didn’t like my art because it was too realistic and that I should draw more cartoony. Other times she would threaten me with friendship whenever I said I didn’t want to do something or just work by myself instead of a group during projects. It would probably go like this. \n\nSam: do you wanna group up? \nMe: uh I think I just want to work alone on this. Sorry. \nSam: I thought we were friends. I thought we could work together... \n\nI hated when she did that because it felt like she was trying to manipulate me. Whenever I was around her,I felt like my energy was being drained. \n\nI once tried to confront her on this but she denied it and kept saying, “aren’t we friends? Why would you think I would do that?”\nThen I said she was doing it again In a slightly angrier tone but she panicked and told me to keep it down as we were in class and she didn’t want people to hear. I just shut my mouth and walked away back to my desk. \n After that she keep talking to me as a if nothing happened.\n\nNow to the assy part. My birthday was coming up and I didn’t want Sam to find out or else they would probably ask why I didn’t invite them to a party. I didn’t have a birthday party in 2 years because I was self conscious about having people come over to my house. I’m a very boring person so I don’t really know how normal teens have fun.\nI only invited people I felt I could trust with my heart in their hand. I don’t really feel comfortable telling Sam about the party. AITA for not telling Sam it was my birthday and inviting her? \nAm I an ass for thinking she’s annoying and wanting to avoid her?\n",

      "description": "Basically the title. I’ve been on like 10-11 dates with this girl, and on the 4th or so date I mentioned that one pet peeve of mine when texting is when the other person falls asleep without saying goodnight, as it makes me worry. She expressed that hearing that made her feel bad, and said she’d try not to do it again. Since then, probably over 80% of days she still seems to fall asleep without saying goodnight. It’s not really a thing I can empathize with, as I never get so tired that I fall asleep while texting someone. I was curious about any thoughts you might have regarding whether this is normal or not.\n\nIt kind of makes me more disappointed because she expressed that she’d try than if she hadn’t said anything at all. It’s not a dealbreaker for me necessarily, I’m just wondering whether I should be more understanding and just get over a small quirk like this, or whether I should view this as lack of follow through. I really like her a lot in basically every other way.",

My girlfriend is amazing at saving money, and this year for black friday we went out and she picked out a new laptop and got a new phone. After she was done she turned to me and said, \"Okay, now let's go grab you a computer and get out of here.\" And I had no idea she was planning this. We walked over to where they were and the only one then had was 1690 dollars and we both agreed it was too much, so we payed for her stuff and left. \n\nThe real problem was when we got home. She found a nice computer for 600 online and started to buy it. I told her no and that it was too expensive and she shouldn't spend that much money on me, especially when I havent really done much for it. She insists that she really wants to do this for me. We go back and forth for a while and it culminates in her yelling at me that I'm too difficult. And shes been upset with me since.\n\nI truly feel like I dont deserve the new computer. It isint that I didnt appreciate the gesture, but she worked really hard to save that money herself, and I would just feel guilty for accepting it.\n\nSo what do you think reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "My wife and I have been married for 12 years. About a year and a half ago I suggested buying a home. I sat her down and explicitly asked to make sure that she was cool with buying a home together. She said that she thought it was a good idea.\n\nShortly afterwards she left her laptop open on the couch and I happened to see messages in which she was talking to her friends about leaving me. I read the conversations and found that she had been putting a plan together to leave at the very time we were negotiating for a home. I confronted her about the messages and she said that she was just feeling overwhelmed, that she loves me and doesn't actually want to leave me.\n\nI started spying on her: reading her messages with friends, inspecting her browser history. I observed her \"lie\" to me on several more occasions. She had developed an infatuation with a coworker and was considering leaving me for them. Two of her lady friends (one of which I have been friends with myself for ten years) expressed excitement about her crush and wanted to more details - who he was, how they were flirting, what she was going to do next. I was angry that they never considered my marriage or my welfare despite also being my friends.\n\nAbout that time, my wife had become increasingly despondent. I was concerned for her wellbeing and thought that there might be a serious mental illness going. My goal became to get her to see a psychiatrist. She consented with my helping her in doing so. Information I gained through spying helped me avoid triggering episodes while we found her help.\n\nOnce she had the support of a psychiatrist, I revealed that I had been spying on her and that I knew about her crush. She was horrified that I had spied on her and she asserted that her crush meant nothing.\n\nThe same friends attacked me for violating my wife's privacy. I explained that once my partner had broken our trust, I needed to know whether my partner was telling the truth. There were situations where, had I not, I would have been some catastrophic life decisions (buying a home, having children, moving, etc). The ten year friend even suggested that I was a psychopath for thinking that spying is \"ok\". I don't think spying is \"ok\", but I feel like I was forced to spy by my partner's irresponsible behavior. I have guilt, so clearly I'm not a psychopath.\n\nI broke off those friendships. My wife is on medication and has been diagnosed with some serious mental health issues. I'm not sure where we'll land land in our relationship, but I want to support her as she gets well.\n\nI have been trying to be responsible for myself. I'm seeing a therapist. I am sad and angry, but they don't think that I am crazy or broken.\n\nI feel like I did what I had to do to survive and to get my wife the help she needs. The beating I got from our friends infuriates me. My wife continues her friendship with these people and every time they come up I feel rage. Do you think I am the asshole for spying?",

      "title": "AITA for giving my sister a copy of my favorite book?",
      "description": "My sister is about to turn 15, a freshman in high school and, according to my mother, very immature. My sister has probably always been a bit behind her peers maturity-wise. She played make-believe games up into middle school and recently left a sleepover because she was so embarrassed by a kissing scene in one of the Harry Potter movies (the one where Harry and Hermione appear topless but no nudity is shown and the whole thing is very blurry).\n\nMy mom has always encouraged this behavior. The only friends she let my sister have over were her age and just as immature or, in most cases, several years younger. She was NEVER allowed to have older people over. After the Harry Potter incident, my mom called her friend’s mom to scold her, and forbade my sister from being friends with that girl. I 100% blame my mother for my sister’s immaturity and social awkwardness (she has almost no friends and my mom making her cut off the ones she does have isn’t helping).\n\nWhen I was my sister’s age, I read Jack Kerouac’s On the Road and found it very moving. It inspired in me a sense of freedom and a desire to escape from the overbearing clutches of my mother. Since I’ll be out of town for my sister’s birthday, I decided to give her a copy of the book as an early birthday present, hoping it would do for her what it did for me.\n\nMy plan did not work. My sister didn’t get the book at all and was so upset by it that she went crying to my mom. I was surprised she had such a strong reaction to it. I was an immature kid when I read it too and was scandalized by a few aspects of it, but still found it quite touching and enjoyed having a “secret” from my mom. My sister is also a very strong reader. My mother is now furious at me and threatening to let me have almost no contact with my sister.\n\nI’m obviously extremely disappointed in my mother. I’m also somewhat disappointed in my sister. I clearly overestimated her maturity, and I wish she could have been more normal about this situation. She didn’t have to like the book, but I wish she would have just gone to me if she was upset by it. Then again, I guess our mom has always been her only form of support. I love both of them, but I’m fairly certain their relationship is unhealthy. I don’t know if this matters, but I am 19.",

      "description": "So, I've been in a relationship with my man for 18 years (10 dating, 8 married). Ever since we became serious, my in-laws have constantly showered me with gifts.  And gifts. And gifts.  He is an only child and would tell me its just because his mom always wanted a daughter but the sheer amount of gift giving was just insane.  I would regularly leave her house after visits with bags of brand new clothes/doo dads/food/etc I would never use. The holidays were the worst: they can't give one bottle of perfume - they give 3.  Not one sweater - but four.  Bags and bags of just \"stuff\" I would never use. \n\nHis family are Filipino immigrants and I always chalked it up to cultural differences but then I started noticing that my MIL has a severe shopping amd hoarding problem.  I feel like the immense amount of gifts is really just a symptom of a larger problem. \n\nI've now given them a grandchild and its bags and bags of toys for him.  EVERY VISIT. I specifically requested a limit of 3 or 4 toys last Christmas explaining that we live in a small apartment, and that other people wanted to get him gifts too and we just couldn't handle too many things. My house is VERY minimalist and I like it that way. They literally showed up with 6 shopping bags full of toys and laughed us off when I reminded them of our limit.  It felt so disrespectful. \n\nMIL is very involved with the local Filipino Retiree social association. They throw parties literally every weekend and will use any excuse for it. And these aren't like \"dinner parties\" or anything like that.  These are full on \"DJ playing Macarena while we eat bad chicken at thr \"fancy\" ballroom at the local La Quinta off Route 34\" with full on themes (Pink only today! 80s night! Crazy hair night! Etc etc) and gift bags and so on and so forth.  Every. Weekend.  \n\n I'm now pregnant with #2 and MIL is chewing at my heels to throw me a baby shower.  She has already basically admitted to my husband that this shower is for \"her friends\"  meaning the Filipina biddies of her senior group. \n\nFirst of all, I don't really need anything.  Secondly she lives far from MY friends and family.  Thirdly I'm not into a \"sprinkle\" when my friends already helped me out with kid #1 at my first baby shower.  Fourthly what she would throw is NOT my scene and Finally she has basically already admitted it would be for HER friends. Its not even really for me I feel like, just another excuse to throw a party.\n\nIf she wanted to do a little dinner party and have family or something I would be down for that but I absolutely know what she has in mind; an insane and massively unnecessary baby shower.  That I'm sure she would also buy me a dress for. \n\nThe family is so supportive and we appreciate all they have done for us but at a certain point I find their generosity very self-serving.  Am justified in this reaction or am I the ungrateful asshole? \n",

      "description": "So this happened not too long ago, about 3 or 4 days. Me and my friend, let's call him Doug, wanted to play some PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Duo's. He told me to hop in the discord server so we could communicate with comms and play some dumb stuff on fredboat. We hopped in to a game and I was asking him to talk in discord and he responded with hisses, like really loud hisses which hurt my ear a bit. The match went on and he wouldn't answer my questions with a single word. He just kept hissing as a \"response\" to my questions for about 2 - 3 games.\n\nNow this isn't Doug's first time doing this sort of behavior when we play games, it usually happens when he's memeing in Rainbow Six, and other games. He would talk normally, he's fine in the head. We're good friends for about quite some time, years in fact. But to me I just clicked during the 3rd game and told him.\"Alright, I'm done, I'm tired of your shit it's quarter past midnight and I'm stuck with someone who's hissing to talk.\" And I just turned off my PC and went to bed. The day after the incident I noticed that Doug has blocked me on Steam, Ubisoft, Discord, etc. So I'm quite flustered as to why he would do such a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould really like your guys' feedback on this, I would really appreciate it",

However, tonight after I had clocked out, I had changed clothes and was hanging out in the lobby. My third shift auditor asked me something about a reservation I made and I stepped behind the desk to look at it and answer her question. I then went and sat down on the couch and started playing on my phone. I also had a blanket wrapped around my shoulders because I was very cold lol. \n\nA guest who had been walking out of the elevators saw me walk away from the desk and sit down. My coworker had a phone call, and so instead of waiting for her to finish at the desk he walked up to me and asked me to go get him some plates and silverware from the restaurant. I just looked at him for a second cause work was rough and I was a little out of it. I said as politely as I could, “I’m sorry, I’m not actually on the clock right now, (coworker) will be happy to help you when she finishes up”. He made a really disgusted face at me and kind of scoffed a little bit before walking over to the desk.\n\n AITA? I’m really tired and I didn’t want to walk all the kitchen. Plus, I’m in full street clothes, jacket and leggings and sneakers, nothing like my formal work uniform, with a blanket on me. I felt bad about it afterwards. ",

      "description": "Hello all. For context, I'm 22/M, SO is 24/F.\n\nTowards the start of our relationship, I had a political disagreement with my SO and her friends. It's about feminism. Basically, I'm pretty progressive on this front (eg. don't just believe that the tampon tax should be abolished, but believe it should be subsidized; encourage female-only STEM scholarships despite it negatively affecting my funding and chances at career progression, you get my drift), but I do not want to label myself a feminist because I reject a lot of the mainstream ideas, eg. \"The Patriarchy\" and #MeToo, and I actually think that feminism's distinct lack of nuance on the gender debate actively hurts men from unprivileged backgrounds. SO and friends are \"smash the patriarchy\", \"all of men's problems are just unforeseen side-effects of their privilege\"-style feminists. There, that's the background context, hopefully you aren't already judging me/them based on that difference of opinion, my question on assholery is specifically about the next bit.\n\nSo, SO and I have had a short heated conversation about it - we didn't really get the chance to go in detail at the time, so she really didn't understand my views (we have done that since and she's okay with them). A few days later, I'm meeting a bunch of her friends for the first time. It's a dinner party, we came over and I cooked entrees, it was pretty nice until one of her friends suddenly brings up feminism and says something to the tune of \"but OP isn't a feminist - right?\". Suddenly, it turns in to what feels like a pile-on from my point of view. I can't really get a word in edgeways against five people, anything I do say gets ignored, this surprise attack has left me unprepared and I'm not getting my views across properly, just arguing about the legitimacy of studies they're quoting or the wage gap etc. \n\nIt feels like playground bullying tactics - one of them says (referencing a previous conversation) \"you like Star Wars right? But not every part? So then why do you call yourself a Star Wars fan but not a feminist?\" and the crowd goes \"OOOOHHHH\", then swiftly moving on before I can explain the difference between being calling myself a fan of something and aligning with a political movement. I get asked why I'm a woman hater (???), and again other questions are coming my way before I can think of a good response. I'm in an unfamiliar house, meeting a group of people for the first time, and they're ganging up on me unprovoked. This goes on for 20-30 minutes.\n\nEventually, the conversation dies because a few of them have to leave, it's just me, SO, flat owner and her SO left. We go out to the pub, SO can tell I'm feeling pretty shitty, then goes away and comes back proudly proclaiming that she's asked her friend to not talk to me about feminism again because it's clearly upsetting me. Frankly, this makes me somewhat more pissed, but I haven't said anything about that yet.\n\nNow - am I justified in not wanting to see these people again? I expressed this to my SO, and she said that they were really important to her and would like me to give them another chance, blamed it on one particular member of the group being a bad influence but tbh I don't see how 24 year olds can use the \"bad influence\" excuse any more. I think they probably did just see me as a woman hater, and saw this as a victory over the patriarchy or something, or at the very least are completely oblivious to the situation they put me in because they've all themselves lived lives of utter privilege (privately educated group, all of them). AITA if I refuse to spend any more time with these people? ",

      "description": "A few months ago my ex (she broke up with me) asked if there's a chance that we could start seeing each other again. I agreed, and first time we've seen each other we talked about how would that relationship look. She said she just wanted to date for some time, without any big commitment, and see how things would work out. I asked if she's sure she woulnd't get bored/angry with me like the last time and what if there would appear someone else in her life. She said she's sure and that I'll be the first one to get to know if that happens. I said ok, let's try. \n\nSo after some time it started going pretty well, we've cuddled and even had sex, so I thought it could work out. But then she started to avoid seeing each other. I was pretty upset about this, as I knew something was wrong. So I've texted her (twice) to reassure that she wanted to continue this relationship. She responded that she just has a lot of work to do right now, and there's really no time. We've not seen each other for two months, and all that time I was still thinking about her, feeling bad that she didn't want to meet up (work wasn't really an excuse as we live really close each other).\n\nAter that two months I've texted her and noted that she was really indifferent towards me. She said that she knows that I'm upset by that she wanted to start seeing each other and then ignored me, still stating it was induced by having a lot of work. I knew it couldn't be just it, and as we were talking about the real reason she eventually admitted that she fell in love with someone else. I wasn't really shocked, not even angry. I felt relieved as I knew that it is definitive end of this relationship. What I was angry about is that she didn't tell me earlier. I've spent 2 months overthinking the situation, hoping that it's just temporary thing. I've confronted her about this and what she said is: 1. She's not in relationship with him, and 2. As we were not in real relationship too, she wasn't obligated to tell me, nor she wanted to. So we argued, I just said that she has no respect for others, she showed no remorse at all.\n\nSo AITA for confroting her about that she lied about the reason why didn't she want to see each other and that she didn't end the relationship earlier, especially that I've been asking her about its state?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Now theres 2 friends in this story. 1 well call Mary the other well call Lisa. Ive been friends with Mary for quite a while now and she just introduced me to her friend Lisa on tuesday. We never really talked or hung out before.\n\nNow for today. I was at home studying when Lisa texts me asking if I was at school. I texted no but i can come and she said alright meet me at the cafe. I asked where Mary was (as theyre rarely not together) and she said mary ditched her , followed by a bunch of jks. So i go to school and am there by 11:50. I walk into the cafe and i see Mary with her friends and decide while waiting for Lisa to answer where she is to sit next to them. Than i see Lisa come into the cafeteria with one of her friends and look at me. I signal her to come, thinking she knew Mary's other friends as well, to join us. She didnt respond. I felt bad , so i walked up to her and jokingly said \"hey, marys right there she didnt ditch you\" ( im running on 3 nights of no sleep from finals so im not thinking straight for reference ) as i thought she didnt know where Mary was or something. Than i go back to sitting down and text Lisa again \"come join us u look lost lol\" and she didnt answer. Finally , her and her friend left the cafe, and i asked mary \" hey, does Lisa actually talk to anyone else on this table \" and she responded with no. Thats when i knew maybe i should ve followed lisa. I text her one last time where shes at and she leaves me on read.\n\nAita for essentially ditching her? I thought she knew marys other friends and invited her to join us and even asked where she was to join her instead?",

(e.g. not watching porn for a while after I send it). It just feels insulting to me if he gets off to other girls after I went through the effort to give him something that makes me uncomfortable. I am not asking it forever or anything, but near the time I've sent him things. I'll trust him if he says he will not.\n\nNote: we've been together for many years and live far away.",

      "description": "I volunteer at the womans center at the university I attend, the other student is one of the paid (student) staff at the center\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am an ex sex worker - she knows this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDecember we discuses fund-raising, one of the fund-raisers was for a local shelter that deals with sex workers. She was very vocally against this saying \"we are supposed to be for women, not people like that, they know what they are getting into and deserve everything they get.\" One of the other volunteers spoke up about how often sex workers were assaulted, she said that she doesn't care and repeated that they knew what they were getting into, and that it took away from real assault victims like \\*\\*her\\*\\*. At this point I spoke up saying that I was feeling attacked as she just blamed me for my assault. She immediately back peddled and claimed that \"this is just my belief about \"those women\" and that she didn't mean \\*\\*me\\*\\*.nope, can't say sex worker and not mean me. She then said she has the right to her opinion, but I have to understand that she didn't mean it that way. She apologized for me \"taking her wrong\", it's BS and I'm not happy.During this meeting she also sais that she would never be able to give pro-choice info because its against her beliefs (not a religious belief, she's an atheist), she didn't know it but someone present had an abortion. She was reminded that in the mandate we are a pro-choice center and she can't try and bully people out of their decisions. She said once again that this is just her belief and that she should be allowed to have whatever belief she wants but she will just have to leave her beliefs at the door. As we were all leaving the school, she stops me in the main area and demands I forgive her and give her a hug in font of about 30 students, knowing that if I said no I would look like an asshole.\n\nI complained to the head of the center, but she is a student and doesn't have any control over anything. She brought it up to the school staff member that is in control of hiring and the budget, but so far nothing has been done about it.\n\nMy next step is to lodge a formal complaint against her. I been resistant in doing this because 1) I would have to come out as an ex-sex worker to more people and 2) I am a mature student in my 30's whereas she is in her early 20's and it kinda felt like complaining against a child\n\nShe has now applied to be head of the center and it looks like she'll get the job because sh'e manipulated the student union into backing her by saying we've discriminated against her by not allowing her beliefs (again not religious).\n\nI am very afraid that she is going to say something to someone who has been through those things when they have come for support. If was younger and still in sex work when she said that to me it would have devastated me and I probably would not feel safe at the school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill I be an asshole if I file a complaint against her?",

We get into the bar and see that the debit machines broke (classic now you need to pay the 3$ atm fee) I go to the atm across the bar because it was empty.  While getting my cash the same girl threw her body in front of the machine and tried hugging me I brushed her off and told her I wasn’t interested. \n\nFast forward about 30 minutes I ran into a girl who is in one of my classes but haven’t really talked to that much so I offer to buy her a drink.  At the bar ready to order the crazy girl comes back and asks if I’ll buy her one. Now I’m kinda getting annoyed with her and tell her to leave me alone as I’m trying to talk with the other girl. \n\nAnother 10 minutes goes by me and the girl from my class are dancing together and at this point I’m not even thinking of the crazy girl anymore until she comes up to me from behind and starts hugging me. Now I’m really pissed and without even thinking I turn around and tell her “I’m not even remotely attracted to you so fuck off” \n\nAfter that she never came back to me and I enjoyed the rest of my night. \n\n\nTLDR: girl kept on trying to hit on me/hug me at the bar so I told her I’m not remotely attracted to her.\n\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I realize this is such a stupid problem I have but I’m killing time atm and wanted to make my first post on this sub.\n\nBackground: my son wasn’t planned and so my bf first asked me to terminate. I told him that I would- under the condition that we break up afterward cause I knew I would resent him for his choice. He decided we should keep the baby and stay together. He wanted absolutely nothing to do with the pregnancy. He kept telling me how he wish he could just fall into a coma and never wake up. He didn’t want to see any sonograms. Didn’t want to touch my stomach. Didn’t want to talk about anything baby related until a month before he was born. Now that my son is born everything is great and our relationship improved drastically. My bf loves our son to pieces and is a great dad. \n\nNow the problem.\nWhen my son was born in India we didn’t have an English name for him yet. We needed a name for his birth certificate so I gave him an Indian name(I’m half Indian) and we decided we would put his English name down when we apply for his American/Australian citizenship. \n\nWe finally agreed on a name and we were onboard for Sterling. We have until our son is 18 to apply for either American or Australian citizenship so of course we’re in no rush so nothing is set in stone yet. NOW almost a year later bf wants to change the spelling to Stirling. I think that spelling is absolutely atrocious. I argue that it’s ugly, and I still have some resentment from him wanting to terminate our son in the first place.  He argues that I already got to choose his Indian name and Sterling was too common of a name (is it though?) \n\nI saw that he had a point. But every time I had to write down Stirling I physically cringe. I just don’t get how he’s okay with Sterling and suddenly switches to Stirling a year later. He’s stalling on the Australian citizenship paperwork so I figured I’d go and turn in his American citizenship first so I can solidify the spelling.\n\nMy family + friends think Stirling is ugly too and should just go ahead with my plan. So I need unbiased opinions from the Internet.\n\nTL;DR\nMy bf wants Stirling and I want Sterling. I think I have naming rights cause he wanted to abort the baby. He thinks he has naming rights cause I chose his middle name. WIBTA if I solidified the spelling by applying for his citizenship before my bf does?",

      "description": "I’ll try to keep this short and to the point.    \n\n\nI am the sole income for my family. I don’t like my job, am overweight and stressed the F out. I have a high income. I have recently been looking for other jobs with a more variable income and one job that I had initially dismissed made an interesting offer to me. Essentially, my interview went well enough that they stopped the interview and offered to fly me out whenever I wanted to meet with them and decide if I wanted to join the company. \n    \nI text this to my wife and she immediately wants me to call. I have no intention of working for this company but am legitimately flattered and excited that a company liked me enough to pay my airfare to fly me across the country. That’s a first for me. My wife asks, “isn’t this the job you said you wouldn’t take because of x, y, z?” First words out of her mouth. She then proceeds to basically say how bad of an idea it is. I get pissed and get off the phone as quickly as possible. \n\n   \nShe realizes that she made me mad and apologizes for making me mad but not for not being supportive. I’m not taking it anyway and I made that clear. I just wanted a pat on the back because I thought it was cool and some affirmation which I was needing.\n   \nBTW - her dream from day 1 has been to be a stay at home mom. When we got married I closed my company down and jumped in with a larger group because it was the responsible thing to do. When we had our first son and she wanted to quit I jumped jobs twice in 6 months and nearly wound up in the hospital because of the stress. A new position at work came up with more stress and more pay and I took that because I want to take care of our family. I have a history of putting the family first even though my dream is not to make a lot of money but to work on a winery or distillery. It really hurt me that she thought that she needed to tell me why this commission only job was a bad idea. I obviously know but just wanted her to be excited for me. She keeps saying that she trusts me to make good financial decisions but I feel like if that we true she wouldn’t feel the need to crap all over this job.\n\nI got home and we fought. “My opinion doesn’t matter and from now on I just  won’t say anything.” \n\nSo, as I go to bed in another room tonight, AITA for valuing her opinion but hating her timing? She is always like this when I bring something new that might be the least bit controversial. ",

      "description": "Buckle up, I have no idea if this will make sense at all so bear with me.   \n\n\nContext: I'm 25F and so is my friend, I'll call her M for simplicity. We were best friends in high school but immediately after graduation we lost touch despite going to different colleges in the same city. This was due, for me at least, to the fact that our friend group had a lot of toxic drama that I was honestly happy to get away from after graduation and because college was my first real time of liberation where I spent 4 years exploring the world outside of our tiny high school and making friends with people from different countries and viewpoints. M and I started hanging out again and maintaining regular contact in our senior years, about 4 years ago now.   \n\n\nFor all 4 years of high school and for the first 2 years of college, I had a boyfriend who I'll call T. T was 2 years older than us but was integrated into our friend group. It took me a while to realize this, but T was extremely emotionally abusive to me. I could go on forever about the things he did, but to avoid writing a novel I'll just say that he performed textbook emotional abuse on me (and one time even physical as he thought it would absolutely hilarious to shoot me point blank with a BB gun and then laugh when I cried) that took me years to unlearn. Even today, there are times where the things he said and did to me impact my very happy, healthy relationship. He made my life an absolute hell before, during, and after our breakup and that shit stays with you even when you don't want it to sometimes, especially when you listened to someone consistently insult and degrade you during your most formative years.   \n\n\nNow, the issue: ever since \"reuniting\" with M, it has been made clear to me that she has maintained a friendship with T. At first, I didn't think that she was aware of the shit he did to me so I approached her (this was about 3 or 4 years ago now) and let her know that he abused me and suggested that I was really uncomfortable with her being friends with him.  She, along with some other friends of ours, agreed that he's just generally a really unpleasant person to be around and was horrified by some of the things he did to me so I figured that was that.   \n\n\nExcept, it wasn't. Periodically through the past 4 years I would hear through the grape vine about the fact that she was still maintaining a friendship with T and would talk to him in a group chat, invite him to outings and parties, etc. I would also hear about how he still bemoans our relationship and refers to me exclusively as \"bitch face\" when he is not spreading vicious rumors about me, 5 years later. Each time I would again approach her and express my discomfort and reiterate what he did to me and each time I was met with \"well, I feel bad for him because he doesn't have anything else going on in his life.\" And it's like, ....! Maybe he doesn't have anything going on in his life because he is just an unpleasant person!!! But I digress.  \n\n\nIn the past year/year and a half, I had barely heard of him until recently. I live across the country currently but informed M that I would be coming home for 2 weeks and asked to hang out. She told me that she was busy. I then found out that in fact she would be busy because she had invited T and some other friends to her apartment. This is when I started to get upset for real. I calmly approached her again and explained that I just feel extremely hurt and insignificant because I have continually expressed to her my discomfort over her relationship with T and she has repeatedly disregarded my feelings on the matter and then went and invited him to her place over me. She then turned it back on me, explaining that she was uncomfortable with me asking her to end her friendship with T because T reached out to her in college while I didn't. From there the conversation devolved into her telling me that she's an adult and can choose to be friends with whomever she chooses (true) as long as she's not hurting anyone (true) and that things are only this way because I did not speak to her for most of college (I did not speak to any of my high school friends for most of college, and none of them hold this against me because they understand that life happens) and because about 2 years ago I approached her with some concerns about her relationship with her current boyfriend (which she immediately corrected &amp; I accepted).   \n\n\nI understand that I have no control over who she chooses to be friends with. But she is making me out to be a horrible person because I have decided that for myself, personally, I cannot be friends with someone who maintains a relationship with my abuser -- however infrequent -- and then justifies that relationship to me by saying that it's all because he reached out in my absence. It is especially baffling to me because M is ultra-feminist to the point where she literally studies feminism for her doctorate so I just have a hard time understanding her desire to be friends with him in the first place. But I accept that if that's her decision, so be it, but for my own sanity I can't be friends with someone like that.   \n\n\nReddit, AITA?   \n\n\nTLDR: My friend from high school is still friends with my emotionally abusive ex boyfriend. I expressed that I can't be friends with someone who intentionally maintains a relationship with him and ignores my discomfort over the matter. Friend turns it back on me, saying that I'm being controlling, unhealthy, and insufferable and that her friendship to him is justified because ex-bf maintained contact with her during college whereas I did not.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for demanding one of the two garage spots in the house that I pay the same amount of rent for as my two roommates who have parked there for the past 3 years?",
      "description": "I live in a house with three roommates and a two-car garage. We all pay the same amount of rent. Two of my roommates are a couple and have lived here since before I moved in. We will call them S and K. There are 4 cars to the household: S's, K's and my two cars (one of which is a convertible that I am selling and have moved to the suburbs to keep it off the city streets as registration has expired.) S &amp; K have been parking in the garage for the past 3 years/since I signed the lease. I have parked both of my cars on the street for the past 3 years.\n\nWhen I first moved in, I asked S about the garage parking deal. He replied that he and K paid extra for those spots. Well I had just recently discovered that they have never paid any extra monthly cost for those spots. If anything, they paid for two garage door openers at $30 each.\n\nLast week, while they were on vacation, I asked if I can park in the garage while they were gone. I now realize how fucking  amazing it is to have a garage spot in the city of Chicago especially in the dead of winter when it's about to be -20/-50 windchill for the next two days and snow all over the ground where street parking is extremely limited as the Chicago tradition of \"dibs\" lives on with vigor.\n\nAfter they got back, K asked me to move my car from the garage so she can park. Instead of moving my car, I asked if they would be willing to share the garage with me seeing as we all pay the same amount of rent. K told me that S needs his spot because all his heavy and expensive work equipment stays in his car. She then asked that she and S have a couple of days to discuss their options. I said sure and agreed to allow her to park while I was away at work the next day and overnight. A few hours later she asked for my work schedule, obviously with the intent of sharing her garage spot with me. I gave her my schedule.\n\nWhile I was at work the next day, I texted  her my schedule as requested (I realize I probably shouldn't have). She also said she would need the opener back as my suggestion of her sharing boyfriend's (S) would not work because she and he have different schedules. She also said that I would have to purchase a third garage door opener from the landlord. I said we can discuss the garage deal when I get home from work the next day.\n\nA lil about our schedules:\n I am a bartender who works late nights and usually stays at my boyfriend's until the next day after my late shift. She currently works from home along with S except for the times when he travels for the day or sometimes week. Sometimes for a day a week, a few days a week or for a whole week. But despite all of our schedules, I think it is my turn to have a garage spot for me and only me as long as I am in town. I am willing to let her park while I am gone but for her to move her car everytime I get back seems all so unrealistic to me.\n\nWell, I am home now and parking on the street while her car is still in the garage. I was hoping to have our discussion but she was busy on the phone and working from home. Then suddenly they were due to leave to go to a friend's house for a few hours. As much as I would love to park my car in one of their spots, I think that would be very rude as we had not had our discussion yet.\n\nJust as they were ready to leave, she asked if I had the garage door opener. I said yes but I would like to have a discussion with her about it when they get back. I realize I should have just given her the garage door opener seeing as she had paid $30 for it. But my instincts told me to hold onto it until we have our discussion. I'm pretty much holding it as collateral and I'm sure she knows this.\n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nI can see me being an asshole by not giving her back the garage door opener yet but I am willing to give her $30 for it as I intend to park in the garage for at least the next year. In fact, they claim they may move out in 4 months so it'll only be for that time that she will no longer be able to park her car in the garage. More so, I want to request that parking spot is for me and that we do not share it as she had it for the past three years.\n\nI feel like it was inconsiderate of them to not even give me the option to park in the garage since I have been living here. That it is inconsiderate of them while I walk a block or two home by myself with a knife and mace gripped tightly at 3 in the morning on some nights that I get off work from the bar. There are a lot of rapes and muggings in Chicago at night. Inconsiderate that I have to move both of my cars for street cleaning which I've received several hundreds of dollars in parking tickets for since living here (my fault, I know.) I feel they are being selfish. There was a time I had to jump start my car to move my out of the garage so one of them can park after they got back from a previous vacation. In fact, they never even offered for me to park my car while they were gone, not once until I asked. It seems they feel entitled to both spots because I don't know, it was theirs before I moved in? Becuase they are a couple/team? Becuase they paid $30 for each garage door opener? Are they entitled?\n \nI strive to be a generous and selfless person but I think sometimes this causes me to sell myself short as others walk all over me. \n\nThere's no way I'm the asshole... right, guys?",

      "title": "AITA for storming out of a family gathering because I'm tired of being used as tech support?",
      "description": "This post may be a bit long as the issue was the culmination of years of behavior that all came to a head the other night.\n\n**The Background**\n\nAt a very young age (about 8 or 9) I was already more tech savvy than anybody else in my family.  Shortly after this \"gift\" was discovered I became the go to person when anything computer related would have issues.  Now when I was a kid in the 90s and there were only a few computers between all my extended family this meant the occasional reboot, antivirus sweep, or OS reinstall a few times a year.  No big deal.  I was happy to help my family, and I was building a skillset that would land me a career in IT that I happen to enjoy very much.\n\nThe problems started about 8-10 years ago as more and more members of the family started getting computers, internet connections, and game consoles in all their homes.  Suddenly the standard greeting for my family was \"where is OP?  we've got some things we need him to look at while he's here.\"  So instead of joining in on the fun I would have a laptop, xbox, and a couple phones thrust into my arms as they went back into the other room to have fun.  As shitty as that sounds at that time in my life I still enjoyed learning about the tech and was still happy to help.  Just a bit less happy than before now that I was missing out on more of our family functions.\n\nSoon after this pattern began a few of my relatives started giving out my contact info to their friends and neighbors whenever they'd complain about some technical issue.  So I start getting texts and phonecalls several times a week from people who want me to drive out to their house and fix their stuff.  After a few times I actually started quoting rates for my services.  This caused some drama with a few of my relatives who claimed they were ashamed and embarrassed that I would dare try and charge for my time when all I did was \"hit a couple buttons and bam it works!\"  My response of \"if it is so easy then why don't you guys go do it?\" was met with silence for several weeks.\n\nAfter this I started to distance myself from these family gatherings and pushing back a bit on the tech support front by telling them they need to take it to a shop or something for more complicated issues.  This mean I would only be doing a few quick fixes and then I would join in on the party for the gatherings I chose to attend.  Sadly this was a temporary improvement as a few of my pushier relatives (the drama queens from the previous paragraph especially) demanded I take a closer look and \"stop being so lazy\" because they didn't want to pay a shop to look at their issues.  This was about 2 years ago and I simply told my parents I'd be going home and will no longer be coming to family events.  My father wasn't happy about it, but he seemed to understand and accepted my reasons.\n\n**On to the potential asshole event** \n\nFast forward to this weekend and my father is hounding me to go to an event at my grandfather's house.  It is my uncle's birthday and he specifically was asking if I'd be able to attend.  I was hesitant as I didn't want to deal with the drama from other attendees when I suddenly \"reappeared\" after 2 years.  Eventually they wore me down and I agreed to attend on the condition that I not be turned back into tech support for the day and simply left to enjoy the time with my family.  They both enthusiastically agreed so I went.\n\nHonestly the start of the party was great.  I got to see family that I had only briefly seen in the last 2 years, and I got to hang out with my grandfather and uncle both of whom are my favorite relatives to hang out with at these things.  I even got my uncle a couple bottles of his favorite beer that is pretty hard to find so he was pretty excited about that.\n\nUnfortunately this all came crashing down later in the evening when one of my drama queen aunt's was in a nearby room with my grandmother and a few of my female cousins.  I overheard the following said loudly enough that I know she knew I'd hear it.  \"Sure is a shame OP thinks he's too good to help his family with their computers now that he's a big shot IT nerd huh?  I brought my laptop just in case he decided to be an adult about this, but (my dad's name) said to just leave it in the car since he won't fix it.\"  (I know this isn't word for word since I lost some of it in my moment of rage, but it is pretty close I am fairly sure to what was said.  \"IT nerd\" was definitely used as that moment is burned into my memory now.)\n\nFull transparency here.  I lost my cool.  I know I should have just walked away, but I was seeing red here.  I stormed into the room and basically whisper yelled at her.  The basic breakdown because I only clearly remember the very end of my outburst here.\n\n\"I was this family's tech support bitch for almost a fucking decade.  It was fun when I was a kid, but after a few years of not getting to spend time with my family because you are too fucking dumb to take care of  your devices I was sick of it.  I was sick of you giving random people my number thinking I would spend my limited free time fixing their shit too.  I came out to spend time with (Uncle, and Grandfather) not to spend that time sitting in the garage working on your piece of shit laptop.  (Aunt) you are a massive entitled cunt, and I hope I never have to see your disgusting face ever again.\"  I then grabbed my things and went home ignoring the barrage of texts and calls I received for a few hours following my exit.\n\nThe aftermath is that though most of my family can sympathize with how I have been treated, and even got some apologies for past behavior...a good chunk of my family including my grandfather say I should apologize for the outburst even if I was in \"the right\" on it.  I disagree, but I am not really upset at them for thinking that.  I've been accused a few times of ruining my uncle's birthday which I apologized to him for.  And he seemed to accept the apology and still wants to hang out with me outside of family things so I am happy to hear that.\n\nProblem is I can't help this nagging feeling that I was way out of line for going off on her.  Like I know her behavior was shitty, but was my response a few steps too far?  Should I have just said a few quick goodbyes and gotten the hell out of there instead?  I honestly don't know now.",

      "description": "So I guess the title is pretty much self explanatory.  There's a girl I've known for about a year. We've been on and off flirting or in love for most of the time. Anyway, I think we were \"on\", we had a pretty emotionally intimate few weeks, and we've been talking and cuddling a fair bit. It's common knowledge that she has strong feelings for me, but I'm more on the fence. Sunday we hung out, and I realized I didn't like her company. Something about her, and what she was talking about just annoyed me.\n\nWe said goodbye, and when I got home I basically wrote her a message basically saying I need space indefinitely and that if she sees me I don't want to talk to her. I said I had some issues to soften the blow, since I basically told her, and intended to mean that I don't really ever want to talk to her again, even though I'm doing great. \n\nI also made no secret of that I was still gonna be hanging out with basically everyone else I know, and that I'd be going to the same places me and her usually go to. I lied to get her off my back, since just saying \"piss off, leave me alone\" would be pretty rude, even if that was basically my whole point. \n\nI said I'd talk to her when the \"issues\" were resolved, but tbh I don't enjoy her company anymore, and I'm probably not gonna talk to her ever again, especially since I'm busy with work, and just went on my first date with another girl today.\n\nAm I the asshole for lying so she would leave me alone without any discussion, so I could focus on another girl I like, work and because she's starting to annoy me, and I don't want to speak to her anymore?",

      "title": "AITA for proposing to my girlfriend (now fiancee) with a ring I originally gave to my ex-fiancée?",
      "description": "I know from the title it sounds less than great but please read the whole post. \n\nLong story short, I was engaged to this girl like five years ago. In hindsight the engagement was impulsive and basically a last ditch effort to save the relationship. Predictably, things didn’t work out. She gave me back the ring. (She literally had the things for like two weeks and barely wore it). \n\nI initially planned to sell or pawn the ring. I don’t know why I didn’t. I just kept  postponing it and it never got done. \n\nFast forward to now. I have an amazing girl that I’m completely in love with. We talked a lot about marriage. The only issue is that I’m having to be a lot more careful with my money. She also wants to have a baby relatively soon so there’s that to consider. \n\nI decided that I already have a ring that’s basically in new condition. I still could have sold or pawned it. But my now-fiancée and I had talked about rings and stuff as well and this was really close to what she said she wanted. So I don’t know. I guess I romanticized it in my mind thinking “this is the girl that should have had it all along.”  Maybe that’s stupid, I don’t know. \n\nAnyway I proposed with it. What I didn’t realize was that my ex actually follows my fiancée on Instagram (why, I do not know!) and so she saw the ring. She, being the lovely person that she is, goes and DMs my fiancée to say that she thinks that’s the same engagement ring she got. \n\nMy fiancée confronts me all upset. I was honest and told her what happened. I immediately offered to buy another ring but she wasn’t having it. She even said she needs to think about whether she still wants to get married. That stung, as you can imagine, and I’m hoping (praying) she was just talking out of anger. \n\nHonestly, my ex moved like two states away after we broke up. I never expected them to get in contact with each other or I would never have put my fiancée in this position. Again, I love this woman to death.\n\nI mean, is this really the worst thing in the world? And bad enough to get possibly dumped over??",

      "title": "AITA for yelling at my aunt for telling my family I was in therapy?",
      "description": "I've been in therapy for a few months now for childhood trauma and have been keeping it pretty private (as in my sister, my parents, my best friend, and my boss are the only ones who know I'm in therapy.) I have a huge family that know about what I went through as a kid, but I'm not close with anyone in my extended family aside from my grandparents and a couple of cousins, all of whom I wouldn't tell about my counseling.\n\nI found out recently that my mother had confided in one of my aunts that I was in therapy. She said she needed to speak to someone for support and while I understand, I was pretty pissed at her that she told someone in my extended family that I make it a point not to talk to. We've talked it through and she understood why I was upset, apologized, and has gone out of her way to prove she won't talk to anyone else about it.\n\nUnfortunately, the aunt she told I was in therapy has decided to tell everyone in my family - I'm talking cousins, uncles, aunts, grandparents - the whole nine yards. Not only that, she's embellished a lot of details about me being bipolar and having the mentality of a 13 year old (I'm 21 and I'm being treated for PTSD and generalized anxiety).\n\nI found this out yesterday and, to put it lightly, I was boiling mad. I called my mom and asked her why she said all those things because I assumed that's where my aunt got the idea. According to my mom, all she said is that I was in therapy to deal with trauma. I believe her because we've already had this fight and she was genuinely sorry for telling anyone anything.\n\nI called my aunt right after. I know I should've taken the time to calm down, but I was fuming. I asked her what gave her the right to tell anyone my business and lie about my mental health. She said she was sorry and that she just wanted my family to be sensitive to me.\n\nI'll try to condense what I said but I essentially said this is why I don't talk to you and that my mental health is my business and I get to choose who knows what. I told her to call everyone and apologize for lying about me. She said she didn't mean to lie and I told her that was bullshit because she put more detail into the lie than if she had told everyone the truth.\n\nA couple of hours later I got a call from my grandparents saying I made her cry and I should apologize to her. I told them I wouldn't because she had been lying about a very private topic to me to the entire family. My grandparents said I was being immature and I said \"Well you all think I have the mentality of a 13 year old so what do you expect?\"\n\nNow I'm getting \"We love you\" messages from my family along with scripture quotes about two wrongs don't make a right and what not. I'm getting the sense that my extended family thinks I'm in the wrong but I don't think I was wrong for standing up for myself. \n\nAITA?",

I tried making the best of it, but again, I wasn’t comfortable in the whole situation all night. \n\nSo, here we are at almost another prom and she wants me to go with her again.

I told her I got it a few weeks ago but it just arrived like 30 mins ago off the truck. And for some reason she was super pissed, said that I should have told her about it first and we could have made the decision together and said I'm an asshole for not consulting her on a major purchase like this etc. We don't live together but we are talking about that and have been together for 2 years. She's been super pissed/annoyed at me for this and has called me a dick multiple times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?",

I still live with my parents but I’m planning to move out after saving up for my own place. Now since I still live with them, I pay my share of the bills which I think is fair. My parents have recently found out about the exact amount of my salary (I refused to tell them in the first place, I didn’t want them getting any ideas) and are now pushing me to pay my brother’s university tuition amounting to 45,000 php/sem + all the miscellaneous fees (side note: my monthly salary doesn’t even reach 30k). I refused because it’s my money and I told them my siblings aren’t my responsibility AND also planning to live on my own, so it’s been a whole week of endless fights and passive aggressive comments about how I’m not helping them with money problems, etc and now they said if I don’t pay for it, then I need to find a place of my own by mid-March. \n\n\nAITA?

      "title": "AITA for being triggered that my best friend still keeps in touch with someone who willingly ignores me and won't give my stuff back?",
      "description": "I've known my best friend (let's say Pablo) for almost 15 years. He, like myself, is a bit of an acquired taste as a friend. Hes a bit bullheaded and doesnt communicate well.\nAnd the offending party is a guy named (let's say Tony) who at the time I  knew for 2 years.\nI have trust issues with people because my last group of friends basically stabbed me in the back repeatedly without remorse, Stole a gf from behind my back and then made it impossible to stay friends.\n\nTony was originally my friend exclusively and I later introduced him to my group of friends. He was one of the first guys in our group to have his own place, needless to we hung out there a lot.\n\nWe became fast friends with a lot of common interests and later on I had no problem letting him borrow stuff like small amounts of money or reading material. I also drove him a lot of places for personal stuff because he didnt have a car and I just wanted to help him. (We bacame friends because I offered him a ride home so he wouldn't have to walk in 98° Fahrenheit weather in pants.)\n\nNear the end of the friendship Tony, Pablo and I are hanging out. We used to fuck with Pablo, jokingly,  because he was behind us in the pilot program (he started later so this is natural). But he switched to a fast track school and became an instructor before us. So we were having a discussion about some regulations or practices and Pablo points out that Tony was doing something incorrectly. But instead of being cool and double checking procedure, Tony flips out. Telling Pablo hes retarded and that he definitely doesnt know what hes talking about. I defend Pablo non aggressively by saying \"Hey man he just got the certificate saying that he KNOWS the material. Dont just write him off like that  let's check the procedures\". So we check and Tony was wrong and we kinda just sat there in silence for a few minutes before Pablo and I take our leave. Tony never apologized for speaking disrespectfully. But it was a single incident and we never brought it up again and continued to hang out. This should have been a man child red flag.\n\nNow I'm not a perfect human being and I have my own share of problems and I have my own growing to do. And when my home life got hard sometimes I would \"retreat\" to Tony's place away from my problems. I understand in hindsight that's fucked up for using his place as an escape. It could make him feel all sorts of things.  Like being used and not feeling like a friendship is real definitely count among them. I now see that.\n\nBut instead of being a real friend and trying to talk to me about my problems or addressing the issue with his place, the Tony ghosts me. \n\nI get that I might not be an easy friend to have, I'm an acquired taste. And if you dont want to be friends with me. That's cool and it's your choice who you want to be around. That doesnt make me mad. \nWhat made me mad was that he was holding on to a bunch of books that I loved. I tried to get in touch with him (texts, voicemail) to get my stuff back, all while apologizing for using him like that and seeking to make reparations. \n\nHe would never answer. \n\nThen i found out he is still regularly hanging out with Pablo.\nWhich is an entire other drama filled tale^^. But I digress.\nThis hurt me. Because not only did he ghost me but hes hanging out with my friends?! To whom I introduced him to no less.\n\nSo I ask Pablo to get my stuff back for me on several occasions to which he just glosses over and basically forgets my request. He doesnt like confrontation. Not that I considered it one because it was my stuff and I just wanted it back. This annoyed me but it wasnt sacrilegious in the name of friendship. So I just continued to ask him to recover my possessions. \n\n Let's establish here that my mom helped Pablo's mom a shitload in elementary school. From taking Pablo to school, feeding him and housing him when his mother went to Colombia regularly. Hes been a fixture in my life a very long time. My family loves Pablo like a son and I love him like a brother. \n\n2 years later I am now only just getting my stuff back, not even all of it, after repeatedly asking and now I find out that he STILL hangs out with this guy and his fiance. \n\nTo make this even saucier at some point Pablo needed to be loaned money. His well to do side of the family refused to loan him the money even though he is an exceptional student and he promised to pay it back. But instead of asking his other best friend James or Myself to help. He goes to scumbag Tony. Claimimg that it was because no one was meant to know.\n (he was ashamed I get it but hes been financially troubled his whole life so it wasnt like James and I didn't know he was constantly pinching pennies to live)\n\nSo quick summary thus far. Not only does he keep in touch with someone that intentionally doesnt care about me, he then gets a loan from the offending party that my parents definitely would have given to him no strings attached. This hurts my feelings\n\nSo when I talked to Pablo about how his friendship made me felt. He basically chalked it up to \"It's a problem between you guys, not me\"\nThat's what really hurt.\n I'm a loyal friend. If you don't like someone, I dont like them.\n If you someone messes with you. I'll jump at the enemies throat. \nNow I dont expect that from people but i do expect some consideration for my feelings. Especially from friends.\n\nNow i know as an adult i can't tell Pablo who to be friends with. Ofc that's wrong. But it does hurt my feelings that Pablo still regularly keeps in touch with him and took a loan from him when he has 2 best friends (James and I) that would do anything for him. \n\nThe only saving grace for Pablo right now is that he didnt invite Tony and his fiance to his bday party because he knew it would upset me if I was there and they showed up. \n\nAITA for wanting to confront him about this in a more direct way? I dont want to lose my friend because I know he will be difficult about it, hes very stubborn. But it eats me up that he hangs out with this guy. Especially when I have trust issues when it comes to friends. \n\nTLDR: AITA for being mad at my friend because he still keeps in touch with a guy that I introduced him to? Who then later ghosted me for personal issues between us and then wouldn't give any of my stuff back willingly.\n\nI might be feeling oversensitive but if I call you my friend I'm expecting mutual respect for one another and a bit of consideration about personal situations.\n\n",

My mom has had a couple of close calls in her life that were saved due to blood transfusions, and thus I get easily annoyed when people don't donate if they don't have medical, athletic, or religious excuses.  I try really hard to spread the word out in my school, so was irritated when I learned that my close friends didn't donate solely because \"they didn't feel like it.\"  I told them that if they don't have an excuse like listed above, then the only reason they didn't donate was because of their own negligence and laziness when it came to finding the desire and time in their day. Keep in mind that our school gives excused absence for the classes we miss, and that you are free to donate anytime during the day, even after school, so that everyone can come during any free time. They said I had a superiority complex just because I donated, but they don't know that it has impacted my family on a more personal level.  My intention isn't to make them feel like bad people because they didn't donate, but just to drive home the fact that they could help save lives if they just took a few simple steps. ",

One of her friends went up to me a few days later and got in my face about how i'm immature and how I threw her away and don't value her.\n\nI just walked away from her. I'm so fucking sick of this shit happening to me, rejection is fucking horrific at this point, and all I get for not accepting it is shit.

I just don't want to waste my time and energy on lost causes. Anyway, are they right? Am I an asshole who doesnt value girls?\n\nEdit: didnt expect this huge reaction. apparently i'm an asshole because I think it's ridiculous for girls to expect friendship after basically shitting all ofer you, and that they are then entitled to ruin your reputation if you disregard them from that point on.

She is on our university gymnastics team and is an incredible athlete. I went to her meet this afternoon and was freaking shocked to see how much of her floor routine had \"sexual\" elements. She did her routine to \"p'on da replay\" and as an example she crawled on all fours, she shook her ass, she did this thing where she went up and down her body with her finger (including her breasts) and then acted like her finger was sizzling. And during all this, her teammates cheered. I was blown away that this sort of sexuality was not only allowed but encouraged. \n\nAfter the meet I told her I didn't think she should do that sort of stuff. She told me that it was normal for gymnastics and that her routine had been worked out for years with coaches and choreographers. I told her it was normal for strippers who danced for dollar bills. She told me I didn't get it. I told her that I didn't understand what was to get, I was her boyfriend and it was my job to look out for her. She told me \"you are literally and asshole and way overstepping your bounds!\" I told her that I didn't want to fight and she said it was too late. So instead of her going on a romantic date I had planned, she decided to hang out with her teammates. I am so upset because I was counting on seeing her tonight. \n\nBased on what she said, am I the asshole for thinking her routine should be less sexy and telling her so?",

      "description": "Firstly, i already feel mildly bad about it because there is a special case in this event.\n\nFor what feels like the dawn of time my brother would often come to me and just start spouting out a random story of some people i dont know in some situation i have no context in and then hed laugh and tell me its funny. Every once in a while he actually delivers it well, but very frequently its so bad it feels like hes butchering a childrens book. I hate having to pretend its funny or that i really care. I dont know if i *should* care, if i should I feel like i should encourage him to improve his delivery, but I really dont care enough to do that.\n\n\nI have recently shot down any chances he has had because he very frequently rambles on and on and its annoying and im usually in the middle of something i dont want to take my attention from to listen to a shitty retelling. Just now he told me \"I think i want to be a comedian\" And I groaned internally cus he has no skill in delivery. I lightly acknowledged it and continued doing my own thing. He then said he wants to share a joke hes written up, and while i knew it being written probably made a difference in whether or not it was bearable, i just didnt have the mood or energy to consider sitting through him butchering another story and insisting its funny. I didnt want to tell him its not funny, cus every time i have done that he just scoffs and acts like im a dick. I even mentioned how he has shitty delivery. He got pissy and blamed me for having a short attention span.\n\n\n\nI can understand putting my feelings aside to let him have some attention but we interact in plenty of other ways that i find constructive and actually build relationship. We play video games together, we go out and explore together. We talk and share things in other ways. I take pictures for him to post on instagram. All this does is feel like hes ripping my attention and shoving his arm down my mouth to feed me a piece of regurgitated faceboook.\n\n\n\nIf i SHOULD be the one giving him attention... how the hell do i do it constructively? when he obviously sucks ass at delivering funny stories?\n",

      "description": "So basically, I'm in a group chat with a bunch of friends and my crush. A year ago I wasn't really friends with my friends, i just had a laugh with them every now and then.  We had to do a science project that involved taking selfies with things, so I did. I shared the project with the friends, we were all working together, and didn't think much of it. Thing is, back then (I feel) I had really bad personal hygiene, and I am still insecure about my appearance. \nOne of my friends has really cool software skills, but with great power comes great responsibility and he was not responsible. He started just photoshopping my face into things, public things that I won't go into too much detail about. I was really embarrassed, but so desperate to seem cool I didn't say anything. Then he stopped. Until recently he sent the template he used and it's awful, just a picture of my disgusting dirty face and greasy hair. I then told him how much I hate that picture, and we laughed about it. He didn't change the picture of the chat (my face) cause it was a private chat, and I assumed he would not use it again.\nI made a group chat with my crush in it and a bunch of friends, including him, and everything was going swimmingly. Then he, with full knowledge that I had a crush on this girl, sent the template. Now I definitely fueled the flames by saying how much the picture made me want to oof myself, but that didn't stop everyone (including my crush) from downloading the picture and posting it everywhere. So in a stroke of righteous anger I asked how his crush (using her name) was, and if she was still ignoring him. Then I deleted it because I felt bad, and literally no one but the people who already new saw it. I know this because they were all asking who it was.\nNow all my my friends  (apart from one guy who is saying it was justified) is saying I'm the asshole for saying the name, and that he was crushed DESPITE me saying that it was just retaliation for sending my ugly mug to my crush knowing I hated the photo.\n\nSo, AMITA?",

My grandpa doesn't follow the new time rules where it is illegal to beat the shit out of children.\n\nSo enough backstory on to the actual story, B and C were playing in the kitchen and C started calling B names. C knew that B was extremely self conscious about his weight and that's what he was verbally abusing him with. So he told him to stop. When it did not stop he lightly punched him. Knowing that he could get him in trouble he over dramatically started crying . This prompted Gp to walk out with a belt and proceed to beat him with the belt. When my brother fell to the ground he started kicking him, my brother started begging him to stop when my uncle stepped in. So am I the assault for hating my grandpa",

      "description": " Okay a little bit of background, Im 19 and live with my mom(Cindy), step dad(Dave), and step sister(Beth,16). Last year Beth ended up having to move in with us because her biological mother kicked her out. Because she didn't want to move in with us, and would've rathered live with her boyfriend, she told police that I molested her and my parents beat her. Still tho, she came to live with us. Ever since she's moved in she's caused drama, arguments and tension. David had always been a heavy drinker, even before Beth moved back in. But after she moved in David began to drink way more, and he's pretty much an alcoholic. Now David has never provided for me in any way shape or form. Not financially, emotionally or physically. \nAnd now that I'm older and still at home, I pay rent, my own car insurance and I buy my own groceries (which I keep on my own labeled shelf.) David and Beth continue to eat the groceries I buy for myself, even tho my mom already grocery shops for the family and they both work and are totally capable of buying their own groceries. And whenever I bring this up David yells at me and tells me that I'm an ungrateful child. Yet I have nothing to thank him for. He acts like I should just give him respect because he's my mom's husband, but he's never shown me any ounce of respect. He even got drunk and passed out on the sofa, missing my highschool graduation. I've also tried very hard to form a relationship with both Beth and David, I've asked Beth to go to the movies, beach, mall and to get pedicures many times and everytime she's declined. Ive tried to have conversations with David or ask him about his day, but once again I am repeatedly shot down. David is almost always drunk and grouchy and will get mad over the littlest things, like if I don't wash one plate(yet he'll leave piles of dirty dishes in the living room), if I accidentally make too much noise(yet he used to vaccum outside my room at 8AM after I just worked a 12 hour midnight shift). He's always yelling or nitpicking about something and Beth is always going out of her way to be inconsiderate. Beth will take all the body wash, shampoo, conditioner , pads, etc out of the bathroom closet and stash them in her room and then yell at whoever asks to use them. \nOverall, the household is just really toxic for me and everyone is always on edge. I feel like living in this home is bad for my own mental health, I've brought this upto my mom many times, and she continues to tell me to get over it. I finally told her today that if she doesn't leave, or there's some form of serious attitude change, for my own sake I need to move out. \nAITA?\nTLDR; my step dad and step sister continue to treat me terribly even tho I've actively tried to build a relationship. I gave my mother the ultimatum of them or me. ",

      "description": "To start this off, I (23 yr old, works full time) love animals, and I currently have two cats that that only I take care of. My boyfriend (23 yr old, works full time) just moved in with me in my house around September last year. Been going great, but lately he's been pushing to get a dog. His family owns a pack of little dogs, and he's started to miss them, and I get that. But I know after the novelty rubs off of owning a dog I'll end up being the one taking care of it, walking or training it.\nI feel this will happen by how he treats chores or household activities. He doesn't. The way I've been trying to do them is alternate who does what, but that hasn't been working. I'll do the chore (ex:dishes), and be like \"It's your turn, I did them yesterday.\" And he'll just be like i don't want to do them tonight/I don't have the time (he spends 10 hours a day playing videogames), I'll do them tomorrow. But its just been me doing dishes, doing laundry, taking out trash, tidying up our room, making the bed, ect. With making the bed his reply was that I was the only one bothered with it being messy. To his credit, he didn't have to do any of this when he lived with his parents, his mom was a stay at home mom and did it all.  I had to show him how to do dishes and laundry, so he couldn't use that as an excuse any more.\nHe says the dogs helps him with his anxiety, and I understand. But I'm pretty sure his mom was the one to take care of them. When I mentioned it, he was like \"I know how to take care of a dog and train it\" but that's not my problem with it.\nSo reddit, would I be the asshole if I told my boyfriend i dont want him to get a dog till I can see he's reliable enough to take care of it?",

      "description": "Throwaway for reasons.\n\nSo for context, I've been friends with this guy(we'll call him A)about two years. Done travel together, see each other all the time, never really fought etc. He is bi, and I am gay though im not sure how relevant that is since we've never expressed interest in each other.\n\nAnyway he has this girlfriend. We'll call her X. She usually doesn't come on the trips or events me and A go on but I never thought much about it. One time we did all three of us go to a movie and X seems distant/ignoring of me. After I got home, I messaged A asking if everything was ok with me and her. His reply; \"yeah she's just never liked you is all.\"\n\nThis made me really sad and I asked if there was anything I could do to try and change that. He said not really. When I pressed for an explanation, he told me she thought I had an \"obnoxious sense of humor\". Well alright.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, A and X are planning on moving and I wanted to do something with A before he left. I kept trying to organize a get-together so I could say good bye but he kept cancelling. I at first thought he was just busy with moving, but it turns out he was just going to events with X. All fine. He offered another date for us to get together and I said sure, fine. He said sorry if me cancelling is a problem and I said \"nah it's fine to change plans just try to be sure before you cement a date haha\". And to this he reacted very aggressively, telling me to fuck off, that he never got on my ass when I cancelled, etc.\n\nI didn't really know how to respond as I tend to shut down when faced with aggression, so I just didn't respond. A few days later after no contact, I did apologize. I said I was sorry if I was short with him, and that I understood the moving process was hectic. He ignored me. After three days of no response and messages left on read I was feeling pretty goddamn shitty, between learning his gf hates me and him being so cold to me, my anxiety got the best of me and I unfriended both of them. They were moving across the country anyway and I figured neither of them wanted to talk to me.\n\nFast forward about a month, I was supposed to go to a Valentine's Day party hosted by a mutual friend of us, geared towards singles and friends who needed company on that day. I live in a very conservative area and my dating life is pretty dry, so I was really happy to get invited back to the event. \n\nAfter discussing with the group different supplies I planned to bring to the party, out of the blue A messages me, telling me both he and X feel weird about me going since they introduced me to the group, and asked me not to come. He also added that his gf was recently diagnosed with a fairly serious illness.\n\nPanic set in and I immediately responded that fine, I wouldn't go, and that I was very sorry to hear about X's condition. I messaged the friend group that I wouldn't be able to attend this year after all. It came as very sudden change which prompted the party host(Q) to message me asking what's up. I told her that me and A were fighting and since he planned on going I didn't want to cause trouble(I didn't mention X was sick as I felt it was not my place). That's when I learned that A had actually blocked Q some time ago and Q basically told me fuck them, and to come anyway. \n\nI messaged A back saying sorry, I'm going, to which he replied that I was a selfish POS and blocked me. In the end, I didn't go. I still feel shitty and feel like I could have handled everything better,  could have been more sensitive to the gf, and lost a really great friend in the process. So AITA here?  ",

      "description": "I am traveling for business in NOLA and on my last day of business, I went to the original Cafe Du Monde. There were about 50 people waiting in line at 9:45 on Monday morning, but I was able to get seated at the small table (smaller than 2'x2') with 4 seats in about 20 minutes - a rather short wait. On a side note, there's a much shorter separate line for \"to-go\" line. I have never been here before so after I got seated, I realized it's cash only. I tell the waiter I'm going across the street to pull money out while leaving my backpack and carry-on at the table. I come back within 5 minutes and a couple next to me tell me they had to ward off people trying to take my table/belongings because they thought I had left it behind. I told the couple thanks so much for looking out for my table/belongings and ordered my beignet and chicory coffee.  \n  \nA few minutes after my order arrives, two elderly women come by and asks if they can sit at my table. I told them \"no, there will be another table that opens up. I'd like to sit alone.\" They responded, \"no, we're going to sit here because there's a lot of people and it's busy.\" I don't know or believe if they waited in the \"table\" line because the only way to get a table that I noticed is to be seated by a waiter - my guess is they came from the quicker to-go line and found my table with 3 empty seats. After I tell the older women no again, they begin to pull chairs to sit, but the couple next to me quickly grab their stuff and say they're leaving while offering their table. The guy tells me in a snarky tone, \"I hope you enjoy your trip.\" \"I sure will,\" I responded. The older women were then joined by two other older women who asked if they could share the table, and the original two older women bad mouthed me about how rude and mean I am. I ignored it, pulled my laptop to take up the whole table, enjoyed my breakfast, and left within 20 minutes.  \n  \nI waited in the longer line and want to enjoy my breakfast alone. I didn't want to be sitting at a table stuck listening to their conversation or socialize out of politeness. AITA for refusing to share my table?",

Her phone was stolen while we were out one day, and the whole team went to the house where it was, and she ended up actually entering the person's home while their 5-6 kids were all over the place. At this point we were well aware he was a more serious criminal.  \n\n\nI said I did not feel comfortable with the way we handled that incident, and she understood.  \n\n\nA few days ago she took some photos of sleeping homeless people and posted them on facebook, without visible faces. I said this bothered me, and she launched a series of personal attacks unrelated to the question of this action. Her only relevant reply is that there are no faces unless they agreed, and she admitted to not getting those other sleeping people's consent. I think this is a downright ethics violation, and I don't debate questions of ethics.  \n\n\nShould I have stayed? I felt like even if this was ethical it was an unfair way to treat vulnerable people, to say nothing of what might have happened to her if they woke up to a lady taking their picture on the street.",

      "description": "So this has really been fucking me up mentally the last few days and I just wanted to know what reddit thinks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically to preface this, I was seeing a girl but we weren't completely tied down because she had just been through some really scary medical situation and wanted to hold off till February (its hard to explain why February unless i go into what exactly the medical issues were) before possibly making a commitment. Now I was completely ok with this and I absolutely loved every bit of her company that I could get. I wasn't really actively trying to see/hookup with anyone else but I was aware that she had some goals and things she wanted to do before being monogamous which for her is a huge deal to hear because she hasn't really been the monogamous type in the past. Yes I know this is an odd situation, and would need a lot more explanation to understand it more, but everything was talked about openly and communicated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we had hooked up a couple times, unprotected, but she is very consistent about getting STD check ups about every 3 months. Other than her I have only been with 1 other person in the last year (this girl being like 4 months ago) and that was protected. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter our last hookup about a month ago, she explained one day after going to the store that she picked up some condoms because she actually wanted to make sure she was keeping me safe with all the unprotected sex she had been having previously. As weird as that sounds, I thought it was very endearing that she would do that because we both dislike condoms, but she went out of her way to do that. But a couple weeks later I started feeling a little uncomfortable itch feeling down their in my junk. Now I figured this was a UTI because I've had a couple myself in the past because of my own medical issues related to my junk since I was young. However, with what she said previously about getting the condoms, I won't lie I got a little nervous. Not even because I may have gotten an STD, but more because with her medical issues that she was/is dealing with, her immune system is in pretty rough condition and I was hoping that someone she was with had not passed something on to her in between checks even though she's pretty selective with who she sleeps with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to the doctor after about 4 or 5 days of the feeling not dissipating, and actually the day I went to the doctor, we called and talked and I mentioned that I had gone to the doctor cause i felt like I had a UTI. I also mentioned that I was getting some routine blood work but that I wonder if they would check if it could have been an STD and she said probably since they took a urinalysis so they could at least check that out even though it wasn't a direct STD screening. \\*\\*Now this is where shit went all wrong.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hadn't gotten word about any of the tests for over a week, but she sent me a text saying \"So you never told me what was going on with your junk especially since you brought STD into the equation\" and I told her that I was just waiting still for the tests back so I could tell her. So she starts texting me that it's pretty fucked up I didn't tell her that I was having unprotected sex with anyone without telling her, but I told her I havn't, just her, and even the girl I had sex with before her was protected. However she insisted that even thinking that I may have had something even for a second and didn't tell her was really fucked up. I tried telling her I did tell her when we talked a week prior that I thought it was more than likely just a UTI (Which it was btw) and very unlikely it was an STD, and that I had brought it up because I just wanted it to be known that I had said something incase it was so I could let her know right away, but she just started shutting down on me super hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this was done over text, and I had asked numerous times if we could please talk about this over the phone because I don't do well with important conversations like this over text and end up just writing walls of text, but she never would let me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe texts just ended up turning into me trying to tell her that I wasn't trying to scare her with this, wasn't trying to hide anything from her, and that I was just trying to communicate with her about what was going on, letting her know incase it was worst case scenario. However she would just keep telling me I was missing the point, that the fact she has/had to worry about an STD or anything is a huge deal breaker even if it was a false alarm and that the alarm for an STD should have never been rung in the first place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's one of the biggest things that's been fucking me up. I really want to know the point that I was missing, but I could never get her to talk to me on the phone or in person so that we could talk it out. I feel like such an asshole for bringing up that it might have been an STD even though I even thought it was super unlikely, but with her immune system complications, I was worried and just wanted to make sure. But now the person I was super comfortable, could talk about literally everything with, and felt like I could really be myself around wants nothing to do with me and i'm absolutely fucking \\*\\*wrecked\\*\\* right now. So am I the asshole..?",

I can't tell if they did it themselves or if they got pulled over the table by another photographer, but their portraits were cut out quite badly and pasted on a coffee coloured background, the lighting of their portraits also is very patchy and my cousins two front teeth appear to have a discoloration, upon zooming a bit closer it is because some pixels were corrupted and turned into a yellow block.\n\nThis sounds pretentious, but I know I can do better.

      "description": "Kind of a massively stupid and petty situation really. My partner and I decided to order takeaway last night to be delivered. We ordered pretty late in the evening from a Chinese place, and I said that the time that I thought that the food would be pretty late (we live in the outskirts of a major city and Chinese food always arrives really late and generally cold here), he said \"it won't be, they've given themselves a generous timescale to get here so I'll be annoyed if it's later than that, it's their fault for not doing their jobs if it is\"...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLo and behold, the food is late. Lots of huffing and puffing from him \"you need to call them and complain, this is ridiculous, terrible service, blablabla\"... until 20 minutes later, it arrives. I was doing something upstairs at the time and could hear him speaking to the delivery guy... for much longer than it takes to grab a bag off someone... and the dog has started howling and wailing because he's starting to raise his voice so I come downstairs to hear him absolutely tearing a strip off this poor delivery guy \"This is absolutely disgusting, you can't treat paying customers like this, this food has been sat in your car and will give me and my wife food poisoning now, I paid (x) for delivery and you've let this down, I want a refund, blabla\", this poor guy was just stuttering apologies until he just handed him the bag and high-tailed it. My partner then picks up the phone, rings the restaurant and starts demanding a refund (they don't give him it). I was *mortified.* I'm really not a confrontational person, but I've worked in minimum wage customer service jobs and have been made to cry by people using that type of behaviour and my blood just boiled. I snapped (which I regretted instantly, I am not good at arguing) and said \"That was really embarrassing, you didn't need to take it out on the guy delivering it, you knew that it would be late\", he turns to me and says \"You always take other people's sides, now it's the Chinese guy, I have a right to complain as it's his fault. My clients will complain if they receive anything less than 100% service so stop defending other people.\"... he's a the director of a big firm, not exactly the same!! To top it off, as predicted, the food is cold, I warm mine up and offer to do the same to his which he declines, saying he'll eat his \"overpriced, disgusting cold slop\" which he does while complaining continuously. I was actually quite upset and a bit teary at this stage, we'd had a lovely day most of which had been about buying his birthday presents(!!) and it really just ruined it for me so I ate my food and said that I would go to bed. He told me I was overreacting, being childish and unsupportive. I went to bed because I didn't want to argue. Now he's not really talking to me apart from to ask me to make drinks, bring items, etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit, AITA for getting upset over a Chinese takeaway?

      "title": "AITA (or are we the a*) for wanting to drop the godparenthood of my husband’s youngest nephew?",
      "description": "Shortly before Christmas my husband reset an old iPad that my mother-in-law wanted to give to her youngest grandson - also my husband’s second godson - for St.Nicolaus day. Something normal to do, if you give a used device to somebody else, especially a kid, isn’t it? So after he finished that, I wrapped it up nicely, added some chocolate and sent it to my brother-in-law’s place by mail, as we live in opposite sides of the country.\n\nOn the night before Nicolaus day my brother-in-law calls my husband while we were driving home from evening grocery shopping. (So I was able to listen to the whole conversation as the car took the call.) My brother-in-law yells at my husband for resetting the device. ‘All the games for the boy are gone! The boy wants to play right away!’ My husband asks why he is not just downloading the games again from the play store? ‘It’s not working! Fix the problem NOW!’ But we’re driving. My husband tells his brother he can’t do anything right now. He should try to download the games another time.\n\nA bit later that night - we were just having dinner - my brother-in-law calls again and my husband didn’t pick up the phone as he wanted to have dinner in piece after a long day at work. That lead my brother-in-law to leave a very rude, aggressive voice message, telling my husband that he ruines his son’s life. And that he would send the iPad back to us on our expenses if my husband didn’t fix the problem at once. Later that night my husband writes him a message. Just a short research online - turns out that the play store was a bit busy and slow that night. He told him that and that he is tired of just hearing complaints about how he acts as godparent. That he is thinking to just let that rest, because apparently he can’t do anything right. So Christmas won’t be any presents from us.\n\nA few months before that iPad incident, we had sent the boy a birthday card with money which had got lost or stolen in the mail. We then transferred the money to their bank account a day late. So we’re really horrible people! Previous presents we chose were not the right ones. Either the wrong toy (lego instead of playmobil) or too small, I guess, because ‘the boy wants to save up some money to get something good. So just send cash.’ We also refused to travel all the way through Germany to attend the boys first school day celebration. We really didn’t feel like a stressful two days trip for hundreds of dollars right before my work started again for a lunch and a picture. We both have demanding jobs. Instead we bought all the school books the boy needed. But we always hear about us not being there for the first school day. (BTW: My brother-in-law and his second wife didn’t come to our wedding because of his work. They never visited us at our house. And if they ever come to my in-laws’ house, it’s because they payed the trip for them). And I received some very rude messages from that boys mother blaming me for ruining the boy’s first school day.\n\nSo the day after Christmas my husband gets this text message from his sister-in-law. She tells him that we’re pathetic to take out the argument with his brother on the boy. That he is mean to not sent him a Christmas present. She also demanded from my husband to ‘call the boy and tell him in person why he doesn’t have a godfather anymore’ - which my husband didn’t do. He is really tired of his brother and his crazy (ex)wives.\n\nBut seriously: Are we mean for ending that drama? Is there a way to keep contact with a 7 year old child without having to deal with his crazy parents? I honestly don’t see a way to separate the relationship of my husband with his youngest nephew from that with his brother. Apart from that my mother-in-law just told us on Christmas that the other godmother of the boy already broke off contact with them a while ago as they got into a fight with her too.\n\nNow I’m a bit worried because the 70th birthday of my father-in-law is coming up next month. And probably my brother-in-law will also be there. He has a bad temper - obviously. And he started yelling at his grandmother’s funeral a few years ago when his ex-wife showed up to pick up his two older sons. And being pregnant now I really don’t feel like being in a crazy situation like that. My family members never lose their temper in public. So what’s your advice? Sorry about the long story and thanks if you read till the end.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to work part time whilst I'm at university?",
      "description": "I had a heated debate with some family members last night about myself looking for part time work during my studies. Both of these have worked since they left school, have been tax payers, and are nose to the grind stone type of people since they started working (also neither of them went to college and come from skill labour / property admin jobs). I'm currently a college/university student who due a scholarship and student finance (based on my own financial situation), I don't have to work to support my studies.   \n   \n   \nA bit of info to paint a picture of what kind of student I am. I've had a summer internship every year since Year 1 of my degree, I've been active in 2-3 extracurricular clubs (1 very relevant to my field of study), and after this next academic year I'll be starting a 1 year placement with a major company in my field. So not a slacker by any means. I also worked full time for a few years before going to university, and worked part time during my pre-university course (1 year long).   \n   \n \n\nThe subject of part time employment came up last night and I mentioned I don't need to get one as I am financially stable currently and can last until I start my placement. Their arguments were that I have lived too long a life of leisure (their words), I need to work and save money, people in life don't get governments grants paid into their banks every year they have to work for it, I'm avoiding paid work (even though all the internships I've had and will be doing are entirely my choice to undertake).  I should show a good work ethic by getting a part time job and putting it on my CV will show I'm proactive. \n\n \n\n \n\nMy argument was that I'd rather take the extra time I have to not work and put it towards other activities and relaxing before I start my full career, I don't need the money, the trade-off between doing 1-2 shifts a week and not having the money leads me to choose not to work. There is no room on my CV for a part time job, employers in my field don't care how many pints I've poured or tables waited on the weekend, they care about my technical knowledge and experience relevant to the role (which I can show via my internships and extracurriculars). I know this is true because I have been for 2-3 interviews already, 1 of which I got offered my upcoming placement, and not once did they ask about my previous work history. It was all technical knowledge about my field, and my knowledge of the company. \n\n \n\n \n\nI think they are annoyed because I can get by without working on grants/loans, and they see themselves as honest hardworking people who are funding my \"leisure time\". Even though in a few months I will be starting a 1 year placement with a massive company who make a major impact on their industry. I do feel guilty however, as I have friends and a partner who have to work part time to support themselves, and I know how stressful that can be. Although, I don't think I should be made to feel guilty and like I'm not being a productive person because I'm not putting myself through menial labour 8-16 hours a week when I don't have to. AITA?

      "description": "Standard I'm on mobile so apologies for formatting. Tl;dr at the bottom in case I end up waffling on.\n\nI (22M) am planning on proposing to my girlfriend (23F) by this time next year. \n\nSo backstory, my girlfriend (L for reference)is obsessed with weddings. She has an obsession with watching wedding tv shows (especially ones focussed on the dress) and loves pricing up hypothetical weddings. All of this I'm completely fine with as I know I want to marry this girl and I think the world of her and marriage at this stage would have been a natural thought process regardless.\n\nThe reason that is all relevant is because she basically has an entire wedding planned out for if/when she gets married. I myself have no preconceptions about what I want for the wedding as long as the food is nice and there's at least one or two good beers on tap so I've said to her if/when we get married, she can basically plan it all. (This is not me burdening her with an incredibly stressful job, she beamed ear to ear when this suggestion was made, if she does want my help and input I will happily help).\n\nAlso she is a shopaholic. She shops at every opportunity she gets and it is her favourite way of passing time. \n\nIn discussion about weddings etc she tells me she has said her dream would be to shop for her own engagement ring. I myself want it to be a surprise when I propose and pick out the perfect ring for her to show her how well I know her and for it to be a surprise.\n\nNow, she can be fussy when it comes to jewellery. She is always grateful when it is bought for her and wears it when the person who bought it for her is around, but you can tell when she actually likes something or not as long as you aren't the person who bought it for her. Noticeably, she won't wear it unless that person is around. Hence why she has always wanted a watch but has never bought one due to how picky she is.\n\nRecently, when shopping I have noticed if I go into a shop to look at watches for myself I have noticed that she will get bored and look at rings so I have started playing a game of 'guess my favourite watch' as she will return with 'guess my favourite ring'. Because of this I have a list on my phone of every ring she has pointed out as her favourite and because of this I feel I could find a perfect ring. \n\nBasically I want to surprise her when I propose to her and sweep her off her feet by doing what she deems impossible and give her the perfect ring to go alongside what will hopefully be a perfect day for her. So WIBTA for risking messing it all up by doing something she explicitly said is the opposite of what she wants?\n\n\nTl;dr: my girlfriend has always dreamed of shopping for her own engagement ring but i want to surprise her with a well thought out perfect ring.",

      "description": "Background: I'm a stay-at-home girlfriend because of my disability. I absolutely hate it and wish I could work, but nonetheless I stay home and do the housework. \n\nSo, I do the cooking, vacuuming, dishes, toilets, other cleanings, the shopping, and make sure the bills are paid on time. The only \"chore\" I ask of my boyfriend is the trash because when it builds up it deterriates my mental health and makes it hard to do the other things I do.\n\nWhat gets me is that he said he would do it, but then doesn't. I even left for a week once and NONE of the chores he said he would do was done. Its not the trash I'm upset about, its the fact I feel lied to.\n\nIt's been 4 days since he said he would take out the trash, and I asked him nicely for the 4 days. I finally had enough and sent him this text:\n\n\"Why did you lie to me about the trash? For 4 days you said you would do it. Its the only \"chore\" I ask of you. It feels like you brushed me off and slapped me in the face while at it.\n\n4 days. I bet if I leave for even a week nothing would be done again.\"\n\nTL;DR Am I the asshole for feeling betrayed and lied to for asking my boyfriend to take the trash out, his only chore, and he ignored me about it for 4 days?",

      "title": "AITA for going to sleep when I am talking to a friend?",
      "description": "I don't really know how to start this, but I started this account to assess this issue. Basically, I have a friend (T) who I talk to often, but recently she's kept me up later than I am supposed to. T and I are childhood and family friends that go way back. I've known her almost my entire life, but recently our relationship has become less and less healthy. We talk every day and if I don't talk to her, she will get mad. Our talks used to be more dispersed and healthy, but the past few years she will call me toxic or get angry at me for not replying to her in a day, or if I'm actively talking to her that day, a few minutes. Because of this, I have been staying up much later than my body needs.\n\nI have sleeping problems, but I don't want to label it as anything serious without a medical expert. Basically, I can't fall asleep before four or so hours pass, meaning if I go to bed at around 1, I go to sleep at around 5. Again, that's not exact because there are times where I can fall asleep in maybe an hour or two. As a student who actively wakes up at around 6 in the morning, this isn't healthy for me at all. I used to take this sketchy form of melatonin to help me sleep, but it often affected my learning and overall mood so I stopped taking it. \n\nT knows I have problems with sleeping and has known for a while, but she chooses to ignore them. I honestly don't remember when this started but I know it was a while ago. When I talk to her, I'm not allowed to stop talking to her. If I tell her I have to do something, she'll give me a passive aggressive response or go on a rant how I'm always leaving. I experience really bad anxiety when it comes to people I love being mad at me, so usually I submit to what she says and apologize.   \nDuring the summer, I had an awful sleep schedule and pulled all-nighters and all that good shit while I could. Again, sleeping never comes easy for me so it wasn't really something I worried about. It was fun. However, because I stayed up so late, I was often staying up later than her. Either that, or she will end up falling asleep. I do care about her, so often I would tell her to go to sleep because I knew at the time she couldn't stay up late. This often resulted in her yelling at me for trying to get rid of her. All my attempts usually ended up in the same place. \n\nOnce school started again and I realized I wouldn't be able to get away with going to sleep late, I started to do things that might help me sleep better. First, I started taking the sketchy melatonin pills, then I started to put my phone across the room so I'm not tempted by it. I know that once I go to sleep, it'll be hard to wake up in the morning. I know I suck at waking up early. T, however, started to stay up later, resulting in her getting angry at me every night I tell her I have to go. The nights when I actually took melatonin, I physically couldn't stay up past 12 or so, but she didn't like that I would tell her I had to leave at around 10. I hated leaving her on read, and any time I would, she would assume I'm tired of her and that if I was, I should just tell her. Once I stopped taking melatonin, I felt like she took advantage of my sleeping patterns. She would guilt trip me into staying up later or get mad at me when I tried to reexplain why I needed to go to bed earlier. Because I'm often busy with school and other things, I can't talk to her until maybe after 7 pm on weekdays. Only about a week ago I reinstated that I am going to go to bed at around midnight (though I often run through the whole 'thirty more minutes' sort of thing), and she kind of complied to it. She has accepted it a little bit more than she used to, but she still calls me heartless and rude when I can't reply. I honestly feel really bad about the whole situation because I've talked to friends and family about this, and they tell me to leave her. I do love her and cherish her as a friend, and I know she does too, even though she hates showing affection or any love towards me. This entire thing has been weighing me down for months now, and there's a bigger story with everything that happened. But I want to know, am I the asshole for going to sleep while we're still talking, especially when I don't get to talk to her during the day much?",

      "description": "Me (27f) and my best friend “Lucy” (27f) have been friends since middle school. Literally went through puberty, life changes, everything together. We are complete opposites (I’m a minority, she’s not. we have complete different taste in music movies men every possible thing) but still through everything we manage to have so much in common. She has this other friend who she’s also been really close with since middle school, let’s call her Jane. Her and Jane have more generic things in common (race, similar family issues). Me and Jane were never close but since we all went to the same schools I’ve known her in passing, and she’s nice, I’ve had no issues with her. When we were all around 19 we were all drinking, partying and living the yolo lifestyle. Jane ended up getting dependent on alcohol, and Lucy let Jane stay at her family’s house , Jane had sex with Lucy’s brother and denies it, has stolen from her, is a habitual liar, and much more but I guess since they’ve been friends for so long she can’t cut her loose (she’s even said something along those lines).Jane recently got back from rehab again, and Lucy told me that she hates janes current boyfriend. I ask her “is it because he’s scummy ?” She says yes. I say “well Jane is kind of scummy too but that’s my personal opinion” .... I’m just going off of everything I know about her and what Lucy has told me. She says I was rude and what I said was unjustified. I apologized, but also I feel like I wasn’t that wrong ? Maybe I’m being bias and for sure their relationship isn’t my business, but now she won’t talk to me. And even though I am sorry and said I was, I’m not sorry for what I said, I’m sorry she was offended. AITA for what I said ?",

      "description": "My ex fiancé and I got engaged July of last year.  It was such an amazing night, he surprised me by taking me to the exact spot we met and got on one knee.  It was straight out of a romance movie, I have never been happier in my life.  That happiness extended through out most of our engagement until January.  \n\nThat’s when he said the words that everyone dreads hearing, we need to talk.  He said that he had actually been second guessing himself throughout our entire engagement and he thinks that we are making a mistake.  I was floored.  I had no idea he had been feeling this way while I was in soon to be wed bliss.  \n\nI tried to talk to him about wedding jitters and how it’s normal to feel this way before a big commitment.  I told him that we were in love and there’s no mistake in that.  His mind was set though, I’m not sure who he’s been talking to about this, but I really doubt he came to this conclusion on his own.  I hoped that if I gave him some time and space that he would come around and see the real mistake he was making.  So I moved back to my parent’s.  \n\nI’ve tried to keep in touch at least through texts and online. Sometimes he responded in short bursts, sometimes he would not respond at all. I’ve given up hope at this point.  Then out of nowhere last weekend he reached out to me.  We talked a little and it was like part of me came back to life again.  I was so happy again, but only for minutes this time.  The real reason he was reaching out was because he wanted my engagement ring back.  It was like soaring up into the air only to slam back down to the ground. \n\nI stopped responding to him.  I honestly can’t believe he would even ask.  It’s like what we had meant nothing at all to him and now all he cares about it cashing out.  This is my ring.  He gave it to me and it obviously means a lot more sentimentally to me than to him.  It represents our relationship and even if it had a painful end, I don’t want to part with it.  ",

      "title": "AITA For Calling Out My Younger Brother",
      "description": "I have a younger brother who has been diagnosed with ADHD. He'll be going into High School next year and he still struggles to follow most social conventions. He doesn't wear deodorant, bathe, or change his clothes to the point where he looks physically dirty and you can still smell him after he has left. Additionally, my parents bought him a pair of nice noise canceling headphones for his IEP. Now he NEVER takes them off and is constantly watching commentary videos and refuses to engage with the people around him. When he does take them off to talk to people he's not polite. We were on vacation and my mom was trying to point out to him something pretty. He takes off his headphones looks at it excitedly, turns around and says \"Wow Mom, that's a whole lot of I don't care!\" Then goes back to watching videos. Another time we went mini golfing and he purposefully putt his ball into the water features and laughed at my dad while he watched him wade into the water to go get them over and over again. At school, he never turns anything in without my parents breathing down his neck comparing his completed homework to emails the teachers send them with a list of his assignments. His attitude and tantrums continue at school to the point where he's gotten multiple detentions, and got kicked out of the school band for his behavior (he got a detention for telling a girl \\[our neighbor\\] that her pet was going to die after she shared with the class that she got it over the weekend).\n\nI'm a perfectionist and I've always had high standards for myself and others. In my eyes, my little brother is out of control. My parents let him get away with everything, and he knows it (especially my mom). They've stopped disciplining him and my mom uses his learning disability as an excuse (he's medicated), and now he uses that as an excuse too. Whenever he misbehaves he tells her that he forgot to take his Focalin and she lets it slide. I know he's not popular and the other kids at school bully him (behind his back I think) because of the aforementioned. A girl in his grade told me that she feels bad for him, but also doesn't because he's \"mean\"(This seems to be the general consensus from people I've talked to). I get frustrated with him and often and short like telling him \"\\[his name\\], you need to take a shower!\", or making a snide comment when I notice he's been wearing the same outfit for a couple of days. I also tease him (i.e. saying nothing and mouthing words at him when he has his headphones on to confuse him). These AREN'T the only interactions we have, but admittedly we never had a great relationship so I don't know how to talk to him about this in a way where he wouldn't take it the wrong way. I've tried in the past to talk to him seriously about it and he became very offended and defensive (More so than he was with the teasing). I talk to my parents about it but they get annoyed with me complaining about him so much, and think I'm being too hard on him and all these things just come along with being a 14 year old boy. I worry about his mental health between me at home and the kids at school, but it also doesn't feel right to me to just let him keep going, and I just get so annoyed with him.",

      "description": "Hi. I'll try to give as much information as possible here, but it's a lot of backstory. I'll answer as many questions as possible in comments if applicable. Sorry for the long post.\n\nMy gf and I started dating back in August. I knew she had a dog and I was okay with that. In September we moved in together and...her dog wasn't with her. I asked her where it was, she said it was with her nephew.\n\nA long chain of events later, we end up moving in with her nephew briefly. And so I got to meet and interact with her dog...who turned out to be a major asshole. I was bitten four times (two of which broke skin) in that timespan by her 150lb mastiff/St bernard mix. If the dog had more interest in taking a finger or hand off, it easily could have.\nNot only is it snappy, it isn't well behaved. It constantly barks. It has to be quarantined in the bathroom every time someone comes to the door. I'm afraid to take it on walks, let alone interact with it at all. It has separation anxiety and makes a mess if left alone. It growls at me if I look at it funny and won't let me come near my gf. It has snapped at her nephew's kids before and has been a nuisance in general in everyone involved's lives. Except my gf. She's had it for a decade and the two of them get along just fine. (It tolerates other people to a very varying degree.) This dog means a LOT to her, and I know it does. \n\nHowever, we decided we wanted to get a truck and trailer combo and live out of it for a while, because rent here in Quebec is rediculous- and we wanted to go out and do something we never have before in either of our lives (we're in our mid 30s.) We were originally going to take the dog with us, but I lobbied against it. \nI think it's unfair to have two adults AND a massive dog living in a tiny trailer if all three parties don't get along perfectly well. And because we're in Canada, having it be an outdoor dog isn't really an option. Even if we were somewhere warm, I don't trust its temperament to not run off into the sunset or attempt to do something destructive. I'm not a big dude, but I'm not tiny- but even I can't, with utmost confidence, restrain such a huge dog if I needed to. Walks with it are more like the dog walks me type of deal. \n\nWe found a nice spot to stay at for the spring with our trailer and have both found jobs. GF is talking about getting her dog out here to live with us when it's warmer, but honestly I won't budge. The dog makes me uncomfortable to a huge degree.\nI told her that if she were to bring the dog here to where we are, that it'd be a deal breaker for me. And that would kill me. I just can't imagine spending my time in a small trailer with a dog that can't stand me, being on edge constantly. It's a huge (literally) responsibility that we aren't equipped to handle at this time in my opinion.\n\nAITA for letting this dog be a deal breaker for us? Am I being unreasonable?",

      "description": "So for some context, my housemate and myself worked the same job over Christmas. It was only a seasonal thing but over this time I developed a friendship with our manager and we still talk despite the job being over. My housemate doesn't have too high of an opinion of our manager due to her seeming snappy over small things my housemate was or wasn't doing at a few points during the work period. So I understand the dislike. However, as none of this snapping was directed at me, I feel no reason to dislike her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, fast forward to now, my manager and myself have planned to go out for drinks at some point and she asked me if she'd be able to crash at my place because it's far easier than her having to either get a taxi home (she lives in a different town) or have her partner come and collect her at like 2am. I said yes, thinking that it would be fine but asked my housemate to check that this would be okay anyway, we're all students and I wanted to check I wouldn't be bothering anyone with deadlines. My housemate told \"No. I do not like her\"  Even though she'd literally just be crashing in my bedroom and my housemate would likely have no interactions with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCompletely understand that no one wants to be woken up in the early hours of the morning by drunk people or whatever but to be told I can't have a guest crash at my house purely based on the fact that someone else doesn't like them seems kind of ridiculous. So, Would I be the asshole if I ignored the fact they said no and proceeded to let her crash at my place anyway?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So here's the thing. I'm not getting married yet, and I'm not engaged, but my friend is getting married soon. We were talking and she asked me if I was inviting my extended family to my wedding. I told her no, and she seemed a bit shocked. I then went on to tell her that since her family is close to me, they were definitely coming. She found it kind of funny, but honestly seemed pretty concerned.\n\nTo give some context: I would absolutely invite my mother, and my grandparents. I wouldn't invite any of my 16 (8 by blood, the other 8 married in) aunts and uncles, any of their children, and not my even my sibling. My sibling hasn't made an effort to keep in contact with me since they moved to the other side of the country. My aunts and uncles tend to be attention seekers, and rude.\n\nMost importantly though, they also don't help my grandparents, who are dealing with a lot right now since my grandmother has dementia, and my grandfather had to retire to take care of her. I love my grandparents and stop by all the time to see them, and it breaks my heart that the have about 50 grandkids and great grand kids (ages range from almost 40 to 3), and none of them stop by or even call. I kind of blame their parents since they don't either, but I try to be understanding. \n\nI only have one aunt who I would even consider inviting, but I don't want to since she has a personality disorder and attention seeks all of the time.\n\nIt just wouldn't make sense to me to invite them since they've never made an effort to be a part of my life. On the other hand, my friends family invites me to family gatherings, takes care of me when they have the chance, and legitimately put in the effort to ask me how my life is going. I would definitely invite her extended family, who practically treat me like their child.\n\nBut then again, I see lots of other people who invite their family who they aren't close with, and I feel like a jerk. Like, I should just put up with it because I should at least give them the opportunity to be involved in my life. If they found out my friend's family came, they would probably be really hurt, especially my aunt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; my family isn't close to me, but my friends family is. I kind of feel like I would just have to put up with it and invite them. WIBTA if I didn't?",

I have a mandatory event for school about a 20 minute drive from where I live.  I live with my parents in order to save money and they wanted this arrangement. \n\nI asked my dad to drive me and then pick me up and he agreed.  He's retired, and not doing much. The event starts at 830 and ends around noon.  The night before, he tells me that he decided to play golf the day of.  He can still drive me, but he said he has to drop me off about half an hour early so he can get to his golf course and be sitting around until the starts.  I'll also have to get myself home, which either means a very long walk using Google Map on my phone, or trying to find a nearby bus station and getting as close to home as I can.  Normally I would use Uber but I recently cancelled my CC because of fraudulent charges and the replacement hasn't arrived so I can't rideshare.  Dad knows this too.\n\nI'm a bit mad because my dad plays golf at least 3 times a week and can play whenever he wants.  I also told him about this weeks ago and he said he wasn't busy.  He told me that he had decided to play at the last minute and he told me I'd have to get myself home, so he clearly hadn't forgotten.  \n\nI appreciate what my parents do for me, especially b/c I can't drive, but I rarely impose on them and this is something I have to go to.  I get that my dad is retired and he worked hard his whole life so he could retire, but AITA for wanting him to not play golf this one time?  Is he TA for changing his plans at the last minute and drastically inconveniencing me?",

      "description": "I started thinking about different scenarios in which strangers have asked me if I spoke Spanish and found that I'm okay with it when it's a native speaker but not if it's a non-native speaker. There is also a racial/ ethnic tell in these interactions as the non- native speakers have been white whereas the native speakers have a skin tone similar to mine (brown). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith native speakers it's typically people who could be my parents and they like to talk about their family to me as they learn about me and where I am from.  Two non- native interactions have been as followed:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The man on the bus is asking the brown folk if they speak Spanish until someone says yes. I say no and observe him talk at another girl who said yes. He says he used to live in Mexico and had a girlfriend from China while the girl gives a polite smile and doesn't say much. \n2. The woman who asked me about God on campus. She was trying to learn more about me and asked me if I spoke Spanish. I said yes to be polite and she switched completely to Spanish talking about how she wants her children to speak Spanish and that she was going to go to Mexico to build houses with her family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be clear, I am not fluent in Spanish and in all these scenarios I'm not comfortable participating with either kind of speaker. I don't have many native speaker friends to ask so I started wondering to myself why I was annoyed at the non native speakers the most. I should be more open to practicing my Spanish so I don't lose it and it's great people are learning new languages but something about a non-native speaker asking me if I speak Spanish annoys me so much.

      "description": "So some context: Night of horrific shooting, I’m doing homework and am about to start my social studies while I’m on twitter and see the video.  It’s horrific and I’m depressed. I know I have HW do tomorrow but I honestly can’t focus or study after seeing that. I know that my teacher will understand and I’ll probably do it later. I go to school tomorrow, and my teacher gets mad at me. He gives me a 0. I’m very upset but what can I do. I go home but then realize that even after that he went and told my parents that I had not done my homework. My parents are very angry at me and do not understand even after I explain. I’m extremely mad because to begin with this wasn’t even my fault, and I got a 0 and my parents got mad at me. I’m in a shit mood and decide to email my teacher. This is the email I sent him: \n\nHonestly, I think what you did today was very messed up. \nPut yourself in my shoes. I don't know if you have seen the video but it is very depressing and horrific. Now imagine your 14 and watching this at night time while your parents are also asleep. You probably won't understand, but I can promise you if any other kid in the class had been in my situation, they also would not have been able to focus/ study. Ok so now you (should) understand how I'm not to blame. But here's what makes me upset and disappointed. Not only did I get a very bad grade on my test and homework, but I probably also have to remake the homework. So it's already bad enough. But then, of course, you had to tell my parents so they can also get mad at me and I get in more trouble for something that wasn't my fault, to begin with. I honestly don't know how I was supposed to handle this situation differently. I really don't know man. \n\nI’m in a bad mood and write this out of anger, shock, disappointment, and sadness. Soon it is spring break and I go on vacation. I come back and go to school. He tells my parents that your son has sent me a very disrespectful email and he’s in trouble. After I hear this I’m actually shocked. Like how low do you have to get to do this to some poor student who hasn’t done anything wrong and is going through a lot. Now my parents are mad at me and when I go to school tommorow I’m gonna probably be in trouble. Idk what to do but AITA?",

      "description": "So obviously this seems straight away like I shouldnt be the asshole but I'll explain the full situation. A good few months ago my friend unfortunately lost his job and therefore wasnt earning any money. Now he has a girlfriend and a kid and had already planned a trip away. So because he was short on money he asked if he could borrow the money for the trip and he would pay me back. Seems fine right?\n\n So he gets back and everything gets back to normal except I notice he never mentions the money. Now Im a very giving person to my friends. They have all given me more love and friendship through my hard times than anyone ever will so I feel I owe them my life so for this reason I never felt to ask for the money back.\n\nFast forward to the present and him and his girl have had a child together (previous child was from his girls past relationship) however he still hasnt gotten a job and I am going to Florida in June so I need money for that. Flights, Villa, Park tickets etc. So the other day I asked if he could get the money for me and I even said he can pay back in parts. Nothing was said.\n\nProblem is I feel bad because he has two kids that need caring for and I dont want to see them go without just to pay me back on the otherhand I do want the money. Any help?",

Brian was telling us about some of the great pro-bono work he had recently accomplished in helping recent immigrant refugees assimilate and succeed in America, through various events he puts on at work.\n\nWhat I wanted to say next was- “I know a girl who has done similar work- and would want to get involved.” \n\nBut all I was able to get out was- “I know a girl-“ because Steph interrupted me and says, “Woman.” \n\nIt took me a few seconds to even comprehend what she was saying. I expected her to say something else, and I had to repeatedly ask her to clarify why she was saying the word “Woman,” before she finally said “You said girl, and the correct term is Woman.” \n\nTo get over the awkwardness, I just changed the term and moved on- however since this has happened I’ve been really bothered about being forced to change my vocabulary. \n\nI didn’t use “girl” in a derogatory way, and if I was referencing a guy I wouldn’t have used the word “Man.” It also signaled to Brian that I was in the wrong, when I don’t feel as if I did anything wrong. I’ve experienced conversations where the word “woman” has had negative connotations in the past as well, so I feel as if I’m just playing catch-up to pander for whoever I’m speaking to by changing my word choice. \n\nBecause of everything above, I’m not planning on changing my word choice in the future.

      "description": "Just some background, during this time, I was struggling with a lot of issues such as my own personal mental health, school, and we were moving out of the area at the time as well as lived in a bed bug, mouse, and roach infested house. This isn't very important, but I feel it adds to my hatred.\n\nSo back in June, my older half brother of 32 years old (I was 17. 18 now) got really drunk because my almost 60 year old dad likes to party with him at our house. He doesn't live with us, but my dad loves him there. I never really liked him around, to be honest. Sometimes he's funny and I know he's my brother, but he's had a myriad of drunken blow ups where he would physically attack anyone who dares make him even somewhat angry. I knew for a fact something was going to go down that day because he was already coming after me a few points like getting in my face and stuff. I told my dad to get him out of there, but he refused. Well later that night, they started fucking around and knocked over the T.V. in the living room. I came out saying \"What the fuck happened? The fuck is wrong with you guys?\" Then he got angry and started insulting me and my girlfriend (who wasn't even there. I'm not sure why he started going on her), and I came back with some reply that I forgot what it was. He didn't like that. His reply was to throw me through my door and almost stomp on my face. I'm no weakling, but I honestly felt too scared and shocked to fight back. He got off, but I ran out of the house to call the cops. They did nothing, and I just slept at my girlfriends house that night. I've never felt so weak in my life. It just added to all my anger and bitter hate and I have never forgiven him for it since.\n\nDid he come back? Yep. And not too long after, he and his now ex girlfriend destroyed the kitchen. Only then was my mom mad. He still came back though. The first few months of our move, he even lived with us. Wasn't really improved as he still antagonized people in his drunken state, and even threatened to... Well i can't even say what threatened to do to my underaged girlfriend to my face.\n\nThis was all months ago, and now he lives with a new rich girlfriend and her kids. He has apologized a few times, drunk, but possibly sincere, but he's apologized lots of times. He even apologized after the first time he did it. Whenever my dad brings him back here, I get furious, as he's the only one who wants him back. Everyone says \"He's your brother. Forgive and forget\", but I feel like I never get time away from the dude, and it makes me angry seeing his face after what he's done, and everyone else knowing about it. I am working on moving out, but I do have to ask, am i the asshole for not forgiving him?\n\nInb4: Yes, we are all super fucked up.\n\nI'm sorry for any sloppy writing. I had to pack a crap ton into this and I wasn't sure how to do it the best way. Shakespeare, I am not.",

      "description": "There's only 16 students in my class and it's kind of dominated by this ignorant, arrogant guy. Today we got out posters evaluated and it wasn't good... My best friend put her hand up and said ''I think that if we had known that we didn't HAVE to compete in the competition, we might have done a better job.'' It was my entire country competing in this and I was personally terrified of it as I have anxiety. So we didn't do a good job on purpose. We wanted to lose. Anyway. This guy goes. ''Oh suuuure! I ruined my poster so I wouldn't have to compete! haha! God forbid having to show my poster in front of people!'' My best friend was devasted, she had been humiliated in front of everyone. I said loudly, without looking at anyone: ''Oh sure, why don't you step a little more on people while you're at it.'' (Might be a danish expression)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel that was justified and okay. But then I had a classmate come tell me that I am bullying this other dude. I was shocked. We have a severely overweight guy in my class, who always STINKS (bad) and has ''snow' falling out if his hair. He's perverted in a disgusting way and always practically rubs his belly against everyone. He picked his nose in class, while snot ran down his fingers. I gagged loudly, when he did this. One time i asked my friend something and he started answering. I told him ''shut up, I can't hear what friend is saying. jesus.'' and another time he asked what our project was and i said something along the lines of ''Oh we are feeding the mice shit, to see if it has an affect on their CO2 and methan outlet.'' while rolling my eyes. I just wanted him to leave.   \n\n\nI'm obviously not being nice, but is this bullying? I never say his name, we actually has a code for him...  \nI can come with more examples if you need more information. I really don't want to be a bully, but I'm so sick of these people and since I wasn't the only one, I kind of thought it wasn't a big deal (palm face). I'm sometimes a little harsh, that's how I was raised, I don't notice it until I see people looking at me like: O.O",

      "description": "**TLDR: Neighbor complains that I've given her and her kids ugly bagels, so I stop informing them when the bagels are ready. Kids no longer come by.**\n\nI make bagels on weekends, and I've always shared them with my neighbor and her kids. I text her when they're done, and the kids come over to my apartment, where I let them choose the ones they want. Sometimes they hang out and chat, other times they just leave with bagels in tow. Usually the mom doesn't come, and I remind the kids to take one for her. \n\nLast weekend I was already running late when I was taking them out of the oven, so I didn't text the neighbor. I just grabbed four and put them in a bag that I hung on their door knob. When I get back to my apartment, I see my neighbor has texted me asking if she can come by. She comes with her kids, holding the bag I'd left them. She takes out one of the bagels, and accuses me of purposely giving them the ugly ones. I am in awe. I ask her to give me the bag so I can take a look, and then I tell her to get out. Now she is in awe. Amazing.\n\nThe assholish part is that the bagels are mostly for the enjoyment of the kids. I know that they were not doing the complaining, as they like the \"ugly\" bagels because they have extra crispy ends. When they were standing by their mother, they looked extremely uncomfortable, and the girl looked like she was about to cry when I kicked them out. Although the kids are free to come by on future weekends, I don't plan to text my neighbor anymore, so they don't have a way of knowing that. They didn't come by this weekend and it made me a little sad :(\n\nAITA?",

Anyway, the neice said no to us getting it for her.  We were joking around about sitting on her and getting it, like we did to each other as teenagers, and then we did.  Her mother and I sat on her and held her arms (her mother tried first and then I did).  \n\n\nThinking about it now I think this was wrong as while it was a joke etc., it did violate her bodily autonomy (she is 13).  I called my sister now to discuss and it turns out the neice and the other neice were upset about it.  I offered to apologise and do whatever to make it up to them but my sister said no.  She believes the neice is being 'a drama queen' and that it's 'just a blackhead'.  I agree with yhis on the one hand but I also think it's a dangerous precedent to set.  \n\n\nI don't know if I'm overthinking it or what.  To be clear, the neice wasn't hurt, but is upset about it.\n\n\nWhat do you think and where to from here?",

      "description": "Sorry For bad formatting on mobile\n\n\nI’ve had a friend for a while now and we got into an argument last night. He’s kind of a douche but he’s also a really fun guy to hang out with.\n\nHe is a pretty big douche to people when it comes to making fun of them and making jokes about them. He takes things way to far in that respect (there is this kid that no one really likes and we all kind of pick a little fun at him sometimes, but he takes things way overboard with him. He says things like, your poor, your always riding someone’s dick, calls him an albino monkey, and is just a dick in general), he feels that it’s ok for him to dish out all of the shit, but whenever someone says something negative to him he immediately goes on the defensive and will throw back ruthless things at you, and he is just a dick in general. \n\nAlthough he can be a pretty fun guy to hang out with, I don’t want to paint him like a monster, because he is not. He is really funny in that he can most of the time make some kind of joke that will make anyone laugh and feel better, and he would definitely fuck someone up if they messed with one of his friends.\n\nSo the reason I ended this friendship with him, was last night me and my friend who also hangs out with him, started talking about he can be a jerk sometimes and kind of cross the line. So this conversation was getting a little bit angry and he cam over and attempting at making a joke but was just stared at by us. He then walks away looking confused and I get a text later asking if I’m mad.\n\nI tell him that yes I am mad at him because he has been taking things to far over the last few months. Then he immediately comes back and says that I’m not special, I shouldn’t be getting special treatment, and that someone else doesn’t take it personally like I am. Now take into consideration that this person has been around him way longer than any of my friends have so he has an almost impenetrable skin when it comes to him. \n\nThen we start to go back and forth, me staying strong and telling him that he fucked up, and him taking a bunch of different little things to try and validate his argument, that he was not in fact wrong, that I was being over sensitive. So about an hour later we are still going at it, but at this point I’m just done with him already. He hasn’t proved anything to me except that he can’t take responsibility for his actions.\n\nAnd another thing that irritates me is that he gave two of my other friends apology’s because they didn’t stand up for themselves and call him out on his shit. But he can’t just simply say I’m sorry to me because I was the one that blew up on him. \n\nSo I didn’t want to end this friendship at all, I really liked being around him most of the time, but it’s when he is constantly going off on someone and crossing the line that makes me mad.\n\nSo I’ve presented my case, and it’s time for you guys to decide: Am I the asshole for ending this toxic friendship and getting made at this kid for being a dick?\n",

      "description": "I was hosting a game of Stardew Valley Co-Op and was inviting players from the public discord. Things were going well until I got this one player who immediately asked if there were any girls on the server. One of the players responded in the affirmative and he immediately started hitting on her. He did nothing else besides that. Followed her around the game talking to her, asking her where she lived and other personal questions.\n\nI told him to stop and just play the game as he was contributing nothing to the game and, to be honest with you, he was kind of creeping me out a little. I told him his actions were inappropriate and that he needed to stop. He ignored me and kept at it. So I kicked him from the game.\n\nWhat makes me think ITA is that the other two players, including the girl he was bothering, immediately left my game after that. They all got to talking on the public discord which we were all members of and agreed to play a game without me. Was I in the wrong?",

      "description": "So I am a college student, so is this girl. We met on Tinder and have been talking for a month or so. She said she didn't have an Instagram but did use Snap.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to just a few hours ago, we met for the first time (we were both looking for a relationship and not a hook up). She is beautiful, smart, and charismatic. She had a very nice body too, although in some of her photos she had a 'weird line' down her abdomen that I figured was inappropriate ask about as I only knew her for a month.\n\nSo, we had plans for dinner tonight at a local diner. I got there before her, and went to a table. About five minutes later she comes. I was confused as I could almost 100% guarantee it was her but was like \"it can't be because this woman has a child\". Then, she comes up and says \"Jack?! Hey! It's Melissa\" I kinda nervously said \"hey..\" in a confused way. At first, I figured maybe she was babysitting or this was her unmentioned brother and thought wow she really is into me for still keeping our date (I don't mind kids as I am an elementary education major). Nope.\n\nShe said \"This is Mike, he's my son!\" I was shocked. I just looked at her and she said \"Yea, hes my bundle of joy. Had him at 18\" I said \"Are you serious?\" and she was like \"Yea!! But it's no big deal, if I put him on his iPad he wont make a fuss, and, by the way, sorry for never mentioning him! Sometimes things get hectic in my life\"\n\nI just stood up, looked at her and said \"I'm sorry, I don't think this will work out.\" She was like \"..oh, but I really like you\" and I just said \"Im sorry\" and left.\n\nNow, part of me feels dickish because I have never done that to a girl and try to hold respect for them, but I felt \n\n1) totally lied to \n\n2) betrayed (in a weird sense). I wanted to start my own family some day with a woman who hasn't had kids. Obviously if I was in my late 30s or 40s I would expect it, but I am just a college junior.... plus, I don't want to take on a 'father' responsibility should our relationship get serious over the next 2, 3 years\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So, this morning, my mom and i were playing a  Jeopardy! video game. (If you don't know, It's basically a trivia game, there's questions and if you know the answer, you buzz in).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, all my life, this game, i hate playing it because i always get so frustrated because if there's a question i know, and someone else knows it. I never can buzz in. It's always so frustrating. I hate losing at games like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, i typically perform well because i have a broad range of knowledge. I know a little bit about everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil Today. We played Jeopardy, and the categories were absolute crap. There was, like European history, Greek letters, and not one thing i knew shit about. But, in each round, there were categories she knew, 70s music and country music, because she grew up in the 70s and loves country. I don't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, it was pretty much nothing but me getting beat, and the few questions i did know were common knowledge and she beat me on it. Then, there was one question, it asked about my all time favorite band and favorite song, i asked her to please let me have it. I begged her, but she didn't. She stole my answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI only had, like, 400 points, she had around 3000. There were about 3 questions in a row i knew, but didn't buzz in since i couldn't risk the points loss. The second round was no better, the country music one came up. I asked if she could at least give me the answer to one, so i don't feel like such a dumbass. So i could at least have a chance. I've been far ahead when we've played, and let her get a question in out of fairness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she didn't. i was pretty much on auto-pilot then on. I just huffed and sighed at every question and just set the controller on the floor. I played on my phone during, i just didn't care. I was honestly pretty upset, i wanted to cry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I ended up with negative 5000. So, i threw the controller to the ground and left. She said she felt guilty for winning, and didn't let herself win. She bet all her points on the final and ended up with 0 so i didn't lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am i the asshole here for acting like this? Should she have played nice and let me get at least 1 question right?",

      "description": "Oof, didn’t think this would be my first post on Reddit, but here we go.\n\n3 months ago I broke up with my then-boyfriend (let’s call him B ). I’ll go into more detail about that but first some background. We met when I told my friend (K) that I really liked the idea of D&amp;D. K then introduced me to his D&amp;D group, among them was B. I joined their party and this friendship group became very important to me - as a non binary AFAB person, finally having a predominantly male friend group where I could kick back and be more masculine was very liberating. \n\nAfter 2 years of knowing each other B and I admitted to having feelings for each other. Things went great for the first month, but then we hit rocks.\n\nTo cut a VERY long story short, he didn’t listen to my concerns about the relationship and often wrote them off as me over thinking. Among many things, he clearly wasn’t comfortable with my gender identity. B wouldn’t use my preferred pronouns and never confronted his transphobic best friend when he flung his unwanted opinions on me. B was also much more serious about the relationship than I was. I didn’t expect it to last that long as I was going to be moving 6 hours away in less than a year, B on the other hand thought we were in it for the long run. I only realised this when, after only 2 months together, he told me he was planning to give me a family heirloom for our one year anniversary. \n\nFinally, sex. This was my first sexual relationship and his second. I asked him to take things slow since I had no experience, and he did... for the first few days. Without going into detail he was constantly touching me without asking. He would want to do new things and when I said no, I wasn’t ready yet, he would say ‘but you said a week ago’ ‘but you told me back then’ etc. I only got to see him once a week, if that, and he didn’t like that. He would get upset if I was working a weekend shift and eventually I just felt like I owed him sex, since I might not see him for another fortnight and that obviously upset him.\n\nDespite all this, B was not a bad guy. He was very caring and we’re still friends. At the time I didn’t really understand what was wrong, I only had an overwhelming sense of panic and knew I had to end things with him. I wanted it to be mutual, so I explained how he obviously wanted to be dating a girl, which I was not. He denied it. I explained that my causal dating and his seriously relationship approaches were not compatible. He refused. Eventually I was forced to the last resort, and this is where I become the asshole\n\nI broke up with him over text. Yes, I know that’s terrible, but hear me out. I didn’t mean to. He told me that he was going to take me out to dinner, and I knew there was no way I could see him in person before then. I didn’t want to break up with him after he had bought me dinner, and I didn’t want to do it before hand and then have to either go to dinner anyway or find a way home. I sent him a message saying that we needed to have a serious discussion next time we met. He asked me to tell him what was up, I told him it was a conversation that needed to happen in person, he insisted we talk now and it happened from there. In the end, the only way I could make him agree to break up was by telling him I didn’t love him anymore (not true, but by that point the anxiety the relationship was causing me outweighed my affection for him).\n\nI’m writing this post now as I’ve had time to look back on it all, and recent events have left me wondering if I owe B an apology for how I handled things. I never told him about the sex stuff, and given his dismissiveness for the other problems I don’t know if he realises how much they contributed to the break up. Now that I understand what happened better, should I talk to him about it? To give him a real explanation as to what happened? We’ve gone back to being friends, but only within the D&amp;D group. Do I risk ruining that fragile friendship, and in turn the D&amp;D group, to do what’s right? Is it right to give him an explanation, or is it too late? AITA or are his feelings about it all not my problem?",

      "description": " I (29M) live in an old five-person house - the place could definitely use a cleanup, but it's by no means abnormally messy. It's always been a welcoming and drama-free house.\n\nA new couple (25M, 23F) moved in a few weeks ago. They're generally nice people, but they’ve repeatedly raised many issues about the house. I could name 10-15 without too much trouble, but a few examples include:\n\n\\- the internet is too slow (10+ times)\n\n\\- there's too many spices / bottles etc on the kitchen shelves (10+ times)\n\n\\- the bin / stovetop / cupboard / drawer / fridge etc is not clean enough (I've lost count)\n\nThey certainly have a right to be happy in their own home, but I feel like I'm constantly being nagged. I eventually asked Guy to tone it down a bit - he was surprised, but we had a good chat and I thought that was the end of it. Happy days.\n\nFast forward a couple of days, Guy goes out of town for the weekend. Girl comes to me and insists that they were, in fact, not complaining. She said that \"not having a filter\" is part of her personality, and that her \"goal\" in life is actually to become \"even more annoying\" (your guess is as good as mine). She insisted that I had misinterpreted her comments, or that she hadn’t said them at all.\n\nAfter ten minutes of this I was getting quite frustrated. Trying to put things into perspective, I told her that she had complained more in the past few weeks than every other housemate combined over the past year (not proud of that one, but it’s true). She said if it’s such a big problem then they’ll move out. This felt disproportionately dramatic but I backed off.\n\nShe then group messages the house saying “It’s been brought to my attention that you all have a serious issue with me and Guy”. She reinforces that it only “seemed like” she was complaining, and she’s sorry if we misinterpreted her “jokes” or “suggestions”. Not only was she dramatically escalating a minor disagreement, but also implying that the issue was entirely with us. Instead of accepting the ‘apology’, I doubled down and made it clear that I stand by what I said.\n\nLater, hoping to diffuse a bit of tension, I cleaned out the kitchen shelves and hoped that it might be seen as a peace offering.\n\nGuy gets home from out of town - he’s angry. He’s under the strong impression that I waited for him to leave for the weekend then ambushed his girlfriend with accusations. This is simply not true. She insists that I started it and has very much painted me as the asshole, calling me things like smug and ‘the worst kind of person on the planet’ (because I stood my ground). He seems oblivious to how dramatic she’s being. She also told me off for cleaning the shelves, claiming that I’d missed the point.\n\nMy other housemates (30F, 31F) are staying out of it as best they can, and aren’t willing to back me up in case it creates a bigger rift in the house. This is a bit frustrating, but I respect their decision.\n\nAm I the asshole? How do I best deal with this situation?",

      "description": "\nNeed to know whether im crazy or what. Me female [22], dating a male [23], i have dated him in past (1yr) and i was a mean/stubborn person therefore we broke up but he wasnt an angel himself. After going back in and out of getting back together we have started to date once again (1month in). We dont really truth eachother as i have heard stories from him of him doing certain things with girl from a club and how many times have they done it which still bothers me because i don't understand why would he tell me these things in detail and that friend who has a gf did it with the friend of that girl... The real question is, he wants to go out with his friend and him and another friend(single) wont be drinking, also there will be a third person who has a gf but he has always cheated on her and have done certain things with my bf with other girls while we were not in relationship which i obviously am aware of.\n\nSo am crazy for not wanting him to go out in two weeks time? He wanted to break up with me over this because i go out... and he doesnt, he has never ever went out while being in rel with me and he does not drink whatsoever. I have drank and went out, its not unusual for me. Also i have mentioned that i find it weird that he wants to go out sober and he doesnt even dance and in a club where all girls dress like..... . So once again am i going crazy lol\n(His reason is because it was the single guys birthday,  so after dinner they want to go out) and i asked why club? And his answer is to dance and have fun... sober? A guy who doesnt dance? Or everrrrr goes out? \n\nBit of a backstory: right now our rel is unstable as we are only back to dating properly after a year or on and off. We dont do much together, he works and then goes to gym so basically in the end he comes home at half 9 in the evening, he eats we talk and or intense cuddling, then we basically sleep. He has work on the weekend too which i end up not seeing him at all which i was used to from the beginning. In the end we dont rlly do anything just feels like he doesnt want to lose me and thats it. On that note, i used to live in another town and i moved back home because i decided to get away from him but he basically manipulated me into saying that we should look for a place together and that he wants to be with me, before me moving back to my moms place he didnt even talk about moving in together again until i moved further away from him. I just always feel worn out, i think im just in love with the past of our first year relationship and this person im with right now is a complete stranger... should i give more time? Am i coocoo ? Help a potentially crazy lady out lol. Probably this post is all over the place as im emotional at the moment, sorry.\n\nTL;DR: So am crazy for not wanting him to go out? He wanted to break up with me over this because i go out... and he doesnt, he has never ever went out while being in rel with me and he does not drink whatsoever.",

He wouldn't say what he needed the money for and only said he was \"calling a friend in a time of need\". He said he called the other guys and got some help from them. He promised to pay it back in pieces over the the course of the year.  I've know this guy for over a decade but we've grown distant over the years and maybe speak once every few months. We were close in school but we haven't met in over 4 years since he moved far away. He started a new business and tried to rope me in but the pitch seemed like an MLM scheme (I might be completely wrong about this); and I was busy with other project anyway. But that didn't sour our already frail friendship and we spoke a couple of times since then. He's a very social guy and has a ton of friends who are very well off than either of us. My wife thinks he was out of line. She thinks considering our history, he could have been open to me about his reasons rather than just demanding 3k, no questions asked, by end of the day. AITA? ",

      "description": "I'm 19, and my family is really hard to buy gifts for. My Dads interests are football and rewatching Seinfield episodes over and over. My mom's is giraffes and God. When I was younger, this made gift giving easy, especially when I was on a budget given by my own parents. Buy a football movie. Buy a giraffe plushie. Easy peasy.\n\nHowever, as I've gotten older, I've been more stumped for gifts. My family at some point got tired of gift giving and decided to only ever do \"stocking stuffers\". This rule is in title only, as it literally never holds true on Christmas morning. Well, this year I have my own job for the first time ever. A part time retail job. Not great, but it's a college student job and I dont mind it. Since I now have an income of my own, I decided to do something a bit less traditional. Not throw away crappy gifts that are as impersonal as a Christmas card, something nice.\n\nI decided to put aside about 150$ to treat both my parents to dinner(wherever the hell they want) something I knew they would love since they constantly talk about family \"togetherness\" despite being questionably dysfunctional. However, my mother will not stop badgering me about buying things for my father, even though I've told her that I have a big gift for both of them this year. She is upset with me that I have not purchased anything physical yet as \"evidence\" that I have thought of them for Christmas this year. (They dont know I'm taking them out as my gift)\n\nShe seems to be already insulted by this prospect. I worry that they will resent me for this gift and I am concerned if I should just instead opt for doing traditional gifts instead.\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

Our whole relationship revolves around poking at each other in a joking manner and making fun of each other. \n\nWell one day I was in a bad mood and the jokes were getting a little too close to home, I didn’t mind too much as I’ve crossed the line a few times with my playful insults too. But then, my sister in law decided to join in and said some things a little more hurtful so I slightly snapped and made a remark about how she’s put on weight since she got married. As you can imagine she didn’t like that one bit, got really offended and excused herself from the room and started crying. \n\nMy brother called me a dick and said that was out of order. I didn’t understand why everyone was so outraged. She knew that we all insulted each other and that if you received an insult you sling one back. Am I really the asshole for treating her the way I treat my bro and cousin. I feel like she thought she could get away with no return insults because she “isn’t part of the group” or something. \n\nTL;DR me and my bro are insulting each other, my sister in law insults me, I insult her back with a bit of hurtful truth on it and suddenly I’m the asshole.\n",

So obviously when I snapped out of my daydream I noticed the woman and immediately got up and apologised. The lady who hit me looked pissed and was probably muttering about lazy teenagers or something but I couldn’t hear her because I was still blasting Magic Shop through my earbuds.

I would see/hear her almost every day, and just get annoyed again and again.\n\nI think the anger built up, because one night I was out with my wife and some friends, and there she was, mutilating something from West Side Story, iirc.  And. The. Train. Would. Not. Come.  Finally, I broke from the pack, went over to her, and said, \"If I give you a dollar, will you stop singing?\"  She looked predictably hurt, and confused, and said something about having classical training.  I just told her that I don't know much about music, but something is definitely off here.\n\nSo she took the money, and stopped singing.  Meanwhile, my wife was **mortified** (to this day, if I mention it, she gets freshly pissed off again).

I'll go with Call*Bart™️. I work full time as an overnight stocker and frankly, it is very monotonous. I've struggled with mental health issues and my doctor even tried prescribing me medication when I was 13 but I was scared of that idea and haven't been checked by a medical professional since. Working 10-7, 5 days a week, has been emotionally taxing to almost my breaking point several times. I have never called off for myself, I called off twice because road conditions made it impossible to leave my house (rural area of upstate NY baby) and once for my ill mother and mentally ill sister to take care of them (mental illness is a big thing in my family, my dad is medicated for it as well.) \n\nA big problem I never foresaw working weekends was my friend group. I mostly spend time with two friends, Matt and Kade (don't care enough to give y'all fake names). I've spent every Friday night into Saturday morning at Matt's house for well over a year, and we've been regularly hanging out since we were 4 years old. Kade is almost always there as well. Matt is a confident, attractive, well-adjusted individual who has supported everything I do my entire life. I'm nervous, meek, submissive and non-confrontational. He has helped me through all of these problems. I have spent exactly one night at his house since the start of the job, and have not seen either of them in 2 months.\n\nI don't expect them to be able to give me a weekend off or lower my hours in order to give me the time I need to fully recover, but would I be the asshole for even asking? I was asked to cover weekends specifically and said I could do it. I'm just not sure how much longer I can persist like this. I'm really scared of the future if it's always like this for me. Also, does anyone who works for Walmart know if there are programs that would give me the mental rest I need? Thanks everyone.",

      "description": "New to reddit, so I apologize if the formatting is off. So a bit of background. I’m new to my career (I’m a lawyer), and moved back home to live with my parents. Where I’m working is about five minutes away from my parents house, and they had the room, so it wasn’t a big deal. \n\nMy parents, who are close to retiring, want to knock down our house in six months in order to build a bigger house for their retirement. The house we live in now only has two bedrooms and they “want more room for future grandchildren.” So as a result of this demolition, they will need a new place to rent for a year as the new house is being built (I will be moving in with my girlfriend in six months, so no issue there). \n\nMy boss is an extremely influential person in the area I live. She has been amazing to me for the short period of time I have worked there. We really have a mentor/mentee relationship going, and I genuinely enjoy going to work every day. I told my boss about my parents knocking down their house and needing a place to rent.  My boss mentioned to me that she has a vacant house on the same block as her own that she rents out. \n\nI (stupidly) mention to my parents that my boss has a house she rents out, and that it may be available. They become extremely receptive to the rental, and begin questioning me about the particulars. Now this may not seem like a big deal, but my family is slightly insane. My dad has an explosive temper, and by explosive I mean there’s a reality that the neighbors could call the police. He is never physically violent, but the man has a voice that can shake a house. \n\nThe more I think about what I have done, the more I realize that I may have messed up. My parents begin questioning me every day about this house, when my boss only mentioned it in passing. Then my parents passingly run into my boss in town. They had never met before. My parents introduce themselves, and then immediately ask about the house. \n\nAfter learning about this encounter through my boss, I confront my parents. I tell them that I’m not comfortable with the situation and it is putting my professional life at risk if something was to happen. I tell them that if they do not drop this, I will voice those concerns to my boss. My parents become extremely insulted by this and will barely speak to me. To make matters worse, they are struggling to find another rental house in the same neighborhood  due to the fact that we have a dog. There has even been talk about them wanting me to move out (not a big deal, but still a slap in the face). Am I the asshole here? \n",

She says at least 2 hours daily. I don't think it's feasible, and told her so. She got pushed off at this at told me she should be my first priority. I don't think so, and told her so. She accused me of not caring. I explained to her, I'm a double major, D1 tennis player, on the debate team, and have a portfolio to manage. I told her I take time out of my day every day to talk to her, and that she should be happy about that instead of asking me to spend more and more time with her. She got angry at this.\n\nAita?",

      "description": "*I want to preface this post by saying that I've been on the fence about whether to post or not. I re-wrote it twice because I don't want it to come across like I'm looking for validation. I'm not. I'm feeling incredibly guilty right now and think I might be the a-hole.*\n\nLast weekend we had dinner at my inlaws' house. Much to my chagrin, my sister in law was there. To give some background on her, she's recovering from a meth addiction. Years ago she hit rock bottom and we ended up with custody of our nephew. There was a lot at play in him coming to live with us (mental instability, actual physical abuse, etc.), but the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nWhen we got him, he was a timid, nervous and anxious little kid. He would flinch the instant anyone turned to talk to him or tried to hand him something. He was scared to tell us when he was hungry or thirsty and was constantly asking if he was behaving. It was heartbreaking. \n\nToday, he's a tremendous young man in his early 20's. He has his associates degree and is very independent. He shares an apartment with my oldest son, so my wife and I see a lot of him. We're both so proud of the adult that he's become and we try to make sure that we support his dreams. We truly see him as one of our kids, and we'd do anything to make sure he's living his best life.\n\nUnfortunately, his mother can crush his spirit in a heartbeat. All he wants is her approval, and she shames and rejects him constantly. Over the course of her many recovery attempts, she made a conversion to Christianity and her views became ultra conservative. She rants against abortion and the lgbtq community. My nephew happens to be gay, and she makes it clear that she doesn't approve. \n\nBack to the dinner. She went off on one of her tangents at the dinner table. Then she tried to turn her rage toward my nephew but I quickly shut her down. I didn't say anything, I just snapped my fingers and pointed at her with a pretty outraged expression. It was awkward but it diffused the situation.\n\nAfter dinner she went outside to smoke a cigarette, so I followed her outside and tried to talk to her about what happened. She made a snide remark about my wife and me taking everything she loved away from her (referring to the custody fight over my nephew) and I just erupted. I can be very direct when I have to be, and I felt like it was appropriate in this instance.\n\nI could feel the emotions swelling inside me and boiling over. Every bad memory from all those years ago came back to me. It felt like I was back in my hallway, listening from outside the bedroom door while my little nephew cried and begged God to fix his life. I know I said some very harsh things but they were all true. And honestly, it felt cathartic. I didn't yell at all. I just spoke in matter of fact tones, but I was harsh.\n\nAt first my SIL didn't say a word, she just stood there with tears rolling down her cheeks. My wife came outside just in time to catch the tail end of my rant. My SIL went inside and grabbed her purse, then came back outside and told us, \"I'm trying my best.\" Then she got in her car and drove away. We left shortly after her and spotted her pulled over on the side of the road, still in the neighborhood. She was sitting in her car with her head hung in shame. I felt a massive wave of guilt roll over me that I still can't shake. I wanted to stop and make sure she was okay but my wife told me to keep going.\n\nSince then I can't shake the feeling that I bullied someone who's struggling. When she wasn't addicted to drugs, she was a caring and empathetic human being who loved everyone, but especially her son. Her life has taken several erratic turns, and I'm truly rooting for her to get it together. But I felt so desperate to protect my nephew from her in that I couldn't think straight. My inlaws aren't upset with me at all and my nephew actually came over and thanked me for standing up to her. Still, I feel so guilty for my actions, and for how I made her feel.\n\nAITA for going off on my SIL who's recovering from a serious meth addiction?\n\nTL;DR: I went off on my sister in law this weekend. She struggles with mental illness and is a recovering drug addict. I'm feel like the worst person in the world right now. ",

      "description": "My girlfriend has a tomato allergy, but thankfully, not one that would be life threatening. She would, however, be sick for a few days, and in high enough concentration, break out in hives. \nWe like going to Blaze Pizza since she enjoys the white or pesto pizzas, but we have a few requirements of them. They would need to change gloves, use a clean peel and paddles, and a clean cutter.  Now, in case you’ve never been there, Blaze makes personal pizzas in a line system, kinda like Chipotle, where several people would man a certain station of the line. Because tomato sauce is such a prevalent ingredient, and a lot of people handle the pizza, inevitably at least one person will make a mistake (e.g. using a cutter that was just used on another pizza). When this happens, they’ll usually apologize and remake the pizza.  Then they let us keep the old pizza (which I save for later) and sometimes they’ll even give us a gift card for a free one. Seriously, I’ve gotten so many free pizzas out of this. \nAm I wrong for gaming the system like this (and also causing their line to slow down sometimes)?\nNote: I never try to get them to intentionally make a mistake. We always tell them our requirements in detail. I just see it as a happy accident when it happens, which is most of the time. ",

      "description": "Throw away account obviously. But if she sees this and knows I'm talking about her. Good.\n\nI (41) have been best friends with her (32) for 8 years. Since my son was 12.\n\nMy son (20) had just had his first big real heartbreak ever. I told her about this. In detail, she's my best friend. (We haven't lived near each other in a couple of years and she came to visit last summer and he was home from college) I thought they were weirdly friendly considering he's my son and she knew him as a 12 year old but they are both friendly people.\n\nWhen I noticed him constantly texting her and knew how vulnerable he was feeling after above mentioned heartbreak I asked him if something was going on? He said no, I didn't want to intrude too much but asked her to \"cut back\" on the friendly chatter with my kid. She said okay.\nShe goes home I notice they are STILL texting constantly. I mention it to him again and he loses his shit saying I'm being controlling. So I tell her thinking she's an adult and a mom and will understand. I say hey I think (my son) is getting the wrong idea and you know he just had his heart broken. I know this sounds silly but I really need you to respect my friendship and my concern for my son and just cold turkey stop talking to him.\nShe was very apologetic, said she didn't realize, okay, done.\n\nThis was last summer.\n\nToday I find out they are still talking. I get upset confront them both. Find out they HAD SEX LAST SUMMER. MY best friend and my son.\n\nWhat the fuck.\n\nAm I overreacting here? I find this very predatory on her part and disturbing. I've always noticed that she tends to like to lead guys on and I try and stay out of it. I was concerned there was some leading on flirtation going on from the beginning which is why I confronted her and said please stop \n\nNot only have they had sex, it was ONGOING. He flew out to see her behind my back! All of this while she's talking to me like none of this is happening and he's doing the same.\n\nHe says it was stupid, it's over, they are only friends now.\nThis is a grown ass woman with a divorce and 3 kids. He's a 20 year old college student who has had very few relationships in his life. \n\nShe knew every detail of his recent heartbreak. She knows way more about him than he knew about her because she's my best friend and we talk about our kids!\n\nTell me straight up am I being an overdramatic momma bear or is she a predatory selfish bitch?\n\nBonus points if she sees this and knows it's about her because fuck you. \n\nTL:DR my best friend (32) had sex with my son (20) and an ongoing \"relationship\" behind my back and expressly against my asking them both to cut ties.

      "description": "Hi reddit.  \n\n\nSo I've been living in this house (5 bedrooms) for a couple of years. People have come and gone and the group we have right now is pretty good, we get along well. But I feel as though some of my roommates, and one in particular, is really inconsiderate.  \n\n\nI live in a converted room just next to the kitchen, and sharing a wall with the living room. I understand these are common areas and I never want to make someone feel as though they can't use them, but whenever someone is in those rooms, I can pretty much hear their entire conversation. They know this because I've (playfully) heckled them before from my room. I also understand that everyone has different schedules as we're all students or working shifts, but I feel as though this is even more of a reason to be more considerate of others sleep schedules (because anyone might be sleeping at any time). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo one of my roommates is recently single, and has been having guys over often at all hours. No, it's not the sex noises. But yesterday, for example, I woke up at 1:45 to an unknown man's voice in the kitchen. I could hear her talking as well, and as I fully woke up I heard music playing (albeit quietly). She decided to start cooking at 1:30 in the morning. I won't pretend to know her schedule, but she's often sleeping in late and regularly works closing shifts (10 pm). I'll admit I'm not the deepest sleeper, but my problem comes when I've already been asleep for a couple hours and then get woken up, and suddenly am no longer tired enough to sleep, especially with noise going on. I eventually fell back asleep when they went upstairs, but then woke up again when she came down to flip whatever she was cooking, and half an hour later when the oven alarm went off (she clearly has a phone, why couldn't she use that?). I also worry because in the past this particular roommate has left the stove on overnight (she did/does drugs) and I think now my body wakes up to everything in fear of it being the tiny click of the stove reheating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand the kitchen is a common area, and people use it at all hours. But am I wrong in assuming after midnight (at the latest on a weekday) should be somewhere where you go grab a glass of water, make a quick midnight snack and gtfo? Not meal prep for the week while listening to music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've tried talking to her about this, having texted her. Her responses in the past have been, \"I get it you need to be up in the morning but not everyone does\" (at 3 am after inviting a bunch of friends over on a Friday night knowing I had an 8 am start on Saturday). She has also told me to stop being passive aggressive by texting her to quiet down (it's 2am, I'm in bed and naked. I'm not getting up and dressed to tell you to be a decent person). Last night I messaged her telling her \"You've woken me up twice now, I have work early tomorrow. It's not weird that I'm going to wake up to the sound of a strange man in my house.\" and she didn't respond. Haven't seen her since. I work shifts but most days with 8am-10 am starts. I'd love to wake up at 6-7 and make breakfast and enjoy my morning, but always find myself sleeping in til the last moment because of the disruptions.

A few friends and I have this little tradition with watching GoT where we go to one of their houses each week and watch the new episodes as they come out. This has been going on for a few years and we've been pretty pumped to watch the finale together for just as long now. It's great fun and a good way to see them as I don't get the chance all that often.\n\nI mentioned this little tradition of ours to my girlfriend before we even started watching GoT so that she wouldn't be surprised by it, however when she brought it up last night she seemed pretty upset that I hadn't changed my mind about not watching the newest season with her and with my friends as intended.\n\nSo WIBTA if I choose to stick to tradition and not watch the newest season with my girlfriend?\n\nTldr: Girlfriend is upset that I'm choosing to watching newest season of GoT with my friends as we have a tradition for it, even after we plan on binging it up until release.",

The responses I received were quite resentful, nor did I believe that their offers were anything near sensible.\n\nAlthough I sure they already knew, I did mention multiple times that if things went south, they could find themselves in a much worst position. In the end, they provided me with a final offer, stating that any further correspondence would be forwarded to their lawyer.\n\nDespite being their best offer, I still couldn’t find it reasonable and now after a month’s time going back and forth, messing me around, I lost my patience with them and began the legal proceedings.\n\nThey have now caught wind of this as have attempted to reopen our discussion again, wanting me to cancel the proceedings, matching my lowest offer, now in a slightly more friendly tone. At this point, I’m no longer interested and want to continue this for two core reasons;\n\n* I feel that they could repeat this event to someone else in the future and I’d like to be some form of incentive to prevent them from trying it again.\n\n* Although I’d like my money returned to me, it’s not really a huge deal to me anymore and I’m more motivated by the fact knowing that they’ll be facing bigger consequences going forward.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "It must feel to her like it's out of the blue, we met at uni and were dating about 2 years but graduated 6 months ago. I walked into a job I had lined up in London, she went to her home town and got a temporary position in a supermarket. Initially our plan was that she stays at home for a couple of months to pass her driving test and then moves to London and we both have jobs and separate apartments in London. Then as it slowly became 6 months not the planned 2 the plan morphs to become the same apartment in London, then it became only me with a job and her contributing from her substantial inheritance while she looks for that perfect job. \n\nAnd one day recently I just decided that I don't want that. I actually want to be dating someone who is an independent woman not a stay at home girlfriend  who has a top degree but doesn't know what she wants in life. As far as contributing financially, I'm hugely sceptical - for our entire uni career she never touched that money, I'd invite her on dates (the rule I work by is one person invites the other, gets to choose the place and then pays, I find this is a good way to feel like one of you is treating the other but also gets to budget it by choosing a venue), but she'd never invite me, I'd invite her to the movies, to shows, night in with take out and a film, buy random gifts etc, but I don't feel like it was even closely matched by her wanting to do things with me. Partly because she didn't want to to dip into that fund and had no other money. But honestly it's not about the money, everything we ever did, we did because I suggested it, even our conversation felt like a constant stream of me trying to be funny and witty and her laughing along, or me discussing a film we watched and trying to analyse why it was amazing/awful and her agreeing. I genuinely still don't know what her dissertation was about because it's \"hard to explain\".\n\nSo there I was with this girl who is very sweet, very pretty but I just feel like I get basically nothing from this relationship. Its not bad just empty, like playing ping-pong with the table up so you play against your self. It's pretty fun for a long time if you like ping-pong, but eventually you want someone to challenge you. And teach you something.\n\nSo now I'm worried I've broken some poor girls heart (she's very upset) all because I think that sometimes I also deserve to be treated like a princess. ",

For the most part, we are really good friends and hang out all the time, it's just that living with each other in such close space has it's ups and downs. \n\nOur first semester, I got away with only one class before 10 once a week and I didn't have a job. They both had to get up early. While they were up they would turn on one of the lights to get ready by, talk to each other, and even use a hair dryer. I usually got woken up for a few minuets, burried my head, and went back to sleep. \n\nNow second semester, I have a job and a.m classes. I get up about 6:30-7 every day, most days I am out of the dorm before they wake up. One day a week I cross over with one of them. I figured, since turning the light on, and making noise was okay for them, it would be okay for me, right? Wrong. I am not purposefully loud at all, I try to be pretty far away from a fucking hair dryer. I only turn the light on when needed, otherwise I use my flashlight. \n\nNow one in particular is mad at me because he says I make to much noise and the light is to bright when they did it every fucking day even after I asked them not to. On the day when I had cross over with my other roommate (this morning) him and I talked quietly a little, and my roommate said it was completely innappropriate and we were rude as fuck.\n\nI feel like if they were even worse every single day last semester even when I asked them to just do their hair in the bathroom, me making as little noise as possible and following an even kinder version of rules than the ones they set is perfectly acceptable, and my roommate is just being way to sensitive.",

      "description": "I was diagnosed with leukemia in December and it's been quite rough. I have just begun treatment and I'm trying to graduate at the same time. It has been very stressful but I have tried to keep it together and be positive. Being posititive has been the hardest part and that leads to fights between me and those who are closest to me.\n\nMy mother is constantly on my case about my diet and doctors visits. She is always telling me what I should eat (including alternative medicine) and giving me books about cancer. I have no interest in changing my diet and adding anything because I have just started my treatment and my doctors don't recommend anything else (like curcumin which my mother insisted I take as pills).\n\nToday, after a routine doctors appointment, my mother asked if I told the doctor that I have been feeling bad lately. I told her no, I was starving and just wanted to get out of there. She was telling me that I should have told him that and that maybe he could have given me something. Since I have complained to my doctor previously and he has told me that it's normal and the pills are working, I didn't think he could do anything. I was quite stressed already and told my mom not to get on my nerves and she hung up.\n\nSame thing happened when my boyfriend asked about the doctors appointment. He told me that I should have told him about how bad I have been feeling. He took it to next level and said hurtful things about me. That why do I even go to the doctor if I'm just going to sit there quietly (I go there every week to get my blood drawn and checked) and made me feel useless. We got into a huge fight because I am really stressed and couldn't hold my temper. I was feeling like nobody really cares about my well-being and they just want me to lie so they don't have to worry. My boyfriend even told me that I should have lied to him about talking to the doctor so that we could have avoided the fight. \n\nI know that they are worrying but they are just adding to my stress and I couldn't take it anymore. Am I a bad person for it?",

      "description": "Background: Both my girlfriend I 16 16, we started dating a little under a year ago. She has two sisters, one is 15, the other is 13(?). Her father is in the picture, but only superficially (he doesn't really do anything when it comes to parenting or care), the youngest sister has multiple learning disabilities that've been untreated (not going to go in depth for a multitude of reasons), same thing with my girlfriend and the middle sister. Her mother is the one who handles pretty much everything, and her mother (my girlfriend's grandmother) helps whenever there's a need.  \n\n\nStory: The middle sister has been very much a trouble child. She has yelled, pushed, and hit both her mother and my girlfriend, the youngest is not included in this, and the middle sister is scared of her father. She (the middle sister) has berated my girlfriend multiple times to the point of curling into the fetal position and has also physically fought with her too. She doesn't put in any effort with her classes (she's in 8th grade, don't want to go into depth for legal/length of post reasons), and has been doing this for a couple years. She has caused my girlfriend a great deal of trauma, to the point that she's afraid of going to a psychologist or psychiatrist because she thinks she'll be put into an institution for what she says. The reason I know all of this is because her mother treats me like a peer, rather than her daughter's girlfriend (which is something that concerns me to a decent degree). She has lied about minuscule and important things directly to her parents', her sisters', and my face. Her lies usually deflect blame on any negative events involving her to her family and random events.  \n\n\nMy question: Do I stand up for my girlfriend and her mother?

      "description": "Now, the title sounds like the basic \"this friendship is toxic\" sob story, but theres a little more to it, so I'm gonna make this short and to the point. On mobile so sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nSo my best friend (known now as \"K\") and I dance together and the group is so close, we are basically sisters. Me and K have a duet so we are a little bit closer, we have also been best friends since we were 8 and 9 ( I am a year older than her) \n\nSo K started grade 9 this year (I know, a yute, shes 14) and shes changed for the worse. She used to be chipper, and upbeat, had very religious beliefs and an overall classic \"good kid\". Now, shes hanging out with the wrong crowd that peer pressured her into drinking, and drugs(weed and crack), and sex, and shes always moody and doesnt take anything seriously anymore. Shes also failing 3 classes\n\nI know people change but I dont like my friend has become. Everyone knows her as the drugged out slut. I love her obviously, but she wont listen to me when I tell her she cant keep doing this and going down this path. I've been telling her all year, and so has my whole dance group, and it's only gotten worse. I think if I back off and stop being friends with her she'll realize the mistake she made on her own, and hopefully get back on her feet. \n\nI need to know if I would be an ass to stop being friends with her when she needs alot of good influences around her right now. So, WIBTA? \n",

The gist of it is that I found a post by someone called thotvengers saying it was racist to see Into the Spider-Verse for anything except Miles Morales. Someone had already added a meme to the post telling thotvengers to chill, so I added to the chain by throwing in my two cents. I said that there is no wrong reason to like a good movie.\n\nOne of thotvengers' friends asked them if they could drag me for what I said and thotvengers said something along the lines of \"Go ahead; I want to do it too\". I felt ganged up on and was scared that I might become the target of the next Tumblr witch hunt, so I decided to flee that situation. Deleting a Tumblr post does basically nothing so, I hid my blog, blocked thotvengers and their supporters, turned off anons, and closed my DMs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter seeing such intense backlash, I've started to doubt myself. Am I racist? Is what I said harmful? Am I a coward for running from this situation and not letting them respond to me?",

I've always respected her views, went to classes and church occasionally but I don't think I ever see myself changing. \n\nRecently though (yesterday) her parents have found out that we've been having sex after all this time and have spoken with her and she's decided to abstain. We met up yesterday to talk about it and I stupidly said that I would to try work things out but in reality and with more time thinking about it I can't see it working in the long run. Plus I don't feel that we would be getting married anytime soon.\n\nIt seems like such a crazy thing to break up over, but sex is an important part of a relationship and it's not something I'm willing to wait out so I guess we're not compatible. I feel like such an dickhead to break up with her because of this but I don't want to string her along for the next few months, get no sex. Then make the breakup worse because we might fight over this and shes thinking that it could work out.",

      "description": "I feel like this is a common one that a lot of people go through. I was always forced from a young age to go to church with my family. At first, around the ages of 4-13, I really didn't mind, I even enjoyed going. After a while, though I started to feel like it was just a waste of my time. At around 14 I told my parents I didn't really want to go to church anymore, I was not enjoying it and a lot of stuff happened inside of the youth program that even looking back now was pretty messed up. They said that I was a kid and I could make my own decisions when I'm 18 and an adult, but until then I had to go, it was not a choice. Of course, I didn't like this answer and we had multiple arguments about it for the next few years almost every Sunday. Them forcing me to go only drove me further away from the church as well as themselves. I am 19 now and now have some say over if I go to church with them or not (it seems like a 50/50 shot). problem is when they do let me stay home, it's not without a solid guilt-tripping. Most of which is along the lines of \"I'm not going to have you forever, come spend time with me.\" I usually tell my parents that I'm 100% willing to spend time with them, I would just really prefer if it was not at the church. I do actually plan on moving across the country soon as well, so, me spending time with my family right now is pretty important to both of us. I should also mention that roughly half of the time I do go to church just to spend time with them, I just don't want to go every week.   \n\n\nI feel like a compromise between us would be the best thing to work this out, but I want to know..\n\n**AMTA** for not wanting to go with my family even though I'm moving soon? Are my parents the assholes for guilt-tripping me for staying home? Or do they have a valid point because I am leaving soon?   \n\n\n(sorry if this was a mess of a post, first time posting something like this on Reddit)",

      "description": "Simple enough, but I'll tell the full story if you want to hear it. I'm so incredibly torn on this and can't figure out what to do or whether or not I would be an asshole for potentially destroying a relationship and this poor guy's trust issues forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShort version, I have one hundred percent certainty that my ex has cheated on her new long term boyfriend. She was incredibly unfaithful to me, and the boyfriend before me, and the list goes on. Her new boyfriend lives in the apartment above me, and I listen to them have sex every night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong version: I am currently a fifth year in college. My sophomore year, a freshman girl and I started dating. The start of the relationship was suspicious in itself because she had been dating a guy for two years and then started \"seeing\" me without telling me that she had a boyfriend. I found out about two weeks into us regularly hanging out and her taking me to a concert with tickets she won. She broke up with him and we started dating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to about a year in, and I go abroad for two months and I start to notice some issues. She stops responding to my texts, starts giving me one word replies. I start to worry a bit, but I'm so hopelessly in love with this girl at this point that I just find every excuse to say things are okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come back from abroad and I notice things are very different. She talks constantly about different guys she's friends with, and things build and build and build until one day I walk in to her room (i had a key to her apartment since I came over all the time) and see her laying in bed cuddling with another guy. They weren't making out or having sex or anything, but still, cuddling. He leaves, and she pours her heart out to me telling me how much she loves me. I convince myself it's okay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo weeks later, We're about to go to bed at her place, she puts her phone down on her desk and I see that she has sent a text to the same guy saying \"goodnight, I love you.\" full stop. Same thing happens, she loves me and only me, I convince myself things are okay, we move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething similar happens with FIVE DIFFERENT GUYS. FIVE. I shouldve broken it off after the first, but like I said, i was so emotionally dependent on this girl that my mind did so many gymnastics to convince myself that things were okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, after a year of this, she breaks up with me. About a month later, she starts dating one of the guys she was telling me not to worry about. This was back in October of last year. She went abroad herself in March of this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a month ago, an acquaintance of mine that went abroad with her who was good friends with her says he wants to talk to me because he needs to vent about something and didn't know who else to go to. So I see him and he tells me everything. That they used to be friends but he's seen how selfish and immature a person she is and he couldn't stand to be around her. That she was in this relationship with this boy the entire time yet she wouldn't stop talking about how she was convinced her project partner liked her or this other guy or this other guy. Then he drops on me that while they were at a club, he saw her making out with a random guy on the dance floor. He went up to them and broke them apart and dragged her out of the club. The first thing she said to him was \"tonight didn't happen.\" This guy has absolutely no reason to be lying, and I know him to be a very honest and trustworthy person, so even though I might be biased, I can assure you that I trust him 100%, and if he said she's done this, I'm pretty confident she has.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, she had that same friend take a picture of her next to a sign that said \"LOVE\" and SENT IT TO THE BOYFRIEND. The fucking day after she cheated on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's now back and her and I are both in our senior year, while her now sophomore boyfriend lives on the floor above me. We're not friends by any means, but he's such a nice guy, and, in my humble but biased opinion, he deserves much better than her. But, meanwhile, she sleeps over his place, directly above the room I asked her out in three years ago, and I get to listen to them fucking, EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. I'm currently typing this at 1am because I can't focus on my homework over the sound of the thumping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to tell him everything. Everything she did to me, everything she did to the previous guys, and everything she's done to him. I want him to know so that he doesn't make the same mistake that I did. Would I be justified in calling him down sometime and telling him everything, or am I just acting on impulse? This has been wracking my brain for months and any guidance would really help.",

      "description": "I have had 3 serious girlfriends, now 4. My first relationship was in college and that ended when I went to grad school. I cheated on my grad school girlfriend with my ex. I cheated on my grad school girlfriend with a lot of people. I wasn't ready to be tied down. When she broke up with me, I tried to get her back in any way I could. She says now that this was stalking. I held her down one time and she says that I choked her but I don't remember these things so clearly. I do not think she's lying, I just don't remember how everything went down. That was a very hard break up for me and I didn't date anyone seriously for a long time after that. I was definitely an asshole to other women but nothing too serious. Then I met my third girlfriend. I was an asshole to her at first and I cheated on her but she stuck up for herself and I quickly fell in love with her. We were quite a match made in heaven. But she never seemed to fully trust me. She had very bad anxiety attacks being with me. At first, I started just holding her down but then it became more physical. I ended up bruising her multiple times and then hitting her in her face giving her a black and blue eye. I wanted the relationship to end. When she finally was leaving, a lightbulb turned on in my head and I realized how awful I was treating her. I begged for her back. She took me back but she never could forgive me. She kept breaking up with me and getting back together. I think she became abusive towards me. She became more and more unstable. I still think she is the one that brought out the worst in me. I went to anger management, I'm better now and she finally broke up with me. A week later, I met someone else and we started a relationship. I had pretty much checked out of the old relationship so it's not like I've moved on too fast.\n\nAnyways, I'm doing better in this new relationship. I feel calmer and better and I've learned a lot from my past. I feel bad for how badly I've treated those two girlfriends in my past but I can't be living in the past forever. I've learned and I've grown. I'm sorry they're still hurting. My grad school girlfriend has written articles about abuse and trauma since she's a psychology professor now. She's blocked me from everything. My recent ex, I don't know much about her because she's essentially hidden from me. I tried to contact her to check in on her but she blocked those advances as well. Look, I know what I've done is wrong. I feel guilty about it every single day but I feel better where I am in my life and idk if I'm an asshole for being okay with who I am after everything that I've done.",

She never talked to me like that and I was pretty miffed because she started getting all over them. \n\n\nAnyway, we become distant, and then she texts me telling me she’s breaking up with me because there’s “vibes” and she doesn’t even mention the shit she’s done. So the next day people ask how the relationship’s going and I told them it’s over. They ask why and I tell them “She broke up with me because she liked other guys rather than me and she didn’t even have the dignity to tell it to my face”\n\nShe hears this from other people the next day and starts losing her shit and torments me about how much of a shit boyfriend I was and that I have a small dick (which I never showed to her and never had a directly visible erection, and some people that saw us when we went on dates said I seemed really caring for her all the time) and says that I’ve made her life really shit because some of the boys that she isn’t sucking off are giving her a little bit of shit about it, which I’ve told them to stop. I’m wondering if I’m the asshole here because it’s to the point where she says I made her depressed because I stated a harsh truth that she found hard to digest.",

      "description": "I [18 F] had been seeing my girlfriend for about a year in secret, because my parents had always been pretty homophobic. She’s brought a lot of happiness and purpose into my life, and I’m extremely grateful for her. However seeing her is difficult since she lives an hour drive away from me, and I still have a strict curfew. \nTwo days before my 18th birthday, I decided the amount of lies I had been building around my life to my parents was becoming too stressful of a burden on me, and I finally told them everything. Obviously, they reacted badly. They were angry that I had been lying to them for this long, and saw the whole thing as some taboo love affair. They don’t really believe I’m gay, and think it’s some weird phase that will pass. I tried telling just my mom and begged her not to say anything to my dad, but of course she did anyways. He has been the worst in the situation. Telling me that as a lesbian I was going to live a sad and empty life, and that I’m still too young to have things figured out. \nThey both decided to give me an ultimatum, either forget that the girlfriend ever happened and continue on as usual, or leave and destroy my family. I’ve always felt some resentment towards my family, and have expressed wanting to leave home many times, but it kills me seeing them hurt by this. I know that they love me, and I love them. If I were to leave, I’d stay with my girlfriend’s family, they are very kind to me and have always offered to help me out in rough times. Moving in with them would be difficult as I would probably have to drop the classes I was taking a community college (they weren’t for a degree or anything, just for fun) and maybe quit my job since the commute would be a strain. But, if I stay at home, and never see my gf again, I feel that I will be deeply unhappy. I don’t want to hurt my parents, but I can’t figure out what the right thing to do is, and whether living with my gf’s family will help me find some happiness.\nAlso, I’m currently in DEP for the Navy, meaning that I have a contract but am still waiting to ship out. I am supposed to leave in July, but I have the option to go earlier since I graduated high school early and just need to submit my transcripts. I am seriously considering moving up my ship date if I am to stay with my gf, to avoid becoming too much of a financial burden. I am pretty self sufficient however, I pay for almost all of my own expenses, and can continue to do this. Despite all of this, I can’t just ditch my family with clear conscious, and they have put a lot of shame and guilt for doing so, emphasizing how much pain I bring them.\nWhat do I do?",

      "description": "Initially, I know the title reads as me being the asshole, but I don’t know what to do.\n\nMy best friend of almost 10 years has been in law school for about a year. I also want to go to law school once I graduate after taking a few years off to work, but she went directly into law school from undergrad. \n\nAs soon as she even started studying for the LSAT she would always rant to me about how hard it was. To make it worse, I go to a college across the country from where she currently lives, so most of our interactions are on Snapchat or phone calls. In the beginning, she would snapchat herself studying for the LSAT and preparing her applications to law school all the time. I supported her through it but once she actually got in to law school, it got worse.\n\nLiterally 90% of her Instagram posts are about law school. She’ll post to her story about eating cheese and caption it something like “cheese &gt; law school”. Her captions always have to mention law school to the point where it’s driving me nuts, because every time we actually do talk on the phone about my law school plans, she’ll say something condescending like: “are you sure you want to do it? It’s so hard. Please don’t do it.”\n\nNot only did I support her and continue to deal with her law school life 24/7, but I would expect her to at least reciprocate the same for me. I went to a top university for undergrad and she went to a state school (where she also happens to attend law school). Not like it matters, but saying “it’s so hard, don’t go to law school” feels like she’s telling me I can’t do it, even though I made it to an incredible university and have been working my ass off while studying so I can get those extracurriculars in. \n\nNow I’m literally triggered every time she posts about law school on Instagram or sends me a Snapchat of her “giving her first law school presentation” or “getting an A on her law paper!” I’ve supported her but now I’m just kind of tired and feel like I’m faking my excitement for her because she’s overdone it at this point. All she ever talks about is law school and I understand that it’s a huge achievement and big part of her life and she deserves bragging rights, but it’s gotten to the point where it’s just ridiculous.\n\nTLDR; my best friend got into law school and will not stop posting about it or telling me about it. Even though I’ve supported her throughout the process, she knows I want to go to law school too and constantly tells me to avoid it or not to go. It feels condescending and I feel like she thinks I couldn’t handle it but she can.",

      "description": "So my friend and I are at uni together and recently she's been doing things that has been really bugging me. The other day we were having a debate and she suddenly tells me she doesn't want to deal with it anymore and I should shut up and drop the subject, completely shutting me down.\n\nThen later we were in a class me, her and some new friends (people I know and she doesn't). I introduce her and sit down. During a discussion i say something funny which gets a decent reaction, but she suddenly exclaims \"why do you have to always try to be funny?\"\n\nSo naturally I'm already a bit annoyed with her but I shake it off cause i'm naturally very thick skinned and little things like this don't bother me.\n\nHowever a couple days later she texts me about this very trivial dilemma (whether or not she should swap places with someone for a presentation cause her professor asked her as a favor). She was acting like it was a life or death decision and kept giving all these pointless pros and cons like what if the examiners are tired at the end of the day, etc. Since I was already a irritated and i didn't wanna deal I just said, \"it's really not that big a deal, flip a coin if you can't make up your mind\".\n\nShe snaps back at me and says, \"it may not be a big deal to you but it obviously is to me. You can't just dismiss my problems when all I wanted was an outsider's opinion\".\n\nI didn't want to deal with an argument so I just gave her options and told her to let me know what she decides. Since then we've both been a bit cold towards her. I don't know if i should apologize or should be expecting an apology. So tell help me out, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "This actually happened last year, but I want an outside opinion on the situation.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. Since I was young my tech illiterate parents always came to me for IT support for very basic things. This got even worse when I got a GCSE in IT, so I always had to fix problems, no matter how easy or basic. This included:\n\n• Pressing reset on the router\n\n• Plugging the ethernet cable back into the TV when it came out\n\n• Finding files on their computer\n\n• Deleting Facebook posts and other showing them how to work the site, despite not using it myself\n\n• Installing apps on their phones\n\n• Attaching files to emails\n\n• Setting up every new device in the house (printers, laptops, TVs, etc)\n\nI had to do all of this and more multiple times as my parents refused to learn how to do basic IT tasks themselves. Every time I had to reset the router or save a word document I would say something along the lines of \"You should really do this yourself\" to which they would reply with \"Why? We have you to do it\". \n\nLast year I decided to stop. My Mum came to me with something basic I'd had to do several times before and I told her to do it herself or get my brother to help (he pretends to be tech illiterate to get out of this sort of stuff). Then she  got upset and started saying how we were a family and should help each other, to which I said you shouldn't need help with this, you've been using this stuff for years. My Mum was off with me for a while and basically guilt tripped me into helping again and said something along the lines of \"we provide everything for you so you should help us with this\".\n\nAs of today I still have to help with phone and computer problems, although they have gotten slightly more independent, but still \"need\" my \"skills\". Next year I will be (hopefully) going to university several hours away and I know they'll still try to get me to fix their minor problems, making me wonder if I shouldn't have given in.\n\nI have no other issues with my family, but this really did and still does annoy me.",

      "description": "For ten years, \"A\" and I were pretty much best friends. We'd roomed together in college, hung out all the time, and talked just about every day.\n\nOver the years I began to notice that she had some not so great tendencies. She was diagnosed with adult ADHD and as such was forgetful, and often times a little... gross (she hates bathing and works a very messy job). I know I am not perfect, I, myself have OCD and struggle to keep it under control at times. We both left school at the same time, her to be closer to home, me to get my health and finances in order.\n\nThere's a history of her being super inconsiderate about my material stuff and not respecting my time. When she came to visit me at home, where I lived with my parents while I tried to save to go back to school and move out, she would probably break something once a visit. I worked a minimum wage job and had to pay rent, my food bill, and a portion of the utilities at home. She was paid just under twice what I was, didn't have to pay rent, and was given her car by her mom. When she would visit, she'd do things like jump into my bed and break my box spring, or throw herself into my desk chair and snap off the back of it, or ignore that I asked her to be careful with an electronic and toss it off my bed. I tried to bring these things up to her, but she would shrug it off and say \"they're just things.\" I lost a lot of my pay having to replace what she broke.\n\nThe time thing is worse though. I work three jobs, go to school full time, and have volunteer requirements for my scholarships. But every time we make plans, she's really late. I've been very patient about this, the only thing I ask is for her to let me know when plans change. I have days where I call off work an hour early, or plan a volunteering gig for half a day so I can hang with her. And not only does she get there two hours late, she doesn't let me know. The worst thing is that she then gets mad at other friends for missing the train and being late because she doesn't feel like waiting. She also complains that college is a \"waste of time\" and \"useless,\" despite the fact that after getting my shit together, I went back to school and became a model student and I really care about what I do. I try to explain but she forgets and says she can't help it because ADHD just makes her late.\n\nI must have explained a dozen times why these things bothered me so much, and she refused to listen. But if she got upset I did something and let me know even once, I made *sure* never to do it again. I'm not perfect, but if I caught myself, I apologized and righted the situation. I never had to be told twice.\n\nAnd in the last year or so, there have been two major incidents:\n\nThe first was her going house hunting and inviting me to join the roommate party. I was totally down for this as I live in a dorm rn. As a group we decided our needs. Mine was \"I can't afford more than $400 a month for rent.\" Along with transit, food and utilities, that was as much as I could do. We had a list of places we were looking for, and only one was out of budget--about $600 for each of us. That was the one she chose. She refused to go with our second option that met all our *needs* because she'd have to park at the bottom of a hill, which she didn't *want*. I was devastated--I'd already cancelled my housing contract and had to beg to be let back in. She wouldn't listen when I explained that I was upset. Six months later, my now girlfriend, N, suggested we move in together when we finish school. A got mad at me, and tried to sabotage my friendship with N. Now N makes me really happy. My ex was really jealous all the time, and so having a partner who's very sweet to me and comfortable with our relationship is *great*. But A specifically got jealous that N was \"taking her place\" since A and I were supposed to move in together. But she didn't respect my needs...\n\nThe second is what I can only call her... temper tantrum. Having ADHD, she's forgetful and would ask me to remind her of things. I have a decent memory so if she asks me once, I can remember for months or years. She has the memory of a fly. One of her things was that when she visited, she had to remember to keep her wallet out so she could put her ID away when she was leaving. She was feeling grouchy that day, but as she was packing up, I reminded her to keep her wallet out. She threw her bag on the ground, yelled \"I don't want to get my wallet out!\" and then, no joke, threw herself on the floor and wouldn't move for ten minutes, complaining that she had to do *so much stuff*. I'd asked nothing of her the entire visit. We had snacks, listened to music, and sketched. She'd spent the entire day complaining about her mom not being interested in the same stuff as her. And how it wasn't her fault her parents had money and that didn't mean she had a great life, and her parents pushed her to try activities she didn't like, like basketball camp. (I grew up in a trailer, eating food from food banks. She often complained about how no one understood that she didn't *ask* to be financially comfortable and that people shouldn't judge her on the fact her parents were wealthy enough to own two houses.) Worst of all, when she fell, she broke the closet door of my dorm and refused to help pay because it was an \"accident\". I had to wait for ten minutes while she sat there and complained about how awful life was and she wouldn't move. I was literally trapped in my room.\n\nAfter these incidents, I started to feel really uncomfortable around her. But she kept explaining that it was all because she has ADHD. She doesn't *remember* when I tell her things that upset or hurt me. She can't help that she doesn't get places on time or is heavy handed. She doesn't shower because she gets distracted (which I didn't go into. the OCD kills me because she doesn't wear deodorant because she forgets and she doesn't shower more than twice a week. she works with animals. she sits on literally freshly laundered bedding all the time). It was all because of ADHD. I hesitantly let it go on a few more months.\n\nThen, a couple months ago, we had scheduled a day to get together. Finals were about to hit, it was the year anniversary of my grandfather's death, and I was having a rough time. I explained that it was really important to me that we hang out - I needed to do something fun. She was gonna swing by after a family breakfast, which she scheduled *after* she scheduled our hangout, and we were gonna go to the mall. We were texting through the breakfast and I messaged to confirm the time twice, and then: \"**let me know if plans change**.\" I was volunteering that morning with friends and said goodbye and left early to get changed and ready to hang out. I waited for *two hours* for her to contact me. I texted her three or four times, called a handful of times, and she hadn't responded even once. She called me back at 3:30 and explained \"oh my mom made me late and I didn't let you know because I didn't want to feel bad about it.\"\n\nI stopped talking to her after that. Except for to try to explain why I was upset that she'd done it again--where she ignored everything I said and accused me of having her \"walking on eggshells\" because I would bring up finances when she broke my things or when the rent thing happened. I feel gross about it because we've been friends for a decade. But she just forgot whenever I tried to explain that the things she was doing hurt me.\n\n**Seriously TL;DR**: \"Friend\" of ten years refused to respect my boundaries or comfort zone, caused financial troubles, was never on time, blamed everything on ADHD, and then got mad at me for saying I was upset. \n\nAm I just being insensitive about her disorder, or am I right in feeling used and cutting her off? Am I the asshole?",

She stays at home all the time during the weekends watching netflix. She only comes downstairs if she’s hungry and she doesn’t even wash her dish (We have a strict “wash your own dishes” policy at our house) and if someone asks her to help with anything, she suddenly has a spitting headache that can only be cured by watching more Riverdale. She doesn’t do anything at all. My family is very religious and my mom makes it a point to go to church every sunday. Except her. She only goes to church on Christmas, Easter and when we sponsor food (Church goes from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm, so people sponsor lunch)\n\nI feel like it’s unfair that one day she’s totally fine to hang out with her bf for 13 hours but the next day she can’t come downstairs to help me and my mom cook for 30 minutes.\n\n\nIt’s really annoying at times, especially when I’m really tired, like after a track workout or after the Good Friday service (Total time of 9 hours of strict prayer) and there are dishes in the sink but she can’t because she’s to “tired”\n\n\nAm I the Asshole for being annoyed at my sister?",

      "description": "Hello AITA...\n\nBackstory: I have an aunt who is only 6 years older than me so in many ways we were raised like brother or sister or cousins. She and I have never gotten along, like ever. So in the last few years she gone form fat to massively obese. She won’t be weighed but she could be 350lbs and I wouldn’t be surprised. She is also on this massive kick that she’s as hot as any other girl, she’s super healthy and she can do anything that everyone else can and she’s fat and proud. That would be awesome if it were true but she lives like a fucking hoarder, she watches thousands of hours of Netflix and rarely leaves her room and always bust my parents data cap and pays no rent. \n\nSo like last weekend miraculously she and her friends did the hike up Mt Lee (to the Hollywood sign in LA). Awesome, I’m glad she did it and I think she wouldn’t be such a miserable person if she got out more. Honestly.\n\nBut we were at a family dinner last night and she was just bragging up a storm about how amazing the hike was and how she’s so experienced now and she was giving people advice on hiking. Mostly I was ignoring her but then my mom said “hey you know lib235sgh is training to do the half Ironman in Colorado this year!” \n\nMy absolute idiot aunt just launched into me how “ohhhh that’s nice but you aren’t really don’t aerovic work like I do unless you’re going up hill!” I told her I was like yeah but I just ran 10 miles right before dinner. She again said that “you realize that doesn’t REALLY count right?” \n\nI lost my shit. I told her she went on a day hike that at worst  should take 3 hours and it took she abd her pig friends all day. In fact they didn’t even make it down until after dark. That doing a hike and getting passed by grandmas and toddlers isn’t really something to write hone about. She accused me of fat shaming. I told her to call it whatever she wants. She stormed off to her room.\n\nEveryone thinks I should apologize but I just hate her condenscing attitude towards everything I do. I went to go into the Navy seals next year and fitness as beeb a huge part of my life. For her to talk down to me because she’s done one hike...EVER...caused me to lose it.\n\nAITA?",

My mother has requested a daily itinerary be provided to her and I don’t necessarily want to provide it. \n\nIf fact, we haven’t told our parents were we are going for the honeymoon. His parents would likely book tickets and join us (like they did to his sister on her honeymoon, even staying at their same AirBnB) and my parents are likely to freak out since we are going to Jordan and it’s a ‘terrorist’ country. Even if we did tell my parents, my mother is the type to rub it in to my MIL that she knows where we are going and she doesn’t. \n\nMy relationship with my mother has always been tense. She used to read my diary in high school, monitor my bank account in college to see what I was spending my money on, etc. This led to me being more closed off and not as forthcoming with her, since she would use what she uncovered to get me in trouble. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I don’t provide her an itinerary? I wanted to check in before putting down a blanket ‘No, I’m not providing that to you’ to make sure the decision isn’t clouded by the past. ",

      "description": "UPDATE:  I went to the party and had an amazing time!  Felt loved, met new people, ate good food, had a few drinks and genuinely had fun!\n///\n\nI came home for the holidays.  (I am mid-30’s, just divorced/sad, having a real hard time, no children.)  Usually my younger/single sister comes home too, but she is spending the holidays traveling.  My parents left today (Dec 30) to spend NYE on a cruise.  I didn’t want to spend the money (and didn’t have the deep desire) to join them or my sister.  (Separate topic!)  Being alone for a few days in warmer weather (here).. it’s kind of what I wanted.  I’ve had a real shitty year.\n\nSo here’s the thing.  Our neighbors, who are super close to my parents (not so much to me), and have been amazing and supportive through the years, are insisting and insisting that I come over to their house for New Year’s Eve.  I don’t want to go.  There are parties in clubs and in bars in our city, and maybe at the last minute I go to one of them on my own, but as of now I don’t want to go anywhere.  I want to spend the evening by myself, devoid of small talk and fake laughs, without having to get all dressed up for anyone.  I want to make myself a nice and healthy dinner, cry if I need to, go to bed early, and wake up early on Jan 1st, make a nice healthy breakfast, work out, ride my bike to the pier, you know, just do healthy lonely people stuff. \n\nI have been avoiding the neighbors during the time I’ve been here because I just don’t want to talk to anyone.  And I’m afraid that I’ll start crying any minute if they ask how I’m doing.  They already complained that why was I neglecting them.  Pretty much scolded me for not coming over to say hello the day I arrived.\n\nMy controlling mother will be curious to know what I did for NYE.  There are cameras all over their house.  She already warned how “crazy and wild” NYE parties get around here, how many people die in car accidents, how many women get roofied, and how it would be “so nice” if I just spent it with the neighbors.  I am a grown woman but now that I am divorced, seems that I am a child again.  (Separate topic!)\n\nToday, I kind of implied to everyone while the neighbors were over, that maybe I couldn’t make it to their party, and they looked at me hurt and weird and asked what I was doing instead.  I lied and said I was going to one of the restaurant parties.  Bullshit and it was obvious.  Am I an asshole now?  \n\nAm I an asshole for declining the neighbor’s invite?  When I stay home they will see my lights on, know I’m home, and wonder why I didn’t join them.  How do I explain that I just want to be alone?  (They don’t seem to get the concept, they’re always happy and coming over to talk with my parents and when they’re not at their house, my parents are at over at theirs.  They are super sociable, vibrant, loud, friendly.  And they love to drink.  I see people having fun but I don’t have fun.  I am uncomfortable.)  I just don’t have the same relationship and I’m not interested in going there at all.\n\nI feel guilty because they are so nice.  And here I am, a jerk, it seems.\n\nAITA for saying no to their invites and visibly staying home during their party?  If I’m not an asshole, am I just ungrateful?  What the hell is wrong with me?\n",

      "description": "My fiancé and I have lived together for a year.  She has 2 great kids, an 8 year old boy and a 6 year old girl and I love them both. I don’t have any kids of my own and the parenting thing is pretty new to me. I like to think I took to it pretty well, during the day hours I spend lots of quality time with them, make their food, do their laundry, and I really try to go above and beyond for them so they feel comfortable with me. We have lots of fun together. Where I feel like I suck as a step parent is being super uncomfortable with the children being in our bed. It’s bothered me from day 1 and I’m afraid to say anything.  Sharing a bed has always been probably my favourite part of a relationship, to me it feels so intimate.  You might think, well that’s okay you like the time alone with your lady and there’s nothing wrong with that... well here’s where I’m probably the asshole.. I don’t even like them being in the bed while we aren’t in it. It’s OUR bed, they have their beds (that I spent hours building).  There are of course circumstances where I understand the kids need their mother at night, be it nightmares, bed wetting, or illness. But on a day to day basis it makes me super uncomfortable climbing into a warm, pre slept in bed.. right now it’s 2 am and I haven’t been able to sleep because of it. So reddit I ask you, is this normal for a step parent or am I a huge jerk that doesn’t deserve these awesome kids?",

So tonight, I test drove a minivan and a large part of my soul dies when thinking about spedning $25k on something I don’t enjoy but is highly practical.  It’s likely the answer. \n\nRight across the street was an Audi dealership, and I wanted to see a Q7 before I made a final decision.  No regrets or second thoughts if I buy the minivan. I walked in and asked the saleswoman if they had any used Q7 models, and she said yes.  Long story short, she spent 30 minutes showing me a car, and I quite liked it.  Enough that I wanted to weigh practical and smart for 1/2 the price versus fun, enjoyable and a little irresponsible in my mind overnight before making a final decision.  So, I said “Can you put together an offer with your best foot forward so I can think about it overnight?”  We go and sit down, and she says “I will be back in a minute.”\n\nI thought maybe she printing something out or whatever.  I look up and I see some mid-30s little man introduce himself and sit down and open up with “So I hear you have a Q3 and you hate it (semi-true:  love the car, but entirely impractical with a family so I hate that we have one with 2 kids).  I also hear you are comparing the Honda Odyssey with a Q7.  You have to ask yourself, ‘What is the price of happiness?’”\n\nI do?  Thank you my sage dispenser of wisdom. \n\nSo you can imagine how the next 90 seconds went.  I then promptly told him “She has done a great job, I was interested in the Q7 but your little lecture made me realize I can’t ever buy a car to help your bottom line.  All I asked for was a confidential quote, not a lecture, so I could spend an hour walking home and mull over the pros and cons.  You gave me nothing and destroyed her potential sale.”  \n\nI then spent 5 minutes apologizing to the lady for wasting her time saying that all I wanted was a quote so I could price up the pros and cons and figure out the decision.  After 11 hours at work today, I didn’t need a lecture from a pint sized Don Draper wannabe that didn’t have any actual numbers attached to it.  I felt bad for wasting her time, she had to bring in the idiot manager to the conversation.  It wasn’t her fault. Now I am at home doing research on used Q7 carsthat she basically got me interested in, but I will never buy it from her.  \n\nAITA if I eventually buy a Q7 not from her?",

      "description": "My roommates cat was recently in heat, so she was spraying EVERYWHERE. The whole house smelled like cat piss, to the point that my other 3 roommates and me couldn't bear it. She would spray on coats left out, blankets on the couches, the couches themselves, EVERYTHING.\n\nShe even would even waltz into our rooms and spray on dirty clothes, which would take at least 3 washes to get the smell mostly out, and even then it would still linger.\n\nAt one point he was too busy with work to change her litter box for a while, so she would even come into my room and deficate all over while I was gone at school or work.\n\nSo, I asked him to either spay her (she's 12 years old so he's had plenty of time to do that), keep her confined to his room or remove her from the house (she lived with his parents before anyways). \n\nHe told me that she's a cat and she's gonna spray every once in a while, and that he would clean everything she sprayed on (he didn't, or left it smelling for days). His grand solution to her getting in my room was to \"close my door.\" \n\nI don't feel I should have to close my door every time I walk in and out of my room because of his cat, and regardless, my door doesnt fully close anyways. \n\nI didn't want the cat to begin with, and my other two roommates who were ok with the cat and I didnt know she wasnt spayed before we moved in. We even moved into a place a little farther away from campus because they allowed pets...\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nTl:dr, cat pissses on everything, roomate wont do anything about it.",

      "description": "I have a friend, Sam. We met in school and remained friends after school. Sam is bisexual, and a year ago let's everyone know that their pronouns are now \"they/them\" instead of \"she/her\". Ok, cool. I do my best. \n\nSam had been dating exclusively women for awhile, gone through a dry spell, and had just started seeing someone again. This person also went by they/them, but had male parts and presented as a man. This is important to the story. \n\nNow, Sam calls me up to tell me about this new boo. Im in an oddly weird place that night, and let them know. I try my best to be enthusiastic, but I'm just falling short. In the time I've known them, I've talked about dozens of new people with Sam. It's hard to drum up enthusiasm sometimes when there's a new person every two months. Then, it gets on to sex. Again, trying to be cheeky, and just continue conversation, I say \"jumping back on that dick again, eh.\" \n\nSam takes great, great offense at that. I meant it purely from a literal context: after a long time of sleeping with people without dicks, theyre quite literally, back on that dick. Apparently that is not what Sam takes it to mean. I'm being transphobic and bigoted. \n\nI concede that what I said was tone deaf, and although I don't completely agree with Sam, I figure it's better to just apologize and be more careful next time. But essentially this ruins our friendship. \n\nWas I really THAT much of an asshole, Reddit?  \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "My wife and I are not well-off so we live in a small apartment with two bedrooms. To make ends meet and have money for what we like, we have to have a roommate and for the past year my brother has been filling that need. \n\nWhen he left his last place it was because his old roommate and him had a falling out over financial reasons and his roommate broke his laptop and started all this other hateful shit. They were evicted because neither of them continued paying rent there. I was worried about him so I wanted to take him in until he could get back on his feet and find somewhere else.\n\nWe moved him in under the agreement that he would move out given notice when we ask him too, because my wife may get pregnant or for any other reason. He paid half of the rent and half of the utilities. Him and us both expected that it would only be for about six months or so we weren't too concerned with long term plans as we felt he would soon find another roommate and be on his way. \n\nMy wife was not a fan of moving him in, but we needed him at the time to make ends meet so we had to compromise. He'd said some stuff in the past about not really supporting my decision to get married but we were past that, even though it made my wife lose respect for him entirely, we would still hang out around the house and do double dates with his girlfriend or whatever. \n\nThe problem really was that he never really respected our boundaries. He felt like we were equal partners in the apartment even though we made it clear multiple times that he was staying in our spare room and that he wasn't entitled to it. \n\nHe was not a good roommate. We let him have his own space, even though he was astonishingly messy, he kept it in his room for the most part. He was a fan of marijuana and hallucinogens but we were okay with that as long as he kept it out if the house and didn't talk about it. And BOY he could not shut up about it. He brought people over without asking, shady people. He made guests uncomfortable and would not stop trying to flirt with the wife's completely uninterested friends. He constantly wanted to argue politics.\n\nFastforward to a year he lived with us. My Sister in law got into a college nearby that my wife and I attended so she needed a place to stay until she could  find an apartment. We let her stay on our couch. We didn't give him a choice, she needed our help. He was fine with it and we all got along for about a month before he started to get weird. He became infatuated with the Sister in law. Kept asking her to go to bars with him. She was made very uncomfortable. \n\nWe asked her if she would stay with us and cover his share if rent and bills if he moved out. She said yes.\n\nSo it was time we ask him to move out. We told him we needed him to figure out somewhere to go in the next 2 or 3 months.\n\nI tried to help him, gave him listings of places to check out and stuff like that, but he wasn't making any progress. One month went by and he started to resent us for replacing him with my SIL. He rarely was home and when he was all he did was talk shit about how we needed him and he didn't need us and how he could be out whenever he wanted to. So I called him on his bullshit and set a day that he needed to move out one month from then. After he actually put in an application he realized that his eviction was keeping him from being able to get an apartment (no shit). So I extended his deadline again.\n\nAt the end of the set deadline nothing was boxed and he started staying at our parents place at night. So we packed his stuff, respectfully labeling and boxing things up. Communicating everything in the process.\n\nI rented him a truck and helped him move all of his stuff in with the parents. He never stopped talking shit about how evil we were. \n\nI kept trying to get through to him and he finally said what he needed to say for me to never want to speak to him again. \n\nHe told me he thought I was being whipped by my wife. He said he doesn't respect me and my relationship is doomed to fail and he won't listen to me until I get a divorce. He said he hopes my wife never gets pregnant. He honestly believes that my wife and I are cheating on each other. He developed a bunch of conspiracy theories as to why we kicked him out but refuses to accept that he was a bad roommate. He's become completely toxic, and his only goal is to fuck up my relationship to my wife. \n\nI had to block him off of social media, and I refuse to answer his calls or texts.\n\n\n",

      "description": "So, for a bit of context, I'm an English major, but I've educated myself a lot in regards to vegan diet because 1. I'm fascinated with biology and anatomy, 2. I believe you can never have too much knowledge and 3. Because my ex was a vegan and I wanted to be able to cook something that would be nutritious and appropriate for her diet. I'm not claiming to be an expert, but I'm not oblivious either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my year, there's this guy, let's call him Seb. He's tolerable. I have no choice anyway, since we have a lot of mutual friends in our year. From the very beginning though, you knew the guy is vegan (one of those who can't shut up about it). And I'd like to stress, I have absolutely nothing against vegans or vegetarians.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe situation happened some time ago when me, Seb and couple of other people from uni went out for a couple of beers. The convo goes on as I remembered I had a ham sandwich in my backpack. As soon as I take a bite out of it, he goes \"What are you doing?\". Confused, I answer \"Eating?\" to which he goes \"Would you mind not eating this in front of me?\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo just calm his bitching, I go \"Oooh, okay. Sure\" and get up to sit elsewhere. As I get up, he goes \"I can't believe you can eat that. That's disgusting.\" So me, being a smartass that I am, I answer \"Actually, it's quite tasty.\". He starts ranting about how I'm eating something that used to be alive and slaughered, how he hasn't eaten meat in three years already, yatta yatta yatta. Tired by his lecture, I just go \"Look, I respect that you don't eat meat, good for you Seb. Could you respect the fact that I don't eat fake meat?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe starts yelling that he's not gonna \"respect\" someone eating a murder victim in front of him, that I'm disgusting and how can someone claim to love animals if they eat meat, that humans don't need meat and that's just our barbaric nature to murder and eat the flesh etc. I replied that if I had a week I wouldn't have time to explain how wrong he was, that if he's not replacing the proteins he's not consuming from meat by something else he's killing himself, that if humans weren't omnivores, we wouldn't have fangs to shred meat etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe argument went on for like an hour, to which he, when he ran out of things to yell, just got up and left without word, leaving everyone baffled. Now, any time somebody is offering to hang out, he's asking if the \"murderer\" is gonna be there, and refuses if the answer is yes. People who witnessed it feel I was right in this regard, but the situation in the group has become very awkward. Should I've just kept my trap shut and let him rant to not spoil the evening or did I do the right thing for calling Seb out? I'm confused at this point, cause the aftermath is just tiring at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;Dr: Called a guy out for being an obnoxious vegan asshole, should I've bitten my tongue and let him rant or was I right for standing up to the wanker in question?",

      "description": "So it's my parents 40th wedding anniversary this year, and my brother suggested that we take a 10 day family beach holiday to celebrate.\n\nSome background, all my siblings and I are all grown and have flown the nest. They all have their own families including young children and whilst I'm in a (fairly new) relationship, I have no intention of having any children.\n\nThe past year or so I have been doing a lot of travelling to new places, and my intention was to do more of the same this year, and beach holidays are not my thing. So having to pay for myself to go on a beach holiday with my family with 4 children(2 of which are under 1) was not on my agenda.\n\nWhen my parents asked me, I said no, however they keep asking me and making me feel guilty every time I tell them  I'm not going. \n\nSo my question is, AITA for not going on holiday with them?",

However, is a huge pacifist and doesn’t like how I was in the military for many years. Recently, we were eating a delicious dinner when she asked me about my experiences in the military.\n\nI served two tours in the Middle East, was discharged due to an injury that I have since recovered from. I’m more than happy to discuss anything about that, but I immediately became hesitant when she asked me if I had ever “taken anyone’s life.” \n\nI was silent for a couple of seconds before replying, “no, I was lucky enough to not see much action.” She seemed satisfied and moved on, the thing is I have, it’s something that still sits with me to this day. On one hand I feel bad for lying to my SO, on the other hand her strong distaste for killing makes me believe she would respond badly.\n\nAm I the asshole for lying to my girlfriend?",

      "description": "I've always had a huge crush on my friend (we've known each other for 2 years) but the entire time he was dating someone else and he moved away a while ago so I never made a move. But over the summer, he started getting really flirty with me after he told me he broke up with his ex. It sounded like it had been a couple of months so I reciprocated and in no time we were sexting. But about a couple weeks later, he texts me saying how devastated he was because his ex had come to visit &amp; stay with him in his city and it turns out that she slept with another guy immediately after they broke up. \n\nAfter that he we stopped talking for 2 weeks and then he started flirting with me again. I asked him if I was a rebound or if he just wanted to fool around and he told me that it was neither for him, he was always attracted to me and now he has a crush on me. We then left it at that but kept sexting each other and having these intense conversations. \n\nBut a month later, he started to get really distant so I called him out on it and he told me that he was just dealing with the consequences of the summer. I felt sad because I realised that he probably wasn't over his ex and I was just a rebound so I asked for space. He said that I definitely wasn't a rebound but he gave me space anyway.\n\nDuring our time away from each other, I realised that he wasn't that great a friend and he wasn't being fair to me. He was always super flakey and I remember when I once told him my mum was sick he took 3 weeks to reply. And it felt like he just wanted me to stick around and fill in these voids for him.\n\nA month later we spoke again and he said he wanted to \"go back to what we were\". I said that I wasn't sure I wanted to do that because I was still hurt from everything. At this point he'd reply at his own convenience so I got really anxious and I felt like I didn't matter to him at all and blocked him. He then texted me on Instagram and we had a long conversation - I said that it was too late to talk it out now and then blocked him there as well.\n\nTwo months after that, he came back to my city and asked if I wanted to meet him - I said no way not at all and asked him to respect my decisions. He told me that he understood but he showed up at my university anyway. And so I hid. \n\nHe eventually left and I went home.\n\nBut I'm curious, AITA?",

Since as long as I can remember I wanted to join the army or marines or whoever would have me. \n\nToday I go up to sign all the papers, pick my job, and officially swear In to the United States Army. I’m very proud of myself and my family and friends are too\n\nHowever my girlfriend isn’t so happy. Now she has some anxiety and separation anxiety, something I’ve been aware of since we started dating (roughly 6 months, I know not that long but long enough for me to catch some feels.) I’ve told her since the beginning that I was going to leave and join the army. I told her I was going to go no matter what. She said she had no problem, and she was happy for me. \n\nUntil Friday, she told me she had a problem. That I’m a selfish asshole who only cares about his dreams and not her. (Keep in mind this is our first argument in six months of dating.) that I could give two shits about anyone but myself. That I shouldn’t sign and I should wait a year to make sure she gets settled. Make sure she’s happy because she’s gonna miss me so much. \n\nI get it she’s scared, so am I. I just don’t think I should wait an extra year when I’m this close. She’s begging me, literally begging me not to go. As I type this I’m breaking down because I don’t know if I should sign \n\nI just need someone to tell me (other than family) if I’m right or wrong. Any advice or just straight up calling me an asshole will help. I just need to know what an outsider would see. Sorry if my formatting isn’t great, or if I have some grammar errors. It’s just been hard and I’m not too worried about that right now. ",

      "description": "So earlier this year I had started a school, this was a different school than my friends had gone to. From the start I knew it wasn't the right school for me. I kept at it for awhile even though it made me quite depressed. I asked my parents if I could move schools and they refused or said they would talke later. Everyday I came home from school upset and sad and quite frankly a mess. My parents must have done something because they asked me if I would be up for transferring in a few weeks ( great parents btw). I didnt expect this and I of course accepted. Now I had to figure out how to tell the kids in my grade since my twin brother still goes there and would occasionally have friends over I couldnt just bale. The two acquaintances that were there were sort of avoiding me for some reason so I thaught this wouldnt matter to them as much. I told one and he didn't care at all, like at all. What a relief but the other did and he was really mad at me demanding a reason for me not continuing obviously I couldn't say I hate the school and I have no real freinds and all my freinds are at another school so bye. I just said my parents were making him he hated this answer yelling at me for a better one. I said I am sorry but I had no choice. I thought it wouldnt matter to this kid as much cause he was avoiding me so much but it did and it hurt. I feel bad for him but if I give him the answer he will refuse and say I was his freind. I don't want people saying it was stupid I leftm because I suffer from depression and anxiety and there was an underlying thing to this whole school and plan.

      "description": "Backstory is necessary:\n\nI go to college 3 hours away from my home town and I was in a year-long relationship with a girl that was still living at home (both 20).  I always had suspicions that she wasn’t over her ex.  Not just suspicions but proof from her words and the fact that she got excited when he asked her to hang out (and would hang out with him alone from time to time). \n\n Over the summer I took a study abroad course for 6 weeks.  In that time she broke up with me and hooked up with her ex.  Long story short, we patched up some obvious problems and got back together.  Although I was having second thoughts about the whole thing I acted like I was fine in order to not relive the situation.\n\nGF (along with a little encouragement from me) decides to moved into an apartment a few blocks away from me.  About one week goes by and I could tell she was acting strange about her ex.\n\nWhat I did next I am not proud of, but felt it was necessary so I could put my worries to rest for good.  One morning when she was in the shower I opened her computer and read the text conversion she had with her ex.  What I found was a conversation that spanned from the time we started dating up until about 4 months into the relationship (well before I went abroad).  The conversation included her saying things like “I miss you” “you will always be my best friend” and “I miss having sex with you”.\n\nMind you, these texts were from about 8 months ago.  However, I could not find it in myself to forgive her and I felt as though I will never trust her again.  After all she was texting these things to her ex while telling me that she loved me and that I was the only one for her. I broke it off cold turkey about 2 weeks ago and haven’t seen or talked to her since. She is furious that I persuaded her to move near me and broke up over something that happened a while ago.  The way I see it, our relationship is ruined and she needed to get out of the house anyway, therefore I don’t really feel guilty for it. Am I the Asshole? Honestly asking.",

I'm planning around 9pm after mom goes to work.\n\nHer: Eurgh but I want to have one then... I don't want one later because my hair will be wet.\n\nMe: ...I mean you have time between 8-8:30 when mom doesn't use the shower.\n\nHer: I don't want it then because I want to exercise. Look, I'm trying to work around you.\n\nMe: Don't you mean I'm working around you? But whatever it's not that deep, you have a shower whenever. I'll just have a bath after.\n\nHer: Why are you being such a bitch about it? \n\nMe: Uh wtf I'm not? \n\n[Circumstance change a little later. We get home and dad has painted the bathroom door so neither of us can use bathroom until after 9. And she's going to meet a friend.]\n\nHer: Right I'll be back by 9 and I'll have a shower then you can go after me. \n\nMe: (bit annoyed that I'll have to wait for her but I don't fancy having an argument about it) ok.\n\n[She doesn't come back at 9pm. It's half 9 and I'm wondering whether to just have one. But then I don't want to deal with her anger if she comes back. And I don't want to bug her with messages either or she'll get mad at me for cutting her time with her friend. So I wait. At half ten I'm deliriously tired and call her and she's like \"oh I've just seen the time! I'll come back now\". I'm way too tired to wait till she's done showering so I get ready for bed.\n\nHowever I'm already angry at her for being annoying. And whilst I'm in the bathroom  (her bedroom is next to the bathroom), she says, after I leave, that she didn't hear me flush the toilet. I'm like wtf. And am annoyed that I have to double check. I have flushed the toilet. And I'm like...]\n\n\"I did flush the fucking toilet you stupid idiot who wouldn't let me have a bath and made me wait forever.\"\n\nShe's like \"But I didn't hear it!\"\n\nI'm like: \"oh fuck off mate.\"\n\n[I'm super mad. I see my pillow and she's got these fancy chocolates on my pillow. I don't particularly like fancy chocolates so I'm cranky, tired and angry...]\n\nMe: Who gave you these chocolates that you didn't want then??\n\nHer: Oh yeah you bitch, that's what I did. Yeah.\n\nMe: Well I don't particularly like them anyway. Do you want them back?\n\nHer: Just throw them in the bin. You know, since I didn't buy them for you or anything. \n\nMe: But what the fuck? (At why tf she got me chocolates when all I wanted was a God damn bath)\n\nHer: Oh just fuck off. \n\nMe: Well fine then I'll just throw them in the bin! (I don't).\n\nWe haven't spoken and she thinks I'm an ungrateful bitch. Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": " \n\n**TLDR on bottom**\n\n2  years ago, in college, I helped this girl out by taking her lease(sub-lease) for a room. She had 3 months left. Lets call her Sarah.\n\nWe agreed on a move out/in date and notified the landlord. No big deal right? Well, 3 days before move in date, she texts me and says she has to stay for  another month because of a trip. I'm like wtf? My buddy has people  moving in and I have no where to put my things. On top of that, we agreed on a date.\n\nHere's what she said:\n\nSarah: Well, we never had anything in writing and I need the room until mid June.\n\nMe: Well, I really have no place to go, can we work something out if you're going to be gone anyways?\n\nSarah: I don't know, I have a lot of stuff and I leave right away.\n\nMe: Wtf? Seriously? I'll be homeless and my friend has people moving in also. My stuff is all over his place.\n\nSarah: I'm not sure what your point is.\n\nMe: We had an agreement. Can't you put it in storage?\n\nSarah: No. Sorry, but hey thanks for understanding.\n\nMe: No.... I don't understand, what the actual fuck?\n\nSarah: Yea, you can talk to Bob(Landlord) about if there's an issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBob was no help. He basically said, since we have nothing in writing, she's still on the lease. I was pissed but what could I do? If I back out, it could be impossible to find a decent place.\n\nSo, whatever, I dealt with it and crashed on the couch for a month. I finally moved in. But, that's not all. A month later, she came by to  visit a room mate and bursts into my room without even knocking. I was just watching TV, no big deal, but still fucking rude and I know  she did it on purpose. She had a smirk on her face and was like \"Oops,  sorry.\" And closed the door.\n\nA few months further down, she came by and said she wanted to go grab something in one of my room mates rooms.\n\nMe: Too bad, I can't let you just walk into someone's room while they're gone to dig around for something.\n\nAs she was about to explain herself, I slammed the door in her face with a big smirk on my face. She pounded on the door and said WTF, and of course, called me an asshole. I laughed and said, pound it once more  and I'll call the cops. She left quietly but complained to her guy friend. Later, he tried to give me shit about it but I'm like fuck that, if something disappears, who do you think everyone will blame? So, he let it go.\n\nShe cost me a shit load of hassle and trouble, I feel like it didn't really make up for it totally, but I don't feel bad at all.\n\n**Am I the asshole?**\n\n**TLDR;**  I helped this chick out on her lease by subleasing. She changes move in  date on me and pretty much says tough luck pal. So, I had no place to  live and put my stuff for a month. I had to get a storage unit for a  month before I could move in. She even burst into my room without asking  a month after, while I'm there. A few months later, she comes by, I  didn't let her in and slammed the door on her face. She, of course,  called me an asshole.",

This means that ‘sleeping in’ on the weekend for him is 6am - only a few times has he slept till 7am. \n\nOn my weekend mornings, I usually wake early to roll over or use the washroom. When I do this, I check what time it is. If it’s close to 5am, I’ll “accidentally” wake my husband. I do this because I know when he checks the time, he’ll leave to go watch tv or play video games and I will get the bed to myself and actually sleep in. He finds the couch very comfortable and regularly falls asleep in it on these mornings, which is why I don’t feel bad doing this. AITA?",

I really wanted something casual, but because we had such a long history as friends I felt like I was supposed to love him.\n\nBut i could never get over that hurdle of not feeling a strong connection to him. Eventually he asked me to be his girlfriend and I agreed.\n\nWe dated for 2 months and then I cheated. He found out by going thru my phone. I didn’t deny anything and told him I think we should break up. But he just wouldn’t take no for an answer.\n\nI know I fucked up, but at this point I was telling him “this is a red flag if i cheated on you in the beginning you should take this as a sign i probably won’t respect you in the future.”\n\nNope, he just didn’t get it. The next few days he kept hitting me up trying to find a solution for us to work things out. When I finally started to get bitchy he got my point. \n\nThat’s when they cryptic messages started, i suspected he might do something drastic so I began forwarding certain texts to his dad.\n\nHe told me he was planning something so that’s when I called his dad, but I had work to go to. So it was in his hands now.\n\nSo idk how he attempted but he’s back home now. I feel awful knowing that I caused him to feel so low. I had a panic attack at the gym because our song came on. I love him i just no longer wanted sexual relations.\n\nAnyways we are in the process of giving each other our stuff back. I asked if i could buy a video game i know he doesn’t like that I’m very fond of. He went off on how he sold it when he was planning to kill himself.\n\nI became one wordy and said i didn’t want to talk about this and I’m uncomfortable.\n\nHe hit me up again saying he found the game but right now i just feel so shocked and uncomfortable I dont want to respond.",

We moved around alot and eventually they split, with my mother moving back to our home country.\n\nMy family was then spilt effectively with one sister staying with my dad. This created a horrible relationship which carried through into our mid twenties. I have absolutely no desire to rekindle the relationship due to what has happened. \n\nShe is very toxic, stealing from all family members, passive agressive and in general making my life a living hell by making me out to be a bad person. I understand our childhood did'nt set us up for the best start but as adults she continued this toxicity. Regularly starting fights and running back to my dad, rinse and repeat.\n\nHowever my mother has made me feel guilty for not wanting too, so my question is am i the asshole for wanting to protect my own mental health and not want a relationship?\n\nAlso sorry i'm terrible at coherently telling a story but really need some clarity.\n",

I have an open day in a week and today I reminded my parents about it. That’s when my mum asked me if she could go with me. \n\nThe thing about that is that I wouldn’t mind my mum going, but that would mean my 5 year old sister had to go as well. I told her that I wouldn’t want my sister there because I don’t want her messing about while I’m trying to find out more about my future (I basically decided I want to go to this uni but I’m going there to find out more) because that’d be distracting for both me and my parents. \n\nShe got a bit mad at me saying that but I think it’s reasonable. She went on to say that when she went to my brothers uni open day last year in a different uni there was a lot of things for little kids to do. That’s when I lost it.\n\nI started yelling about the fact that this is my future I’m talking about and all she seems to care about is the fact that my sister could have fun at my potential future university. I don’t want to be overshadowing in that day in the way that my parents focus on my sister all day to make sure she’s okay instead of focusing on my future, which the day is basically supposed to be. \n\nI know that the day is basically for me to find out more info not my parents, but I’d still appreciate it if they could at least pay a bit of attention to it since they don’t really listen when I try to tell them about it myself.\n\nDid I overreact?

      "description": "Today my SO texts me about a guy walking down our driveway:  \nSO: Just chased off guy who walked down our driveway on a cell. \"Oh Im lost.\" Yeah sure.  \nME: What did he look like? I'll make a post on [Neighborhood App] for ppl to look out for.  \nSO: Black male, ~6', dreads. Mid 20s.  \nME: Long or short dreads?  \nSO: Long. He left walking east down [Street] toward [landmark].  \nME: Do you remember what he was wearing?  \nSO: No    \nMy Post: SO caught a man on his cell phone walking down our driveway. He said he was lost. Our driveway is long but you can clearly see our garage at the end of it - not possible to think its an alleyway or something. Description: Mid 20s, long dreads, African-American, about 6' tall. Left walking east down [Street] towards [landmark].  \nLater I get a DM: I wanted to reach out to you about your post and I thought about doing in on the post but I dont want you to feel attacked. Your post obviously reflects your experience but it doesnt really offer any information for the community.  \n1) You may think its obvious that your driveway is not the alley. I know that in your life time you've made a turn while distracted and thought to yourself \"why am I going this way?\" Especially if he was on the phone.\n2) Im assuming that when you husband spoke to him he turned and walked away. Im sure you would have said otherwise. Im interpreting that you don't believe what he told your husband?  \nYou could be describing a misunderstanding but posted it like a violation. Now you have everyone looking out for a 6 ft tall 20 year old black male with dreads? That’s like saying a 6ft tall brown haired white male and from what you said this person didnt do anything wrong. I understand that you were obviously disturbed but I want to ask you to be cautious about creating situations that will allow for continued profiling. I hope that this makes sense and again it sounds like you were disturbed but we're on a neighborhood website and have a responsibility to protect all of our neighbors.  \n    \nWe're a house in the middle of the block, the driveway ends like a typical driveway. It's 100 feet long, our house lining a side with neighbors chainlink fence lining the other side. No way a distracted person would mistake that. We HAVE, as I said in my response, alot of criminal activity in the neighborhood like car break ins, burglaries, mail theft, car theft, and shots fired. Cops light up our street often and we've been told to stay in hour home a few times, like when they thought a suspect was hiding IN OUR GARAGE.  \nI posted to the Security and Suspicious Activity group. This guy's behavior was suspicious considering our neighborhood's history. I gave all information available. I try to be mindful about race relations etc in our area because it is an issue, but obviously I'm not perfect and if my white privilege made me unintentionally caused an instance of racial profiling I'd like to know and adjust my future behavior accordingly.",

      "description": "So, right now I'm in kinda a shitty situation. I've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. All of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but I don't feel that way, heres the story.\n\nI knew my ex for almost 10 years. We go back all the way to high school and have been friends. After we graduated I said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. We dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. I won't lie, I loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. She, however, seemed super worried. I sat down and talked with her about it. I told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy I would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. She was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.\n\nThese past 7 months have been a roller coaster. She moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. That was until a few weeks ago. An old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. I was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. This guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. Along with this, he sent me a string of Facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because I make more money that the real father and she would rather I care for it.\n\nSuffice to say, I was fucking pissed. I confronted her, she cried, I cried, it was a mess. In the end I broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born. If it is mine, i'll help her support it. If not, then I am never seeing her again.\n\nI've been cold to her. Her and her parents has tried multiple times to \"work it out\" with me but I've refused any contact with them. At one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and I kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. Any time she's tried to \"Reconcile\" i've shut it down,\n\nMy friends are saying i'm in wrong here. According to them she's pregnant and because of that I should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. I disagree fully. But I could be wrong. Am I letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",

      "description": "I'm 21 years old, out of the house, and looking at getting into my next job. I've distanced myself from my family on account of it being a huge toxic mess where absolutely everyone in it, from my 14 year old brother (one of the persons in question) down to my dad, is incredibly terrible to some degree, with the most of it coming from my narcissistic, lazy dad who refuses to discipline the kids. I also have not been around due to military service for 3 years, so realistically I couldnt have been around much anyways. This has resulted, officially, in them (a 15 yo sophomore girl and a 14 yo freshman) essentially flunking their current grades on account of how little they go to school (which was somewhat an issue when I was going to high school as well, though that was moreso due to lack of transportation than lack of initiative) and, unofficially, my middle brother (was 17 and in continuation school) dying in October from a drug overdose.\n\nSo, the issue: the kids dont want to go to school. They go to bed at unreasonable hours, they go back to bed when they are woken up, and one of them will actively insult and scream at you whenever you attempt to stir her up from bed past waking her up. It is abundantly clear to me they dont care, and the way I see it, I can show them they can always use me as a resource to get them to school, but I'm not in a mood where I'm going to basically drag them to water and make them drink. I can see the flip side of the arguement being that they're family and I should be looking out for them being their older brother, but I dont think I can do much when they dont even listen to or respect my mom or dad, and my dad gives them active reason not to care: when my mom disciplines them and takes stuff away (namely their phones or game consoles), my dad will go behind her back and give them right back...or let them go on the weekend when they were told they cant do anything, or let them have friends over when they were told they cant, it's a huge parental issue in my opinion. \n\nI'm of the opinion that, frankly, the kids are fucked due to their lack of care and the lack of my dad being a solid husband and father. I dont want to be screamed at when trying to help the kids out and I dont want my life to have to revolve around trying to make them care about something that not even my dad cares about, so my question is this: AITA for being laissez faire with the kids on their lack of care for getting to school?",

I was even doing it when I wasn't working and was in school full time. Hell, after I'd gotten into a car accident I didn't see him for 2 months because I needed to recover and then find a new car. Whenever I go out there we just sit around and watch TV. He rarely even wants to go to the movies and I typically prefer to spend my days off doing stuff, even if it's just chores around the house, sitting tends to make me antsy.\n\nThe past few weeks I've been feeling particularly exhausted, mentally and physically, from work and school and finals are coming up, so I told him I didn't feel like making the drive this week and asked if he minded coming out.

      "title": "WIBTA for telling my mum to stop giving out her number?",
      "description": "I'm on my phone, so sorry for formatting issues. Throwaway account.\n\nTo give some context to the title, my parents split up a year ago and my mum was devastated, without getting too far into it, she's been struggling to handle it. She has however, thankfully, got a lot of people around her to support her. She goes out multiple times a week, and a few months ago agreed with a friend they'd try to meet up every weekend, they often go out when they meet up too. \n\nSince she's started going out more, she began telling me about men she got chatting to. At first I was just happy to hear her talk about something other than my dad, I liked the idea that she may be starting to get over it and be open to the idea of a new relationship, but then it escalated. \n\nIt became at least a weekly thing that a new guy had approached her, flirted with her, and she'd then inform me she'd been talking to them over text. The thing that gets me though, is her talking to me about these men has now turned into constant complaining about the inappropriate things they say to her, or how they want to date and she isn't ready to date. Often she'll say they said inappropriate things whilst they were out, and then as you'd expect, they'll behave the same way when texting her. She tells me way too much information about what these guys said, and I've already nipped that in the bud because nobody wants to hear about the intimate details of what these men want to do to your mum in the bedroom, she still tries to tell me often but I shut it down straight away. \n\nBut my main point is that I'm getting to the point where I'm fed up of listening to her tell me about all these men trying to get with her, and the sexy talk they try to engage her in, when she's giving out her number to people already doing this stuff in person - What does she expect? She always has an excuse when someone asks her why she gave them her number (because she doesn't just tell me this stuff), and it's always playing off like she had a totally innocent reason to do it, like she wanted them to tell her about fun things happening in the area (as opposed to just googling it?) \n\nI've heard her friends say she's leading men on just to stop talking to them in a few days and she denies it and says she isn't interested in them and she isn't ready to date yet, but I believe she probably is leading them on. I've been out with her before, one on one and with her friends, and whilst she has sometimes been approached by interested men, this is happening all the time now, and giving out her number when she knows they're interested I feel is definitely making them think they have a chance. I feel she must be doing something whilst she's out with her friends to be getting all of these men talking to her, and I feel a bit bad for the guys who seem actually nice, who want to go out on dates, because they think she's interested too.\n\nThe thing is, if I tell her she should stop giving out her number, I don't know if that makes me an A-hole because I'm inserting myself into a situation she seems, ultimately, okay with. Nobody has explicitly said to her \"Well, what do you expect? If you don't want these guys to try to sleep with you then stop giving them your number when they've clearly shown signs of wanting to sleep with you.\" But I feel it's because everyone feels she's enjoying the attention from the men. She definitely uses it as a confidence boost, she'll start saying stuff about look at what my dad's missing and she can get guys still. It's helped her stop obsessing over my dad so much, which is why initially none of us thought anything of it and liked she was coping better. I don't think anyone wants to stop her having fun, but at the same time, none of us want to hear about the vulgar things people say to her, or how she's been asked out and how crazy that is as she isn't even interested, every time we meet up. I really don't know if this is something I should let her navigate herself, or if it's a good idea I say something to her.\n\nShould I tell her to stop giving her number out? Should I just leave her to it? Is there a better way to handle it?",

      "description": "I worked with a guy and kept in contact with him over the years. The last few years he has gotten very depressed, mostly because he is lonely and isolated. He is hyper focused on finding “a mate” and has a very skewed perception of what a relationship should be. Basically he wants someone to take care of him and make him happy, but it comes off in a bad way. ANY positive interaction from a single female is his signal to try and woo her. He refuses to become friends with people, especially those who are in relationships because “what is the point they are already taken.” He used to talk to me about how he was sad nobody loved him and I’d help him through the worst of it since he was my friend. But lately it has gotten worse. \n\nHe tried getting multiple types of help, but nothing did any good despite multiple medication trials to the full dose for the appropriate time frame. I keep telling him to talk to a doctor or a psychologist, but he doesn’t see the point because that won’t help him find a girlfriend. He had intentionally overdosed on his medications before and I’m worried he will do it again. At the same time I’ve put my foot down about not helping him with a relationship anymore because he needs to figure that out himself and any sort of formula or set of actions he wants me to give won’t make a relationship work. He told me he only was continuing to talk to me because I helped him figure out relationship stuff.  I told him off for that and he apologized.\n\nSince then I’ve hosted him and he insulted my home, my food, my state, my partner, and my appearance and continuously expressed displeasure at all options I had given him. This is not the friend I knew before.\n\nEvery time I talk to him he always says he is terribly sad and has nobody to talk to, but he is absolutely miserable to be around and I don’t know what to do. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to be done with his depression and for wanting to stop talking to him altogether even though it looks like he could really use support? It’s been almost two years since it got worse.",

      "description": "Okay sounds pretty bad already I know but hear me out.\n\nI have an online friend who I've been talking to for about three years now. During said time I have been there for her no matter the situation and had to talk her and several of her other friends off the ledge multiple times. She used to be really kind to me and I really loved her.\n\nNow however something in our friendship has changed. She's always taken her anger out on me whether it be through picking fights or just insulting me randomly. I know it's because there's no one else around to be the target of her anger and she's going through a really hard time. But it still hurts to hear some of the things she says. Especially since I've been trying to help her. It's gotten to the point that whenever I'm at work and can't message her she thinks I hate her and won't believe me when I try to explain.\n\nShe has professionals around her to help her so if I leave it's not like she has no one to help her through the tough times. I tried leaving already earlier this month but ended up staying because she made me feel guilty for trying to go.\n\nThough I love her I can't always be there for her. I have a life outside of my phone and I don't want to feel guilty for living it anymore. And on top of that I've been feeling like I'm coming apart and sinking to this dark place in my mind. I can't juggle trying to keep myself happy and being there for this girl 24/7. \n\nDoes it make me an asshole to abandon this girl?",

      "description": "I literally just found this sub today and I hope I am following all the rules. I am not looking for any sort of absolution or advice because really nothing can be done at this point. I just want to know if the feelings I have are justified...hence: am I the asshole. \n\nSix years ago I was 22 and started dating the absolutely most perfect guy on the planet. Saw sparks immediately, fell hard for him within the first few dates, he says he fell just as hard. We had an amazing first year courtship. I mean literally out of a fairytale romance novel. I was so in love with him I could not see strait. \n\nSo exactly one year in, his high school sweetheart shows up on the scene with a baby she claims is his. The timing of it was right from the last time he's seen her (kid was about 2 years old) and she claimed that she didn't know who the baby's father was at first but now was certain it was him and she needed him in his life. This part of the story could go on for pages but fast forward to the baby wasn't his, DNA test proved it. It was some sort of crazy girl shakedown because the real father wouldn't buy her a car or some such craziness that people get themselves into. \n\nI was so relieved and figured our relationship would continue unabated after this minor bump in the road. However the baby scare freaked him the fuck out. He claimed he was still in love with me but he'd seen into the face of fatherhood and commitment and he just wasn't ready and broke up with me. I was devastated beyond words. Like couldn't eat sleep, eat or even breathe. He went off on a summer vacation sold travel around Europe by himself. About two weeks in, I decided I couldn't be without him so I texted him that I needed to talk. He didn't respond right away so maybe two days later I texted him back that I was super late, was probably pregnant and I wasn't asking for him to come back, I just wanted him to be aware. I 100% was not pregnant.  \n\nHe called me immediately and asked what my plans were. I told him that I planned on getting an abortion but I felt like he should no. He told me to not do anything rash and that he would change his ticket and come home as soon as he was able. So when he got home he told me that he loved me, that he wanted to be with me, that his ex-GF scare wasn't my fault and he was sorry he bolted and that he wanted to keep the baby. I really hadn't planned for that happening that quickly. \n\nSo perhaps fortunately I got my period maybe two weeks later and was able to convince him that he blood was probably a miscarriage. I told him I was too scared to disappoint him and pretended to drive myself to planned parenthood where I concocted a fake miscarriage story. He never asked for any proof but he was deeply upset that the \"baby\" didn't make it. \nI pretended to be upset by the \"miscarriage\" too.\n\nWe pretty quickly both realized that it was probably for the best and our relationship more or less picked up where it had left off before. We aren't not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but I truly love him. He supports me in my career, he's amazing, he's wonderful and I can't live without him. We got married about 3.5 years ago.\n\n\nSo in December we had our first baby, an amazingly beautiful little boy who we both adore. My husband is amazing father and is willing to sacrifice just about any material good so I can be a SAHM. Everything we have is amazing. He's in the Navy, we live in an amazing little beach side community in California, he's a wonderful dad. I could not ask for more. \n\nBut I know in my heart all of it is based on a lie. Am I the asshole?\n",

I did not notice any snoring. Maybe he doesn't snore every night or maybe I just fell asleep before he did and slept through it.\n\nHe texted me a couple days later and said he was salty that I left. I explained why, just as I did above, and he could not handle it. Pointed out that it didn't seem to be a problem the first time. That he didn't want to be with someone that couldn't stand being next to him. I said we could work something out. Ear plugs or whatever, it's not a big deal, it just was that night so I left.

I soon find out he asked out a girl that i used to be friends with in elementary, but she and i grew apart. \n\nShe rejected him because she only saw him as a friend and felt weird dating an ex of someone she used to be best friends with.\n\n He wanted to get back together and i told him i needed some time because i felt that i at least deserved the truth when he broke up with me.\n\nAfter some time and a long talk we got back together. I told him it might take me a while to fully trust him again because of what happened and even before we started dating i've had trust issues with my dad and brother (he knew about these issues). I asked him to please be patient with me and communicate our emtions. He agreed.\n\nI had trouble telling personal things and believing certain things he said, and i said all i needed from him was reassurance. He was good on his part.\n\nSome months pass and i feel like im almost there but not quite yet. Eventually we get into a spat and he felt that by taking him back i should be able to fully trust him by then. I know its been some time since then and we are in good spot rn, but the thought has nipped at the back of my mind since. Was i wrong for taking so long to to fully trust him again?",

      "description": "On mobile, bear with formatting please.\n\nI straight up was in love with this girl. We lived a few towns away though (like a good 15-20 minute drive). We talked every night over ft and fell asleep together every night for about 2 months. Eventually I fell for her\n\nI let her know how I felt, knowing full well that she wouldn’t be very comfortable but it was killing me trying to keep it a secret. I loved her so much and just wanted to show her that I would always be there for her. \n\nShe decided to never talk about it but dropped subtle hints and sometimes not so subtle hints that she liked me. (One time she straight up asked if it ever seemed like she liked me and I said sometimes. She replied by saying that those were her favorite times. I thought this was good news) \n\nWith the Sadie’s dance coming up soon, her friends were trying to get her to ask me and she said that she probably would, but we’d just go as friends. I said of course and secretly hoped this would be the first step to actually being able to spend more time with her in person. \n\nShe asked me about my feelings for her on ft one night and I elaborated. She then was teasing me by saying that she would block me and I wouldn’t be able to communicate with her ever again. I thought she was joking until she blocked me on everything except my contact. When she asked for last words I said “I love you” as a last ditch effort to stole her. (Talking to her was my favorite part of every day and it always made me happier) She said that she didn’t want to block me now but she did anyways. She seemed like she didn’t want to either but she still did. \n\nHave her space for a week and then got one of my friends to talk to her to see if there was any reason why she did. She got pissy and yelled at my friend. Left her alone for another week and one day she unblocked me and said she was sorry. I said that a reason before hand would’ve been nice but I get it. Long story short, she said I was annoying and clingy, I also made her uncomfortable and she didn’t want to talk to me anymore. \n\nI fell kind of bad but at the same time I feel really hurt because she played with me knowing full well how I felt about her. She led me on even though she didn’t like me. Idk how to feel and I want to apologize and also yell at her. I loved her so much and she tore my heart out. Just needed a place to vent and see what you guys think. ",

      "description": "Sorry, English is not may first language, so sorry for grammatical errors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live with my husband, daughter(5) and our dog.\n\nMy aunt and her husband were over for a visit, the men doing… man-things in the garage, while I was in the livingroom with my daughter and aunt. \n\nMy aunt has always been a sweet lady, but very pampering of her own kids, like it’s the world end if they get a scraped knee. She has always been, its your job to protect them from the world. \n\nMe on the other hand, I’ve always been; live and learn. I like to guide more than shielding and let my daughter experience it on her own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, onto the event.\n\nWe were in the livingroom, daughter was on the floor cuddling with the dog and just petting in general.\n\nI was on the couch with my aunt and we were just talking about general stuff, how have you been, how’s the kids and such. \n\nSuddenly there is a small yelp from the dog, I quickly get ready to leap over if something happened, but dog just gets up and leaves the room.   \n I asked my daughter what happened, and she tells me she was petting his ear and he made a sound.\n\nI make a motion for her to come over to me and she does, ‘cause I can see she is upset and not sure what she did.\n\nI ask again what she did in details, she explains she was scratching his ear and pulled it to get more space to do the petting.\n\nI’ve told her before, not to pull on the dog, tail, ears, paws and such. It hurts the dog and makes him uncomfortable.\n\nI try to explain this a few time and she keeps asking why.\n\nSo I go, what do you feel about this. And I proceed to gently grab her ear, just having a hold of it, no pressure at all, and does a small pull. Automatic her head follows, to relieve the pressure and I let go.\n\nI ask her again how she felt about that. Not good is her response, and I ask what she thinks the dog feels, and she goes; not good again.\n\nHere the tears slowly starts coming, ‘cause she now realize she brought pain to the dog and feels bad.\n\nI take her on my lap, gives her a hug and says its okay, now you learned something new and that’s good. \n\nWe sit there for a few, before she is okay again and wants to go play with the dog to make it up for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe moment my daughter steps out the room, my aunt lets go.\n\nWhat a horrible mom I am to inflect pain on my daughter, I should be ashamed, never allowed near kids again, the dog needs to be put down, horrible living conditions and so on.\n\nI cant even remember all she puked out, I was honestly just sitting there in shock.\n\nSince I didn’t really respond, she got up, called her husband that they were leaving and walked out the door, while threatening she would call the child protective service.\n\nI’m just lost for words on how she reacted, and tbh question if I did something wrong. Welp? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR; Daughter petting dog, pulled its ear, I pull hers(gently) to teach why it was bad, aunt goes on a rant how bad of a parent I am.**",

      "description": "Background: my Catholic parents popped out 6 kids. Myself (eldest, 26F), three kids who play no part in this tale, my sister Mary (22) and my sister Liz (19). All names changed! I have a partner of 2 years (Abe) and Liz has a partner of 1 (Luke). \n\nMy cousin is getting married in a few months and we are all traveling there and staying in a hotel for 2 nights. Mary had initially asked if Liz and I would be cool with all sharing a room in order to keep expenses down. If Abe wasn't coming, that would've been A-OK. But he is and obviously we planned to just get our own room. Ditto Liz and Luke. So Mary is stuck getting her own room solo. Sucks, but she's has a job when she is home from college (full ride). \n\nMy parents told me tonight they wanted Liz and I to get a room with Mary and have Abe and Luke share a second room. To avoid scandal and not having our behavior reflect badly on our youngest siblings, to help save our souls, and to ease the pressure on Mary's wallet. That is the order those reasons were given to me. Liz and Luke are cool with this. \n\nI'm hella not. My parents haven't expressed concerns about where I sleep in the last two years, knowing I spend 9/10 weekends at Abes place. They're also cool with Luke and Liz living together. To say anything now seems hypocritical at the very least. I don't think it is fair to anyone aside from Mary. And my parents are control freaks who left me with emotional trauma that I'm still trying to work through. \n\nAbe will follow my lead as this is my family we are dealing with, as I would if the situation were reversed. Liz doesn't want to create drama and Luke agrees. \n\nSo, Reddit. WIBTA if I told my parents to pound sand? ",

      "description": "I have a friends group with 2 others where we would chat and play games together. We were very much just regular people having different fun conversations as you would in a podcast. We met online each one of us, and have been friends for the past 3 months. We all live abroad from each other.\n\nOne day, I decided to ask them both if they would be interested in joining a new free game with me when it releases a few weeks later. It was free for a few days. They reply with a curious yes and said they are up for it. Fast forward a day behind the release window and I realize it's 45 gb big. For a demo, it's a large amount. What's important here is that I don't have alot of internet package on offer. For what I'm paying, that amount is 10% of my package, so I go to them with reluctancy and tell them that this is alot and that I would accept to download it if only they would join me. I'd explain that I'd rather pay for the session than the game itself. I explicitly made that clear and they both said they'd join so I stopped being silly.\n\nI was late by a day as the service just bugged out so I had to postpone the download. It worked out fine for one of them so she got to try out the game first if she wanted to and she did like 10 min and that's it. The other couldn't make it at all sadly but life happens so I completely understood. Mine got done the next day and I waited for them to come online. I get a message then that she thought the game was boring and that she didn't want to come online to play it again.\n\nI was immediately put off by it. I went to ask if she would join me regardless to play together like the plan because that's what I wanted but she continues to say nah. I complained with a \"that was a waste of 45gb\" and she goes to tell me something like \"just delete it?\".\n\nI'm grouchy for the next week and the other 2 are just talking regularly and keeps including me in but I didn't reply. I then let it out that I was still mad about the case. Before the whole argument started, I mentioned that I didn't want this to become big and that I only wanted her to at least understand what she did and that we'd just move on after this. I even claimed I was the bad guy here so I did not expect anything in return. They both go on to ask me to explain. I do and it then just becomes this pointless argument because I try to explain my issue but she still thinks it's something else. That I'm mad because she doesn't want to play the game. I'm mad that we agreed to play together and she went ahead to play it before and then just left me. I would have been 100% acceptable if she got bored of it during the session but not on her own. \n\nAt the end, she left the group and I don't know if she understood yet what's happening. I guess my only hope was that she at least understood. The other guy didn't pitch in at all. Am I the asshole for making this issue when my only desire was to make sure it doesn't happen again?",

      "description": "Throwaway BTW (Hopefully they don't use reddit O.O)\n\nOk, I should start off with some background information. Some details are going to be changed just so people who know me don't match the details...  Disclaimers aside ON TO the history. **NOTE Backstory is SUPER LONG and I made a TLDR for backstory.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst off we're all 17. This involved 3 people mainly: me (Male), my ex-bestfriend (I'll call him Adam also Male), and the girl(who will be called Grace, she goes to a different school to me and Adam), also a few of our mutual friends. Adam and Grace have been friends since late elementary/early middle school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis story starts back in summer of 2017, I started getting into Dota 2 and my friend caught wind of this and invited me to join a group made of our mutual friends made out of people from our school and Grace.  It was pretty chill and we had fun. I kept my interaction with the group at a minimum and played the occasional game with them. I mainly just played with Adam or my other friend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Note: at this point they are NOT dating\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJump forward to December, Adam and I had planned to the annual Anime convention (we usually go together and get a hotel).  The convention was going fine and we were having a really good time. In the middle of this Adam gets a text from Grace saying that she was at the convention too \\[Her older Sister and her also LOVES anime and they go every year so it was nothing new\\]. We met up with her and hung out as a group of 3. This was my first time meeting her and actually talking to her. It was pretty awkward at first because Grace and I aren't what most people considered socially skilled. I kept my conversations mainly with Adam and Adam talked to Grace. I didn't really talk to Grace as I didn't really know too much about her. So later that evening it turned out that Adam had plans and left early because he had family obligations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now it was just Grace and I walking back to the convention hall because she needed to wait for her sister to pick her up, and it gave me a good opportunity to get to know her. We hit it off amazingly (at least in  my opinion), it turns out that we went to the same middle school (DUH!) and we heard a lot of good things about each other through other friends. We had a lot of things in common and our personality matched very well. We ended up waiting 3 hours for her sister and I stayed with her because I didn't feel comfortable leaving a girl in the middle of a city we both hardly knew. what was going to be small talk turned into a fun 3 hour conversation that could easily kept going on if her sister didn't arrive. She and her sister invited me out to dinner when she was picked up and which I gladly accepted because I wanted to get to know Grace better, turns out her sister is an amazing person who I also got along very well with also. Dinner went great and we left on a good note. I called Adam later and spent a few hours talking to him on the phone just chilling and laughing about the days events.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a bit. A couple of weeks have past and I have gotten closer to Adam as friends and Grace and I became really good friends.  I invited Grace out to the movies and asked Adam to tag along because it was a thank you for dinner and since me and her met at the convention I thought have a really good mutual friend would be cool.\n\nA few more weeks pass.\n\nAt this point I was infatuated with Grace and was head over heels for her. TBH i kinda idolized her as she was my \"ideal girl\". At this point our Dota 2 group was also starting to hang out in real life and it became a regular to just hang out and have fun together. As time passed and i got to know Grace better I decided I should stop being a wimp and ask her out. I call up Adam and as we were talking it slipped out that I liked Grace and I told him I planned to ask her out and what did he think. He said good for you man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, he offhandly told me that he and Grace have been secretly dating and they have been for a month.. I didn't even have a chance to ask her out yet and I felt betrayed and kinda in denial. I texted her about it and she said it was his idea and that nobody knew not even her best friend, I was the first one to find out. I wanted to cry but I kept cool and supported them. She still to this day doesn't know that I liked her and I still somewhat still do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# SKIP TO HERE IF TOO LONG ON TOP BUT I RECOMMEND READING IT. BACKSTORY TLDR: Met my best friends childhood best friend who turned out to be my ideal girl and good friend, we hit it off really well. 6 months later, told my best friend that I was going to ask her out and it turns out they've been dating in secret at his request for a month.\n\n# \n\nNow onto the part where I ask you all on whether not I'm an asshole. Now I was really good friends with a girl who I like so I couldn't just cut her out of my life because we're in the same friends group and I liked talking to her though I tried to keep things platonic which is easy for me because im antisocial. I only hung out with her whenever it was a group thing and I tried to keep my one on one interactions with her on a only when necessary basis which is hardly ever.\n\nOne event happened where after a group hangout with the Dota 2 group was ending, Adam  and Grace were going to walk back to Adam's place and since I live the same way I asked Grace if I could tag along instead of leaving after them because I had to walk anyways. Grace had no problem with it since it meant all three of us got more time to hang out but Adam got upset and called and Uber for him and Grace. (A lonely walk back home.) Adam later blew up at me on the phone about how I was trying to get in the way of him and Grace and that he hinted to her to a romantic walk back after the group hangout and that Grace didn't get the hint and was the only reason Grace said yes. He said that Grace would appreciate it if I backed off and let them have their own time and stop butting in. He was also mad that I talked to them during the group hang out since he was treating it as a date with grace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt super terrible and I sent an apology to Grace saying that I didn't know that she felt that way and if I was being a bother for both of them it wasn't my intention. Grace called me up right away to ask me what the hell I was talking about and that she didn't feel that way at all. She honestly didn't get the hint of the walk and thought just wanted me to tag along as well and that she never considered me a bother rather the opposite. Grace and I had a long talk that night and despite her insistence that she didn't know what Adam was talking about and she was worried about me because I sounded really panicky in the apology I sent her. Her and I left the conversation on a good note and the conversation is still a secret to Adam to this day.\n\n Eventually life got in the way and she started only going on dates with Adam and I started looking to move on to other girls and try to get over Grace (I actually was successful and ended up dating another girl for a little bit but that ended because we didn't have the same interests and she wanted to focus on her academics. It ended on good terms.) .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways what destroyed my relationship with my Adam was he doxxed me in retaliation and he revealed that he was angry at me for a long time and it's been building up and he thought I used our friendship to get closer to Grace, which in my opinion might be biased but I that thought didn't even occur to me, I honestly hope I didn't because I didn't think I did. He ended up apologizing for the dox and I forgave him but its been awkward ever since. I haven't talked to Grace in a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought I moved on but what sparked this post was the other day when I was hanging out at lunch recalling a story to one of my female friends. Grace and Adam and the rest of the Dota 2 walked up to me because they haven't seen me in a while because I had a different schedule and I just switched lunches to match theirs. Grace moved to have a one on one conversation with me just asking about how life was going and how school was for each other we were pretty close. After they left my female friend said I was being way to close with Grace and that she felt the attraction between us. I patched things up with Adam but I still feel guilty and an Asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post!!!!!!!!!! I really didn't mean for it to be this long but once I started typing I couldn't stop -.-",

      "description": "Last year I became friends with two girls through work. Let's call them Mary-Kate and Ashley. \n\nI met Mary-Kate first and we have a lot of superficial things in common. Similar hobbies, similar food habits, similar taste in TV. We always had lots to talk about, though she rubbed me the wrong way at times. Ashley came along a little later and we had more core similarities. Closer in age, similar stages of life, similar religious and political viewpoints, though our friendship was a slower build, due to her being an introvert. \n\nA few months ago, Mary-Kate left the job and while she quickly lost touch with Ashley, she still sent me regular texts about her new job. We went out to dinner a few times and she always claimed that she missed me so much. Meanwhile I noticed that the workplace was happier without Mary-Kate. Everyone seemed relaxed and less on edge, including myself. \n\nRecently, Ashley let slip a petty comment Mary-Kate made about me. Nothing serious enough to confront Mary-Kate, it was a comment about how I don't dress well and would be a poor shopping companion for Ashley. I have a quirky sense of style and this comment hurt a lot more than I'm sure Ashley expected. I've found myself pulling away from Mary-Kate, responding to her texts with the bare minimum. I keep replaying the friendship and find I'm downplaying her supportive moments and highlighting her melodramatic moments. \n\nI know a petty comment about my fashion choices isn't enough to end a friendship, but AITA for allowing this petty comment to make me reevaluate the friendship? And AITA for ignoring the possibility that Ashley intentionally told me about Mary-Kate's comment? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend (25M) and I (23F) have been together for almost 6 years. We have lived together for 3 1/2 years and have a child together. We have both grown complacent and comfortable in our relationship, but still love each other. It took me a while to understand being thoughtful is not in his nature, but I’ve come to accept it and love him anyway. \n\nWhile I was at work today, he texted me and told me had a surprise for me. I got a little excited, but didn’t think anything of it. When I got home, I noticed a to-go container in the fridge that contained some fries and a burger that had been eaten off of. When he got home, he went to the fridge and said “look what I brought you!” He pulled the to-go container out, much to my dismay. He explained he and his Mom went to lunch where she took a few bites of her burger and told him to bring the rest home to me. My feelings were hurt and I said “Well, thanks. It’s nice to know I’m worth your crumbs.” His feelings were instantly hurt and we got into a huge argument where he made it clear he didn’t want to talk to me for the rest of the night. I asked why his feelings were hurt, I was the one whose feelings should be hurt. He explained he thought he was “being sweet” and figured I could take the burger for lunch or eat it for dinner tonight. It would be one less thing for me to worry about. I told him I was thankful for the burger, but to maybe not get my hopes up next time he has a “surprise” that are someone else’s scraps. I asked how he would feel if the roles were reversed. What if I told him I had a surprise for him and he came home to a half-eaten hot dog. He argued he would “be happy” with it because it was a gift from me. We rarely argue, but we are currently still not speaking. I really don’t feel like I was wrong for not being excited he brought me someone else’s leftover lunch and called it a surprise. \n\nTLDR: my boyfriend of 6 years brought me home his Mom’s leftover lunch and was mad that I wasn’t more excited/ grateful. \n\nAITA for not being excited over this dang “surprise”?",

      "description": "My Husband is a pretty skilled musician and plays numerous instruments and composes on the side. I never really cared for it, but I recognize how much he loves music so I don't try to mess with. He often spends hours practicing his instruments which I'm fine with.\n\nHowever, he's been pushy since my daughter has been born. Instantly when she was born he made her listen to music. Maybe made is too harsh. He just played music for her, either on his phone or with his instruments. He said it's to give her \"perfect pitch\", apparently it's when you are trying to give the kid the ability to tell pitches just by hearing them. It's accomplished by letting them listen to music (husband says it's certain types of music, like Jazz or Bach) and they'll gain that ability. I'm fine with that and it's actually working which is cool.\n\nMy daughter is now just 4 and he wants to give her an instrument to play. He gave an introduction to lots of instruments and told her to pick a one she wants to learn. She wants to learn, but I'm against it. I say that it's strange to be forcing instruments down her throat at such an early age and that we should wait until later for her to choose by herself what she wants to do--whether that be sports, video games, or music. But she should decide. Not my husband. My husband insists that she should start early but I think it's just too much for her. What if she doesn't like it and my husband keeps forcing her to play the instrument? What if because she was forced she wouldn't like to play music? I'm hesitant, and he's still insisting that she start to play music.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for calling the non-emergency number on a panhandler?",
      "description": "I work retail for minimum wage in a shopping center close to Detroit. There's multiple businesses here, the biggest being Walmart. I frequent that Walmart nearly every other day, especially while on break at work, to either socialize with some of the people there or to grab some lunch. Usually when it gets late, around 10:00PM, you can find at least one person there begging for money, although you usually don't see the same people there often.\n\n\nLately, there has been one older woman, around her 40s, that has been begging (panhandling) around the entire shopping center, whether in the parking lot harassing people at their cars or waiting to people to leave the stores. For context, it has been raining this whole past week or more and she was wearing bright white shoes. I looked at her, assumed she was being deceitful and not actually homeless. Shes asked me two times while leaving Walmart for $5, no reason given. I'm used to being asked for money and told her that I don't carry cash (which is true) and I'm sorry.\n\n\nToday, I left work to grab some food across the street. She was in the parking lot, yelling at people getting in their cars for money. I recognized her and walked a different direction to avoid her. However, on the way back, she was very close to my storefront and noticed me. She yelled out, \"Excuse me ma'am, could I have $5?\" I ignored her and kept walking and went back inside.\n\n\nLater on, I decided to take my lunch break and left the store to eat outside. She saw me while in the middle of accepting money from someone and called out to me again.\n\n\nAt that moment I had dialed the non-emergency for our local police station and they sent someone out immediately. She followed me up to the counter and began talking towards me, in front of a coworker and an assistant manager.\n\n\nThe first thing she says is, \"Did I offend you? Did I offend you?\" She started telling me that in the Bible, it says you should give to the poor. She says I don't know what her situation is, she isn't harassing me, I could have told her to stop, ect. She said she could take my job if she wanted to.\n\n\nShe left, but a minute later comes back in and asks my coworkers if they called the police on her, and they told her no (true.) She then asked who I was on the phone with. I told her it was my boyfriend and put it on speaker for her to hear. I basically told her that I'm tired of telling her no, and that she is making customers at my store and the surrounding stores uncomfortable.\n\n\nBefore she could leave again, an officer had already pulled up and came inside. He pulled her outside, came back in, and said he sent her on her way but unfortunately she's allowed to panhandle outside in the lot. Although he reassured me that she would even trespassing if she came into the store again as he warned her that she is unwelcome.\n\n\nTLDR: AITA for calling the non-emergency line and having an officer tell this serial panhandler to leave me alone, and does it make a difference whether she was actually homeless or not?\n",

      "description": "Backstory: It is well known in my circles that I am a costume enthusiast and will usually make a costume from scratch and will take every given opportunity for dressing up. I’m also a bit of a nerd, so there are quite a few book character costumes knocking about the house (some fairly obscure). That said, I will fuss over anyone, especially a child, who makes even the slightest attempt to dress up. I think it’s one of the perks of childhood to have a bit of fun without judgement and it is only to be encouraged.\nToday: Moms at school pick up (5-6 year olds) we’re discussing what the kids are dressing up as. My neighbour tells everyone how she just told her daughter(just 5) to pick a character that wears normal clothes, because she wasn’t going to spend any time on something only to have her daughter change her mind on the day  (the downside of raising a daughter who knows her own mind, but this is not what this post is about). The neighbour then complained that the daughter will have to carry the book around with her so that other people would know which character she was.  Later on in the day, it occurred to me that if her daughter did change her mind at 7am on the day, it might be useful to know that we have a couple of costumes they could use. So I literally texted her with that: We have such and such costumes, in case you want them. \nHere is the response:\n\ni am perfectly happy and she is perfectly happy.the book is one that she likes and means something to her and the girl she identifies with.i generally prefer books about real people.the only issue is whether people will recognize who she is but can’t really let that influence it\n\nI now feel like I have offended her. I clarified that it was in case she changed her mind, obviously, but still. \nI am fond of her and our children are very close. There are ideological disagreements but ultimately we have more in common than not. \n\nSo, did I assume and make an ass of myself or was her response OTT? ",

As an important member of the team this would be expected of me. I argued that after hours or extra hours were one thing but working saturdays and sundays is entirely different. He said he needed time to think about this and later sent me a message to say that I can have the three days back. \n\nNow he barely greets me in the morning and avoids small talk. \n\nI enjoyed going to work but now I feel like shit when I come here. \n\nColleagues had been in the same situation but instead of speaking up they complain behind his back. \n\nNot sure how to get the sour taste out of my mouth and get the relationship back to normal.

      "title": "AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for wanting to go out with her friends when I visit her at uni.",
      "description": "**AITA: This is legit my first ever post on reddit so if I format this horrendously then im really sorry I have no idea what im doing.**\n\nSo basically my girlfriend and I were together for about 3 years. We met in school and eventually got accepted at different uni's, about 1hr and half train journey with two changes with long waits. The train journey cost about £30 a time, which is super expensive for me as I'm not well of my student loan is awful. I didn't care about the price because I was always happy to go and see her. Now here's a few things for context:\n\n1. It was ALWAYS me that travelled down to see her because her uni course was alot more intensive and I agreed to go down to save her the time of travelling so she could work.\n2. I went down fortnightly, sometimes weekly, so this was a good £100 a month on travel. and then another 50-100 on going out to eat/food/drinks ect.\n\nAnyway, so at the beggining of uni she was super sweet, very affectionate and always greatful for my visits. But then things started to change a bit. I'd come down and visit as usual, but instead of spending most the time with me she'd dip and out the dorm and go and chill with her new friends. Now this wasn't bad, im not Kim Jong un, she has freedom to do what she wants and isnt obliged to spend time with me. But me and her friends were not even remotely on the same level about anything. She went to Cambridge and I was at a non Russel group uni. Not that this matters, but her friends were alot more intelligent and we shared little to nothing In common with each other so I didn't really enjoy sitting and trying to talk to them, especially when I'd come all the way down and spent alot of money to see HER, not her friends.\n\nI tried my hardest to join in and enjoy myself but it just wasn't enjoyable. Now here's where it gets to the AITA part. She knew that I didn't enjoy spending time with her friends, and she got to see them all week as they lived in the same dorms, so at first I just kinda went \"hey look, I've spent alot of money and time and effort getting down here, and I want to spend time with just you, and be together and spend quality time\". And \\*expectedly\\* I got a responses of \"wooowww so I can't have friends/you're not even trying/I really want you to like my friends/I want to spend time with them too\". And in true sensitive me fashion I was all like \"ah okay sorry will try harder sorry love you\".\n\nTHEN it progressed throughout the year and got to the point where one night I went down to see her and she straight up went \"Hey we're all going out tonight so wear your nice shirt\" And I was just like \"nah im not going out man, I don't bounce off them, they don't like me (they thought I was a \"chav\") I've come down to see YOU, not spend time with them. I see you once a week, why can't we just chill together\". To which again I got the usual \"you don't want to spend time with my friends, they're really trying with you, you're just looking like you don't like them\". Like this really isnt a money issue, or a time issue, but the fact im busting my fucking nut trying to get money to come and see you, and you don't even appriciate it enough to spend time ONE NIGHT of the week alone with me.  Like AITA? Am I being unreasonable? She got me fucked up, I genually don't know if I'm being an asshole or not. Anyway this happened a handful of other times, same arguments, put a tad strain on the relationship and eventually she broke up with me because \"thing's weren't the same anymore\".\n\nBut yeah, was I an asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if I formatted this wrong, im new to reddit and that, thanks guys.",

      "description": "So I'm going to try to include as few details as possible in this story because I don't want this getting back to my co-workers/friends.\n\nI bartend and generally have a good relationship with my co-workers. I consider some of them among my best friends.\n\nOne of our newer bartenders broke up with her boyfriend who was cheating on her. She still lived with him so they had to make that work for awhile. \n\nRecently she came in crying and told a pretty awful assault story. Not going to delve into specifics but I consider it like [Greg Hardy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/11/06/horrific-details-emerge-from-greg-hardys-domestic-violence-case/?utm_term=.c7051aacc4c8) level assault (without the guns laying around on the couch). The type of shit that's truly horrific and made me want to throw up. \n\nRight away I encouraged her to talk to the police, because what he (allegedly) did should land him in prison for multiple years. I was legitimately concerned that her life was in danger. She claimed that she didn't want him to lose his job.\n\nI believed her because I'm inclined to believe domestic assault victims. However, today she was discussing some of her new dating prospects and one of our (female) co-workers approached me and said that she was suspicious of her story, which I had was also starting to question.\n\nThis was because of a bunch of different factors:\n\n1. She's been telling so many people about this horrific assault. Like not just all of my co-workers but regular guests as well. Like this isn't just \"my boyfriend slapped me\" shit. That's horrible enough but what she's describing is WAY worse.)\n2. She doesn't want to press charges. Now, I know this is common in cases of rape and DV but it just seems incompatible with reason 1. Like I understand why women (and people in genera)l would want to keep this inside but she's told so many people that she barely knows. That seems like a weird disconnect to me.\n3. She spent like 30 minutes yelling at him on the phone while we were closing down one night this week. Given what she's described, the last thing I would think she would want to do is provoke him because someone dying did not seem out of the question given the story she told.\n4. There were no signs of trauma on her body. Not impossible when considering the story she told, but definitely unlikely.\n\nIt's mainly the first two things that I listed which don't make much sense when combined with each other. She's definitely the type of girl that loves drama which in my mind means she could easily be lying or exaggerating. But she's also a pretty tough person so I wouldn't doubt that maybe she's just managed to shake it off remarkably well.o other \n\nTwo other co-workers told me tonight that they doubt that she was telling the complete truth. I'm not sure if she's telling the truth, lying, or just exaggerating, but I feel guilty for not believing her completely. I would never actually say this to her unless there's some confrontation that escalates things, and I'm continuing to outwardly support her, but I have my suspicions on the inside.\n\nAITA for not believing her completely?

      "description": "For background, my coworker and I are on the same project (we are business consultants) and have known each other for 4-5 months and are generally friendly to each other on a day to day basis. My coworker is pregnant with twins and is in the third trimester of her pregnancy. As you can probably guess she is noticeably pregnant. Today we and another coworker on our team were walking from our office to a neighboring client's office which required us to take a strangely narrow escalator. If a normal escalator can fit two people side by side, this one's width is about half that size.\n\nAs she boarded the escalator she said to us \"Wow, this is a tight fit\". And I, without missing a beat jokingly replied \"Yeah, I guess it's a good thing you're not having triplets then\"\n\nShe laughed. I laughed. The other coworker did not laugh and had a scowl on her face. Later today the other coworker pulled me aside saying my comment was offensive and I shouldn't have said what I said. I took it in stride and said I would apologize to my pregnant coworker (she left early so I'm planning on doing so tomorrow just to be safe).\n\nI personally don't believe what I said was offensive. Getting bigger while pregnant is normal and people who have triplets get bigger than people with twins. In my mind, it wasn't so much as a fat joke as it was a matter of fact joke. Though I can see why a woman's changing body size could be a sensitive issue. But I do feel like I gauged the situation, knowing from previous conversations that my pregnant coworker is a good sport and seems to take shenanigans around the office well.\n\nDoes assuming my pregnant coworker wouldn't be offended make me the asshole. Or does her being a good sport about things justify my seemingly inappropriate joke?",

They decide to go to a club. Along the way my girlfriend keeps telling me I should get a cool black leather jacket like German guy and I say nah that's not my style but she keeps bugging me bc she says I would look good in it and I'm still like nah dude not me. We continue on... German guy almost gets in a fight and my patience is wearing thin. I don't really want to dance at this point but I'm still planning to be along for the ride. At the club cover charge is high and girlfriend casually mentions she wants to do cocaine in the club with German guy.\n\nI lost it and demanded we leave German guy and leave this club. We do. Girlfriend and I argued on the street as she still wants to dance and I want to go home. We part ways - I go to the hotel and she goes dancing with her remaining friends. I was still really upset at the way she treated me but the fight didn't seem like too big a deal yet. \n\nCut to 7 AM. She returns from the club and slides into bed expecting everything to be cool between us. I'm still a little upset so I pull away from her touch. The arguing starts up again... She calls me a square and I tell her to fuck off and leave the hotel to go walk off my anger. Now I'm back at the hotel and she's gone off to her friend's place to deal with her own emotions. She's not responding to my messages.\n\nFor context - normally we get along really great and love each other and don't fight. Also, she takes anxiety and depression medication which is less effective when she drinks. She has been doing more reckless drinking and taking drugs lately which has me concerned. We have been talking marriage plans too.\n\nSo, AITA?\n",

I said fair enough, let me then at least help you with all the info you might need for interview and all the details about our position and he proposed alright lets just get wasted one night and we will be settled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward few months later he got accepted and after two months I met him at christmas party where I just wanted to talk about how he likes it so far have some drinks, just casually. Now I mentioned that in one month (as he has to be in the company at least three months) we can finally go celebrate that and get drunk. But he right away started with this refferal and so that we can split it right ? while I really did not want to discuss it there and make an argument I somewhat went with it but said that ok lets see as soon as the money comes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the money came and I refuse to split it as we had some arrangements first time and I had plan for those money. He acts as I somewhat did not surprise him and karma is for free and stuff that should make me feel bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to share this ? Its not huge amount but its something that will cover something I planned. It is mostly about principle as to not let people do what they want with me and standing the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "As bad as that looks in the title, there's a bit of explaining I have to do.\n\nI'm in my school's hs orchestra, and I'm at the highest level. It's not necessarily an outstanding achievement, but it's something I'm proud of.\n\nThe night before my concert, I had to stay after school to practice. My phone was dead and I left my charger at home, so because I wasn't allowed to leave, I called my mom from a friend's phone and asked her to bring my charger and a pair of shoes.\n\nOn my break when I was able to charge and check my phone, I had 8 messages asking why I hadn't said goodbye after school and why I hadn't been responding to her texts. She even texted something along the lines of, \"Winterierthree2, your phone better be dead or I'm going to be fucking pissed\"\n\nI was understandably angry, an argument ensued over text, and things got kinda bad, with both of us cussing and being mean to eachother.\n\nShe plays the sax, and she's playing with another orchestra, she just didn't have to go to practice, so I was able to talk with her later about it.\n\nThe argument was partially my fault, I admit, because I was still frustrated with her after she apologized, because she had no right to be that rude when there's no way for me to remedy the situation, or even respond.\n\nShe ended up crying about it, I said I was sorry and she told me she was thinking \"bad thoughts\", meaning suicidal ones.\n\nI stayed as long as I possibly could to apologize to her and console her, even being late to the stage where I was going to perform. I made sure she was alright by the time I left and that she wasn't going to hurt herself. I told her she should come watch my concert so she isn't in here sitting all by herself. I also texted her this a bit before we performed. Keep in mind this argument had been taking place in the band room, 10 steps away from the auditorium where I was performing.\n\nShe didn't show up for any of my 30 minute performance.\n\nAt this point I'm a little pissed. I came to all of her marching band competitions, even when I hadn't been feeling well mentally, about 6 or 7 in total, driving upwards of 45 minutes each way. I also stayed for her part of the concert that was right after mine.\n\nI come back into the band room to pack up my cello, and she's chilling with one of the band teachers, talking and laughing and playing her instrument. I had worked on this music for months and was proud of my performance, and she didn't see any of it.\n\nAITA for expecting her to be there for me? She has told me about times where she's had these suicidal episodes, so this isn't the first time it happened. I suspect ITA, but I'd like to know what you guys think.",

      "title": "AITA for not being sad about my best friend's uncle dying?",
      "description": "My friend (A) and I have known each other since 1994 and have been really ingrained in each other's families for over 20 years. Needless to say I know most of their family secrets - one of which involving her uncle (U)...\n\nWhen we were kids, I was always warned to not be alone with U because he was \"weird\". I remember noticing that he was always around when we were swimming in the pool, and particularly enjoyed throwing rings in for us to dive to retrieve. I always thought he was funny, but wasn't around him enough for him to play a significant part of my childhood.\n\nFast forward to the summer of 2017. A is getting married, and she asked her sister to be her matron of honor and me to be her maid of honor. We were expected to share the responsibilities of helping A with her wedding plans, as well as putting together her bridal shower, bachelorette party, etc. However, it became apparent in the very beginning that I was in it alone when her sister had full-blown mental breakdown. Like, lost-her-job-and-put-into-mandatory-therapy mental breakdown. \n\nBecause of the unfortunate situation with her sister and the fact that I was spending more time than usual with A, she eventually let slip that her sister's problems were the result of childhood trauma. I assumed she was referring to their parent's short addiction stint (they've been clean for 20+ years and doing fantastic) but no, she was referring to U sexually assaulting every female in her family. Every. Female. His sister (her mom), his daughter, and all of his nieces...all of them except A (I'm pretty sure she doesn't remember as a defense mechanism but she says it never happened). Despite all of this, he was still invited to the wedding. Admittedly, it was very hard for me to act as if I didn't know anything, as asked, especially when I noticed him sharing cigarettes with A's sister numerous times during the reception. \n\nSo two weeks ago, when we learned that he had stage 3 cancer in his lungs and brain, I felt nothing. Actually, not nothing, I felt vindicated. I felt he finally got what he deserved after years of traumatizing every woman in his family. The thing is, though, everyone's flocked to his side. Additionally, they are all posting these long, emotional rants about how unfair it all is, coupled with dozens of photos of them with U throughout the years on social media. I honestly cannot roll my eyes hard enough.\n\nBut I get it - I get that people feel the need to make amends with the dying and choose to only remember the good times. However, I do not think that it's necessary to forgive someone of such grievous crimes, especially ones that have had such lasting effects. They are sanctify him in death and guilt tripping everyone who didn't go see him before his passing - even A's sister, who is still very unstable.\n\nI've kept my mouth shut, but I've made it clear that I will not be attending his funeral despite my friend asking me to be there for her. I have also been very tight-lipped with my condolences and attempt to change the subject whenever she brings him up. \n\nI feel completely justified in my response, and I don't feel like an asshole at all. However, I would like to hear others' input to help me better understand how my reaction looks from an outsider. It's a very delicate situation and I don't want to make it worse with my incessant apathy.\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for being upset with my girlfriend for not getting her driver permit?",
      "description": "First, some backstory: I’ve known my girlfriend for about a year and a half, “dating” her for a little over a year, and been official for 4 months. Since we’ve met, I’ve been the sole transportation, since she finds Ubers/taxis to be expensive and scary. She lives 23 miles away, which makes things a little difficult.\n\nBack in October 2017, I mentioned that if she would like to learn how to drive, I’d love to teach her and help her get her license. As she’s the type to shut down under pressure, I didn’t push it since I wanted her to take it at her own pace and I didn’t want her to feel uncomfortable. She’d avoid it whenever it came up in conversation during the following months. However, I did have her practice in a parking lot a few times throughout last year. \n\nMid last year, I voiced my concerns that driving out to pick her up just to take her to a grocery store down the street was becoming quite a strain, and even though I’ve never asked her for gas money, I mentioned that it would be helpful if she could pitch in for gas, which turned into me being an asshole for not asking in the first place. Mind you, I hate asking for compensation when doing a favor, but driving 80+ miles a week adds up very quickly. Since then, she’s given me ~$20 every now and then, which helps.\n\nCome October of last year, I purchased a car that I absolutely treasure and was uncomfortable with having other people drive. I mentioned to my girlfriend that I might not be able to teach her how to drive in my car since I couldn’t afford risking something go awry, which caused an argument about me breaking my promise on teaching her how to drive. She mentioned that I was the only one she was comfortable with and that she won’t be able to learn with other people. I told her that I’d help her get her license, and once she does, I’d be more comfortable with teaching her in my car.\n\nAfter that, she said she’d work on it. There’s a DMV in a town 20 miles in the opposite direction of where she lives from my place, and I’ve offered to take her there if she’d like to get her permit, since we both work M-F 9-5. (Side note: my job is an hour and a half away, so I leave and get home well outside of normal DMV hours)\n\nEvery time I have brought up the idea of taking her to the DMV for just the permit, she says that she doesn’t feel ready. She’s studied for it for hours and has taken the practice tests many many times. (Side note 2: She already got a permit when she was younger, but it expired a couple years ago).\n\nLast night, she mentioned that her sister will be teaching her to drive today with a quick drive around the block. I said that I don’t really support that idea, since she’d be at a huge risk in case something happens. I also mentioned that I would happily take her to the DMV in the morning if she’d like to get her permit before driving on a public road, which led to an argument about how I don’t appreciate all of the effort she’s made and that what she’s doing “is just not good enough for [me]”\n\nSo...... am I the asshole?",

He's also madly in love with her. But there's an issue. She's his cousin's ex girlfriend. \n\nI keep telling him that a relative's girlfriend, much less one you walked in on having sex with said relative is a no go zone. Add to that he's confessed more than once to her and she's told him she's not interested in him in that way. \n\nThe more he keeps her close the way he does the more I see him moping in the chats we're in together and the more he messages me about how much he wants to be with this girl. Frankly speaking I don't think she's worth his time but that's me. \n\nI have told him before that in my opinion he should see less of her and generally work to remove her from his life if all it's gonna do is hurt him the way it does. The couple times I've brought this up he gets defensive and recently tried to defend wanting her by changing his story to say she's his cousin's FRIEND'S ex and that she hates the guy. But every other time he's talked about her he's said it was his cousin's ex. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR : Friendo is hung up on a girl that's his cousin's ex girlfriend and she's not interested in him.  I think he should slowly remove her from his life because she's doing nothing but hurting him. He doesn't like that idea and I feel like an asshole for bringing it up. ",

      "description": "So basically, I feel that my mother condemns my emotions and is just not pleasant to be around. I remember when I was younger I told her stuff and then the next time we had an argument (we have those ALL the time, it’s honestly exhausting), she’d insult me about it. For example, she found out I was harming myself, and basically screamed at me for 3-hours straight about how if this got out to “authorities” she’d be “blamed” and she’d “have a record”. She says a few times before in arguments that she wishes I was dead. As a result of all this, I just show no emotion to her, and am really just flippant to her sometimes. She says this hurts and she loves me,but it is really hard to believe that when the next argument we have, she’ll say something that really hurts. She’s going through a lot (my dad died 1/18, she’s still grieving about that), and it doesn’t help that I’m naturally annoying (ADHD), but I just don’t think it’s fair to displace her feelings on me, especially when it’s my own mother telling me she’d disown me or whatnot. \n\n(NB: please be honest, if I am TA, tell me. Be truthful. Thanks) ",

      "description": "A week or two ago my exgf broke up with me. It started from me talking to her about how we had a disconnect in our relationship and something needed to change. She felt the same way, but she didn't think the problem could have been solved so we broke up. That's okay, I can accept that as answer and there isn't much I can do to change that. The previous month or so had been pretty terrible for us, we kept getting in fights and we were gradually losing feelings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I attribute this to the lack of motivation put into the relationship. I poured my heart out in the beginning of Feb and tried to schedule dates, buy presents and other things. None of them were reciprocated that month, our last date was in January. She stopped calling me and texting me as often, I was always the one trying to initiate conversations and I was getting tired of it. I'm not great at controlling my emotions, so there were times when I would get frustrated and confront her about these things, which always resulted in the same answers. They usually boiled down to her being busy or other random excuses. I think I was generally mad that she always seemed to have time for her friends (sometimes she even lied to me about when she was free) but could never be bothered to schedule any dates. I also stopped emotionally leaning on her because it felt like she just stopped caring. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for that long rant, here comes the actual scenario/question thing. I was recently talking to a mutual friend and she mentioned that the reason she wanted to break up was because she felt like she kept trying to make it work and I wasn't helping it work. This really boiled my blood, because she sent me a long text after we broke up apologizing for \"emotionally using me\" and now she's trying to make it seem like I didn't try. FFS she got some friend a valentine's day gift and forgot about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can see where she's coming from regarding my frustration towards the end and how I could have been mean, but to say I didn't try is a whole different story. I don't know, maybe I'm just really angsty or something. She still wants to be friends and I was considering it at first, but after hearing that I don't want her in my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I put a lot of effort into trying to keep our relationship going, after breaking up with me, my ex told her friends that I didn't try or reciprocate the feelings she gave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I need to edit anything for clarity let me know, I ranted pretty hard so some things might be unclear.",

      "description": "I see my family a lot and get along with them great for the most part.  One thing that drives me crazy is my brother, who tends to be something of a know-it-all.  He absolutely loves to assert himself as being smart, and tends to get very competitive about.\n\nOne of the ways this manifests is with backseat driving.  I don't drive him often (we're both adults and neither of us live at home/with each other), but when I do, it crops up, especially if he's in a bad mood for whatever reason.  These are not comments that are necessary reminders, they're usually pissy little asides like \"You didn't have to let that car go ahead of us, you know\" or \"You don't have to change lanes yet, but whatever\".  Dumb shit like that.  I've asked him to stop before and he's always said \"I'm not being snarky, I'm *helping* you.\"\n\nNeedless to say, I hate this, and I honestly find it distracting as hell.  Probably the worst case of this happened a year ago, when it was pouring horrible rain during a three-hour drive that he wouldn't stop commenting on.  He kept insisting this was for our own safety, though he didn't at any point offer to drive in the downpour.\n\nThere is a family event coming up that is going to be 1) about a ninety-minute drive, and 2) really early in the morning, so he will probably be cranky.  We might all be able to go together (in which case, our dad would drive us over), but if we can't, I may have to drive him.  If he starts in on it, would I be the asshole if I threatened to pull over?  If he kept going, I'd pull over and say some variation of \"Either you drive us the rest of the way or you stop talking.  Every time you make another comment, I will pull over again.\"\n\nI realize this makes it sound like I'm chastising a child, but at the same time, I legitimately don't know what else to do (other than just not driving him, period, which would cause a rift with my dad/the rest of the family).  He knows I hate this and won't stop, so this is my best idea to get him to cut it out. WIBTA if I did it?",

Making her cry everyday and she’s 6 like this ain’t right”. His post kind of pissed me off, like regardless of the situation I don’t believe you should advocate for violence against kids, so I made a mocking story(leaving out the bullying info) of my own saying a grown man shouldn’t be saying things like that. \nOfcourse G sees my post and confronts me about it. We go back and forth for a little but not much ground is gained for either of us. He’s saying “she’s being bullied why are you not on her side” and “it was clearly a joke”. While I’m still in the belief that no one should publicly ask for children to get harmed and that it wasn’t a joke. I ask him repeatedly to remove the post(he’s got a pretty bad record so this will just add on) but he doubles down and post another story saying how it was a joke, BUT he never removes the original furthering my belief it wasn’t a joke. \n\nI’m going to the police station to report the bullying but since I don’t know her name or the schools name I’ll be forced to use G and his post as my only lead/proof. I told G that without any names he’d have to get involved to which he tells me “it’s not your family so don’t get involved”. I really want to prioritize the girl being bullied and let G act a fool online but I feel my hand is forced. ",

I'm walking on the edge here and you're gonna try to force pressure me into going out into the grass!? What am I a peasant that you get to walk all over? Bullshit I have a right to exist here too\". So our shoulders hit pretty hard since neither of us gave way.\n\n.\n\nI just kept my eyes forward and kept walking my line. Didn't look back. I was worried what I might do if the guy tried to make something of it when, in my mind at least; he caused it. The group had plenty of time, saw me coming from way down the sidewalk, yet they didn't make that two or three feet of space that my body would've needed to walk along the edge there.\n\n.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate the desire to walk side by side. That is why when I'm in a grocery store and there is a family walking side by side, I make way. Even if it means stepping aside out of the main walkway and into an aisle to let them pass. Basic courtesy right?\n\n.\n\nSo am I the asshole? What would've happened if I had decided to bend down and tie my shoe; would they have knocked me over entirely? It it *right* to let the mob push people around?",

B had his earbuds plugged into his phone with the wire flying everywhere during the commotion. He grabs my foot (I had sandals on) and tried to take my sandals.

I immediatly appologize and say that I'll try to pay him back. Btw the earbuds were 10 dollar ones. He demands I get him new ones and takes my earbuds (my earbuds are s8 note earbuds) from me. He also demands that they be delivered to him before thursday and if not he'll claim mine as his. \n\n\nI'm not scared of fighting him bc im a lot stronger than him but im a lot shorter than him lmao.

      "description": "Context: Became really close friends with a coworker this last summer. We had lunch together and grabbed coffee almost every single day. Back in January, she told me that she was meeting up with guys on Bumble/Tinder. At this point I had a mini panic attack after realizing that maybe I had feelings for this woman and I couldn’t possibly go about living life asking \"What if...?\".\n\nA few days later, we met up for coffee and had some of the best conversation I’ve had over a span of about 4-5 hours. At the end of the evening, I explained how I felt about her (probably terribly executed). Didn’t ask for a response because it’s not easy to be put on the spot like that. We went our separate ways. \n\nSince then, she’s been keeping all social interactions to work and everything seems fine during these times (mostly). However, now she essentially refuses to communicate or interact outside of work anymore. \n\nAITA: The other day I asked for her help to understand the situation that was going on because I really felt like I was losing a friend. She responds saying that she’s been avoiding the conversation because she figured it wasn’t worth it to hash out. \n\nI responded with a book of text explaining how her behavior has made me feel insignificant and then ended by saying that her comment about the situation not being worth it to hash out was all the understanding I needed to know where her mind was at. Overall I’ve just felt alienated. \n\nDeciding to cut ties until she properly acknowledges the situation.\n",

      "description": "My current girlfriend and I got together from her picking me  over another guy (let's call him Jake). So I'm a very insecure, and overprotective guy and she really makes me happy and all that. But I also get very jealous easily because I never see her. \n\nMy girlfriend, before me was talking to Jake while also talking to 3 other guys. She said she did it because no one could give her what I could give her so she felt that she would go to other guys to get that attention. But she's also not a very trustworthy person because she constantly lies to tell me what I want to hear. So I've never really felt like enough. And we get into fights often for this very reason. I guess i have trust issues. That's fair, but I really don't want to leave her. But she makes me so happy at the same time. Happiest I've ever been. So it's not as simple as just leaving her. I would be broken. She makes me the happiest guy alive but also the worst at times. \n\nSo today I was at my family's Thanksgiving and we are talking all this \"lovey\" stuff and smiling and sending pictures and constantly telling each other how much we like each other and stuff like that. Casual stuff. But then she asks me a question that just pushed every bone in my body. She asked me if she could talk to Jake again after blocking his number. When her and I met she never stopped talking about the guy, every little quality she would brag about. But she never shows me off like she did to him. And when she asked me that I had a panic attack and I was really angry and sad. My family asked me what's wrong and I couldn't tell them. This happens alot and I'm not sure why. \n\nI told her that I'm done caring and that I'm done with feeling jealous and told her that I'm not enough for her. And I was actually scared she would like him again. Because one relationship didn't stop her from getting another before. But I really just told her multiple times how much I hated that and how mad I was and how unimportant I feel. And now after the fight and we are semi okay. I need to know if I am in the right or in the wrong, or tell me if I don't deserve her at all. \n\nAlso my first lengthy post on any subreddit, so I apologise for the difficulty, if any for reading.

      "description": "Sorry, I've found myself in a pretty odd situation.\n\nFor background context, I've been dating my girlfriend for around two years. For the first year or so, all was normal and our relationship was totally great, and then she went on a hormonal birth control pill. Her sex drive plummeted, and around sixth months ago we had a talk where she confided that she was really uncomfortable doing sexual things any more, and that she was only doing them at all because she felt like she had to for my sake. I apologized, since I obviously didn't want her to feel that way, and we've been pretty much celibate since then (I told her we should only be doing sexual things if she was interested in doing them). She started seeing a counselor for that two months ago, and I'm hopeful that in time things will return to normal there.\n\nIn addition to the above, I have felt like our relationship has been lacking in emotional intimacy for the last while. Two nights ago, I decided to try to bring up how I was feeling to her, and told her that at times it has felt more like she has been my roommate than my girlfriend, and that I'd really appreciate if we could try to spend more time together. She was receptive and the talk felt pretty productive, we set a date for the two of us this Thursday. \n\nAfterwards, though, she told me that a friend of hers asked her on Monday if she would be interested in the two of them being \"queer platonic partners\", and she asked me for my permission to say yes. I asked her what that meant, since I had never heard of the term before, and she described it as \"a platonic relationship with a lot more of an emotional commitment\". I told her honestly that from how it sounded I wasn't comfortable with it.\n\nShe told me that she might be explaining it badly, and that she'd appreciate if I could google the term and read up about it and then talk to her again about it. I did, and google described it pretty much the same way that she described it. We talked last night, and I tried to explain that I didn't mind if she had close, emotionally involved friendships, since that's none of my business, but that choosing to label it with a \"relationship\" word felt like it was crossing a line for me (especially since my girlfriend is bisexual). I also said that I was feeling kind of insecure in our relationship at the moment, especially because of the intimacy issues I raised the other night, and hearing from her right after I talked to her about that that she wanted to enter into a deep emotional commitment with someone who wasn't me felt kind of disheartening. The conversation ended with her agreeing not to say yes to her friend.\n\nAm I being the asshole here? I know there's some aspect to this that's founded in my being insecure, but I'm not sure if I'm being an asshole about it or if it's reasonable to be uncomfortable with labeling a friendship that way.",

She also gaslit me quite a bit. I could have been a better husband, I recognize this, but I am still pissed off at her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to the multitude of lies (Including not signing her service of divorce, and trying to skip out on our court date) I don't beleive anything she says. There are frequently other motives involved for her contact to me. We have been no contact  per my request since our divorce. She has emailed me once to say \"Sorry\" on our wedding anniversarry, and has mailed over important documents that were still going to our old address, where she still lives. Therefore she can be occasionally resonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently got an email from her asking for me to sign over the car title to her. As background, I had the loan released from my name prior to the divorce so long as she fulfilled the obligations of the credit agreement. This was a risk, but the car was not underwater so provided she didn't wreck without insurance it the loan was small enough that reposession would cover the cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I don't trust the emails. She says she \"does not want to meet because I don't trust the mail with a car title\" and also did not provide any evidence the loan was discharged. I told her in no circumstance are we meeting. I learned recently a gun nut co-worker of mine talks guns with her and she may have purchased a gun recently. A revolver. We had never owned a fire-arm. I think I am being paranoid, but still. I refuse to see her. She was able to provide me with a notarized letter from the bank that discharged my responsibility same day, but since then I have not received anything in the mail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Am I the asshole for asking for proof and refusing to do her a favor?",

      "description": "My family is odd. We have the ex-military photographer, the ex-military artist, the tattoo shop owner, and the parent of four.\n\nAnd me, the autistic novelist. Cue the origin story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nAs a kid I was trotted out like a new toy whenever I did something smart, tossed aside like a broken one when I did something autistic (\"acting out\").\n\nAt 15, I was solicited by my father to show him my chest. My immediate thought was, EW. Told him off, didn't do it. Mom took his side, grounded me. Six months later at 16, I became the victim of 15 years of child sexual abuse. Ugly misery was had by all.\n\nBefore blocking me on social media in 2016, Dad tried to add me to a fake account. I told him what he did had never been acceptable, and that I wanted a father and not a monster. He blocked me faster than I could block him. I'd been friends with the parents' shared account, and both siblings, to try to \"keep the family together\" and forgive them.\n\n\\--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't let the whole \"my dad is a pedo and my family believes him\" thing go. Those four grandkids he's got are easily going to be targets. But my mother and tattoo shop sibling are willing to lie to God about my dad, and the parent sibling and I had such a meaningful chat in October that I ended up getting shingles from the stress. Shingles. From stressing out over the one person I thought I'd protected adequately.\n\nStatute of limitations is no help now. Dad will never talk to me again, thank God. But every time I see that happy family schtick, I want to puke up my guts. I'm not happy; I didn't have an adequate childhood. I see things on TV about loving fathers, doting mothers, and sincerely want to harm myself. I can't let it go.\n\nI want to let it go. But sometimes my anger gets its claws into me, and I throw shade at the only sibling I still talk to, because I know Mom and Dad are watching. That sibling is a flying monkey. \n\nThe family is a tight ball of suck, and even though I got out, I can't quit reminding them how deeply they fucked me over. I'm told to \"let it go\" (DO I WISH I COULD) and forget how bad my parents gaslit me, neglected me, and kept me under their thumb to the point my mother tried to vicariously live through me while torturing me.\n\nI got taken down hard, for God knows what kind of reason, and my sibs got everything they wanted, including a father who didn't touch them at night. I got blamed for every emotion I ever felt, and I struggle to get out of bed sometimes because I see how happy they are and I seethe. I'm envious, I admit it. I needed the right kind of childhood. I got hell.\n\nI can't let it go because I recanted to keep my family in their home, and sacrificed myself for people who never gave a damn. My acts were wasted; my mom told me she would've killed herself. Great, make me feel worse about my choice and even more conflicted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey treat me like I'm an asshole. If I'm constantly reminding them of what awful people they apparently still are, AITA?",

      "description": "This is an argument between me (18F) and my SO (18M). I'm a senior in high school and he is a freshman in college. We've been in a long distance relationship for the past 7 months. I told him that I was going to be in the school musical before practices started. I told him when the practices would be and how long they would go on for. His only response of disapproval to this was \"ewwww.\"\n\nNow that practices have been going on for a month or so, he gets hurt and angry at me every time I have them. He says that I don't think he's important and I don't put effort into our relationship because I don't spend enough quality time with him (time where it's just me and him talking and neither of us is doing anything else at the same time). I work 12 hours a week and practices take up 7.5 hours a week currently. I spend more time in school than he does because I'm in high school, but I am able to text him during school and during practice when I'm not busy. I spend quality time with him on the weekends and in the evenings after I have work or practice. The musical will be over in mid April.\n\nI've participated in the school musical every year of high school, and it's something I really enjoy. I didn't mean to hurt him at all. That wasn't my intention. I know that relationships take a lot of work, so I'm still trying to spend as much time with him as I can.",

      "description": "Listen, I know the title sounds rough but give this a read. I'm a Junior in high school and in my physical education class they're is a kid who is mentally challenged. He is able to switch classes by himself and be there on time so he doesn't have a designated aid that stays with him. My physical ed class is the average level class and this kid is also in there. My school greatly stresses the \"Everybody is equal\" message and I obviously agree with 100% but there are some flaws. We had class the other day and we were playing Knock-out. Everyone in the class treats him as you would treat anyone else and no one really has any problems with him. He was playing knock-out with us and everyone was used to him and his antics but today was different. He was constantly telling the girls to \"suck my d*ck\" and was saying \"you f*cking suck\" to everyone in line. He came over and spit at a few people in line (me included). I tried my hardest to shake it off and not say anything to him. Towards the end of the game it was him and one of my friends left but my friend made the last shot which meant he was out. He began saying stuff to my friend and I eventually said \"You're being a loser dude\" He got very upset and told my teacher who came over to me give me a \"talk\" about being rude. I tried explaining that he was saying much worse things and that if everyone in this class should be treated the same then why isn't he receiving a talk but she kept ignoring it and just kept telling me I was being childish and rude. I was sent to the office to talk it over with my vice principal but he agreed with me surprisingly and let me off the hook. What are your thoughts? ",

      "description": "My best friend and I have been friends for about 10 years now. He's been through alot of hardships in his life since I've known him, like his father disowning him, having his money stolen by a close relative, working a tough unforgiving job and never having a girlfriend. I've stuck by him through 10 years of hardships, always there no matter the time of day to be someone to lean on or talk to or vent.   \n\n\nAt the beginning of our friendship, he would have breakdowns every couple of months or so which was understandable as things would pile up. Lately, I can not have a conversation with him anymore without him spiraling into a depressive meltdown. We used to talk all the time but now I have begun to dread seeing his message bubble pop up because I know it'll turn into a 2 hour pity fest. He doesn't even ask how I am anymore. I have not been enabling him all these years, as I've constantly been there to support but always suggesting that he should see a therapist or make some changes in his lifestyle to avoid some of the drama that surrounds him. He used to see a therapist for a while but then he lost his health insurance so his depression has been very bad as of late and I feel like I am his only support system now.  \n\n\nI am getting married in less than a month so I'm in the chaos of planning my own wedding right now (which he is aware of). Last night he messages me with not even a hello or how are you doing but straight into his problems, which as of now and for the last few years has just been a self pitying cycle of \"why won't anyone date me, its because I'm unattractive/undesireable etc\". Long story short, I ended up telling him that I was sorry and that i have my own stresses right now and that I just couldn't deal with his issues on top of my wedding planning. I told him that he really needs to go back to seeing a therapist if he really is spiraling this badly everyday because I won't be available for him forever like this. He initially got upset but then apologized \"for burdening me with his shit all the time and he'll keep it to himself from now on\" and stopped talking to me.  \n\n\nI feel bad because maybe I could have gone about it better, I don't want him to feel alone and he really is a great guy outside of these episodes. AITA for not being there for him?",

      "description": "I have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and I do take meds for it, they help to an extent. I have a hard time around food and germs.     \n\nTonight my husband and I went out for Italian food. He was sitting across from me at a short table and burped on to my side salad and bread without covering his mouth or turning to the side (before the other food came). I tried to tell myself that the burp didnt hit my food but it definitely did. I didnt say anything but he  noticed that I wasnt eating it. I'm sorry but I physically cant eat something that I saw someone burp on, I just can't. It's hard to explain but to me it feels extremely dirty and I have a visceral feeling of disgust towards the food after. \n\nHe got mad and told me that I better eat it and said  that his friends and family would tell him to leave me for not eating it. My husband doesnt chew his food enough and eats extremely fast which causes him to burp excessively. He also gained a lot of weight, he is obese now and that causes acid reflux which made the problem much worse. Usually I can avoid him burping on my food but tonight I couldnt. I still ate the pasta when it came because that hadnt been burped on. \n\nI want to know if I really am that horrible for not being able to eat it. I understand that he didn't mean to and I wasn't mad at him ( I asked him to please cover his mouth next time but he said that he didnt know he was going to burp)  but that doesnt effect whether or not I can eat it. If it turns out that I am the AH it doesnt change anything since I still would not be able to eat it due to my OCD but I'm curious. ",

      "title": "AITA for blocking a younger user who wants to befriend me",
      "description": " \n\nOne time when chatting on Discord a new member quipped that they were 36 and still a virgin in an offhand manner. Like we would’ve done for anyone else we told them it’s nbd to not have done the do at that age and the topic moves on. They have a habit of keysmashing and inappropriate innuendos but at that point I didn’t see a reason to cut contact with them\n\nLater they got into a rather ugly exchange where they even called a mod ridiculous for stepping in, then maybe realised how childish they sounded and quickly dropped the subject. After backreading the entire debacle I had no qualms about blocking them for real so I didn’t have to see their messages on Discord.\n\nWhen they found out by accident they proceeded to make several vague comments about being ignored and feeling bad in the server until people finally asked them what was wrong. They then announced in the public channel that I’d blocked them which led to a flood of DMs asking me what was going on. By this time I was mortified about the whole issue especially that others got dragged into it.\n\nI later found out that they’d said in another channel that they’d just turned 18. They were a whole year younger than I was! There was no reason for them to disclose their actual age online, or for me to take them at face value, but I couldn’t help feeling a sense of disorientation since I hadn’t made allowances for what they were doing because I didn’t know they were so young, and suddenly having to do so threw me off.\n\nWhen I finally unblocked them at their request they started off by saying that they looked up to me, and me blocking them made them feel like I was angry or disliked them. I explained simply that I didn’t hate them, I merely blocked them because I was known to be confrontational on certain issues like the one they got into a disagreement about and I wanted to prevent that. They didn’t seem to accept that reason and kept asking me if I would unblock them from now on, that they want to “form a relationship” with me. They said that people had refused to talk to them in the past before and that they were “the odd one out” irl because of their religion, so they wanted to make friends online. I pointed out that they had friends among other members of the server, I just wouldn’t be one of them.. They didn’t want to accept this either, so in the end I had to end the convo and block them again because it was getting nowhere.\n\nThe day after I got more DMs from mutuals saying that the person had messaged them saying how I “still hate them but it’s okay I understand”. It still leaves me with an unpleasant feeling even though this happened last Oct because they seem convinced that I loathe their guts. I occasionally wonder what would’ve been different if I’d unblocked them and let them “form a relationship” or whatever they meant by that, and if I might have been too hard on them given their relatively young age and what seems to be inexperience with online communities.

      "description": "My parents got divorced 12 years ago. My dad started using drugs and my mom had a new relationship about once a month and we moved in with a new boyfriend about once a year.  One of these boyfriends was incredibly creepy and I told my mom I didn't feel comfortable with him at the house.  My mom told me I couldn't live at home anymore (I was 14) forcing me to live full time with my dad and his girlfriend who were always high on meth and couldn't provide basic necessities. Turns out I was right about the creep boyfriend and my mom ended up getting a 15 year restraining order, which she still has never admitted to (despite me being a protected party on the order). \n\nI ended up living with my paternal grandparents.  My mom has a good job and my grandparents weren't my legal guardians and don't have a ton of money.  When I first moved in, my mom kept paying for my health insurance and cell phone. When I was 15 this stopped and my grandparents took care of me. I got my GED equivalent and started community college at 16 and worked at a doctor's office to pay for school, food, gas, etc. with help of my grandparents. I barely spoke to my mom until I transferred to a top university at 18, at which point my mom reentered my life.  This is when she began taking credit for me getting into this school, apparently telling people at her work and family friends she helped me with my applications and essays helping me to get in (my mom never even saw an application let alone helped me with one). My mom sent me the odd $100 but my grandparents kept paying for my phone and I paid for everything else with student loans, grants, and scholarships. I moved in with my mom after college while I waited to start law school, she helped with my phone bill and didn't make me pay rent (which I am very grateful for) while I worked to pay my other expenses. \n\nI started law school and my mom paid for my flights home for the holidays so I could spend them with her and her family.  She also paid for a flight home for me to interview. However, all rent, tuition, etc. was paid with student loans and money I made working as a paralegal during law school. My mom let me stay with her one summer during law school so I could intern somewhere in her area and not pay rent, she also rented me a car so I could get to and from work. While I was studying for the bar my mom told me I could stay with her.  Her ex-boyfriend who I had a good relationship with helped me pay for my bar prep and to get a car. My mom wasn't with him at the time but obviously if they hadn't dated this wouldn't have happened. \n\nThe day I started studying for the bar, every hour I would get a call to come downstairs to help her do something like move furniture or watch her try on new outfits.  Anytime I would say I needed to study she said I was lying to get out of helping her. Needless to say, I wasn't getting any studying done. My mom kicked me out for \"disrespecting\" her (per my mom no one has any respect for her so I cannot provide you with specifics as to what I think she meant by that) and thankfully I was able to stay at my maternal aunt's. Meanwhile, my dad got sober and he and I started rebuilding our relationship. My mom constantly fought with me about my relationship with my dad and my maternal aunt that summer. I moved out of the area for work and things with my mom got better. However, my brother moved home and now any time her and my brother fight, she calls me and tries to involve me in the fight. Every time this ends with my mom wanting to talk about all the sacrifices she made for me and how she never did anything for herself - this always seem out of left field to me since, again, these convos are about her and my brother.  Also, for some background, my mom dated all sorts of guys regardless of how they treated me or my brother, she buys all sorts of designer clothes, goes on all sorts of vacations, always has a new BMW, meanwhile from age 14 until very recently I was constantly concerned about whether I would have enough money for food, gas, utilities, etc. She then compares her sacrifices to my \"selfish\" father and wants to talk about all the \"terrible\" things he did and tell me what a \"piece of shit\" I am for wanting a relationship with him.  She tells me all she has ever done has been there for me and that everything I have in life I owe to her. Today I finally said I couldn't be spoken to this way anymore, that she made a lot of mistakes too not just my dad, that I am tired of being manipulated, and that what I have, I worked for. Am I the asshole for saying/ thinking these things I mean it is true that she has helped me out in many ways? I am grateful for what she has done, but I don't agree that I owe everything to her or that she has made many sacrifices for me, but she seems so convinced I am starting to worry that I'm the asshole.",

      "description": "First time poster, on mobile. Please forgive any format errors.\n\nAs title says, AITA for refusing birthday gifts from my family? This has happened a couple times in my adult life and seems to be specifically birthday gifts I refuse. Let me explain:\n\nI hate presents of all forms because they stress me out! First things running through my head as I unwrap a gift is 1. Where am I going to put this? (I'm a minimalist due to how often I move) 2. Did the purchaser incur financial hardship for this gift? (the economy is hard where I live) and lastly 3. What was the environmental footprint of this product (child labour used or from country without labour laws. Can this item be easily recycled etc). I know this makes me sound a bit nit-picky but I get to choose what enters my home because I will be the one maintaining it.\n\nOnto the gifts. I was raised in a divorced family and Christmas was usually pretty contentious because the parents tried to out buy each other. As a youngin' I didnt know well enough to separate the items I wanted between the parents and sometimes ended up with two of the same gifts because heaven forbid the parents communicated with each other. This was obviously blamed on me for wasting parents money (hence #2 from list above). I learned to ask for one item from each person at Christmas and kept it at one per person and that was all I expected.\n\nAt Christmas when I receive a gift I didnt ask for, it's easy enough to pass it onto a friend or sibling. But birthdays seem to be more difficult because family will buy me random items no one has any use for. I've told/asked/begged them not to buy me anything because of reasons above but they seem to take as a challenge and will buy some abstract items. I know they mean well but I've come to the conclusion that if I didn't ask for it, I don't accept it. So AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA For Having Sex in my Friends Bed and Leaving her House Messy?",
      "description": "So I know the title sounds horrible and just from reading that any sane person would say YES YOU’RE THE ASSHOLE, but let me explain further. Last week my one of my best friends (D) went on vacation. We had previously discussed me staying over her house for the weekend so I could have sex with my fwb and watch her kittens, and our other friend (J) would take over for the kittens the rest of the week. J has a key to D’s house while I use the spare key they keep hidden. So D goes on vacation and all is going well, my fwb comes over and we do our thing and he spends the night with me. The next day, D texts me “are you planning on staying in my house and banging all weekend?” and I replied “yeah probably”. Then suddenly she’s telling me about how she’s uncomfortable with it, which I absolutely understand and I said that i would ask him to leave which he did. She then tells me that she was just joking about letting him over her house and that she didn’t think I would actually do it. So I feel bad because it’s already happened and she’s uncomfortable with it, and I tell her I didn’t realize she was joking as she seemed pretty nonchalant about it when we discussed it. The whole week goes by and even though she’s still on vacation and we’re chatting here and there I can still get the sense that she’s mad at me. I left her house on Sunday with some of my stuff there and a little bit of a mess that I had fully intended on cleaning up before she returned. Since I’m a procrastinator I waited until the day before she came home to go clean up and get my stuff. I go to her house early in the day to find that the key I was previously using wasn’t there so I texted J to see what happened. She says she moved it into the house because she didn’t want someone to find it. I ask if I can get her key so I could clean up and she tells me “I’m going there to feed the cats later”. I tell her I still need the key and she tells me she’ll just do everything. I really didn’t want her to because I knew what mess came from me and what didn’t, but she insisted she do it and refused to give me the key. Fast forward to yesterday, I started my first full time job that they both know I’ve been terrified about for weeks and they don’t even ask me how it went, then I see them on Snapchat hanging out together. The only thing D texts me last night is “did you use my pillowcases”. Today I wrote to them that I was upset about this and D snaps at me saying she feels disrespected that I had “played house” in her home and didn’t clean up after myself. She also tells me my Christmas gifts to the both of them sucked when I was under the impression we were only giving small gifts to each other, and also accuses me of smoking her weird which I didn’t do. I think she was just on a roll. So reddit, I feel like the asshole but am I? ",

The individual would never clean anything and yell at me for the place being dirty when i had finally been fed up with cleaning all the time and relaxed on cleaning the bathroom as much and doing the dishes for him all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell then things got interesting he decided to date one of our mutual friends after about a year ago he hated her guts for breaking up with his old college roommate. so i helped repair the friendship and then a year later after i explained my feelings towards her to him he decided to then tell her about my said feelings and ask her if he wanted to date him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now they are dating which whatever i dont really care about that but what i do care about is he disclosed my personal feelings to her without my permission. So they are still currently dating and he has given her a key to the apartment without getting my permission first. She is over 5 out of 7 days of the week some weeks. i can hear them having sex in the shower daily I am fed up at this point. So we talked about the situation he basically had an attitude of not my problem and kept the same habits i confronted him about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo i then have a surgery and haven't really talked to him while i was recovering from the surgery so he eventually tells me we need to talk so we do. He then proceeds to interrogate me as to why i haven't talked to him in 4 weeks and that im an asshole for not accepting their relationship and i cant get a word in before he interrupts me so i pull out an eviction letter telling him to leave in a month and a half and he hasn't spoke to me since.

      "description": "Disclaimer, I've haven't been on many dates and am probably one of the most socially awkward people out there. In fact, this story is about the first ever official date I was on. \n\nI'll call him Steve. So I work at a grocery store in a bakery and I fry donuts about twice a week. That's where I met Steve. He worked overnight stocking frozen items, so we work relatively close to eachother. It started out with some friendly chatter that turned into some flirting. And after a few days, a coworker in the bakery telling me I had a secret admirer, Steve if it wasn't obvious. We exchanged numbers and eventually made some half hazard plans through texting. \nThe date isn't planned or anything, and we just go to a restaurant to eat. It's all fine, though I'm sure I do come off as pretty awkward. He paid too, which I'm not a fan of. I don't like when someone pays for me because then I feel like I owe them something... But it's whatever. \nThen I feel things get a little weird. We do discuss some second date ideas over text. Mostly due to how he talked afterwards as well as a few instances, I just don't think it'll work out. \nHe texts me that his grandma passed away and very heavily implies that he wants me to say I'll go with him. \nWe've only been on one date though, and it was only okay in my mind. We weren't really in a relationship and I definitely didn't know his grandma. And I certainly wouldn't actually ask him to go to a funeral with me. So I just don't tell him I'm going. I assume he gets the picture, but he still brings it up another time anyway. \n\nThat's not all even. It's been about three weeks and we still didn't go on a second date. So it's doubtful we'll have anything more going on, right? We're still texting though of course and he brings up that his friend is getting married soon and he wants to bring a guest. He doesn't ask me though. Not YET at least. But by during my shift and asks me in person. Now I'd say Steve is a pretty nice guy. We don't have much in common and he's actually about ten years older with me. Which is also another reason I felt awkward towards him (found out how old he was on the date). \nSo he proceeds to ask me to go with him to the wedding. Again, we're not in a relationship, only been in one date, and I actually don't want to be anymore serious with him. \n\nA few other things happened and we just ended up completly distancing ourselves from eachother. I don't actually see him at work anymore either thanks to shift chsnges.\n\nBut the question of course is, an i in the wrong here? like i said at the beginning, I haven't been on many dates, so its hard for me to discern. So I'm fully open to your opinions. ",

      "description": "So this started back around Thanksgiving. I drove my older brother, my eldest brother, my older brother’s girlfriend, and my best friend back home for Thanksgiving. We all currently live around DC and we went up to the northeast for thanksgiving. Both ways the trip was 9 hours since there was a lot of traffic, and gas was expensive. All in all the total cost of gas was about $120 both ways. There was some local driving over the Thanksgiving weekend but I covered that cost myself. After the trip, I talked with my eldest brother and we agreed that everyone in the car other than myself would split the cost 4 ways for gas. Everyone seemed fine with that. However, I was driving with my older brother today and he told me that it was a bit unfair to ask all the passengers of the car to split the cost of gas. His reasoning for this was that unless I had bought a train ticket or something like that, I would’ve made the drive anyway and would’ve had to pay for that much gas with no help from them. He said I should’ve covered about half the cost myself and made everyone only chip in about $10-$15. I understand his reasoning since we’re all tight on money. He’s a recent college grad, and both myself, his girlfriend, and my friend are both still in college so we all are struggling for money. My thought though is that since I did most of the driving (except for the last half on the trip back to college) that that should be considered since it’s an exhausting drive. I feel a bit bad about it now, but ultimately I’m not sure if I’m the asshole or not in this situation.",

      "description": "My daughter insisted we have dinner with her boyfriend. Through dinner, he hardly spoke to her, or looked at her, never mentioned anything that they both liked or did together. He spoke about himself a lot, but then we asked him to, to get to know him. He obviously tried to impress us, talking at length about a psychologist he reads, political commentators he likes and follows, advanced classes he takes, how he’s an Eagle Scout, etc. our daughter was uncharacteristically bashful and obviously smitten. The next time we were supposed to have dinner with the two of them it was the same thing; he barely looked at her or acknowledged her, talked about his politics and what some famous writer says. His politics are the opposite of ours, but we politely listened. The philosopher he reads has made statements about women “knowing their place “ which is troubling. We only objected out loud to one thing, he made an outrageous statement about something we easily disproved with a quick web search. Our usually forceful, opinionated, liberal daughter just meekly sat there. \nThe first few times they were both home from college (the same one), he said he didn’t have room for her in his car and that was fine, we thought it was odd he would fill up his car with guys, but not offer his girlfriend a ride, but we didn’t really mind getting her anyway. After Christmas break, he actually offered to take her back with him, but kept changing the time and ended up going at least 4 hours later than the original plan, part of that with her sitting on out front porch like a puppy, and then even after I took her to his parents house waiting some more while he worked on his car. Then he did the same thing again on Presidents Day, changed the time 3 or 4 times while she waited on our porch, asked her to come to his house instead and then when we were almost there, he decided go off and get a haircut. My husband and I were livid! My daughter just kept saying “it’s okay, it’s okay”. Then she admitted that he makes everything about him. He doesn’t value her time. She even posted online how she sits like a lump in his dorm while he ignores her playing video games.\nBut, I’m a “controlling asshole” because I don’t want to have dinner with him again.\n",

      "description": "TL:DR;  I took my grandson to lunch and invited my sons ex-wife without my son or wives knowledge.\n\nMy wife and I take care of my grandson while my son is at work, he's been divorced for a few years and the divorce was based on his ex-wife cheating and she is now married to the man she cheated on him with. I was going to the hospital with my grandson for unimportant reasons and decided to have lunch there. This hospital is also where my son's ex-wife works. I decided to invite her to lunch with us. My wife would be upset and also knows my son would be very upset if I did this, so I told her to stay home for other reasons and didn't mention this to my son. \n\nThis is my explanation to my son after his negative reaction to todays events: \n\n\" Throwawayson - it is perfectly within your right to withhold your time and Throwawaygrondson from me and unfortunately your Mom who clearly has your back on this issue. That said you’ve said from the get go that you were not going to speak Ill of throwawaygrandson's Mom in front of him. How are you going to explain your punishment of Grandpa to your very smart son. I am truly sorry you feel so strongly on something I did that had no impact on your time with your son. We were going to eat at the hospital cafeteria because I had free food coupons and were there to pick up his things. On a previous visit when the three of us were going to eat at the cafeteria throwawaygrandson had asked Grammie and me if we were inviting his Mom to eat with us. Your Mom said we would not and said something neutral that didn’t bash his Mom. While you have been very clear on your desires in regards to your ex wife I have also been clear I feel it prudent for us to maintain at least a casual relationship with the mother of my grandson. I feel the same with throwaways-other-ex-daughter even though what she did to throwaways-other-son and their family disgusts me as much as what throwaways-ex-daughter did to you and her family. I did not wish her Merry any holiday nor happy birthday nor do we share any chit chat communications. While you and I cannot see this from each other’s perspective we can agree to disagree without exposing  throwawaysgrandson to the depth of the issues between his parents. Regardless of how badly you decide to punish me please do not put any of this on throwawaysgrandson. Today was just a normal fun day with Grandpa that happened to include his Mom. I was the one who text her offering her to join our lunch. I didn’t tell or ask him not to say anything to you of Grammie as that would imply what happened as wrong. I hope we can get past this soon.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Tell me if I'm an asshole, okay? 4 years ago my ex and I built my first rig. I love PC gaming and I wanted something that could run a multitude of games. I also wanted to run some professional programs on it like AutoCad for work. I've been working on building my own business doing interior design and I use these programs along with a few other Adobe products. I invested a decent amount of money on it and time putting it together. It is one of the biggest purchases I've made in my 23 years at the time. I'm pretty proud of it and I think it's really cool. Fast forward about 3 years. I broke up with said ex and am now in a long term relationship with another guy who is also into gaming. I would say it's one of his favorite hobbies, as is mine. As of recent, my work has been very demanding and most of my focus has been on building my business; so less time for gaming. He asked if he could use my computer to run certain games because of how heavy they are and wanted to play online with friends. Of course I said that was fine. But for almost a year, he ONLY uses mine now. It's his primary computer for 90% of anything he does online. He does work on his computer (A Razor gaming laptop) at home sometimes but majority of his usage is on my computer. He doesn't even ask me anymore. I find it annoying that I feel put out by using my own computer, but he's constantly on it. And it wouldn't bother me if it wasn't every night for hours and hours. To the point where his computer time impedes on our chores, laundry, cooking, etc. I genuinely asked him why he always uses mine instead of his and he said \"Because I have to go get my laptop and set it up and all that bullshit\" I've told him that it bothers me and he just gets pissed saying \"Fine, I won't use it anymore; fuck it.\" And gets an attitude. But beyond that, he doesn't take care of it. He sits at the desk and pulls at his beard and runs his hands through his hair, just fidgeting. I find dandruff, beard hairs, crumbs and just trash in general all around my workspace. I have a 85 fucking dollar keyboard that has all of his beard hairs and dandruff stuck down in it. I told him it pisses me off and he needs to clean up after himself. He said he'll do it. And he does somewhat. But after a week or so, it's back to the same routine. I've changed the computer password 3 times just so he will get off my computer. And then a few weeks later I let him use it because I want him to be happy and get to enjoy games too. He says I never use my computer. I said I'm never on it BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS ON IT! I feel his mentality is that if I'm not using it, it's free game. And that is true but I feel the privilege has been abused and I'm done being nice about it. I'm annoyed. I'm agitated that I have to go behind him and clean up MY DESK, MY SPACE, just so I can fucking use it. Please tell me if I'm being totally ridiculous about this. I have a lot of pride in what I've built and so I just want that to be respected. Am I an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend uses my computer that I spent a lot of money building and he disrespects the space by leaving trash and crumbs all over it and then gets made at me for telling him to stay off it.",

      "description": "So the thing about me is I like to buy everything I want for myself, because nobody knows what I want better than me. In addition i'm very minimalist, hate 'tat' and this goes to both my possessions, style of my house and clothes. I tell my friends, girlfriend and family not to buy me anything for holidays or my birthday and if they \\*really\\* want to just make sure it's restricted to consumables (booze, bodywash, cologne etc). I'm not a dick about it and say it in as friendlier way as I can \"haha don't worry guys, I don't want anything. Maybe just some nice gin or something if you really want to?\" Despite this my parents regularly buy me board games, toilet books, tops with amusing slogans on that I immediately either give away or throw out (yes I feel like a dick, but I don't want them).\n\nThe person i'm upfront with the most is my girlfriend. I've straight up told her numerous times \"I've bought everything I want. Anything else I want i'm going to buy because i'm obsessive about how I and/or my office looks\" yet she buys me \"cute\" looking t shirts (with cartoons), tops with giant nike or adidas logos on - stuff that I hate and she surely must know after several years I would never buy myself.\n\nI also have a very sleek looking office in our house. I've let her have run of most of it, but for my office i've made it exactly how I want. Really neat white walls with contrasting black furniture and carpet - it looks great. Anyway, my last finishing touch was going to be a nice bonsai on a table in the corner and I kept excitedly telling my girlfriend how much i'm looking forward to finding one, taking care of it and making my room complete. She took this as \"go and get any random plant for as cheap as possible and surprise me\" and presented me with this dying, wilted piece of shit that was covered in 'reduced' stickers (rightfully so as it was almost dead).\n\nWhat I wanted to say was \"WHAT IS THIS HALF-DEAD PIECE OF SHIT!? I WANTED A BONSAI TREE THAT I SPECIFICALLY CHOSE! THIS IS EVEN WORSE THAN THOSE ADVENTURE TIME PYJAMAS YOU GOT ME THAT I'M ALREADY PLANNING ON GIVING AWAY!\"\n\nInstead I said \"Wow, oh my god you're so thoughtful. Thank you so much now I don't need to get an expensive plant\"\n\nI feel like i'm unreasonable sometimes and I know everyone means well, but at the end of the day I just don't want people to waste money on me especially when it's something that I would rather not have.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hey Reddit! First time really positing anything. I'm on mobile so sorry for the bad formatting.\n\nHere's the story. I bought myself a switch with Pokemon let's go as a Christmas gift to myself, but I haven't really gotten around to playing much, because of work.\n\nHowever my girlfriend really enjoys playing and even has her em account on my switch. So today I offered her to leave her my switch while I was at work. I still had my game running in the background but really didn't think about it.\n\nWhen I got home I discovered that two days of progress had been lost cause I forgot to save and my girlfriend switched over to her account without saving.\n\nFor me this really isn't a big deal. When she got home I pointed it and told her that I'd be nice of her if she could save my game before switching over to her save state in case I forgot again.\n\nShe got extremely angry about this and told me it was not her fucking problem if I forgot to save my state. Again, I really didn't care about the progress and I really didn't think that this was going to be a big deal. However her reaction shocked me because just saying \"I'll try and remember it next time\" would have been much easier and that would have been the end of it. We got into a huge fight, which actually wasn't about the save state but about considering others, especially in a relationship. Pressing an extra button would be little more effort in comparison to the frustration it would save.\n\nAm I the asshole for getting upset about her hot headedness in this topic.\n\nTL;DR Ask girlfriend to save a game before using my console, she gets angry and we get into a fight that looks like could end our relationship.",

I work nights and it was one of my days off so I would be up until 7am because I maintain a nightshift sleep schedule on my off days. \n\nMy fiancé was asleep in our bed and I could hear some LOUD af bass coming from somewhere in our neighborhood. The noise ordinance in our area mandates quiet time from 10pm to 6am. Our windows were all closed and I could still hear and feel this bass through our walls. If I stepped onto our porch I could clearly hear all the lyrics of the songs they were blasting. \n\nI figured they would stop eventually, I mean, it's Monday night, right? I let it go on for a while, but eventually the stress and frustration I was feeling towards these inconsiderate neighbors started getting to me. My stress turned into a moderate headache around 2am, and the music was still blasting. It had been going on for more than 4 hours at this point. On a Monday night. Wtf. \n\nI didn't want to go over to their house and say something in case they were drunk and did something irrational or violent (I am a small-framed woman), so I called the non-emergency hotline to file a noise complaint. \n\nTwo cops eventually pulled up, told the neighbors to keep it down, they did, and that was it. Easy peasy... just kidding. After the cops left the male from the household walked into the street and starting screaming \"Fucking PUSSIES! DON'T MOVE TO THE EAST SIDE IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A FUCKING PUSSY.\" etc. Then he started blasting the music again. I did not call the cops again. \n\nIt has been 5 days and every single time this guy comes outside he starts screaming similar obscenities. I went to take out my recycling one day and he got out on his porch and started screaming at me then too, but I just ignore him and carry on with my daily routine. I don't know how or if he knows it was me, but it seems like he might? \n\nSo, am I the asshole? Should I have done this differently? Is there anything I can do to make him stop screaming at our house every hour of the day?\n\n",

      "description": "My friend (34F) is having her first baby this week. She's always been a little bit OCD about germs and cleanliness, but she just told me if I want to hold the baby I will have to get these two shots. Initially, I agreed to this because she is my best friend and we are neighbors, I know she will need help because she's having a c-section, etc. BUT...I have only ever had one flu shot and never whooping cough. I am fully immunized for the other stuff you get as a younger person. She told me she plans on hiding in her house away from people to avoid getting the baby sick. Other people have questioned her about this and she seems to know it is extreme, but does not care. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo..there is a part of me that understands this, obviously, newborns are extremely susceptible to sickness and I would never expose her to anything. I did not require all my friends and family to get immunized to see my daughter. I did ask that they wash their hands and don't visit if you're sick or have been sick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my question is am I the asshole for not wanting to get these shots and how should I tell my friend? Is there anything I can say to her to make her feel better?",

My sister texted me today and said, \"nephew's birthday party is on your birthday this year\". It's his fifth birthday.\n\nI immediately felt my stomach drop and just a sense of dread. I don't like to do much for my birthday, and I don't even want to celebrate with my family, but I want to have the day to myself to celebrate quietly with my boyfriend and enjoy my one day a year that's about me. My boyfriend and I are both very introverted and socially anxious, so the thought of not only foregoing my quiet celebration, but also having to go interact with a bunch of strangers and noisy kids is just the worst. I also don't want to have a super busy weekend and I'm running a half marathon the next day, it'll just be a really stressful time.\n\nI love my nephew. I just don't want to go to his birthday party. Last year he had a big party with a bunch of kids and parents and he didn't even notice I was there (I'm not complaining, I didn't expect him to, I'm just saying I don't think he'd notice if I wasn't there this year). Am I the asshole for wanting to skip his birthday party so I can conserve my energy and enjoy my birthday on my own terms?",

      "description": "So this is a spur of the moment post and I'm going to keep it brief. My girlfriend is extremely clumsy and has a tendency to leave messes out hoping that I'll clean them. She basically lives in my dorm room because my roommate lives in his girlfriend's single room. But when my parents came to pick me up for Thanksgiving break they made a comment about the mess that I had made in my room. The problem was that it was mostly dirty clothes and dishes that I hadn't had time to get to. I hadn't used any of those clothes or dishes. She's broken three pairs of rather expensive headphones of mine because she either wasn't paying attention or in the case of one such pair fell onto them. She has lost two different computer mice that I've given her so she could play video games. And tonight she asked me to make her ramen. So after I made her ramen and I hand it to her she stands up, with the bowl, to get something. As she goes to sit down she tips the bowl and it spills all over my futon. I just am getting tired of all of this and feel like a massive asshole for feeling this way.",

      "description": "So a couple years ago I had a severe mental breakdown and was put in a duel diagnosis rehab center since rehabs for just psychological issues are being combined with drug rehabs. While there I met a guy who came in the same day and we became close in those 28 days bc there was nothing but time to talk. \nAfter we got out we stayed in contact and was there for him emotionally when he needed to stay strong to stay off the heroin. I ended up moving states and he fell into a bad relationship that ended with him robbing a bank and his ex gf turned him in for the reward money.\nHe got back in contact and recently has been talking about his future plans of a life with me which I had to shut down bc I don’t look at him in a romantic way.  Since then he had a sexual encounter with a guy in prison and I’ve been telling him to go with it partly bc I know it will take his mind off of his fantasies of being with me. AITA!?",

      "description": "To give some background, I know of five times my husband has lied to me. The other things were smaller, like lying that he had quit smoking, but about a year ago there was a big lie about money (there were a few lies about the money but I'm counting it as one incident).  Since I had paid for our wedding and the first leg of the spouse visa I arrived on, he agreed that he would pay for the next leg. He had a savings of £7,000 from his late father so we agreed we'd save that and more so that we'd always have enough for the visa and wouldn't have to risk us being spilt apart. \n\nSo one day I opened a letter from the bank that did have his name on it and it said he was over his credit card limit. He had told me he only had £2000 to pay off so I asked him about it and he said the limit was £4000 and he must not have realized how much he was spending. I thought it over and suggested that we use the savings to pay it off because the interest would be a killer. Slowly and painfully, he revealed to me that the credit card debt was actually £8000 and that he had blew the entirety of the £7000 savings. At this point, we were just putting our combined incomes into one account and everything was shared without saying who's was what. So we got counselling and I got a personal account so I could keep my money safe. It was fucking brutal to be lied to in such a way by my partner and to have my sense of security pulled from under my feet. It's been a long road in getting some sort of semblance of a normal relationship going again. \n\nSo that brings us to last night. He saw I opened a piece of his mail and was infuriated because I should trust him completely by now after all he's done to get to work the savings back up (it's not even close to the original amount but he is making an effort to put money on every month). I personally feel like that's quite a tall order and also, all the household bills are in his name, so I feel like it makes sense that I open them since I'm paying them as well. We only get paper bills for the purpose of using them for my visa applications, after all. \n\nSo am I the ass hole? I sort of understand where he's coming from, but like I said, the large money lie wasn't the first time he lied to me. I feel like I have a right to protect myself by checking the letters from the bank and general bills. He says I can see them, but he has to show me himself. ",

      "description": "For context: I’m 17, my aunt and uncle treated me to a weekend in NYC to see the Museum or Natural History for my birthday. We visited this really cool fossil/gems store where I found an incredible herring fossil that I was dying for (I’m passionate about marine biology) and my aunt generously offered to buy it for me. It was eighty dollars. As I was thanking her, she said something along the line of “at least I’ve got my holiday shopping done early for you!” Which I took to mean hand at the gift would count as my holiday gift. I was fine with this. \n\nOn the trip back today, I asked where my fossil was and she said in her suitcase, so I said not to let me forget that when we arrived home. She said then that she wasn’t giving it to me then, she was saving it for next Christmas. I was pretty surprised but I didn’t say anything other than “Seriously? Ok”. However I think it’s kind of absurd to tell someone that you’re buying something for them and then keep it for another ten months. WIBTA if I asked her if I could have it now?\n\nI’m not sure if any of this is relevant:\nThis may or may not be the case this time, but the last time we were on a trip together without my parents my aunt sent a bill to my parents for the hotel, meals and transportation, which she is probably going to do this time too.\n\nI talked to my mom about this and she said that my aunt did the same thing to her with a necklace, then never actually gave her the necklace.\n\nReally not sure this is relevant, but I’m half Jewish (my aunt and her brother, my father, are not) and I don’t like Christmas at all. Hanukkah is much more important to me (than Christmas, not then the other Jewish holidays, lol) so I don’t really see the point of saving a gift for almost an entire year just to give it on a particular date. \nThanks to all who reply :)\n",

I guess people donate to good causes more when they've had a few hand grenades on Bourbon Street.\n\nAnyways, I completely support their causes so the first few times I would let them say their spiel and then tell them maybe next time (money's tight or else I would). It's finally gotten to the point where I just tell them I already donate to them as I walk past because I have shit to do. I don't have 30 minutes to stop and chat about the problems that plague our world while I'm on the clock.\n\nSo am I the asshole for lying about donating just to get out of the conversation?

      "description": "So I play basketball at one of the local teams. Team's great, friendly teammates and a great coach, who will yell a bit but it's fine by me.\n\nSo there is this teammate, we'll call her E. For the past few months she's been getting drunk af, not coming to all the practices cause if uni classes, plus having fun and disrespects our coach a lot, either verbally or by asking from another coach for personal training, when she loses all the layups and easy baskets.\n\nFast forward to why I'm posting this. At today's practice, we sit on the bench and I complement her on her high energy. She's all like \"yeah I really wanna do great today, but he (referring to our coach) will probably say something bad and I won't want to play well\" all I said was that she should allow his words to stop her, instead she should show him that he's wrong. Practice continues as normal, warmup, stretches and then this huge idiocy happens.\n\nWe are sitting on the bench so we can split in two teams and practice some defense. Coach is checking some stuff, E sits next to me and says \"look at this idiot wearing blue sweatpants. Love his shoes, still an idiot\". That made me furious. E used to be our main center, but because of her attitude, we all believe that coach moved her to second center (I'm the third center). I really respect my coach, and that's why I got kind of angry. Also, I got angry at her, because she doesn't try a lot in practice, yet she gets to play a lot, whilst I try a lot at practice and never miss one, yet it would be a miracle if I got 5 minutes of play.\n\nPractice ends and I'm with a teammate that's really close to our coach and I consider her a good friend. I told her what E has told me about our coach. That he called him an idiot, etc, and that she takes her spot on the team for granted.\n\nTime goes by, that good friend and teammate decides to call our coach and tell him what happened. Few hours later, coach calls me. \"hey C, I'm just calling to confirm that this really did happen, cause I called E and she said that she complemented my shoes but did not call me an idiot\". Honestly I was speechless. At the time I started doubting myself. Maybe I heard wrong??? I told him that I'm 90% sure that what I heard was correct and I'll just give that 10% to her, benefit of the doubt. Coach days that he will take this to the board of our team.\n\nWhat I'm worried about is how E will react to this whole thing in tomorrow's practice. Will she come looking for a fight, will she not talk to me etc. I always try to have the best relationship I can have with every person, even if this person, like E, is not considered my friend. This situation is a first time for me. I only talked to my friend cause I wanted to let it out and vent.\n\nSo the real question. AITA for speaking to my friend about this??? ",

So, I mention it to my boss and he already doesn’t like this guy. Basically he’s been trying to find a reason to fire him anyway. My boss goes to the hire ups and said we have to fire him cuz saying something like that causes a “hostile work environment” and if he actually got into a fight with someone the company would get into trouble if they didn’t do anything about it. So now the guy got fired, my friend blames me and our friendship is ended all over this stupid Facebook post.

So, my roommate was dating this girl for a few years and he broke up with her probably a year ago, but she still comes around once every few months for a booty call. I hate this lady. She annoys me to no end. She's in her 40s and doesn't know how to do the simplest of tasks (like change the toilet paper roll or put the shower head back up). She's honestly dumb as a box of rocks and inconsiderate and she is SUPER sensitive about people not liking her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last night she spent the night and she used the last of the toilet paper and didn't change the roll. And I'm all about making sure people learn on their own, so I used the roll that is under the sink and put it back when I was done, leaving the empty roll. She used the bathroom this morning and there was no toilet paper for her to use, so she finally looked under the sink to replace it. Finally, a lesson learned. But no. That's not where it ends. I keep all my hair supplies under the sink and she took out (or dropped) a box of my hair bleach on the floor and then left it there. This would normally just be another annoyance, but I have cats. So now she's taken this to a whole new level of pissing me off before she's endangering my animals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my SO (because he is the person who calmly tells our roommate of the nonsense that he should be dealing with) and my SO let him know about it. This happens constantly when she comes over and nothing seems to change. Our roommate doesn't like confrontation, so I feel like he just doesn't even tell her what she did wrong and therefore nothing gets fixed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, WIBTA if I messaged her directly to tell her to pick up after herself when she's in our home?",

      "description": "Best friend got married, I was her maid of honor.\nIt was a destination wedding. My bf (of 5 years) took time off work and we got a hotel room etc for 2 nights in the city the wedding was in. \n\nI did my MOH duties. I bought a dress she wanted, threw her a fun bachelorettes party, stood next to her in church, held a speech at the wedding etc. \n\nAfter church, at the reception, I discovered that while my seat was right next to the bride (there was one long table) , my boyfriend was seated at the far far end of the table. Next to the photographer they hired and next to a family who didn't speak his language. \n\nThe best man next to the groom had his wife (who was not part of the bridal party) right next to him.\n\nI was hurt and annoyed. I suspect it's because we aren't married (they are very religious) but idk what the hell she was thinking. And she could've at least sat him with the younger people, our friends, so he could talk to someone. \n\nWe've been together for 5+ years, we have lived together forever, we've hung out together with my friend lots of times, it's not like she doesn't know him. \n\nI didn't want my boyfriend to feel hurt (and I could tell he was a bit even thought he tried not to show it). After the food had been served, I got up and went to sit in the empty seat next to my bf while the photographer was going around taking pics.\n\n\nMy other\n friend later said it was kinda shitty of me to leave my seat next to the bride. I feel like I did the right thing. \nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "My parents moved out of state.  My mom comes back almost every 6 weeks for at least a week and stays with us and to say it's difficult is putting it lightly.  She is hyper sensitive, yet super judgmental and cannot tolerate silence.  She is literally always talking or asking questions. The first day or two we catch up but then it's like, I have nothing left to say.  Then she gets passive aggressive with me and will be like \"okay,  you're making me feel like I'm bothering you\" (because she is, and I resort to one- word answers).  The next day she'll try starting a conversation by asking literally the same question she asked the day before, after I answered it. She will ask me \"what's new? \" every day brought the week. It's too much. \n\nMy dad comes to visit with her about 3-4x per year.  I'm closer to him but even then, after a few days, there's nothing to talk about.  \n\nThey're from this area, lived here for over 60 years, so it's not like we can go sightseeing or I can show them around town.  \n\nIf they visited once per year, my husband and I would make more of an effort to plan things throughout the week and be better 'hosts', but they visit so often we can't do that...when we have our own plans, they act like we're being rude or get passive aggressive, even though they have friends that still live here, a rental car, and can entertain themselves.  \n\nI had to run errands this morning and when I was about to leave, my dad was like, \"um, okay  bye\". I've been up running around doing things since 630 so when I mentioned I might take a nap, my mom (who slept in until 1030) goes \"okay, I guess I'll just watch TV then\"  in a passive aggressive tone.  \n\nThey leave tomorrow and I planned to make a nice dinner tonight.  Of course my dad is busy now and won't be home for dinner, so I'm peeved by that.\n\nI know there are people that don't have their parents anymore or strained relationships and I'm probably going to hear \"be thankful\"... which I am, but after a few days,  I run out of gas socially, and kind of shut down.  \n\nMy parents just make me feel like I'm a bitch. Am I? \n\nTL;DR  My parents visit often and stay with us and get passive aggressive when I need some space or am kind of burned out socially and don't want to talk.  \n\n\n",

He gets home from school, curses at everyone and plays video games literally the whole rest of the day.\n\nAnyways, last Christmas he got a leopard gecko as a pet from my grandparents. He asked for it and they said yes because I honestly don’t think they know how to say no to him. They didn’t even ask my parents if it was ok to keep a leopard gecko and didn’t know shit about the care requirements. I was really pissed so I pretty much ignored the gecko for 6 months. Fast forward, the gecko got MBD (A fatal bone disease for reptiles), and as I am somewhat experienced in reptile keeping, I put the gecko enclosure and my room (My brother didn’t give a shit about me basically stealing his pet or it getting a disease wtf) and I try my hardest to treat it for 2 months. By some miracle it actually worked and I am currently in possession of a leopard gecko. \n\n[Heres](https://www.reddit.com/r/leopardgeckos/comments/8npal2/save_a_leopard_gecko/?st=JPDE1Y62&amp;sh=82fd2099) a link to a more detailed post and there are alot more on my profile if interested.\n\nThis Christmas my brother randomly asks for a FUCKING CHAMELEON and my grandparents are in the process of getting him one.

There has been plenty of times where he has earned my trust around her. My gf and I are currently long distance for uni and it's been tough. She has recently moved back to her old house and there isn't much space for her. She now wants to move to an apartment living off her chick fil a wage. For reasons that aren't important she basically needs to room with him. She has offered to find a third roommate but she has said that even if she can't she's still moving in with him. She has stated multiple times that nothing I say will change that she's moving in with him. I have made it clear to her that I hate the idea of them moving in together. My logic behind my feelings is that with us being long distance, she will start to prefer him over me, not so much in the romantic way more in the way that someone likes their best friend more than their SO. I also have a small fear that they could start to grow feelings for each other and we could split up because of it. Am I the asshole?\n\ntl;dr - Girlfriend is moving in with a guy and with us being long distance it could cause our relationship to end. I am against her moving in with him. ",

Then I'll look around and some asshole will be meters away with a shit-eating grin. I'm not a confrontational person, and they have plausible deniability in this case, but it seems a lot like they do it purposefully. So I came up with a plan for petty revenge. I would not look around but immediately open the car door, get in and sit down. Then go to get my own car keys and start to put them in the ignition. At this point no doubt the real owner is running up to the car and shouting at me, I will smile sweetly and say \"oh I'm very sorry, this car unlocked just as I passed it so I thought it was my car because mine does that! Oh how embarrassing!\" \n\nWIBTA for doing this? It may backfire if someone made a genuine innocent mistake. ",

The details are kindof vague on purpose to avoid the implied parts to recognize the post.\n\n\nSo, I've been living with this friend of mine, let's call him Bob, for a few years now. \n\n\nA few nights ago I found some presence in our place. Nothing like a ghost, more like a ninja that kept emptying our fridge. To be fair, all the food in the house is provided by Bob, but that's not important.\n\n\nNight after night the presence would take away some food. In order to scare it off I made a giant tikki head. The head seemed to worked, until it disappeared.\n\n\nBob had this vehicle parked in his front yard. He found out that the \"presence\" was actually an old friend of his, let's call her Margaret, who recently became in trouble with the law.\n\n\nMargaret was under arrest order by then. She ended up stealing Bob's vehicle along with the tikki head and ran away. Bob didn't care too much, but here things got complicated.\n\n\nBesides from Margaret commiting yet another felony by stealing the vehicle, she was spiriling down to a darker place. She begun to speak with the tikki head, who she personalized as her rational side, allowing herself to be bad by contrast.\n\n\nUnder the influence of the tikki head she ended up crashing Bob's vehicle against a dangerous cargo one, causing a hazardous situation on an entire town. \n\n\nThere was a way for me to help the situation but I stood still waiting for my other friend and work collegue, Peter, to tackle down the issue. It was a close call but Peter managed to save the situation and prevent the hazardous content of the other vehicle to cause an entire town to go south.\n\n\nI may be guilt-tripping myself but... Am I the asshole for making the tikki head in the first place? Should I had acted before Peter interfered to prevent the hazard? \n\n\n\nThanks in advance",

I consider Y a friend and occasionally hang out with outside of the restaurant. The management and Y often comp some food and I hook up the employees for great service and everyone is always happy.\n\nI have gone here with female friends and women that I am interested in pursuing.\n\nI came in here over the weekend on a date with (23F) who I’ll call T. It seemed pretty obvious to me we were on a date as it was just the two of us. \n\nWhile I was in the bathroom, T asks Y about me and he says that I’m great and all of this positive stuff. Also Y mentions that he has a girl and things are going great with her, who I’ve never heard of btw.\n\nAfter some drinks were both a bit tipsy and were telling Y about how T and myself are going to a concert soon. Y starts asking T if she’s going to Coachella, which she was considering because her work can often get her in for free, and how he needs more females in his crew. He presses the issue a bit more and tells her to grab his number.\n\nI’m sitting there kinda confused like wtf, seems kinda ballsy to ask a chick I’m on a date with for her number right in front of me. At this point T discreetly looks over to me and says “is this okay?” She was feeling a bit weirded out too. I’m a bit surprised about the whole thing but think maybe I’m just being insecure or defensive and say yea it’s fine.\n\nWe got hooked up real nice on the bill, tipped big, and left. I shared my discomfort about this situation with T and she was super cool about it and said she thought it was strange too.\n\nThe next day Y sends her a text “hey, it was great meeting you last night. I hope your night turned out great.” T doesn’t respond.\n\nI think Y was hitting on T, but he apparently talked me up while I was in the bathroom and still hooked the bill up nice. What do you think?

Even over discord calls when he would hide his phone because it’s late, they would always tell him how much they love him, we would see them at restaurants in public.\n\nThen a month ago, we learned he had been manipulating three girls at our school into basically giving him stuff for free because of the “abuse”. They called CPS and CPS investigates his house. To this day, his only evidence of abuse is a patched hole in his wall. He says his dad threw a lamp at the wall, but the lamp supposedly thrown has a large base and the hole was small. He constantly changes his story also, at one point saying his dad pinched the hole.\n\nWe were still planning on hanging out with him, as we thought the depression just clouded his mind. Then, one of our friends girlfriends started receiving weird texts from him, very frequently. Telling her how good her art is, how amazing she is, how lucky our friend is to be dating her. Then he starts ranting to her also. \nOur friend told him to stop texting his girlfriend, and he told him to shut up and called him an asshole. That’s when we decided to stop hanging out with him, but it gets worse.\n\nHe decided to try and get CPS to take him and his sisters to a foster home, bombarding them with calls. He tried to tell us that foster homes are amazing, and that’s why he was doing it. We didn’t care, if he wanted to do that to himself sure, but his sisters didn’t want to go. One of his sisters is autistic too, which is even worse. He refused, and kept calling them. They never had enough evidence to take them.\n\nOne of my friends recently hung out with him and watched the punisher, and he texted him later saying “When we were watching the punisher some of the scenes.. idk how to describe it.. it.. reminded me of some things” We don’t know if he means he cut himself or he’s been thinking of doing something to our school, but the school never listened whenever we brought stuff to them.\n\nSo basically I’m asking, would my friends and I be the assholes if we cut him out after months of trying to help him? I just feel so drained, as this is the only thing he talks about when we are with him. \n\nThere’s other reasons we’re doing this but I don’t want the post to be too long. If you would like to know I can talk about them in the comments.",

The deal we made was they would pay me a total of $24 a week, because that is divisible by three and a little less than taking an uber every night. They live about 8 minutes from me. Last night, the one who doesn’t pay to come home (he prefers to go around every day finding rides for free) asked for a ride “because I couldn’t find a ride today and you are going there anyway”. I said I don’t care, but you have to ask the guys who are paying. He did not, and just got into the car. No one said anything, but 2/3 paying guys came to me later and said we should not give him a ride again, because he has gotten a few rides with them and the guy they pay in the morning using the same excuse. Am I/are we the asshole(s)? After all, we ARE going to the apartment anyway. ",

      "description": "(throwaway account, TL;DR at the bottom, mobile user yada yada)\n\nSo I [F18] have been in a long distance relationship with this wonderful guy [M20] for over 7 months now. We met during a summer camp where he was a volunteer and fell in love immediately. After spending 2 weeks together at the camp we went long distance. We've met 3 times since, twice when he came to visit me and once when I went to him. My parents don't know about him and for reasons I'd rather not talk about, I can't tell them. \n\nNow here's my big deal. I want to go to the same university as him (because I wanted to go there from the start and not because he is there). There is an math exam required in order to get a place, and said exam is VERY hard. Now, my math is quite decent, atm I can say that I'd score an 8/10 at that exam. The problem is that I really want to get as high a grade as possible because my parents will never accept to pay for my college, so I need to get in for free (quite limited number of places).\n\nLast week the university started organising some training courses where they show their future students how to approach solving the questions of the exam. So I convinced my parents to let me go to his city and attend those courses every week (a lot of money involved). I went to the courses and afterwards I spent the day with my bf. It was amazing.\n\nThe problem is this. He wants to spend more time with me, and wants a little privacy (which I totally understand), but in order to go to his home (1h train ride away from the University city) we would need to leave the courses early to catch the train. He says he's been to these courses last year and has it all written in a notebook that he can let me have, so I don't miss out. I don't agree with skipping those courses just to spend time with him, simply because 1) they're very important to me, I feel like it helps me understand math a lot better and 2) my parents have spent a lot of money for my education so I can get to that university, last thing I want is to fail myself, or them.\n\nWe talked about this last night, he says he feels like I don't love him and that the sacrifices he made for me were kind of pointless because I'll never do the same for him. We're both committed to this relationship as much as possible, and I don't consider breaking up anytime soon. I love him, but I feel like this is going too far. He says he knows he doesn't want any other girl in his life, but I'm neither ready nor willing to make that statement anytime soon. \n\nSo, reddit. Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR my boyfriend wants me to skip (very important) courses to get some private time. ",

It started as an innocent conversation about work and all of a sudden I got a whole paragraph ending with \"sorry I probably said to much\". On about how he was never truly sorry. I'm very wary about girls thrusting emotional stuff and venting on me. I am someone who would often mistake this for affection and a chance to prove how nice I was. Like a friend zoned nice guy type deal. Plus it was about her ex. I said don't worry about it. She said sure so I replied its nothing to do with me. She then said sorry to have bothered. I'm of the opinion that she could stay chatting Im not sure yet. But if not maybe I dodged a red flag. ",

      "description": "So me and my buddy have been best friends since kindergarten. We are close enough that we have keys to each others place and it is not unusually for us to just show up unannounced. It is fairly common for me to come home and find a random new case of beer in my fridge and him and his gf in my pool. \n\nSo with that being said, I went over to his house Saturday night after a particularly rough day at work (I'm a cop) because I figured having a good time with friends is much better than being home alone wallowing in self pity.\n\nSo it turns out that he is not home, he had to take off for a work emergency and would be out of town until the next day. His girlfriend is home though and invites me in. I would consider her and I to be friends as well so I take her up on it and come in to hang out. I think it would be important to add that while I liked her and think she was really good for my buddy, I am admittedly pretty shallow with pretty high standards so I don't have any interest in her sexually. So we are drinking beer playing pool/darts and just hanging out. That eventually turns into doing a couple shots.\n\nAfter that we go and sit on the couch. I figure we can watch a couple reruns of the office and I can go pass the fuck out in the guest room. But that is the last thing I remember. I don't even remember getting the show started. I just wake up the next morning with the worst hangover of my life. Splitting headache, so dizzy I can barely stand up the whole thing. \n\nBut what it worse is that I am naked in his bed next to his girlfriend. Obviously and rightfully he hates me right now. And my friends are saying I should have never went in and hung out with his girlfriend alone and put us in that situation to begin with. \n\nBut I can't stress enough, that I had no sexual feeling for her. I did imagine in my wildest dreams that this would have happened. Shit, I still can't imagine it as I don't remember any of it.\n\nSo I know alcohol isn't an excuse, so I am 100% the asshole for sleeping with her. But am I also the asshole for hanging out with her alone in the first place?",

In school we have similar grades but hers are ok because she is older and more responsible so she will fix them, she failed 2 subjects I failed 3 but she didnt take any consequences while I got grounded, my dad took away my PC (this was 2 months ago). She is allowed to bully me, when she does it its funny and its taken as a joke but when I try to defend myself and start joking with her I am \"disrespecting my sister and I shouldnt behave like that\".\n\nMy dad would constantly pick on me because I disconnected myself from the rest of the family and became very anti social (because of my depression, which by the way no one wants to talk about with me). I decided to hide myself from everyone else and use video games (overwatch and csgo) because I need to focus which makes me not think about school and other stuff. I got into Rap due to that type of music being open about depression and family issues.\n\nWhen I was 8 my parents divorced I changed schools which made me lose contact with lot of friends. This was one of the causes for me slowly getting depressed. Their divorce hit me hard, even to this day when I think about it I start to get emotional and it sometimes cry.\n\nMy GP openly tell me that they love my older sister more, which I take pretty hard and even talked to them but they just dont care about my feelings mostly. They constantly talk shit about me and no matter if I do good they will just dont care.\n\nThe same is happening  with my bro. My dad and GP support all his wishes and talk how when he grows up he is going to be super successful and Ill live on his couch. At 4 years he has got: 2 parrots, a bicycle, 2 children sized bikes, a dog, etc. I remember when I was a kid I was asking for 2 things, a hamster and a scooter, they denied to buy me those two. I learned how to skate when I was 8 and that was using my friends spare skateboard, when they found out they grounded me because I wasnt allowed to skate, later on they were ok about me skating after using my Bday money to buy myself my own skateboard (after about a year of me learning how to skate). I bought my first gaming PC about a year ago from my pocket money even though I was asking for it for years (I get about 30$ a month compared to my sister getting 150$ a month) the PC I bought was in total about 700$ (its not that great but it gets the job done) and it took me quite a while to get it because I also use my own money when I go out with friends which is reasonable but my sister gets extra money when she goes out with her friends. It took me 2 years in total to buy myself a PC.",

      "description": "For some context, my husband and I have been together for 5 years. In the middle of these 5 years, we started an online business together.\n\nThe business was my idea, and I was fully prepared to go through it on my own. However, my husband, upon seeing me struggle with some aspects of the business, decided to help me, as he had a lot more knowledge than me in the area. Of course, I was happy to get the help! But he kept repeating stuff like \"You'll never be able to do this without me\" \"I sacrificed years of my life for YOU\"  \n\n\nHis parents had abused him emotionally growing up. I took him into my house (before we were married, we were fairly young), tried my best to give him what he needed. However, taking care of someone who's been through that took a toll on me, and I ended up snapping on him multiple times. I'm not proud of those moments.\n\nThe abuse caused him to become extremely impatient. He would lose his shit every time I did a small mistake, go completely bonkers whenever I would cry due to his outbursts. I began to be afraid of little things. I was scared of giving my opinion (and thus, would default to agreeing with him). I was so scared that it affected all of the spheres in my life.This only caused my productivity to drop like mad. However, because of my drop in productivity, the rest of our team was starting to view me differently. I could've understood if it was just a professional thing, but something about how they were talking to me felt off.   \n\n\n**Here's why I became very suspicious of my husband:**\n\nHe vents to others whenever we have a fight. He'll go up to his friends, his family and just about everyone and give us details about our personal lives. He'd detail nearly everything I've done and said to him. However, I would hold it in, all of my feelings, and I'd rather talk it out in private, just between me and him. This led to our entire circle getting his side of the story everytime, further isolating me socially. I couldn't help but shake the feeling that he was doing so with our business partners as well. I asked him about it, and he lied to me and told me he never revealed anything personal to any of our partner. So, I logged into his emails and read the back and forth between him and the BPs.  \n\n\nAnd here it was. Laid down were detailed facts about our fights, relationships and just generally my flaws as a person. Basically, he ruined my chances of ever starting anew with any of them, as they now have access to parts of my life I never gave him the consent to expose.\n\nI confronted him about this and told him that I went through his email. He immediately went for the divorce and is considering kicking me out of the company(Which is now easy to do, since pretty much everyone hates me - AND he told them I went through his emails)  \n\n\nI feel horrible for breaching everyone's privacy. I feel like an utter piece of shit. But a part of me can't help but think that I was right to dig further?",

      "description": "So, current college student here. I matched with a girl on Bumble recently and we had set up some sort of plan to just meet up and maybe chat a little bit at this holiday thing that usually happens at my college. It's basically a bunch of Christmas lights and organizations trying to sell you stuff. She was already on campus to study and I live outside where they were doing the holiday thing, so it seemed like a no-brainer to meet up there.\n\nAnyway, the sort-of plan was for me to try to find her at the thing, so I'm walking around and after 15 minutes, I see her. Only her pictures didn't show how, well, big she was. She used angles and pictures that hid her size. I don't really respect that, because I lay everything out in my profile (I'm 5'3\", so if we match, you're gonna know I'm short). So I just walked off and unmatched with her.\n\nAITA here? One of my friends says yeah, I should've sucked it up and just hung out with her for a bit, but the other says that if she's gonna mislead people, she shouldn't be surprised if she's ghosted.",

      "description": "So this is through spirit airlines, which I know makes it kind of my fault. Another thing, I have worked in the service industry for some time and I understand service jobs are difficult and people are assholes. I am not the type to talk to a manager or complain, I like to think I’m pretty understanding. So I had a plane booked from Portland to Vegas, and then Vegas to Austin. I missed the check in by maybe 10 minutes (freeway incident, but still my fault I’ll accept), and the gate attendant refused to help, saying there was nothing she could do and that it was my fault for not checking in online (which I couldn’t, since I was traveling with my dog). She walked away from me as I was trying to explain my situation and put up a sign that check in was closed for my flight. Thankfully I was able to catch another flight to Vegas so I wouldn’t miss my flight to Austin. Just my luck, it’s snowing in Vegas for the first time in a decade, so a bunch of flights get canceled or delayed. Mine gets delayed from midnight to 2 pm. I don’t know anyone in Vegas, and it being late at night, and having a dog, finding a hotel for one night last minute seemed like an expense I couldn’t justify. So I wait at the airport, until finally! 2pm! No plane at the gate, no attendant. there was no one to ask. After ~30 min of waiting I strike up a conversation with some other  passengers, and we exchange grievances and just generally bitch about spirit. Not far from us are the flight attendants, who don’t know anything. We eventually notice that they’re cracking jokes about the plane not being here and how unreliable the estimated times are, in front of us. Maybe I’m being sensitive, but to say that in front of dozens of people who have had to spend the night on an airport floor is pretty insulting. So at this point, I get annoyed and it was immature but I start being a bit bolder with my complaints. After talking about my experience with the gate attendant, and all of us complaining about how late the plane is and the lack of information, finally the plane pulls up. 15 hours after the scheduled time. one of the flight attendants comes up to me, asks me what my seat is, and says he’ll “take care of me” and that he’s “so very sorry” (verbatim) about my experience. Again, maybe me being sensitive, his tone seemed a little sarcastic? This is why I’m writing this. I immediately felt a LOT of guilt and embarrassment and I ended up apologizing to HIM for my incessant bitching. I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong for being upset that I spent a lot of money to catch a flight that I had to wait 15 hours for but AITA for complaining loud enough for an attendant to feel like he should apologize to me? Either way, I think it was pretty rude of the attendants to speak amongst each other that way in front of all the passengers. For now I’m just sitting on the plane waiting to depart and trying not to make eye contact with any of the flight attendants",

      "description": "Made a throwaway because she uses reddit. So I  (23m) have been dating my girlfriend(18f) for some time now. Before you all jump down my throat for dating someone so young, she’s wise beyond her years. It took me a while to admit to myself I had feelings for her because I didn’t want her to see me as some creepy old man, but she is truly amazing. \n\nNow on to my problem. She is definitely the most insecure person i’ve ever met and I truly don’t understand why. She’s 5”5 and around 130lbs. She’s in great shape and goes to the gym practically everyday. Due to stress and medication she hasn’t really been eating so i’ve been trying to get her to do so because she was originally around 165lbs about four months ago(it’s funny though because she didn’t look overweight by any means and now she looks very thin). I am not trying to fetishize her but she has this gorgeous exotic look to her and her skin is this beautiful caramel color. Despite all this, she’s convinced she is (to quote her own words) “a fat waste of space”. She had trouble with eating disorders  when she was younger but went to rehab for it and really struggled with bullying because she used to be obese when she was little. \n\nNow to give you an idea of how much this is hurting our relationship, here is the list of things I am not allowed to do. Take her shirt off during sex even if the lights are off, eat her out because “you probably hate it but you’re just lying to protect my feelings” (i’m not), touch her stomach in anyway, compliment her because (you’re just lying), or literally see her upper body in anyway. From time to time if she’s drunk or stoned enough she’ll randomly send me a nude or show up at my place and rip everything off and I really don’t understand her hang up because her body is amazing. Like really. Toned stomach and what i would estimate is at least a DD cup (which she hates because she thinks they’re saggy... THEYRE NOT)\n\nAll of this reached a point where I said enough is enough and told her to get help. She went on antidepressants (which have visibly been helping with her overall mood) and started therapy. It’s been months and NOTHING changed. She still turned away if I walked in on her changing, no shower sex, shirt stays on... you get it. So I sat her down and asked her once and for all if she could please make an effort because god.. I want to TOUCH her. I want her skin on mine. Not being able to just hold her is the most sexually frustrating thing i’ve ever experienced and I feel like a teenage boy again. She just started crying (which freaks me out because she literally never cries in front of me) saying that she was trying her best and that ‘pressuring her’ is just making it worse.\n\nNow I really didn’t think I was pressuring her. I was just asking her to fucking TRY because it really doesn’t seem like she is.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I’ve been getting tattooed by my artist on a regular basis since 2015. She has tattooed my whole sleeve and now we’re working on my second sleeve. We’ve built a very good rapport over the years and I really like talking with her and hanging out while I get tattooed. I spend good money on her because she does excellent work and it’s worth it to put something I really love on my body. \n\nSo, now to our last session. I’m not usually bad with pain and I never tap out for our tattoo sessions... EXCEPT for the last one. She did quite a big tattoo on the back of my arm and we’d been going for about two and a half hours at this point. I usually don’t eat before I get tattooed because it makes me feel nauseous, but I’ll bring a snack or something, a water bottle, and a sweet drink (like juice) for blood sugar purposes. I started getting really shaky before she was about to tattoo another huge part of my arm (elbow ditch, eek). Like not just kinda shaky, but REALLY REALLY shaky like I couldn’t stop my whole body from shaking hard. I assumed it was blood sugar and I said as much, then finished the rest of my juice. I’ve NEVER felt like I was going to pass out while getting tattooed, except for this time. I’ve never told her that I can’t keep going because of pain. But this day I told her I didn’t think I could keep going because I couldn’t stop shaking. I tried to power through as she did a couple little things on my arm and then I asked her to stop and could we please continue the big piece the next time because once we started then we wouldn’t be able to stop. \n\nShe tried to pressure me to do the big piece because she was really excited about it. And I don’t blame her. The stencil was on and it looks super good and I wanted her to as well. But I couldn’t. \n\nThen from the other side of the room another artist piped up and was like “next time you come here you better put your big girl pants on”. He kept looking over and smirking at me while I was explaining, as I was being pressured, that I didn’t want to continue for today. Now that did not sit well with me. I was shaking so hard at this point and I thought I was going to vomit. And he said that because I was tapping out. \nMy artist bandaged me and sent me on my way and I drove home to eat something while shaking very very hard. As she was bandaging me she was like “aww are you sure you’re okay, you’re shaking so much.” \n\nI felt better later in the day after I went home and ate but I still felt like shit about the situation. \n\nI’m supposed to have another appointment with my artist in April but I’m really not feeling up for it. I don’t want to go. I feel like canceling it. \n\nAITA for feeling like shit about this situation? WIBTA if I cancel our appointment? ",

      "description": "My (23F) friend (21F) lets call her Maria have been friends for over 8 years. We met after I moved to the country that I currently live in and was one of the first people that I befriended.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, I bought a new car (A 2012 Fiat 500). It’s not NEW new but I bought it for a good price considering the mileage on it. It is my very first car so I’m very happy about it and love it a lot! About a week after I bought it, I was on FaceTime with Maria and in the middle of our conversation, I told her about the news! I was so excited to tell her because her sister who’s younger than us (19) also bought a car recently (last year) and we were both so excited to follow in her footsteps. \n\nHowever, Maria’s reaction just stunned me. After I told her the news, she asked me what kind of car it was. As soon as I told her, she started laughing at me. I’m not talking about a little chuckle... it was a full on laugh, not being able to breathe and all.. and then she proceeded to ask me if I wouldn’t be ashamed to drive such a small car. I mean it is small but I couldn’t understand why she thought I should be ashamed so I asked her to explain. And then she told me that out of all the cars that I could’ve bought, I picked the cheapest and most insignificant one. At this point, I was so hurt that I just stopped talking while she kept laughing. \n\nAfter a few minutes, I told her that I was very hurt by her comments and that I was expecting more support/excitement from her, as one of my best friends. I thought she would stop laughing after I said that but instead, she just called her sister and proceeded to make fun of me and my car while still on FaceTime with me. \nThat’s when I hung up. She then tried to call me twice after that but I don’t pick up. \n\nIt’s been 2 months and I kinda feel like I overreacted a bit. What she did wasn’t nice but she was my best friend and I cut her off just like that, in an instant. I FEEL like an asshole.\n\nI guess now I’m just trying to get different opinions.

I simply don't want to do anything, I just want to play my game. Nothing personal towards her. I told her this is how I relieve my stress. To make up for it, I dedicate Friday's and Saturday's for her where we go on dates - going out to eat and watch movies. But once Monday hits, I spend most of my time through the week playing. My rationale for not showing as much attention is because last year when we dated, we didn't live together and would not see each other until 8 PM or so anyways. So I told her, think of it as the same thing, except I am in the living room and won't be as attentive until later in the night. AITA here? Is she expecting too much?

She complained nonstop about how it isn’t NEARLY as good as the original version on the arcade. I swear you could mistake her rants, for Cranky Kong dialogue. So because I have Switch online I let her play the original Donkey Kong and she hated it. Now she acts really defensive if I bring it up. I was hoping to prove that TF was surperior, but I didn’t expect to crush her nostalgia.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to go on a second date with someone who judges me for not loving (just liking) my job?",
      "description": "I went on a date with someone who kept asking me about my career as a social worker and if I was passionate about it. I told him I like it but at the end of the day it’s just a job. He talked about how rewarding it must be and how good it makes me feel to make an impact in someone’s life. That part was cool and all but the best reward I can get is my paycheck. I’ve built up a pretty good resume to be able to make more money that what most people think social workers make. I’m glad I can help people and be rewarded by a paycheck that pays for things that I am passionate about: travel, nature, fitness, sports\n\nI told him I was passionate about things but not work. He asked me if I thought I was ever going to find something I’m passionate about. I had JUST told him I have passion but not during work. I was starting to get annoyed because I do have passion. Yes I probably could have gotten into something that fit in more with my hobbies like physical therapy or nursing, but that didn’t happen and it is what it is. I’m passionate about my hobbies and get to do outside working hours. He kept putting words in my mouth saying things like “but you’re not happy” or “you’re not fulfilled.” I told him yes I am but a job is a job and I do it to pay bills and the things that keep me happy. He eventually put the subject to rest but I could tell he was being really judgy for not having or looking for a job where work won’t feel like work.  That kind of tells me that he doesn’t value balance or boundaries. Like everything has to be sunshine and rainbows. I’m not sure if I see a future with someone who’s happy-go-lucky all the time. It’s not realistic and we probably wouldn’t be a good fit for each other. \n\nI should add that when I burned out a lot within the 1st year of my career and that’s because I was unrealistic in thinking I could help everyone and would get extremely frustrated when I couldn’t, which led to me hating social work. It took me a while to get to a point where I could set emotional as well as physical boundaries. I had to change my actions and my outlook. I only worked during working hours, never again for free. I told myself that I can only do so much and you can lead a horse to the water but you can’t make it drink. Boy have I led many horses to the water and continue to do so. I no longer get upset when they don’t drink because I know that I did what I could. Also, he’s in his 30s and he just decided to pursue his passion. He’s never actually experienced working a job that he thought he’d love, burning out, and then having to find ways to be content rather than actually loving it so much that it won’t feel like work. I think we’re either in different stages in life (he seems a bit naive) or we’re just very different in personalities. Either way, we’re not a good match. If it’s not a match, why bother going on a second date? So AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Went on a date with a guy who’s too optimistic and thinks that there’s passion in all aspects of life, including work. I disagree and I feel shamed. I don’t think we’re a good fit so I don’t think a second date is necessary. ",

      "description": "Just to be brief I’m a 22 year old college student who hasn’t had many “real jobs” other than some volunteer work in middle and high school. I’ve really only had two “real jobs” while I’ve been in college one at a restaurant and my current job at a well known super store. I was brought into the restaurant business by a good buddy of mine who had been working there for a little over a year as a dishwasher. I was hired on as an additional dishwasher and after about 3 months of me working there I had gotten promoted to be a salad/sushi chef and quickly gained promotions much quicker than my friend who’s been there longer, but there was never any resentment for my quick progression just a type of family love you could say. I enjoyed the kitchen lifestyle and the guys will always be a second family to me, but due to college and the demand for the hours they needed I had to keep my education in mind I had to leave and get a more hour consistent job to get through college. Ive been working at this super store for 11 months so far and within my fourth month their i was given employee of the month and just recently was given a promotion to be a manager of a sought after department on my first try. However, unlike the restaurant I was told to keep this a secret until i was moved over after they had trained someone to replace me in my current department, so that is no problem my lips are sealed. I’m still in my current department and employees over 4 years and over are starting to get their suspicions about who the new manager is and some rumors (not true) of others getting the position are being looked down on and trash talked for “getting the position” well I’m the youngest manager at this store and no one suspects me because I haven’t been here even a year. So when they start talking about how “messed up it is that I’ve wanted that position for 4 years and never got it and someone else gets it” I just go along and tell them “yeah that really sucks, maybe you’ll get another department down the road” and “maybe they just found someone who is better fitted to do that job”. So AITA for not saying anything to my coworkers knowing I’m the manager and I’m the person they’re trash talking for taking the position?",

      "description": "My very best friend is married to a man (we’ll call him Evan) who I would consider a, “man’s man” if you will. He’s super masculine, a carpenter, hunter, a little too afraid of gay men for no good reason, you know the type. All in all, I think he has a good heart and treats my friend well.\n\nBut. \n\nMy friend is an extremely kind caring person, the type who you wouldn’t find questioning whether or not she’s an asshole, because she just isn’t. And I think Evan might take advantage of it. He says things like, “I can’t do any of the cleaning, she says I do it wrong so I don’t even bother helping” or, “I can only cook ramen, and I don’t feel like learning, but she’s so good at it, I don’t even worry” or, my personal favorite, “Yeah I plan on puttin a baby in her soon. I haven’t decided exactly when would be right.” And my friend just laughs these things off.\n\nSo recently I tried to make plans to go to dinner with her, Evan, and my boyfriend. As I broached the topic of these plans she said, “Oh no. No way. Evan is watching the football game tonight. There is only a month left in the season, I can’t wait until it’s over so I can stop planning everything around when Evan watches the games.” To which I said, “Yikes.” And she got so mad at me, we ended up getting in a pretty serious argument where she kept telling me how Evan does everything for her, and she would never stop him from game watching for dinner, and it’s not about compromise she just wouldn’t tell him what to do. Now my friend is happy, she loves this man, all in all he seems like a good person, but I can’t help feel like his quasi-misogynistic words go a little too far. I can’t decide if I’m an asshole for trying to help someone who (in my independent lady mind) is doting upon a man who doesn’t give too much back. Or if I’m right and she’s suppressed. ",

Now, normally I head over there at around 8:00 in the morning.  but my brother wants to start getting to school at 6:45 am so I have to leave way earlier. I usually go to bed around 9 to 10 and because I had to wake up earlier I wasn't able to get as much as sleep and was tired when I got my grandparents house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow normally I make my own breakfast or my grandma goes out and gets something to eat real quick. I always pay her back if she does go get something to eat. Now my grandpa is bedridden and cannot move a single limb on his own. He has Alzheimers and Dementia. My uncle also lives with my grandma because he never really moved out and when he did my grandparents were getting old so he moved back so if both of them were in trouble he could do something about it. \n\nAnyways, I would like to point out that I have been helping my grandmother with my grandfather for almost 3 years now. So I get to my grandmothers' house pretty tired just to the point where I just cannot keep my eyes open and fell asleep. My grandmother got enraged at this for some reason, calling me a son of a bitch because I was asleep while she was calling me for the help that she normally does. And I just told her I don't really want to do this I am really tired right now and need to catch up on my sleep. She was furious, and called me a lazy piece of shit. I told her My uncle could help her. I normally help with cleaning up my grandpa and turning so he doesn't get bedsores, now I don't think that this is exactly the worst thing in the world, and because he is my grandpa I will do it. \n\nThe thing that made me angry was the fact that everything that I have done for her in the past 3 years was thrown out the window because I needed to sleep just once. I was pissed at first, but I've since calmed down. Another thing that I have now started to notice is she doesn't even know me anymore, about a couple hours later she went out to the store and got some groceries, and she came back with fucking mc Donalds. I am not mad at the fact that it was mc Donalds I'm mad because she brought food in general, and if she really knew me then she would've known that a simple apology would have been sufficient.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease help me reddit, I feel sort of like an asshole, but if she won't appreciate the work that I do for her and my grandfather then I don't think I want to help out anymore.

      "description": "Kind of a shitty title, I know there's nothing wrong with being friends with girls that are taken but this situation is a little different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met a girl, A, at a club in college almost three years ago. We hit it off almost instantly and became good friends. You know, not super close or anything because she had a boyfriend and I never really had those kinds of intentions with her anyway, didn't want to make her and her boyfriend uncomfortable, we just got along really well.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver time, our relationship kind of grew. She went through some really rough shit and came to me for advice a few times and I was happy to help her out and listen to her. I started to see her as a really close friend and she felt the same. I started to feel like, deep down, if she was single, I would go for it--but she wasn't, so I didn't dare. I met her boyfriend a few times, even went out and got drinks with him. He was a good guy. I didn't want to hurt them or their relationship. I just kind of brushed it off as a \"right person, wrong time\" type of thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't feel bad being her friend. I mean, I honestly thought I would. Like, on paper, \"girl you really connect with is super into someone else\" sounds really shitty but it wasn't so bad for me. I kept myself busy with other girls and just generally enjoying being single so it didn't weigh on me much. She seemed really happy with her boyfriend and she seemed happy to have me as a friend so that was it. We kept talking more, hanging out more, about shit that got deeper and more personal but I thought we were just being friends. I didn't think it would affect her very much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to see that it did, little details, but I think I purposefully ignored them. Stuff like her always asking our other friends what I've been up to if we haven't talked in a few days, making it a point to acknowledge me when I enter the room etc. Maybe that's nothing, maybe I'm overthinking it. In any case, I brushed it all off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause she seemed completely happy with her boyfriend until one day she just woke up and... wasn't? She just kinda broke it off with him. And she has been claiming it's because they've been fighting more, they don't really see eye-to-eye as much, stuff like that. I'm not sure if I believe her or not. I know her well enough to know that she's not always honest with herself. And that maybe some of this has to do with her possibly having feelings for me? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not here to ask whether she does or not--I think she does. A few people have pointed out how her behavior around me has changed since her breakup. I've noticed the same changes and I suspect that she does have some feelings for me, maybe she had them for a while now. I'm too afraid to ask because I don't want to answer her if/when she asks me how I feel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n What I want to know is if it was wrong for me to become so close with her, knowing that she was committed to someone else. I never wanted to see her relationship fail or to see her (or her boyfriend) get hurt. But I can't help but feel like a total dick for letting myself get close to this girl, thinking it was just a friendship when I knew how sensitive she is, when I knew that we do really connect with each other. Help me out. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "So, I live in an apartment complex which for the most part is very well insulted for sound, apart from the constant stomping around from upstairs.\nNow this isn’t just light footsteps that you can hear, and I don’t expect anyone to tip-toe around their own apartment, but it is like they deliberately stomp around as hard as they can, and it’s as if someone is thumping on the walls.\nI have however taken into consideration that they are on the top floor and don’t have any upstairs neighbours of their own, so they may be oblivious to how noise travels down through the floors.\n\nI’ve contemplated going upstairs and asking them politely to try and be considerate when they’re walking (running?) around their apartment, but I struggle with figuring out how to word things in the nicest of ways, and I don’t want to come across as off-hand when I really don’t mean to be.\n\nSo I guess my question is, would I be the asshole for even thinking that I could ask them to be quieter? And if not, how would I even go about asking?",

      "description": "I’m from Belfast, Ireland and I manage a bar here. For that bar we have our own personal radio that’s linked to the local taxi company, we’ve been using this company for over a year now. We use it primarily for the regular customers to get home safe and we generate at least 50% of their business.\n\nMy cars in the shop so I decided to use this taxi company after my shift today and rang one with the radio for myself, I got picked up and dropped home to my door. I don’t live that far away, even with a meter running, it should cost between £4-6. Well this driver tried to charge me an outrageous £15 for the drive. This driver did not have the meter running so I’m guessing he was just trying to do some horrible math in his head for mileage or whatever. I said to him when he asked for that amount that it’s too much, it’s usually between £4-6 and then he got angry and said it’s the meter but when I corrected him and told him his meter was not running he got angrier and switched it on very aggressively while kinda shoving my leg in the process. When he switched the meter on from stand by mode it said the fair should’ve only cost £4.60. I called him out on why he’s asking an absurd amount so he told me to just get out of the car while cursing at me. I sank to his level and cussed and argued back because I’m thinking of how many of my regular customers this man has ripped off previously without it being called out. I eventually told him to f*** himself and that I’m gonna speak to the manager of the taxi firm. He then replied with “try it, I know where you live” followed by some insults. I regret arguing back and I shouldn’t have sank to that level but it truly was because I was thinking of my regulars. I don’t know if this is just one driver personally or the whole taxi company.\n\nTLDR; taxi driver over charged me. My bar creates half of their business and I got angry on behalf of how many of my customers he’s ripped off. ",

      "description": "So Id like to note that this story is from last November-December and things have since settled between me friend and I, but at the time I didn’t know about this sub and only had a couple people to get opinions from (they were very mixed) and I still wonder if I am the asshole in this situation. So here it goes:\n\nSeveral months ago there was a devastating fire that decimated the town right next to mine. Many people, including one of my closest friends, lost everything/almost everything they owned in the fire.\n\nLiterally two days after the fire a friend of mine (who was not directly affected by the fire) posted on her snapchat story (which she has shown me gets 300-400 views on every post) that she got a brand new car. My first thought was to swipe up and say “woah cool car” or something of the like. However what soon came to my mind was the fact that my two of my good friends lost their cars in the fire, along with many residents of the town. So I sent her a message about it.\n\nI worded it very deliberately to not outwardly attack her for posting this, suggesting that she maybe should post about it later because a lot of people lost their possessions, they probably wouldn’t like to see someone showing off their brand new car. \n\nShe immediately jumped on me, extremely offended at what I said, telling me off, she brought up that I wasn’t directly affected by the fire, therefore I shouldn’t speak for those who were, which I could understand. However she began to tell me that I was saying shes not allowed to be happy and despite me telling her otherwise she insisted thats what I was saying. \n\nI tried to explain to her that I wasn’t trying to tell her what to do, that I just trying to lend perspective that it might be seen as insensitive, but she just warded me off with a “thanks.”\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I (50F) was invited by my mother to attend my father's 80th birthday party this upcoming weekend.  They are divorced, but still keep in contact. (he is living with someone, my mom is widowed.)  She offered to fly me to Toronto from BC to attend,  but I politely declined.\n\nI have a complicated relationship with my dad.  I've been reading a lot of r/raisedbynarcissists posts, and while he is/can be a self-centred dick, he's not as bad as some of the posts I've read there.  Regardless, he is often a jerk to me, so I don't feel the need to see him.\n\nA little history: He cheated on my mom and they split when I was pregnant with my second child.  When he missed my (first) child's birthday, I gave him a couple of weeks, incase the mail was late, and then called him to see what was up.  I think, like most men of his generation, he had always let his wife take care of the entire birthday/gift giving aspects of his life, and just never picked up the slack when he left her.  I let him know that I was disappointed that he didn't bother to send his only grandchild a card for his first birthday, and my dad made up some lame excuse about not being anywhere near a place that sells cards.\n\nI then wrote him a long letter, basically telling him that he can choose to be a part of our lives or he can choose to not be.  No pressure, but I was not going to have my kids learn about disappointment from their grandfather.  So, basically, shit or get off the pot.\n\nHe wrote back that he was very hurt by my letter and that yes, he definitely DID want to be a part of my and my family's life. (Spoiler alert:  He did not, actually.)\n\nThis was 16 years ago, and he has probably sent 10 birthday/xmas etc cards in total.  Bonus asshole move: Most of them are just to one of my kids.  Years ago, he flat out told me that I was doing a terrible job as a mother and he actively disliked my older son. (I didn't spank him enough and I was also making him 'gay' by letting him have long hair.) This after only seeing him a handful of times in 10 years.  He somehow expects that my kids are going to jump into his arms gleefully yelling \"Grandpa!\" even though he has remained a virtual stranger their entire lives.\n\nAnyway, this was years ago, we have managed to be civil through a couple of family get-togethers and my sister's funeral.  And yet, he has shown pretty much zero interest in me or my husband or children, unless he's asking for money.\n\nI don't hate him.  I'm not even actively angry at him.  I've just sort of delegated him to be a long-lost Uncle that I might occasionally see.  This very much disappoints my mother who really wants us to be close.\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The main issue is my partner will tell me he’s too busy or doesn’t have time (for me) — but will turn around and text/hang out 1:1 with other female friends. \n\nThe first time I chalked it up as not a big deal, but it’s happened multiple times since. Called him out on it, but not much has changed. \nAlso, the kicker- I’m never invited because he prefers one on one contact as it’s more personal. \n\nI do know he’s not sleeping with his female friends but there is most likely some light flirting. The breaking point was yesterday when he was talking about one of his female friends while in bed with me, and how beautiful she is etc. He then gets a text from one of his sister’s college friends at 11pm. And postpones our plans so he could meet with another female friend for lunch.\n\nAt this point, I’m just DONE with the female friends. All of it. Told him to stop texting them, and seeing them because his focus, attention and mind is with them and it’s effecting our relationship. \n\nHe said I was controlling, juvenile, and overbearing but will think about it.

      "description": "This is such a vague silly post BUT it's bothering me because it's just an example of things that constantly happen in my family, where I'll disagree with the rest of the family and they perceive me as an asshole, because of things I say. \n\nThis example is about my dad buying pain au chocolate at a French bakery. He told me he asked the girl who worked there what they were called, and she didn't know the name so she said \"bread with chocolate\" instead. My dad told me about this as a funny story but I said \"if I was her boss I would've fired her for not knowing the name of one of the companies products. If you work in a French bakery you should be able to pronounce it. She should lose her job\" \n\nNo one in my family agreed with this, so I was left feeling like the stupid one even though I don't think what I said was mean. It wasn't said with ill intention at all, I was just giving my spontaneous commentary. My family never agrees with me on anything. My sister doesn't have this happen because she's quiet even when she disagrees.\n\n Maybe I should try a new method called \"being quiet 80% of the time and when I speak I only say neutral things in this super soft non threatening angel voice\"?",

      "description": "In NYC subway train delays are common. I was commuting home on Friday evening and we got stuck underground for a while. \n\nBeing Friday, the sabbath begins at sundown, and it was looking like sundown would happen while we were still stuck underground. \n\nA group of Orthodox or Hasidic (I don’t know the subcategories of Judaism) teenage boys asked if I lived near by and if I could take their cell phones, watches and money from them because they aren’t allowed to carry them once the sabbath began at sundown in the next few minutes.  He even offered to pay me for holding their things. \n\nI felt bad for the kids because their faith is obviously something very important to them and circumstances outside their control made it difficult to honor their spiritual practices. They wouldn’t be asking this of strangers unless they felt it were absolutely necessary. At the same time, a group of strangers asking me to take a bunch of cell phones and cash made me uncomfortable. \n\nI declined as politely as possible, stating that I wouldn’t be comfortable taking their belongings but wishing them the best of luck.  AITA for saying no?",

      "description": "AITA... For background, I was looking to change my hair and I found a local hair stylist in my area who has outstanding reviews and pictures of her work. I reached out to her via email and got an initial response pretty quickly asking if I could come in for a consultation. I replied back asking when she was available and waited three more days for a response back. Only when I double emailed her (very politely) did she reply back. Fast forward, I went to my consultation appointment with her and she said she would text me so we could make an appointment. I waited patiently for 3 days for a text. I decided to text her yesterday asking when we might be able to book an appointment so I could take work off in advance. I got a reply back saying \"she was at work and would text back ASAP\".(Which I totally understand and was happy to wait. She never texted me back last night after that and I am still waiting this morning.   \nI know that running your own business is stressful and Im sure she has a lot of clients and prior appointments which I completely understand. I expected to wait for an actual appointment, but the response time in between is really getting under my skin, and I hate waiting for her text when she said she would text back \"ASAP\" ...\n\nSo am I the impatient asshole for expecting quicker response time? I  genuinely am not sure because I am impatient in general. Should I wait it out or go to another stylist?",

I usually nap when I get home, but the past few days I couldn't. The sleep deprivation starts to compound until I'm a walking zombie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday I went home early due to not feeling well, and by the night I knew I needed many hours of sleep. I decided that tomorrow (today) would be my much deserved day off, the first in months. I emailed my boss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to this morning. My GF's alarm starts going off at 5:30am, and I roll over to sleep more. She snoozes it and lets it ring a few more times. Having been used to getting up at 2:30am, I had 3 extra hours of sleep under my belt and the alarm was really starting to wake me up. I had taken sleeping medicine the night before and planned on sleeping through my GF getting ready.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe got up and went to take a shower. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hear my name SCREAMED from the bathroom. Jesus it was jarring. I got out of bed and walk to the bathroom. She starts telling me problems she has about getting ready, asking for my help to get her out the door. Her toothache was making her morning so much worse. She was saying she's late, her car is parked far down the street (we live downtown) I just wanted to SLEEP!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went back to lay down, letting her complain about the things she had to do and she came out of the bathroom angry. We got into a fight because my \"sick day\" wasn't real and I had the ability to help her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wanted my day off to be about me for once, all about me and my sleep. I didn't see why she couldn't just ignore me and pretend I wasn't there. I ended up making her lunch and cleaning the apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, and if you're wondering, I didn't go back to sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to spend my time off how I wanted to spend it? Even though she needed help? The thing is, her \"help\" was just her having a bad time and wanting me to solve her problems for her.",

We passed each other walking to opposite entrances and when they glared at me  I said \"You really shouldn't slam on your breaks and reverse that quickly in a parking lot\" while continuing to walk away they both started screaming \"You shouldn't be so close to my car!

I agreed though, and told him he could, but he went and took out $100 more then we agreed upon. It just seems like he’s always trying to get me to pay for things, or buy him things. Such as texting me pictures of items he wants. He’s not asking directly but I usually don’t know what to say. WIBTA if I told him i can’t borrow him anymore money in the future?",

      "description": "Okay, I'm on mobile, and it's a long one. I'm already an asshole for that \nSo, I have a cousin who is 16 years old. Overall, cool little dude. I'd legit die for him.\nWhen I got out of the military I got to visit my family for a bit. Of course, C wanted to see me. He was acting funny whenever we talked about it on the phone. He and my Aunts were not on speaking terms, and he was accused of something he didnt do, and it was nbd. This was weird, but I brushed it off.\nI tell him whatevers going on, I'll make time to see him, but I dont want to impose on A/E, as it was THEIR house.\nI ask him a bit of what is going on, so I know what to avoid saying. \nC \"Well, A thinks I was having sex, but really I went back to grab my shoes, and GF was in the car when she came back home while were leaving.\"\nSounds a little off, but whatever. A has a lot of stress dealing with sick children all day,so she can get a little upset over weird things. But she always apologizes, and makes amends, and is better.\nI call A and E and ask if it was okay for C to come over and visit. I state that I don't want to invite without asking.\nE says he can come, but GF isn't invited. \nFair deal, I relay the info, and we all go over to hang out.\nA pulls me aside and explains what had been going on. C has been really rude lately (saying she is fat, mean, and doesnt really care about him.) AND HE HAS BEEN HAVING SEX IN MY AUNTS' HOUSE. E (not A) caught them full blown in the act on the couch! Even though they EXPLICITLY told him NOT to. \"Not his house, not his nest.\"\nSo he drives up, and I go to answer the door, a little disappointed in what I had just heard, but still happy to see him. \nGF is at the door first. She quietly shoves some bags into my arms, and walks off to sit down in the corner of the room, and sulks the whole night.\nC comes in and we catch up real quick, then all settle down. He keeps muttering under his breath after everyone but me or GF speaks.\nI ask E if I can go light up in the back with my mom real quick and order some pizza. \"No prob\" she says.\nSo after a bit, my cousin comes out, and asks me for a hit. \nI tell him no, and to go back inside. (He is 16, and isn't allowed to be out on the patio while we are smoking pot anyway, house rules.) \nSo he tells me to duck myself, and asks my mom. She also says no.\nThen this fucker grabs the joint out of MY MOTHER'S HAND, and calls her a cunt.\nI was upset, so we went home early.\nWhen we went to say our goodbyes, He forgot his bag inside, and told M to get it. Not asked, but, TOLD MY MOTHER. \nI said I'd get it because I wanted to say bye to the cat. \nAs I was in there, I put a bottle of juice I had in my pocket in his bag next to where the joint was \"hidden\" (it was pretty obvious, and sticking out of a side pocket.) Then took a pic and sent it to his mom, asking if he's vaping again.\nL just grounded him for a month, but I don't know. Did I go too far?",

      "description": "For one of my modules this term I have a piece of coursework, in which we can either work in pairs or work on our own. I initially became partners with this guy, David because he asked me and I didn't really mind either way.\n\nThe way this unit works is that the quality of the project should be proportional to the people working on it (so two people should make something twice as good). And now that the Christmas holidays have started I will not be able to meet David until after the deadline, so we'd have to work separately which is a pain (communication is just an extra overhead for project work).\n\nPlus from the time we did work together I had no idea what he was trying to do, it all seemed irrelevant to our project. I think this is just poor communication on both of our parts, but at the same time I have a lot of other units to worry about so I don't have much time to guide him.\n\nThere's not a lot of time to the deadline, and we haven't really started properly, so it's not like I'd be taking any work we did together and leaving him with nothing. If anything, he can keep our idea (because I don't really like it).\n\nIf I didn't have a lot of other coursework and exams to prepare for I wouldn't mind so much, but I'm not smart enough to carry both of us, because I need to put in a lot of time to get work up to standard. All our communications have been odd and broken, and our ideas and plans tend to conflict which is why I feel like I would work better on my own.\n\nOf course I'd feel like an absolute dickhead to break it off this late (even though we haven't yet started), and he will most likely hate me, but I want to get a decent mark. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I an asshole? Even if I am, should I still go for it?",

      "description": "About a month ago I had a bit of an issue with an online friend of mine. Basically she felt I was complementing her too much (I called her cute a bit) and asked me to stop because it made her uncomfortable. They also asked if I had feelings for them, to which i said that I was very fond of them and may have had a little crush on them, but since they were taken I would absolutely back off. She thanked me and I thought that was the end of it. but about 30 min later, they pull me into a group dm with another person to basically say that she value her relationship over her friends and that she wouldn't be my friend anymore if I tried to come between her and her significant other. Needless to say I was incredibly taken back by this, since I'd never seen my friend act like this before. So I went to someone else whos also my friend and has known them for longer and told them what happened, because I was honestly worried about her. My other friend told me that she had some personal reasons for acting that way (former bad relationship and trust issues) and told me not to worry about her and that she was probably fine. Cut to about a week later, I notice shes being weird around me. So I message her asking if everything is ok between us, and she tells me that she knows I told my other friend about what happened, and that she felt I went behind him her back and betrayed her trust, and that I should have just talked to her about it. So I apologize for everything, and she says that she wants to take a break from being around me, and that she's  still on the fence about whether or not she still want to be my friend. So ANOTHER week passes and I decided to message her to ask how shes doing, only to find that both them and the friend they dragged me into the dm with have blocked me. AITA here?",

      "description": "So, I met a girl a few months ago while playing online, she was one of my best friend sister's and I rapidly developped feelings towards her. At first I buried my feelings cause she have a boyfriend and I didn't want to mess with my friendship with her brother. One night she text me and we call on a voicechat app and after a few hours of talking about how bad she feel in her relationship, she tell me she like me more than she would want. So i come out and admit that I feel the same way about her and she begin to tell me she would want to be single to date me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the following month it was pretty complex, one day she would call me for like 5 hours straight, the next day she would completely ghost me. Once I get her to understand the way she's handling it is unfair, she began to send me texts at any time of the night or the day, telling me how she like me, how she want to see me etc. So I find a pretty cheap bus, ask her brother if I can sleep at his home wich is like 100 km from her place(900 km from mine), he agree and I plan my one week trip to meet her. During this time the calls and texts continue and every time she would ensure me of how real her feelings are toward me until she finish a call by telling me she love me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is during this whole time she said me she was not ready to quit her boyfriend, and I told her I understand and it's the reason I want to meet her, to make her decision making easier. A few times she told me she wanted to stop things here using excuses like \"you are too perfect for me\" \"I don't deserve you\" etc, wich I replied it was bullshit excuses and If she wanted to stop here she would need to be honest, and to wait until we meet to take any decision. Every time she would agree and the next day the sweet texts would continue on her initiative. But as the time pass I got a bad feelings about my trip, and I was pretty much convinced I wouldn't see her. Yesterday her brother call me and tell me his other brother won't be able to shelter her for the week I was staying here and we need a solution wich I found. But in her head, the decision was taken cause she have too much distance to travel and she won't be able to quit her boyfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere I stop to be neutral and describe my feelings. It has been like 2 weeks I feel like I'm being used, she needed some attention that she didn't have at home and found it with me. I told her a few times how insecure I am about intimates relationships and she never stopped her bullshit. I felt she violated my trust only to feel loved. In 3 words I felt fooled. So I grabbed my phone and called her boyfriend to tell him she was fooling both of us, that I could provide screenshots or further explanation if he want. Honestly I did it for two reasons : I was hurt and felt the need to hurt her, and he deserve to know she's not trustworthy and willing to emotionally cheat on  him.",

      "description": "I'm in my senior year of highschool, living in Canada. I go to a full french high school. My mother tongue (and pretty much everyone else's) is english. However, if we speak in english, we get disciplined. Now this is fair enough, and I abide by these rules most of the time.\n\nHowever, my name is Daniel. Daniel has both a french and english pronunciation. In english it is pronounced exactly how you'd expect, but in french it's pronounced like Danielle. I really hate the french pronunciation of my name, and have therefore asked people do pronounce it as Daniel. This has never been a problem, and all of my other teachers have always been fine with this.\n\nThis year, one of my teachers refuses to pronounce it as Daniel, and refuses to let anyone else pronounce it in the english way. I have asked her multiple times to pronounce my name as Daniel, but she vehemently refuses. I have been disciplined multiple times for this, and have even been sent to see the principal over it. \n\nI don't really care though, my name is Daniel, not Danielle. If she struggled to pronounce it in english, then I'd understand, but english is her first language, so it doesn't apply. She claims that pronouncing my name the way I'd prefer it to be pronounced qualifies as speaking english. I don't see it that way, to me, that's my name, Danielle is not my name. AITA?",

      "description": "Me and my older brother are both in our 30s, married and have 1 kid each. I have a boy under 2 &amp; hes got a girl who is just shy of starting school.\n\nWhen my neice was born, my mother pulled out the baby clothes from when my brother &amp; i were babies, having saved them specifically for her grandbabies to have. (She bought them for my brother and when i came along, i wore them too.) Sister-in-law wanted nothing to do with them for neice. Most are pretty gender neutral, so when my mom was babysitting and neice needed clothes changed, she would put on some of said clothes (a pair of jeans for example) so she could enjoy the outfit for a while, but SIL would come to pick her up and change her out of clothes before heading home, leaving childhood clothes at my moms house. We never asked wtf but theorized that maybe its because they were too masculine looking.\n\nFast forward a few years and i have my son. My mom gingerly asked if i would like the clothes, expecting more heartbreak over it but i was thrilled &amp; said hell yes. My little guy rocks the clothes pretty frequently &amp; grandma always has a huge grin to see him in them.\n\nNow, i found out my brother &amp; SIL are expecting a boy. So I'm stuck with the dilemma of what to do about the baby clothes. I feel im obligated to offer them to her as they WERE me brothers first, but she has a history of refusing to put baby in them. I worry about it because she is definitely a \"gift horse in the mouth\" sort of person and has told us often of recieving a gift that wasnt the \"right brand\" so she sold it and put cash towards the \"right\" one.\n\nMy concern is if i give her the clothes, whether on not they are worn by future nephew, that she will toss or sell them in the end. If she doesnt want them or they didnt have any more kids, i intended to put them away for my grandbabies to inherit.\n\nWIBTA to not offer her the clothes? Or could i offer them and tell her if she doesnt want to keep forever to return them to me?",

      "description": "My boyfriend has an \"X\" that he's a bit secretive about. He doesn't really like talking about X and when I ask him questions it's like pulling teeth and he gets visibly agitated. He hasn't been with X for 5+ years but they still talk frequently via email since she's moved away. Bf and I started dating 2 years ago and he didn't tell X right away about me. X heard it from someone else and asked him and he confirmed it. Then X said she couldn't talk to him anymore and disappeared. Few weeks later X comes back and says she's sorry for get outburst and then that's that. I asked him about his conversations with her a few weeks ago and he read some of them to me. Literally zero messages involve me. X will mention her husband to him but he has never, not once, spoken to her about me. That makes me so uncomfortable. She asks about holiday plans and he says, \"oh a quiet stay in,\" etc, even though we were out all day with each other. I told him that that made me uncomfortable and he said that he will start talking about he but I feel like it's forced and weird. \n\nI guess I don't really understand how I'm feeling right now, but it's just strange. I love my boyfriend but I don't know about this relationship he has with this woman. ",

Then he calls me names because he is losing the debate. It escilates into a fight and I do say some pretty harsh things, as he does. Then he takes those harsh things and trys to twist them and take them out of context so he can look like the victim. Then goes on to slander me with fake screenshots to further is agenda.\n\nHe is now going behind my back and slandering me, and yet again taking things out of context, and slandering me.\n\nI stopped working on his fan game, and decided I sould release the code for the game to help others with the type of project that it is. He is now claming that I have no right to release code to a game that has been cancelled for a month, even though he has no intentions to even do anything with the code.\n\nI am thinking abkut sueing him, but I'm not sure.\n\nThanks for helping me Reddit.",

      "description": "Background: I do not like my Grandmother in Law, she stresses me out, and my daughters freak out when ever she's around. She is a horrible person in my opinion and she has said multiple things that have pissed me off beyond belief and since I shouldn't rip into her I'll leave it at that if you want to know more I do have a post in another subreddit. I maintain contact because I love my Grandfather in law. He unfortunately has cancer and probably only has a few more years left with us.\n\nSo I live on west coast due to my husband being in the US navy. My family and his family live in the midwest. He left deployment about mid November and I came to vist family mid December. My original plan was to stay until mid January, but after spending time my Father in law and his wife invited me and my 9 month twin girls stay with them till hubby came home.\n\nOf course I took it, but we did go back up to get stuff dealt with so I didn't tell her a lie when I said I'd be going back to Washington. I just didn't think she needed to know that I was coming back considering she was heading to her second home down south. Things were great we only told a handful of people of people I was down. The trouble didn't happen till I accidentally sent a picture of my daughters standing for the first time to my husband's aunt. She's a snitch when it comes to my GMIL. She's been over once and somehow remembers everything they own.\n\nShe confronted my Brother in law who did know I was down he said point blank don't tell GMIL or there would be consequences. She seemed to have kept it quiet until a few days ago, when GMIL apparently got angry that I didn't tell her. Cue vist the following day. She randomly breaks down saying how hurt she was that I didn't tell and ask why I didn't say anything. I wanted to tell the truth, I settled with \"I didn't want to cause friction between you and your son, because I know you two don't get along.\"  Than my GMIL went on a exposition (I guess) about how she's trying to mend that bridge and she's trying to accept My mother in law.\n\nI got out of there quickly as I had a cranky little brother with me whose wisdom teeth are coming in. I don't think what I did was wrong, but he tears really stung. I felt like I had killed an innocent animal or something. I guess what I'm trying to say am I the asshole for not wanting to tell her where I was at.",

Me and my ex M31 have been together for 3.5 years. Last januari i broke up with him because we were only bringing out the worst parts of eachother. I know he doesnt have a new place to live in a week so i let him stay till he finds a place. Over the last few months we had our share of fights, and i gave him a deadline of april 1st to move out. Since the deadline he has been acting really well and really takes my feelings and wishes into consideration. So because he couldnt find a place we talked and i moved the deadline to may 1st. \n\nFriday he got a mail with an invitation to look at a place. So tomorrow we will look at the house. He's concerned that the place will be to small (1 bedroom,1 bathroom) and admitted that he actually doesnt want that house. But i really want him to leave my house, so that i can get back to living my life. Its not that i hate him or anything. I promised i would still be friends with him when he moves out. \n\nSo am i the asshole for wanting him to accept this house and move out?",

Anyway essentially this is what happened: \n\nSide note: I'm new to reddit idk what's allowed on here aha\n\nI'm making my boyfriend food while he sits on the couch, I don't mind really If I'm honest I like doing nice things for him he doesn't ask too much of me. Anyway then He asks me to sit with him so I straddle him (not to be sexual just cause it's comfy n I like looking at him he's very cute) And he gets turned on (all good I'm fine with that obviously) so I get into it too and blah blah blah y'know what's happening... he asks me to give him a BJ and  I oblige, so I'm there doing my thing and he starts asking if I put a timer on for the chicken nuggets, I say no and I keep going (keep in mind I've made chicken nuggets so many times I know how long they need to be in there and I have a good sense of time) but he doesn't shut up about the nuggets, I'm cooking him food that he asked for and giving him the blowjob he asked for and he's still demanding stuff from me. So I stop and put my clothes on and go and put the timer on the nuggets and he asks for me to keep going with the BJ and sex or whatever. I say no and express that I'm upset and a little hurt that he cares more about food than the oral he asked me to give him. I felt like I wasn't really being considered all that much, it made me feel like I was doing a bad job at both cooking and oral, which even if I was, it's not like I wasn't trying to do well. After expressing that I was upset I obviously didn't want to have sex anymore, but I also didn't want to cuddle on the couch so I sulked on the floor but out of sight cause I didn't want to make him feel awful, I just needed a minute to get over it.\n\nHe did apologise but it was a backhanded apology where he said something along the lines of  'y'know I was right though' \n\nMaybe I'm not very good at oral but considering he's my first partner and I'm his first too, I feel any flaws I have in the bedroom maybe should be discussed or forgiven. \n\nIdk please help me out here, am I the asshole?

      "title": "WIBTA for questioning my wife's sudden desire to make a drastic career change?",
      "description": "To give this situation some necessary context, here are some details of varying importance.\n\nMy wife is a pharmacist and I work in education. She brings home about $50,000/year and I bring home about $75,000. We're both in our early 30s and have been together for almost ten years now. We're in a comfortable situation financially.\n\nAlright, let's begin with what my wife and I have found to be the bitter truth: she just does not like being a pharmacist. She absolutely hates it. Day after day she'll come home with a new complaint about something a patient or colleague did. One time a patient crumpled up a receipt and told her to throw it away. One time a patient pissed all over the toilet seat. One time a patient licked his fingers before counting money and handed the bills to her.\n\nSo a few months ago, we decided that maybe just dealing with customers kind of sucked. I'd been there and could relate. I asked if she would try working in a hospital (no direct contact with patients), and she agreed to try it out. She has worked there a month now, and the only thing that has changed is the nature of her complaints. She doesn't like her boss and she doesn't like her immediate supervisor. She doesn't like how busy it is there. She actually probably hates it more than her old job because at least in her old pharmacy, she could take a break every so often.\n\nA lot of her complaints are valid. Some of them seem a bit ridiculous--things that have happened to me and didn't even blip on my radar. I think most of it stems from the fact that, again, she really just doesn't like being a pharmacist.\n\nSo at this point we have basically tried all career avenues of pharmacy, and nothing is quite doing it for her. She wants to get into something else. I've repeatedly told her that I would be supportive of her career change if she thought it would make her happier, and she frequently seeks permission from me.\n\nLast Sunday, she suddenly came to me and said she wanted to be an esthetician at a women's spa. This wasn't exactly the most surprising thing in the world, as I know my wife loves beauty products/skincare related fields, but ... an esthetician? I mean absolutely no disrespect to estheticians as I know it's a job that requires a hell of a lot more than what I do at mine, but I can already hear her complaints about future customers. \n\nOf course this is a huge step for my wife. She is horrible at making decisions. I don't want to squash her dreams, as she seems really enthusiastic about this, but I have a really strong feeling that she's making a classic mistake. It's like loving Disneyland so much that you decide to work there, and all of a sudden you're stacking boxes in the back of the gift shop. I feel like her reasons for going into this career are all wrong and that we're going to be back in the same spot in a year, just with a whole lot of new problems and another job thrown into the \"not for me\" pile. And in the time, she will be taking a fairly massive salary hit. I agreed to support us, and I know I can, but the job offer she has is not offering her all that much at all.\n\nI'm honestly inclined to just start bringing up doubts about it, but knowing her personality, she would probably just give up on it. She actually seems excited to work there though and while I don't want to make her feel bad, but I really want to get this off my chest. I'm going against what I promised her, but I have serious doubts about this career choice for her. I'm frankly against the idea and want to tell her but feel like IWBTA. \n\n",

      "description": "My close friend M has (self-diagnosed) bipolar disorder which makes him isolate himself for long periods on end. These episodes happen very suddenly--he'll go from sweet and affectionate to extremely cold and standoffish from one day to the next. Like, we'll hang out as usual, and then the next morning he'll be 'gone': no texts, no calls, nothing. He won't respond to any attempts at reaching out from my side either. Then, whenever the episode is over, he'll bounce back acting like nothing ever happened.\nIt's confusing because during his 'good' times he is very vocal about how much he loves and appreciates me. I adore him as well--I feel a deep connection with him and have always tried to be there for him through whatever happened in his life (family troubles, stressful new job, several moves). \n\nTo illustrate: the latest episode has now been going on since late November, that means no contact at all since then. I texted M the other day asking to meet up because I wanted to talk to him about something that I didn't want to discuss over text, to which he replied (to my surprise) that he could meet on the weekend and he'd keep me updated. Friday comes and goes by, so does Saturday. He then texts me late on Sat asking if I could do Sunday, to which I replied sure, but only in the morning/noon since I had work later in the day. Nothing came after that. Now it's Thursday and I'm somewhat hurt that he didn't even tell me he couldn't make it, especially since I see he is active on social media. I definitely understand that being online doesn't mean feeling well enough to socialize, but I would have really appreciated at least a short heads up. Also, I see him liking lots of tweets about how people with BPD love the ones who stick with them through periods of isolation and how getting mad at them when they ignore you will only make them isolate themselves further. \n\nI understand that he doesn't ignore me because he hates me or whatever, but rather that his illness makes him want to isolate himself. The only real problem I have is that these periods happen without warning, can last very long, and I am expected to just bounce back to 'best friend mode' whenever he does. The current situation has been pretty bad for my own mental health and although it may be selfish, I also feel really upset that I can't help him with whatever he is going through that makes him isolate himself so much. \n\nI am now considering trying to get a hold of M to tell him that I don't want to continue the friendship and explain my reasoning. I thought about taking the current isolation as a hint, so to speak, and just not reply whenever he feels like being my friend again. But that would feel like an asshole move to me. I don't want to hurt him and I wish I could just remain untouched by everything, but it really does take a toll on my mental health and I don't think I am equipped to handle this behavior at the moment. \n\nAITA?

Not a problem I paid up £50 for my gf and me.\n\nThe day of the party arrives and around 4pm at work I get a phone call from my gf saying she feels awful and is have Braxton Hicks contractions for the first time while at work ( in a high pressure job). She has had then nurse look her over and she advised that if things get any worse to consider going to the hospital.  Naturally I explained the situation to my colleagues, told them in couldn't attend the meal and left work early to make sure she was OK.\n\nWe didn't end up going to hospital and a couple of days later she was back to normal. I came into work Monday and found out that the money I had paid had been used to pay for a tip and to settle an outstanding drinks order that no one owned up to having. The restaurant had been informed that I we couldn't attend and didn't prepare the food we ordered. I was expecting to lose £10 in deposit for both our meals but I feel the situation was out of my hands and I shouldn't lose all the money. My boss has asked if anyone minds chipping in and thinks he can get me £20 back which personally think is a bit of a slap in the face.\n\nAITA for wanting all my money back minus a £10 deposit?",

      "description": "Ok, here’s the thing. I am probably the furthest away from a person who would ever consider making someone choose me over their dog but this dog has put so much stress into my life, she was one of the factors in a mental break I had recently. Now one would ask, how could a dog be that bad?? Dogs are the best thing to have ever happened to humans! And I would agree!!! I have two myself, and I work with dogs everyday! But this dog from day one was bouncing off the walls hyper, which is not that bad, she just needs exercise right? Wrong! If she is tired from exercise she gets aggressive, like barking snarling snapping aggressive. She constantly growls at us. She is a bull terrier so it’s not something you can just brush off. I can’t take her for walks because she pulls me down the street. She is resource aggressive so she’ll snap and snarl at my boyfriend, me or my dogs if there is a bone around. I have put up with this because I love my boyfriend and he wants to make it work with the dog because it’s his first and because he knows no one else can handle her but honestly I have no love for her, I couldn’t see myself ever loving her and I wouldn’t want her around children in the future, I don’t trust her as far as I can throw her. She is not a loving dog, she doesn’t show affection all she cares about is food and will kill over it. Today I took her to the dog park and she had been fine up until today, but today she attacked a dog made him bleed I had to drag her out of there everyone was freaking out I was so embarrassed, the other dog was fine but there was blood everywhere. I’m just so tired of her. I can’t see this relationship working with her in my life. She has on more than one occasion tried to attack my boyfriend. I don’t know what to do. Am I being an asshole? Should I make him choose? ",

      "title": "AITA for listening to music \"invisibly\" while in public",
      "description": "I (35M) am hearing impaired, have been since birth. NBD -- with hearing aids I can hear \\*about\\* as well as normal. I do ask people to repeat themselves more than people who aren't hearing impaired do, but I'm 95% sure that people who aren't hearing impaired don't hear as well as they act like they do, and/or are embarrassed to ask people to repeat themselves, etc etc. But that's another topic :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also hugely into music; I've been a musician pretty much my whole life, and one thing I love it listening to music at all times when out in public. Blocking out the outside world. Up until \\~9 months ago, that would be via headphones, which make it obvious to people that I am listening to music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now I have these fancy new hearing aids that basically make me a cyborg. I can stream anything from my phone directly into my hearing aids. I love it; not having to carry around headphones anymore is just so convenient. It does make the hearing aid batteries die much faster, but it's worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich brings us to the problem... I always pause the music when initiating interactions in public. Examples: going into a store (I'll pause the whole time I'm in the store), getting on the bus (in case the driver has something to say as I pass by after swiping). Outside of things like that, I keep it going constantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live in a busy metro area, and random people try to talk to me pretty often. Usually to ask for money or a cigarette (I do smoke). It is a particular pet peeve of mine when strangers ask for a cigarette; culturally (in the US anyway) they're somehow frequently seen as communal property and among friends, I get that. I will give any friend a cigarette anytime. But not a stranger, and even more annoying than being asked 5 - 10 times a day (NOT exaggerating) is that half the time (again NOT exaggerating) the reaction when I say \"no\" is quite negative, with a sense of entitlement that just pisses me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I have noticed in the last 9 months that people have been trying to talk to me and I frequently don't realize it until I am past them and they are yelling. In general, even though I'm annoyed at what they're asking, and I don't feel I owe them a cigarette, I do feel that as humans they deserve a reply rather than being ignored. If I realize someone is talking to me before I pass them, I will generally say \"can't help you\" because I don't know what they're actually saying, as I have the music going. This answers any query and allows me to keep walking. To be \"more\" polite, I'd have to ask them to hold on, pause the music, ask them to repeat themselves, then say \"no.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question is about the scenario where I don't hear them and appear to completely ignore them. In the past, my headphones would at least provide a reason why I \"ignored\" them. Now, there are no headphones so I REALLY look like I'm ignoring them. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - nope, read the post ;)",

      "description": "Apologies for mobile formatting \n\nI’ll try and keep it short. My GF and I have been dating since early September, with us having a previous relationship in June/July. She’s friends with some guy which I’m completely fine with, until I saw her messages with him. He’s quite clearly obsessed with her and often tells her how much he loves her and that ‘she’s his’.  I also see her saying how she loves him too and I absolutely hate it. They both know how much I dislike the guy. I’ll often see them together and the guy hugging her and all. I obviously get upset at this and my GF tells me that if I have a problem with it then I need to get over it. \n\nJust a side note, I have been dating her for longer than they have been friends. I’ll be hanging out with my GF and she’ll just casually ignore me and be texting the guy. We were chilling in my basement watching a movie and he FaceTimes her saying how he’s bored at work and she just goes on with it, clearly uncaring for what I’m doing. One time they got in an argument and she was upset at me saying that she knows that I dislike him and it’s all her and nobody is forcing her to talk to him. I always get attitude when I explain that I don’t like him. She always gets to the same point on me having ‘sides’ although I haven’t talked to the girl in over 2 months. Keep in mind that there was nothing between me and this girl, just that we were good friends and shared the same comedy. I got pissed one day cause we were having a laugh over something she was showing me and a notification pops up and says ‘I didn’t want to do or say anything cause I saw your boyfriend coming’. She doesn’t know why it made me upset, I don’t know the context of it, but seeing any message like that would make anyone upset. I love my GF dearly and I don’t want this to tear us apart but it just has been getting to me lately, I know this sub is against giving advice but I just don’t know anymore.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to bring a friend on a camping trip?",
      "description": "Hi guys - LTL, FTP, my apologies if this is a bit lengthy! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner, myself, and a group of about 5 friends have been planning a winter camping trip since last fall. We have a Facebook group we use for coordinating various camping trips throughout the year, and a FB event was created in January for this trip in particular. Everyone is really excited and has been planning and preparing for months. One of us is flying in from out of state just to go on this trip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have a friend in this group, let's call him Carl, who has not been that involved. Carl went on the previous winter trip a few years ago and was very enthusiastic about the idea of another one when it was brought up during our last camping trip in September. However, Carl has not been very involved in any of the planning or discussion. He's liked a couple posts here and there, but until this week, that was it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause it's winter and we're heading towards the mountains for this trip, the number of cars we have between us that are able to handle snowy conditions is limited to 2 - a friend's SUV, and an AWD sedan my partner and I are borrowing from his parents. Last week, we coordinated rides in the FB group - the SUV is full, and our sedan *might* have one seat open. Carl did not respond to this post in any way, either on FB or otherwise. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to note that Carl does not drive, and lives the furthest away. (The rest of live within a few miles of each other.) I had begun to assume he would no longer be joining us on the trip, since we leave first thing Saturday morning. On Tuesday, he posted in the FB group asking if there was an open seat for him somewhere and if we had reviewed weather forecasts and driving routes. We'd already discussed both of those things last week. My partner commented that we might have an available seat, depending on how much room is left after we load all of our gear and our dog. Carl did not respond until late last night, saying that he'll chip in for gas and doesn't mind riding with our dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty frustrated that Carl has waited until the week of the trip to figure out a way to get there, and I'm not happy that we will have to be the ones to accommodate him. (My partner doesn't really mind one way or another. He's very non-confrontational.) Carl says he's been busy moving and dealing with an injury, which is why he hasn't been very responsive or involved, but this trip has been a long time in the making and he just started moving last week. In my opinion, if he's busy moving and has an injury, a severe-weather camping trip probably isn't the best idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to bring him on this trip? I have no issue with him going in and of itself, but I'm not happy with having to accommodate him at the last minute like this.",

      "description": "This is a very mild AITA and I get that haha. But I'm planning my husband's 40th surprise birthday party. During the day, him and his buddies will go paintballing, then I rented out the dining area of a little bbq eatery nearby that my husband just LOVES for family and friends (~45 people). I was only going to provide cake, water bottles, and maybe a veggie tray, and thought people could order their own food. It's a place where you go up to the counter, order food, and they bring it out to you, not a formal service place at all.\n\n\nWhen I ran this idea by his step-mom, she said it would be incredibly rude to not provide at least 2 full courses for the guests. In my mind, this isn't a kids party, this is for a grown man and I've always paid for my own food at an adult's birthday get-together. I'm also not wanting to spend $400+ to feed everyone (veggie tray, water and cake is about $100), but would very much like everyone to be a part of it. But now it's sitting in my head that if I invite family and friends to a food place around dinnertime if I would be an asshole for not feeding them. What do you think?",

      "description": "I have this friend and he (21M, gonna refer to him as John) had a new relationship. One day, his girlfriend texted me and said that she took my number from John's phone without telling him to give him a surprise birthday party, and she asked me to contact with our mutual friends for the party, since she doesn't know any of his friends yet. I said ok. We were planning the birthday party together, like which place to choose etc. Some days later when I was hanging out with John and showing him something on my phone, his girlfriend texted me something about the birthday. Luckily though, I swiped her message on time, and when John was not able to see my phone's screen, I wrote her that John was here and we can talk later. She didn't believe that he was here, so I took a picture of him and sent it to her. Then she got angry and called John, asking where he is. Oddly enough, he lied and said that he's at home studying. She got super pissed, hang up, and sent the photo I took seconds ago to John, saying she's breaking up. John was brutally shocked that my photo end up at her phone, which he assumed I don't know. He immediately thought I had a secret relationship with his girlfriend. I tried to explain myself and showing the previous messages, but without listening he called her and said something about his cheating hypothesis and how he sure it's true. When he eventually hang up, I showed him the messages and calmed him down. But of course it was too late. So AITA?  ",

If I didn’t want to do the things he wanted, he’d get upset and would not drop it and incessantly call or text until I agreed.\n\nOn the rare occasions I could get him to go for something I’d actually wanna do, he’d decline or end up finding a reason last minute (read: when I was at his house) that he couldn’t go.\n\nThen there was all the small stuff like always giving him cigarettes and borrowing him money that he would pay back whenever it worked for him.\n\nOver the years, there were multiple times I told him I thought it was one sided and that I would appreciate it if he gave a little. At best, he’d try to explain why he couldn’t do specific things.

      "description": "I am just starting my first year at UC with two weeks left in the quarter and my boyfriend says he feels unloved and lonely  because I refuse to make the trip to see him. Every time we text now it always ends up with him berating me and arguing with me because either I do not text him enough or that I won't visit and most conversations more often than not end with both of us feeling like shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live on campus about an hour drive away from my hometown, and he expects me to visit every weekend, which for the first 5 weeks or so, I was. However, my grades were suffering because of it, so I told him that from now on I would not visit him if I had a midterm the next week so that I could use the weekend to study and he agreed. Possibly unrelated, but I can't drive yet and it's a $25 Amtrak ride there one way and reserving a spot on a shuttle which is first come first serve is dubious at best that I will get a seat since they sell out quickly, so it is a hassle in general for me to visit to begin with. Why doesn't he just drive to see me to visit for a day? Well his excuse is that he can't afford gas, what with him deciding to buy a fuel inefficient car for its looks and whatnot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs it turns out, in the last two weeks of the quarter I have 3 homework assignments including a quiz due on Monday, a midterm on Thursday, and my finals start next week on Wednesday. So of course, I told him that I would not be able to visit until after two weeks when finals are over, even though I didn't visit last weekend because I had a midterm last week too. He is very upset that I have made this decision, and he is constantly telling me how I don't love him and making me feel severely depressed because he doesn't understand that I need to be on campus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom his perspective, he is upset that I want to use the weekend to study instead of visiting him because I also go to club events and study groups during the week, as well as spending time with my friends when I go to the dining commons in the evening. So his logic is that since I spend time with other people during the week, I should be spending time on the weekends with him. He claims that I neglect him when I see my friends because I'm not constantly on my phone texting him (but from my view, why would I even want to talk to him when it always just makes me feel like shit).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I want to spend my last 2 weekends studying for midterms and finals but my boyfriend feels neglected because that will mean that I won't see him for 3 weeks. May be some jealousy and obsession going on, or possible neglect, or both depending on who the asshole is, if any. It is a hassle for me to visit because I can't drive, he doesn't want to visit because he can't afford it. He feels neglected because I don't text him enough as he would like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my view: how does he expect me to keep visiting him when I need to be here working and studying, is it not important that I focus on school? How can he put his own needs before mine, I'm only in college once I need to be here and now, I don't understand. Is he right to keep calling me the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This girl had been trying to be friends with me for the whole first year and when I tried to keep things professional she’d say stuff like “do you think I’m not cool enough to be your friend” fast forward to months later, we become friends and basically confidantes until I end up dating one of her long term best friends (she set me up and I didn’t know until a month after we started dating) \n\nThings didn’t go so well - he turned out to be abusive and had a completely different story as to why and what the break up was. Turns out she also knew that this person had done underlined issues beforehand that she didn’t tell me about even though I asked her when she was giving him my number. \n\nThing is, I had a conversation with this friend and told her that I didn’t want to get in between their friendship cause she seemed to be genuinely bothered by some of the things he did. She says they’ve been friends for a lifetime but she was hoping the whole thing didn’t ruin her friendship with me instead. I say absolutely not. \n\nI was going through a very hard time after the whole thing and she was very dismissive of my feelings and practically told me she never wanted to talk about it every time I told her I needed a friend (she was the only close friend I had in this new area) she claimed that it felt like I was blaming her and I said I don’t understand why she would think that. I was hurting and just needed someone there for me. Nothing changed. \n\nA month later I find out that she was listening to the guy’s side of the story and when I asked her to help with something I needed from him that he was refusing to give back, she said he’d never do something like that. I’m sure he gave it back to you right? Thing is, I’m good friends with her spouse but I’m still able to listen to both their relationship issues and be there for them without picking a side. She couldn’t do that for me and in the end, it seemed like she obviously picked a side without needing to. \n\nShe still tries to come to me with her problems while at work or just tries to be friendly but I try to smile and just walk away. I even avoid eye contact. The other day, I overheard her telling our other co worker and she told her to keep her distance. I’m sure she’s a good friend she just wasn’t one to me and I don’t think explaining myself to such a closed minded person would make a difference.\n\nAm I wrong? ",

      "description": "So I learned a few months ago that my cousin is giving her child the same middle name as me. Me and the baby are both girls and my middle name isn't a very feminine name to begin with, it's technically a unisex name but rarely it is given to girls. I found this out from my grandma, who explained she is matching her child's initials with her step children's, which is understandable but my cousin never once asked me about it. (Nor has she told me the baby's middle name) It's not a coincidence because she's even using the same spelling as my middle name and she knows my middle name because all of my social media's (that I have her on) uses my full name. \nMe and this cousin are not very close, we have gotten into arguments quite a few times when I was a kid and she was a teenager.  We never speak to each other, even at family events. This cousin also has a history of snubbing the family when we don't meet her standards. \nI haven't confronted her about this and don't really plan to but am an asshole for being bothered about this?  It's technically not a big deal but it really bothers me. ",

      "description": "We have been married for a long time, married really young, and our relationship is getting colder by the day because finally I made a stance on something that has been bothering me since the beginning. \n\nSay, I'm cleaning the bathroom and at the end of 3 hours work (we have 4 of them), she would say, \"you didn't even change the drawer liners\" (or something that is equally random to me). She didn't mention it before  . She could tell \"change the drawer liner\" and I would have been still fine with it, no \"please\" needed. But that's all she will say, nothing more or less. and when I complain she basically says it means the same thing, you still have to do it, so deal with it. \n\nAnother example would be, \"why didn't you put my phone on charge \" you never  charge mine, I would if you tell me to, but, how you tell me matters a lot to me.\n\nI rage with anger at this, but don't show it. What I'm trying to find out is, this is normal way of talking among couples? Am I being too sensitive for no reason? I never talk to her or anyone this way and believe I deserve the same, specifically since I don't see her talking to anyone else this way.

He has had work but its only been part time so some weeks he’d bring in a thousand and other weeks maybe four hundred. There has been weeks where he hasn’t had any pay at all and I’ve had to pay off things like our bills in part payments as well as pay rent and food and so on, since his pay usually goes to insurances and his car repayment. \n\nUsually I remain quiet but its very hard to not become passive aggressive and annoyed when I see him doing little around the house and only applying for jobs here. In all he’s applied to maybe 6-8 jobs. It’s also put a spanner in the works for our dream which is to buy property in the middle of nowhere and live like hippies, living off the land. I’ve also had to put studying on the back burner because of this. \n\nWell a couple of nights ago I was at my wits end and spoke to him about it and he got upset because he has depression and anxiety and says he can’t find the motivation to do so and that I shouldn’t complain because he gets paid more than I do working 3 days a week which is true...\n\nSo AITA for getting frustrated at my SO.

He claims that it is my fault that he is getting drunk and lead him towards making bad choices. It is important to note that once this guy is even a little tipsy he will begin start to binge drink with everyone ON HIS OWN ACCORD without me even being there. What he is trying to say I am the one who get him to that tipsy point where he begins to make bad decisions. I do get excited when it comes to drinking but I never force the booze down his throat. What I mean by excited is that I do hand the man drinks and the occasional \"drink that Sh\\*\\*T boy\". I guess am I the asshole here? I feel like it should not be my fault that once he gets a little drunk he goes crazy or the fact that I even remotely try to have a drink with the guy it all goes to sh\\*\\*t.

      "description": "My (23m) girlfriend (23f) will occasionally get way too drunk. Its not a crazy amount of times, maybe once or twice a month max. It can get to the point where she cant walk by herself and I have to support a lot of her weight or keep her going in a straight line. Often it triggers some anxiety issues in her and she'll stay up all night hyperventilating while I try to console her. \n\nNone of this would be a big deal if it happened every once in a while but its fairly common, and its only ever been me as the too drunk one like once. \n\nLast weekend I went to a bar with my friends and the girls were gonna get ready together and meet us there. An hour in I'm a little drunk and I get a call from her, cant hear anything. She's muted the call. I tell her she muted it and she hangs up. She calls two more times and its muted every time. A few minutes later she gets there, completely plastered. Her friends kind of hand her off to me and i leave my friend group to help her go sit down (cant walk by herself). I'm visibly annoyed, probably more than I should have been and just tolerate her talking for a bit, very drunk rambling giggling kind of stuff. I'm nodding and smiling but not interested and still annoyed and she asks whats wrong. I tell her \"this is not fun for me\" and a huge fight ensues. My side: she isnt thinking about how her actions affect me or behaving responsibly and this has happened multiple times. Her side: I'm embarassed of her and she knows how to take care of herself.\n\nWe fight, go home and talk it out and both apologize, definitely things i did i handled wrong. \n\nThe next morning she realizes she lost her debit card and her glasses that night. She also fell going down stairs twice and has two enormous bruises.\n\nWe're texting about it that day and both apologizing again but the way she is talking I was very much in the wrong for being embarassed of her and need to take a step back about her decisions. She apologizes for how she reacted to things but not for getting so drunk she cant walk, losing important things, and injuring herself. I know she isnt \"my responsibilty\" but im obviously going to take steps to make sure she is safe and can stay on her feet. It feels like she doesnt realize her decisions affect me too. \n\nLike I said, this wouldnt be an issue if it wasnt a fairly common, one-sided occurance. Am I the asshole for getting annoyed?",

      "description": "It’s the start of junior year, and I see the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen, and I immediately am head over heals for her smile, her voice, her everything. Long story short I pursued it and we’ve been dating six months. Then recently I’ve been going through a rough point with my other friends and just stuff in my life has been getting me down. I tend to be very internal, and always pretty positive, so my real feelings don’t always show. But She told me that I hadn’t been myself over text lately and that she felt neglected, that she had “been upset with me”. I explained that it wasn’t intentional and I completely opened up about all that I’m struggling with, but her response killed me. She essentially blew it off, saying: “I hope all that works out, but don’t forget about me” and “sorry I’m another thing to juggle but if you can’t juggle me I can’t be with you”\n\nNearly instantly all my feelings for her went away, and I felt like I could be anyone and she wouldn’t know the difference. I’m just a guy who juggles her and she is willing to move on if I start to struggle. After six months this was a major kick in the teeth but when I thought about it, it aligned with a lot of her other actions too. There’s a lot to that but the root of it is that I take a lot of hits to my pride and to my own happiness in order to make her happier, but when I really thought about it, I couldn’t think of a time when she’s done the same for me. I think she enjoys what comes with having a partner, but isn’t willing to make any sacrifices for my sake. \n\nIt’s important to understand that I am not a complainer. I would never expect or ask for someone to confess all my problems to, but I feel like I also shouldn’t be scolded for having a down point in my life. But after all that she says I’m her boy and she loves me. That’s where my problem comes in.\n\nI’m sorry for rambling but I think context is pretty important. I know spilling to strangers on Reddit probably isn’t the best move, but I just want a completely unbiased second opinion or two. I’m also aware that since this is all coming from me it’s probably biased, but I’ve done my best to present the truth.\n\nSummary: My girlfriend’s expectations of me are too high and I can’t see us going on for very long term because I just can’t be everything she wants. I’ve tried sticking it out for a while, but I want to break up with her. \n\nAm I the asshole for possibly breaking her heart out of self interest?\n",

      "description": "a few things to know before we start this: firstly, it's important to know that my girlfriend has been abused before in a past relationship, which was a few years ago. second, we have had sex before, but pretty rarely (she has never complained before afterwards). third, we've known each other for almost 10 years. lastly, i'm female, her abuser was male.\n\nmy girlfriend isn't asexual, but sex repulsed at times because of past abuse. and i'm ok with just cuddling and kissing, that's totally fine by me. i would never force her into anything she didn't want.\n\nthe other day she practically jumped on me, started touching me etc etc. we did it, showered together, cuddled, all that jazz. it is important to note that i asked her repeatedly throughout if she was okay with what i was doing, if she felt alright and stuff like that.\n\na few hours later however (she'd gone home afterwards), she calls me up and starts shouting at me why i had let her do that, when i knew she felt uncomfortable with sex, and that i should've known she was triggering herself purposefully by sleeping with me. i got mad at her and told her i had no way of knowing what she was thinking. i had asked her multiple times if she was alright, to which she had said yes, as i have mentioned before. had she said 'no' at any point, i would have stopped immediately.\n\nso, am i the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  so, here's an update for those who care:  \n\n\nwhen i spoke to her again after about a week, she surprisingly still stuck with her argument that 'i should have known'. i did not expect this. i thought she would have snapped out of it by now. she did say she was being harsh when she called me on the phone and blamed me for everything, and she apologised for it, but she also said at the core she thinks she's in the right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nneedless to say, that's a pretty big dealbreaker. we've all established that her actions were not okay, and she was wrong. very wrong, in fact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwe argued for a bit and then decided it would be for the best to take a break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'm dissapointed in her, honestly. i thought she was smarter than this. i don't know what kind of bubble she's in, but if she's going to stay there, our relationship is over. i did everything i could have possible done to ensure her comfort, but it's not enough for her, apparently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni will do whatever i have to to take care of myself, my own problems, before i play anybody elses therapist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks everyone for the support.",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHORT VERSION**: Guy likes me. I am not interested in him. Give him the cold shoulder instead of talking things through. AITA?\n\n**The whole story, below**:\n\nThis summer I was traveling in pursuit of my hobby, let's say underwater basketweaving. I went on a trip to a country where a lot of this happens and joined a group tour with about 40 other people. One of those people was \"Allen\", a man about 20 years older than me (I am female, mid-forties, single).\n\nEveryone in the group is friendly and we all get along since we share a common interest and are traveling together, sharing meals, activities, etc. One night getting off the bus, I am weirdly dizzy and off balance (thanks, jet lag) and worried about being able to walk to the hotel safely, so I explain my situation to Allen and ask him for support. He takes my arm and \"escorts\" me back to the hotel, and I am grateful and thank him. He asks me if I want to go out for a drink and I say no (that should have been a red flag for me - why was he inviting me for a drink when I was already so messed up, I could barely walk in a straight line?!). Anyway, the next day we sit on the bus together, and at first we're sort of becoming travel buddies and that seems cool. But then after a day or two of this I realize he's thinking more than friends, and I'm not interested in him that way. In fact I'm not even interested in being \"just friends\" because I just don't like him at all.\n\nWell, he's super interested in me and always right there, sitting next to me at meals, following me around when we're at museums, etc. He is really pushy, not reading any signals, and I am not happy. So I'm laying awake in my little hotel room trying to figure out how to deal with him in a direct but polite way. How to use my big girl words. And then I'm like fuck it, I am on vacation, I am not wasting my mental energy on figuring out how to be nice about \"breaking up\" with this guy. So instead of talking things through, I just give him the cold shoulder starting the next morning. I no longer talk to him, avoid him, and make sure I'm always seated with other people around me, so there's no spot for him near me.\n\nHe seems to get the point and goes so far to apologize to me for pushing too much and he realizes I'm not into him. It seemed really sincere and insightful. After that I'm willing to be polite and talk to him again, but he apparently misreads that and thinks I'm into him. So I go back to ignoring/avoiding him. The trip ends; everyone goes home.\n\nAt home he starts emailing me, and maybe a Facebook request. All of which I ignore. Including emails asking why I am not replying to him. \n\nThat was several months ago. I just saw him recently at a weekend event. He kind of joined a conversation I was having with someone else, and then he was like \"Oh, are you talking to me now\" and I sort of said meh, shrugged my shoulders and quit talking to him. He did manage to keep his distance after that.\n\nOk, so I feel like I have been SO RUDE to this guy. AITA? And if I am the asshole, why doesn't this guy say \"damn, she is an asshole, I don't want anything to do with her\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I recently moved in with a wonderful guy (both mid 20s) and things are going great. We moved into a new place together and he brought his collection of art that he planned to hang up in the new place. They are all lovely but two or three of them were painted by his ex gf. This made me feel uncomfortable because they made me think of her everytime I looked at them. I told him how I felt and he said that he wasn't keeping them for any emotional reason like sentimental value, he just likes having art. But he understood how I felt and got rid of them (I think he gave them away) because he didn't want to cause any problems between us. This was a while ago and it hasn't come up again. I am an (amateur) artist too so I've been painting new peices for our house to replace the old ones. \nIt was hardly a fight but it has been weighing on me. Was I unreasonable to ask that he get rid of those peices? I'm worried that I'm just being petty and jealous but I really disliked being reminded of his past relationship every time I went into my living room. What do you think?",

      "description": "February 2, I 27m left everything behind in Sweden. I moved across the whole Euroasian continent to South Korea, where I now work as one of the higher ups of a large korean company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past decade I've been saving about 50% of the money, I've made. Which means after I got out of univesity, I had the money to buy a house, a nice car, etc. The only people who knew I had saved a lot of money, was my girlfriend and my abusive parents and of course my siblings. From the age of 13 I started to get intrested in south korean culture, my parents hired tutors to learn the language, and after a few hardworking years, I became fluent in the language. Life in Sweden for me was miserable, my parents were abusive, but supportive for my ambitions. They'd punish me if I got a grade lower than A, they'd control all aspects of my life. Which made me hate them, they are manipulative sociopaths. They controlled everything in my life. All up, until the age of 20 when I moved away to univeristy. There I met my ex-girlfriend. During that time, I studied a lot, my dream was to move to south korea. I had a lot of friends, but nothing meant more to me than achieve my dreams. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished univeristy, last summer. I almost found a job instantly, I moved back to my parents house, until I could find a aparment. It's during this time, I began speaking to this south korean company, through work connections. The small firm I worked for in Sweden, had a lot of shares, bought by the south korean company. Which meant that, we were partially owned by them, and my boss did a lot of affairs with the larger company. It's here where I get in contact with the co-owner of the south korean company, and he had seen my work. And wanted me to come to south korea for a interview, I went.  \n\nWhen I came back to Sweden, they offered me the super high paying position, in the company. I of course accepted in secret. They told me, they'd pay for the flights and offer me suitable housing. It was a dream come true for me. This was in january. \n\nWhen I told my gf I was breaking up with her,  she started crying. And asked why, I didn't say any reasons. All I knew was that I had a new life waiting for me, on the otherside of the world. A few days later, after I'd packed my things. Said up my position at my job in sweden, and told my parents that I was going on a work trip. I only needed little clothing with me to south korea anyway.  When I got to south korea, packed my things. Deleted all my social media, blocked all my family, friends, numbers. Changed mine. AITA for doing this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: Moved to south korea from sweden, told no one about it. Blocked all people I knew in Sweden.",

      "description": "So, last friday I found out that my best friend was beaten really, really severely by her abusive ex. I figured something like this had happened, since I know the fucking asshole, but nobody would tell me what happened. If this was something that was kept secret I would understand, but everybody knew before me, even people that barely know her or anything about the situation. It all seemed to deliberate, since I could tell that something was going on, I heard the whispers and noticed the looks they gave each other. \n\nIt seemed I was the only one locked out of the loop, despite her being my closest friend in the world. Anyway, me, her and a couple of friends got wasted a few days back and she dropped the bomb when I saw her body was covered in bruises. I had already pieced it together a few days before, but just hearing this was like a fucking nuke. I completely froze up, the only thing I remember was that everyone seemed really scared, and that I promised to murder him if I ever saw him again. Eventually I got so angry that I went home, and eventually fell asleep, and when I wanted more details the next day, nobody would tell me anything, so I'm pretending to not remember anything, since they obviously were afraid of my reaction.\n\nAm I the asshole for being upset that nobody told me, even though pretty much everyone even tangentially related to our friend group were told about this? I feel so fucking powerless, I didn't know what had happened, so I couldn't be there for her, and to be honest I feel guilty that I got so angry, even if it was legitimate, since I suspect that they didn't tell me this because they were afraid I would react like I did.",

      "description": "not a shitpost or whatever this is something im actually worried about and i cant ask my friends because im scared of being unfriended as transphobic\n\nanyway i have a friend who is trans and shes okay shes not a great friend but nevertheless she is my friend and i do care about her\n\nthe problem that i have with her and her behavior is that from my point of view, she seems to be idolizing/sexualizing being a girl or what it is to be and present as a girl. In our group game of DnD she has stated that her character is either in lingerie or naked, which is weird but alright. This persists however as she constantly is obsessing over lingerie, she has gone out with me multiple times to buy thongs, lacy underwear etc. She's even sent a few posts about this kind of stuff to our group chat. (talking about lingerie, wishing she had an outfit in a picture, looking as cute as a girl in a picture etc.)  I get she just wants to be seen and treated as a girl but i don't think she really understands what that means. It seems like (from my perspective) that being a girl to her is just being sexy or cute, and there isnt much else about it that shes spoken on.\n\nTo give some explanation about her behavior, she is a very awkward and shy girl, there are some things about social interaction that she really does not understand but her intentions seem to be well intentioned. She does not realize often that what she sometimes is not within normal social realms, and I (and i don't have a full grasp on social behavior either) have to point it out to her. \n\nAm I the asshole for thinking this, and would I be the asshole if I pointed it out to her?",

      "description": "So my brother called me up about a week ago asking me to watch his kid. I explained that I was Busy with homework and don't have the time to take care of an 18 month old, and point out that his extremely responsible 14 year old can baby sit and she would appritate the money probably more then I would. Note that he should know I'd charge him since I've been excepting jobs recently from stranger's lately for $10 an hour (2 less then local minimum wage), I didn't plan on charging him the same as I would a stranger, but the notion of him having to pay made him flip. I told him again eather way I have enuf homework that I don't have the extra time to watch his kid let alone a stranger's wich he had brought up in his rant. \nHe explains how I've been gouging him for money for months now. He brings up that I had charged him for a Polaroid photo around Christmas, note I charged haft the price for the film and only charged because he insisted on taking a photo I loved and wanted for my personal album, and I explained this to him when that issue had originally happened. (I'll admit in that one I was being a bit of an asshole)\nI'm a college student with 2 learning disabilities and can't cut into my study time especially if I'm going to pay for classes just to fill in the gaps my high school left me with. He now believes I don't care about family I guess.\nTL:DR : I can't babysit my brothers kid because of my study's so according to him im an asshole of a little sister. Also he's being a bit of a choosing begger, in my opinion.\nPS. my brother is about 20 years older then me\n",

      "description": "I know this sounds really bad, but hear me out.\n\nI've been friends with this girl, we'll call her Violet, for about a year and a half now. She's a pretty cool person, we share a few similar interests, and she participates in the plays and musicals along with me. \n\nNow, Violet has clinical depression. I'm not blaming her for that. I don't know if she's in counseling or if she takes medication. I've always tried to be a friend for her to talk to, but we aren't the best of friends so I know she has her reservations. She's told me she has self harmed before and also had thoughts of ending her life, as well as a huge amount of self esteem issues. \n\nThis is where the problem comes in.\n\nFor a while, she always would moan and groan about her depression, and how nobody likes her and all of that, but my friends and I would always tell her otherwise. However, this has been going on for the entire time that I've known her, and I know I'm not the only one tired of her complaining that nobody likes her.\n\nSo, a few other friends of Violet's has asked her to be honest when talking with them, (she might have a problem with lying as well), but she took it as they want her to be honest about herself. Yesterday, while we were all getting on our makeup and costumes, she must've gotten upset at this guy who was talking to her, and started yelling loudly about how nobody cares about her and how we asked her to be honest. Even the director noticed, but a friend got her to leave and I asked the guy to just stop giving her something to react to.\n\nIt completely ruined the mood and there was an eerie silence as everyone continued to finish getting ready, but it got back to normal soon after.\n\nThis has become a regular occurrence, and usually we try to laugh it off when she's upset about herself, but it's been continuing so much.\n\nWould I be the ass if I asked her to stop bringing it up when everyone is having a good time?",

My mum had a risk of death initially however after her surgery she is better.\n\nSo the story is; mum's incident resulted in her having a life saving surgery however will leave her paralyzed waist down. (Violent stuff removed so it's short)\n\nSo the doctors told us that the something has gone through her spine. This means she is very likely to NEVER walk again. Now I am more than fucking grateful that's she is alive so so so fucking happy. However, since she will no longer be able to walk I and close family have to look after her. Obviously. \n\nI am 20 and were planning to go to University at a different city, move abroad after graduation and live my life there. After this incident I don't think I can do either of those things. I have to change my university. My social life will take a hit and I'll probably be depressed for a while. Hence me saying my life will be partially ruined because I will now have to be with her (almost) at all times.\n\nNow I love my mum to bits however I just think my life will never be the same because of what happened. I will never ever blame her for this, she means the world to me. I've already accepted that things will have to change for the worse now and I have to live with it.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking ahead too much and saying my life is ruined?",

      "description": "This is a long one, and my first post. Hopefully I’m following all the conventions for this subreddit. \n\nOur relationship took a turn to the worse when I was 16. I came out as transgender to her. She didn’t take it well. The first few months were tough. She mocked me, yelled at me at any moment, and refused to acknowledge me.\n\nShe told all my friends’ parents about me coming out, and my whole family. The dad of my best friend at the time, J, stopped letting me hang out with J. I even caught her talking to her coworkers about me being trans on the phone. Keep in mind, I asked her to tell no one. When I heard her telling her coworker I recorded it and confronted her. \n\nShe yelled at me for being awful and selfish, not letting her have her support network to deal with this.  \n\nThings got worse when I told her about some of the mental health stuff I was going through. I’m [a multiple/plural](https://solipsistful.weebly.com/faq.html). There’s just a lot of people in my head and we all just live together. I’d come a long way since when it first started when I was 14. I was functional and successful, I’m talking straight A’s and never got in trouble. \n\nShe took it poorly. Telling her is the biggest regret of my life. She made me see a psychiatrist and after talking to me for 15 minutes he prescribed me risperdal, a powerful antipsychotic. She was hoping it would cure my trans-ness I think. My mom told me I was hurting my family and friends, and that I should do it for them.\n\nFirstly, risperdal got rid of everyone else in our plurality. They’re gone forever. It also made me incredibly depressed. I almost died. I started failing at school. I begged my mom to take me off them. I even pretended to not be trans for a bit. \n\nA month after they took me off the risperdal, my mom decided to try to put me in a mental hospital. She convinced my family I needed help and they turned my yearly physical into an intervention.\n\nAt this point, the affects of the risperdal on my mood were gone. So I argued I didn’t need to go. She said my friends talked to my mom about how they were worried about me. That I was being a burden to my friends. I found this to be a lie later, but at the time I bought it and agreed to go.\n\nWhen I graduated high school and moved away to college, I started to realize how toxic and manipulative she is. I also starting going to therapy again, this time for my issues with her.\n\nBut despite me asking, she would not apologize for what happened. She said she’d do it all again and doesn’t have any regrets.\n\nThe thing is, she did all that stuff out of a twisted form of love. She was doing what she thought would be best for me. She’s still that woman who raised me and my sister on $18k. But she’s hurt me a lot.",

      "description": "To preface: my girlfriend and I have been dating about 6 months. I’ve only seen her incredibly drunk twice, last time being this past weekend. She and her friends had planned a 3 day “spring break” since all of their school schedules had spring break on different dates. I hadn’t met her friends as they lived in her hometown and I met up with her on the third day, 2 hours away from where we stay for school and drove her back the next day.\n\nWe have a healthy sex life, IMO. Have it 4-7 times a week.\n\nAnyways, I was excited to meet her friends and she told me we were all going to go to a club after knocking back a couple drinks. Awesome. I was happy to attend.\n\nWhen I leave, they’re sober. About half an hour til I’m there, and she tells me they’re all way too drunk to still go out, and want to just stay in. She’s slurring her words and says she drank an entire bottle of champagne. I was a little annoyed that she had gotten that drunk right before I arrived, but I thought it’s her weekend I’m doing this for her, it’s all good. \n\nFirst thing she says when I walk in is to go to the bathroom w her. I do and she asks if we’re gonna have sex tonight. I’m like, lol what? I haven’t even met ur friends yet I’m trying to meet them. I don’t know. \n\nThen I meet them all, it’s a good time. We get along well. However, while we’re sitting in a circle, and she’s on my lap, any time I move my hands off of being around her she’s like “feldevourer, come a back!” And moves them back around her. Over the course of about 4 hours I go outside with 2 of her friends and we start talking. She comes out after about 15 min and says “hey can I have my boyfriend back please”. I start getting rather annoyed as I also wanted to spend time with her friends.\n\nWe go back inside and sit in the circle again. Over the next hour she repeatedly (5-6 times) tries to stick her hand in my pants slyly, but we’re in a group of people. I keep telling her to stop and she does it again like 10 minutes later. Eventually I grab her hand and say fucking quit. She does it again and I get up and sit on the floor. For a little while after that she throws a hissy fit saying I won’t pay attention to her. Before we go to bed she Asks again if I wanna have sex. Where any inclination for me to want to may have been, it was gone now. I said no not anymore and we went to bed.\n\nThe next morning we both acted like nothing was up but it’s been a couple days and I brought it up to her again. I called her too needy sexually when she’s super drunk and that I wasn’t really comfortable. She didn’t really comment at all.\n\nShe isn’t like that sober, but I want to know if I’m being overdramatic. So AITA?\n",

      "description": "It'll be a long and nuanced post, I'll try to lay all the information as impartially as possible. English is my seocnd language, so excuse me for possible mistakes. TL;DR at the end.\n\nI'am a physician, born and raised in a big brazilian city (1.8 million people). After my graduation I decided to go work in Germany and landed a job a a big Hospital in a small city (30.000 inhabitants). Since I was a foreigner I started with a temporary limited work permit and had to take some examinations to get the full recognition, in the meantime I worked in this Hospital (I'll call this one Purgatory). \n\nBecause of the limitations of my work permit I could only take THE WORST shifts, and for like ten months I had to work 10-12 hours a day from monday until saturday, often also sunday, and at the same time study for my german and medical examinations. I've told at the Purgatory that it was inhuman and that I needed a break to breath and learn sometimes, they always pretended to care but a few weeks later everything went back to how it was. I'm not gonna lie, I've really learned a lot in those circunstances and developed myself fast. Soon I became a key player of the department.\n\nIn my second month, when I was struggling with a different culture and learning a third language, I was once alone at the monitoring station (one step before an ICU) and called a superior for help because of a minor problem. He came and wsa furious at me because I couldn't solve that alone, said that I was lazy and that I only wanted to take money from Germany (note: he is greek) and that I was not interested in learning. Because of that I cried, and we were in front of a patient. After I cried he was ashamed and apologized.\n\nBecause of my restricted work permit I was not allowed working overtime, but I did it anyway because if I didn't I'd lose the job; i did overtime but those hours were erased from the system so the Hospital would not get in trouble.\n\nFast forward, I finally took my last examination and barely made it, but in the end I got the recognition. In the same month I asked only for the best shifts so I could take some well deserved rest and I recieved a huge backleash from the shift planner; he said that it was not the department's fault that it took so long for me to get an apponitment for my examinations and it would be unfair against the others if I took only the best shifts for a month. I resigned with a balanced shift schedule. But then another small problem happend in the burocratic process and my recognition came a week later. As an answer the boss made me go through another month of the worst shifts because back then they couldn't predict when my recognition would come.\n\nA few weeks after recieving my recognition the same greek superior said the same mean things to an assistent that was a good friend of mine. I started having a reasonable working schedule and became an important part of the team because I had a very good development. The department was struggling to find good assistents. \n\nI was dissapointed of beind mistreated for so long, became furious for knowing that my friend heard the same mean things as me and wanted to go to a better Hospital where I could learn more and develop myself more. I sent one single curriculum to a good german University Hospital (I'll call this hospital Earth), where I could also take part on research and better myself even more as a doctor.\n\nI was called for the interview, but as I was underway they cancelled and re-schedule for the next week. When I got home that day I was so upset that I sent three more curricula to the three best german University Hospitals.\n\nOne week gone by and I went for the interview on Earth. I came punctually and they called me 30-45 minutes later. They've said that I made a very good impression, and the boss there made me promise that, if they called me, I would go work there, but he didn't promised me a job on the spot. He would call me at the end of the week after that round of interviews. The promised day came and he didn't call me, then another day, and another, and another. the whole time I've sent emails and called the secretary to try to find something out. Four days later I just wrote to the secretary: \"look, I don't care if I landed the job of not, just please tell me, I don't need a feedback from the boss himself\". The next day the secretary called me and said that I was chosen. \n\nI was very happy and asked for demission on Purgatory. When I spoke to Purgatory's boss, he said he knew already that I was going because Earth had called him. Purgatory's boss said that I was ungrateful after they helped me going to Germany and that I was a small human being for blindsiding him, looking for a job before talking to him in a situation where the department was having difficulties finding good assistents.\n\nAfter asking for demission I tried to call Earth again to negotiate when should I begin working on Earth. I have a wife at home that spends her whole day taking care of our baby that's now 8 months old. Then Earth said that I shouldn't ask for demission yet, they would call me if I landed the job. \"WELL THANKS ASSHOLE IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE!!!!!!!\" I thought.\n\nSo I standed in the cold without a job from Feb. 2019 onwards and without concrete offer from the ones that promised me a job. I've made what every bread winner of a household would do: started spending every single second of my free time looking for work. Then I suddenly recieved an email from the 2nd best University Hospital from Germany (I'll call it Heaven) inviting me for an Interview at the beginning from January 19. In the meantime Earth contacted me back saying that I landed the job (for the 2nd time...), but they could only give me a contract after middle January.\n\nI went to the interview on Heaven, they were on schedule and treated me very well. I clarified that my wife wanted to study medicine in the future, the boss immediatly called the department for student admission (in front of me) and asked if my wife would get a facilitated access to the university. I also said that I teoretically had an offer at Earth and that I promissed going there, but I was unsatisfied with how the process took part, but I was torn between going to Heaven of keeping my promisse with Earth.\nThe boss on Heaven said that he wanted me working for him and he didn't mind, he wouldn'r think less of me.\n\nHeaven took me for a tour in the hospital, they made me talk with an assistent without superiors nearby, she said that the work there was very satisfying and the superiors were kind. Like I said, it is the second best Uni-Hospital of germany.\n\nThen they've sent me back to talk to Heaven's boss again. He said that he already had decided for me, and that I could start rigth on Feb 2019. He also said that he didn't want to pressure me and gave me a day to think about where I'd like to work. He added that I I could wait until the process was done before backing off from Earth.\n\nOn the next day I emailed Heaven's boss saying that I decided myself for Heaven. He immediatly started sending emails to the Human resources and to organize a temporary apartment for me. I've recied copies of the internal emails the entire process, and the formalities are already done and I'll be recieving the contract in my mail.\n\nBut I can't help but feel guilty about both Purgatory and Earth. Purgatory gave me a job and there I developed myself a lot. I've broke a promess with Earth\nAm I the Asshole for going to Heaven?\n\nTL;DR: I'm a brazillian physician that started working in Germany with a temporary and limited work permit in a Hospital that I'll call Purgatory. In Purgatory I developed myself but was badly mistreated along the months required to get my complete revalidation. After revalidation I've landed a job in a way better Hospital (Earth) where they made me promisse that I would work there if called (but didn't give me the job on the spot). Earth backed off AFTER I asked for demition in Purgatory and treted me poorly in the process by not answering my calls and emails and not honing scheduled appointments. Fearing for the financial security of my family (my -for now- stay at home wife and 8 months old baby) I've resumed looking for jobs. In the meantime Earth called me back saying that I've been chosen, after I've got invited to some other interviews. I landed a job in the second best University Hospital of Germany (I'll call it Heaven), they liked me and gave me the job on the spot, and gave me a lot of reassurance and peace of mind along the way and treated me very kindly. I decided that I want to work on Heaven but will only back off from Earth after signing my contract with Heaven.\n\nAm I the Asshole for going to Heaven?",

      "description": "UPDATE: I talked to my grandpa and hes doing everything he can to keep my shithead father away. Called my grandmother this morning, however, and she's having lunch with my father. She doesn't know how to work speakerphone so she just repeated everything I said, including the time and date of our Christmas. I'm bringing my boyfriend with me and my brother isn't coming. If he shows up i'm either gonna explode or say nothing and just leave. I kinda wanna blow up at him but I think leaving without a word would be better for my relationship with my grandfather. \nA little background: I (20F) am in college, and my paternal grandparents have been helping me financially, like they do with all their grandchildren. My grandfather saved a ton of money for my schooling since I was born, and I'm very grateful . However, this was mostly my grandfather's doing (we love grandpa, he's the real OG). My grandmother is...a bitch. My mother and father were in a custody battle for eleven years, with four of us kids in the middle of it. When my father wanted to stop seeing us, my grandmother said she would stop giving him money if he stopped fighting for custody (my father is 52 and still depends on his parents. Nice). Half of the shit I went through (testifying against both my parents on abuse charges, emotional and physical abuse, etc) would have been preventable if my grandmother would have butted out.\n\nAnyway, so this Christmas I was planning on taking my brother (15M) to see my grandparents for Christmas. They live out of state and we don't see them more than four times a year, so we jump at any chance to see them. However, my grandmother wants to invite my father. I told her neither I or my brother was ready to see him (we haven't spoken in +3 years) and she replied with \"that's so disappointing.\"  I have a hunch that she's planning on inviting him anyway, no matter what time I decide to meet up with them.\n\nAITA for not wanting to see someone who physically, emotionally and verbally abused my mother, my two brothers, my sister, and I? And how do I tell my grandmother that if he shows up I'm leaving?\n\ntl;dr: grandma's a bitch, trying to force my brother and I to see abusive father at Christmas. We don't want to. AITA and what do I do??",

They really do like each other, so it's pretty cool to see an actual relationship amongst all the bullshit in 8th grade. \n\nHowever, because they're really popular, whenever they so much as speak to each other, a crowd forms and start making a ton of noise. It's getting so bad that Olivia has started treating her classmates like fans, and it's so annoying. I'm sure it's unintentional, but it's still awful.\n\nAlso, because everyone r e a l l y cares about their relationship, Olivia feels the need to keep everyone updated. So, when she walks up to me in the hallway and immediately starts talking about Ollie and their relationship, I'm super annoyed. I honestly just wanna go home, so could you not? \n\nB U T , to be fair, the crowds aren't really their fault, Olivia is handling the best she can cause she's super introverted and Olivia only thinks I care because I'm too much of a pussy to tell her otherwise.\n\nTLDR: My friends started dating and now it's being unintentionally shoved down my throat.

      "description": "My husband(32) and I(28) have been married for three years. Backstory my husband’s mother had a stroke a few years ago and has no husband or anyone to share her life with so we try to fill in as much as possible. She is still almost 100% mobile. \n\nTo sum it up my husband works out of state during the week and we only get weekends to spend together and he spends at least half if not more of the weekend with her. I encourage it to an extent because she lives alone, though I resent it a bit as it deeply stresses him out but if he chooses to spend the whole weekend with me, she usually causes a blowout fight and does something irresponsible(she once bought a car she couldn’t afford after they fought because he wanted a weekend to himself). God forbid we choose to vacation without her the world might end. We have given up multiple opportunities to do things because she would be very angry at him for spending his vacation time away doing something she couldn’t do. She is very manipulative and will bring up how she’s “going to die soon” whenever he wants to spend time without her. \n\nOur house is undergoing a remodel currently and when it’s finished I want to bring up the idea of renting the house out for extra income and moving away. Not out of state just somewhere else. We’ve discussed wanting to start a family soon and have expressed that we’d like to have at least one child before I turn 30 or at least before he turns 35. \n\nThe thing is I find her to be a terrible mother/grandmother. My husband has two siblings both with 5 year old girls and she’s constantly criticizing their parents decisions, disciplining the kids when it’s not her place etcetc. She’s also obviously very emotionally manipulative and she downright abused them all as children. His two sisters don’t even really spend time around her and she makes it a very big deal that she’s so sad about that. I know myself enough to know if she tried to pull the things she does with her daughters we would have a very bad relationship as I’d easily fly off the handle if she tried to treat my children the way she treats her other grandkids. \n\nI feel as if she’s guilting my husband into thinking he has to involve her in our lives and our future child’s life because “everyone else abandoned her”.  I want nothing to do with it, I feel like we need to start our own lives and she’s preventing that. When she’s spoken about us having children before she already has inserted herself further into the equation than I’m comfortable with especially given that my family isn’t as close I feel it would be unfair to my family to have her involved as deeply as she expects to be. My husband has expressed similar sentiments while frustrated with her but when it boils down to it I believe he will cave to her manipulative ways to avoid feeling guilt. \n\nWIBTA for suggesting I want our lives more separate from her and would like to raise our children without her involvement?",

Shoveling her out all winter, moving stuff around her house, some repairs here and there.  I didn’t mind at first, but it’s become a more frequent thing and it’s gotten annoying.  \n\nLast night I was drinking with my gf and I’m guessing my gf thought I was drunker than I was because she sprung the latest job request on me.  Over this last winter several limbs of trees have fallen off into her mother’s back yard.  Now that the snow is melted they want me to cut them up and take them further out into the woods.  I don’t want to do that shit on my day off and told her basically that.  \n\nCome this morning my gf asks when I want to go over to her mother’s.  I asked her what for and she tells me that I said I would go clear out the tree limbs from her backyard.  Trying to play it off like I agreed to it, she says later on during last night we talked about it again and I agreed to do it.  Bullshit.   She tried to talk me into it for a little while talking about how her mom can’t do it and if I did she’d cook us a nice meal.  My thoughts on it are she might not be able to do it, but she can hire someone who can.  Also she’s a nice lady, but I’m not a fan of her cooking.  It’s always been a politely choke it down kinda thing, not really an incentive to go break my back over.  \n\nI guess my gf had already told her mother that I would do this and now she’s PISSED that I’m refusing to.

We always fought about dumb stuff all the time, Android vs. iPhone, Mac vs. Windows, Iron Man vs. Captain America, etc. But every now and then, we had a serious fight. One of us would push the just the right button on the other one and we would both fire up, get super emotional, and insult each other in every way possible. We were both suspect, one of us wasn't better than the other. But about a month and a half ago, right after a huge fight, I grew tired of it and all the fights we'd had. I mean, everyone thinks they're right in an argument they'd just had. So I stopped pretending that these fights hadn't happened and going back to normal as we'd been doing. I just stopped being friends with him. At school, I completely ignored him (not that he reached out anyway) unless we were with our mutual friends, and even then, I only addressed him in a talk. Never by name. Same in any group chats. Recently, college results came back, and I @ him in a gc we were both in with people we both trust, asking him if he got in. He said he didn't and I said that sucks. Another person in the chat asked about another (somewhat decent) college, and he compared it to trash. I told him that he was being dumb for saying that, and because we were both still angry at each other, he told me that it was his choice and that I had no right to choose for him. I told him I agreed and that he could make any decision he wants, but that's not going to stop me from expressing support for this college. Because we were mad at each other, he elevated the argument saying \"no one asked for your fucking opinion\" and \"you shouldn't say anything at all.\" When I stated that I didn't ask him for his opinion about this college, he checked and made a mistake, so I took off the kiddie gloves and implied he was dumb for not getting into his college because I didn't like being told I had no right to speak. I know that was definitely a mistake, and it wasn't cool, but I was already emotional because of our previous fights. He was already saying stuff like \"Go suck your dad's dick motherfucker\" and as a high school junior that doesn't faze me at all, and I told him that he needs to be more sportive when given feedback (not about getting into college but being called dumb for trash talking a good college). That was when he took off the kiddie gloves and made fun of me for a really dark, ugly experience in my life a long time ago that only he knows about (so he not only make that joke but also revealed that info to everyone in the gc). He kept going with the jokes, and I didn't fire back, I just told him he was being disgusting for making multiple jokes on that matter in an argument about whether a college was good or not. The jokes he made hit hard and made me defensive, as well as the other people in the gc (who sided with me), but I'm not sure who is at fault here.",

      "description": "I was talking with a friend about our children’s schools, and I mentioned one of the things I like about my daughter’s preschool/kinder is that there are several students with disabilities, physical and/or mental. (sorry if my terminology in English is offensive, as I do not have a perfect grasp of the nuance. In our native language I used perfectly polite words for disability/handicap in this conversation.) I see that the children have designated helpers but otherwise are treated exactly the same as all children, expected to perform the same routine and participate in all the same activities, and generally seem to strike a great balance of being assisted without being discriminated against. I thought this was really cool of the school and teachers, and I expressed I was happy my daughter is attending such an environment where she can see and learn that just because people have different abilities, doesn’t mean anything is wrong, and everyone should be treated equally.\n\nMy friend took immediate offense to this. She said in return something like, “if you really respected disabled children and saw them as equals, you would not see their disabilities at all, and you would not even need to mention them being at the school as a ‘good’ thing because it would be just natural and not worthy to mention.” \n\nI did not expect what I said to be taken as offensive, and I did not mean to say anything in a negative or discriminatory way.

      "description": "My wife's mother and little brother (8 y.o.) came to stay with us for the week. The first night was great and we all got along. The next morning she slept in until 11:00 am while the rest of the house, including her son, woke up around 7. I hung out with the boys (my son is 10) and made them breakfast and took them for a long walk to visit my wife at work to give her some time alone. I assumed she was just tired from her trip and didn't remember to ask if I would take him for the morning. during our morning together I noticed that little bro has a big cursing problem and will typically respond to surprise with an \"oh fuck\" like it came natural to him. When we got home from our walk the boys hung out with me and put together a model car at the dining room table. I ordered some dinner for the family and set the boys beds back up in the livingroom. The following morning was more of the same with her sleeping in without asking if it was okay to watch little brother. Wife was with the baby in the back of the house putting her down for a nap and I went to use the bathroom around 9:30 when I hear the boys stomping and screaming really loudly. I went out to reprimand them but my wife beat me to it and gave them both a good talking to. I asked her to go get MIL up to help with her child. She came out complaining and saying \"my son needs to be watched, what did you expect?\" she also claimed that my son taught her son to swear (after admitting the previous night that he had problems with cursing) then came the attitude for the rest of the day. She made lunch (with food I provided) and pointedly did not offer any to anyone but her son who was at the table with myself and my son. I tried to ignore it and made lunch for the rest of the house. After that she decided to go for a walk apparently and just left without saying a word to anyone and assuming I would just watch her son. (there was a general snotty attitude throughout the day and she would refuse to talk to me) When she got back I told her that we need her to be present and taking care of her son when he wakes up in the morning and I told her that I thought it was very rude to not offer my son and I some of the mac and cheese she made when we were in the same room. She tried to deflect everything and acted aloof like she had done nothing wrong so I told her that I need her to take responsibility for herself, her child and her actions when in our home. I reminded her that in our home we try to treat everyone with respect as well and if I offended her to please let me know so we can work it out. She said nothing and eventually went to bed. This morning my wife texted me and said that her brother woke up and was in the living room playing by himself and had broken her headphones. She looked and her mother was still sleeping in. When she told her mother that we had thought this was going to change she just replied \"oh xavierspapa is just being too sensitive\" I am going to send her to a motel for the remainder of her trip when I get home this evening. Am I the asshole? ",

As I’m changing her she starts screaming at a 15/10 since I’m mid diaper change I can’t really pick her up and rock/soothe her so I remember something our pediatrician told us and that is if you get close to her ear and make a fairly loud Shhhhh.... sound it can trigger a calming reflex. I tried this 3-4 times to no avail. My last Shhh sort of turned in to Shhhhhhhhut up already. I didn’t tell it just said it at normal talking volume. \n\nMy wife was pretty mad at me and accused me of cursing at my daughter. The way I see it is she can’t understand me and it’s not as if I yelled it. And since when is shut up a curse word. It may be a little rude but there are plenty of worse things to say. \n\nAITA?",

We recently got a new crew and I have noticed that the dry erase markers I keep in a jar on my desk are always upside down, sometimes with the lids loose, when I get to my cube in the morning. So, I put them back the right way, but the next day, they’re disturbed again. This has been going on every day for about a week.\n\nI don’t use these markers often, but I need them about once a month to update our office’s information board. I bought them with my own money as the state only provided black and brown markers.\n\nI think what is happening is the cleaning crew brings their children and allows them to use my markers to color while the crew works. The kids don’t disturb anything else or color on my desk or state property.\n\nI feel like I would look like an asshole for moving the markers into a drawer since they aren’t expensive and the kids don’t seem to be destructive. At the same time, I don’t want to have to buy new ones every other month because the kids leave the kids off or use them all up coloring their pages 5 days a week.\n\nWould I be the asshole for hiding them?

      "title": "WIBTA for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when we go to the gym?",
      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been going out since June last year and apart from the situation with my family and the restrictions I have on me, we have a good relationship.  \n\nAt the start of this year we signed up to a gym and it was going quite well for a while. Soon enough more and more people started coming at the same time as us and because she has some issues with anxiety, uncomfortable feeling towards and being scared of all boys, we started actually going to the gym less and less; opting to just hang at hers instead. This carried on off and on for a good few months, with us sometimes being able to use the gym instead of us driving away once we saw the parking lot having too many cars. Throughout this whole ordeal I admittedly have felt annoyance at the whole thing. Her reasoning being that she feels like everybody is watching her and that makes her really uncomfortable and what-not. I tried telling her that they're just doing their own thing, etc to which she replies that she knows that but her mind will still think that so she will still have that feeling. I generally accept that and usually we cancel gym for tonight and instead go to McDonalds to get her a frozen coke to make her happy and then just chill at her's until I gotta be home for my curfew. \n\nRecently we cancelled our membership with that gym and signed up to a new one that has much more space and is definitely better. We knew coming into this that the gym would be more busy as it's a more popular gym and what-not. Ever since we signed up almost two weeks ago now, the first couple nights since the membership we didn't enter because she saw quite a few people (mainly men) working out through the window so she couldn't enter at all whatsoever. That night I was like okay, I understand and drove off. The following night we managed to get out off the car and was about to swipe our cards to open the doors when she noped out and said she couldn't do it. I said \"really?\" A couple times because we were so, so close. She got quite upset with me for that and I tried to explain to her it's because we were so close and all she needed was just that one more step, but she wasn't having it. Shortly after I managed to convince her into trying again somehow, I am usually very shit with my words and mess things up but I succeeded this time. This time we got in and it was great.  \n\nFrom then on, we manage to get in the gym but we usually have to wait in the car until the person who just arrived gets in the gym before us, or any people outside enters/leaves and are out of the parking lot. I'm fine with this as it's just a minute or two thing, no drama there. It's just to further elaborate on how she is. \n\nWhen we're in the gym we typically do five mins of cardio and use that time to gauge how many people are leaving/entering the gym and whatnot, and to give the area we want to go to that little bit more time just to see if the people in there leaves within that time frame. If they don't, we either go to the weight room where all the heavy weights and machines are and sorta work out there half-assed, not really amounting to anything. Last night when we went, and a couple of times actually, she expressed that she feels uncomfortable and that she wants to go/sit in the car and that just makes me feel disappointed because I want to work out with her, and annoyed because I know and she knows nobody is looking at her but she just can't get her mind to think that too. Sure every now and then people look around and look for a few seconds but that's nothing (to me), to her that's uncomfortable and I understand why.  \n\nTo sum it up, would I be the arsehole for feeling annoyed/disappointed at my girlfriend? It's been happening for over half a year and admittedly neither of us have made progress besides me being able to do one pull up now. I feel as if we're not getting the best out of the gym because of how she feels during these times. She expressed many times she wants a big butt and to not be skinny as hell and whatnot, but she's also letting herself halt her progress, we both believe that she needs more confidence as that's a big thing that she's lacking (she said) and I agree.

      "description": "AITA? \nSo here's the backstory:\n\nI play in a band, and we've playing together for a year now. We are a four member group, a drum plateyer, the lead singer, the bassist and me (the guitar player)\n\nOur songs are mostly written by me and the singer, but sometimes the bassist will write some too.\n\nWe haven't recorded any albums yet, but we have a few songs recorded semi-profesionaly.\n\nThe bassist claims he is the most talented member of our band (he isn't) and says that he should get more royalties from our shows at bat's and clubs.\n\nWe said that it would be unfair, since each member gets %25 of the royalties\n\nHe threaten to break my guitar more than once, because he says I don't know how to play the guitar correctly (I do know how to play it. I've played since I was 10)\n\nOn Saturday, we had a show on a bar called Morty's. We played a few songs and then we got payed and left, but the bassist says we played horrible and damaged his reputation. He says that we will never be able to play profesionaly, because we give him a bad image, so I kicked him out. The other band members haven't said anything about it.\n\nYesterday, he sent me a text message saying that he's sorry and that he won't do it again, but that's what he said last time we confronted him for dissing our drum player \n\nTL;DR: I kicked our bassist because I thought he was being a prick",

      "description": "Alright, story time. I've been friends with this girl (Who I will refer to as \"F\" for friend)  for about one and a half years. F hangs out with our group of friends often, but usually drifts off to other people to do her own thing for random amounts of time. We're all fine with that, and continue on with our lives without worry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently (In the span of the past week and a half), she hasn't really talked and/or made contact with any of the people of our group. This was usual, so I figured she was just busy, or wanted to hang out with others for a bit. We see each other often through the day, and this is the conversation I had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF: \\*Groans, setting down her drawing pencil\\*\n\nMe: Is that an annoyed groan or angry groan?\n\nF: Annoyed. But I don't see why you care anyway!\n\n\\*There was a few beats of silence, trying to figure out what she meant.\\*\n\nMe: You've been avoiding our friend group for like, about two weeks. We all figured you were hanging out with \\*Other friend\\* and \\*other friend.\\*\n\nF: Well MAYBE you should have asked me why!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that point, I was just confused. We both went home a minute or two after, and neither of us made an attempt to speak to each other. Keep in mind I have high-functioning autism, so social situations like this are a major, confusing problem for me to deal with.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I have done something earlier? Should I have asked her what was wrong? What should I say when I see her tomorrow? Am I being an asshole?",

      "description": "Context, we work as ski patrollers at a ski resort, meaning we are directly in charge of every person on the hill, the safety of ourselves, staff, and guests. What decisions we make directly affect how guests can utilize the public space and ensure thier safety while enjoying the outdoors.\n\nThere are 3 leadership roles here, our hill captain (runs the entire patrol for the day) 2 side captains (mountain is split into 2 sections, so they are in charge of the crew for thier side) and then the line patroller who are in charge of closing trails, maintenance, etc.\n\nOur side captain suffered an injury and will be out for the remainder of the season, so a newer patroller (the female in question) was promoted and given the chance to lead. She is a paramedic (however she teaches EMT's more than she works in a rig so I've noticed her practical skills aren't as sharp as they should be) and she is about 2x my age. I however have spent 9 years working here as a patroller so I know how things flow,  what to do and when (basically have 7 more years of practical experience at this mountain than she does).\n\nShe showed up late for our shift so I took it upon myself to make sure we could properly open the mountain for guests as it had been more than 30 minutes past the proper opening time and our side of the mountain was still partially closed with crowds growing at the base. I delegated our other patrollers on what needed to be completed (trail sweeps, hang bamboo, basic ski patrol stuff) and sent them off to go get the mountain open and lessen the chance of a major accident.\n\nShe finally arrived at the patrol shack almost 45 minutes late and questioned where everyone was. I told her what had happened and that we were getting pressed to open more terrain because it was becoming a safety hazard and she blew a gasket. Saying things like \"I don't take orders from you.\" \"You're not my boss.\" \"I was given this position not you.\" Etc. Etc.\n\nI tried to explain myself and state that things were not safe. Yet she continued down the road of anger. At lunch time our hill captain pulled me off the hill to have a chat because of how upset she was. I explained my side of the story and then she barged in trying to take over the conversation. The hill captain then took her side  because I was never able to properly explain myself. As a result he decided I was in the wrong because he was the one that put her in charge. He told me to pack my gear and head home.\n",

      "description": "I'm 22M and need your help deciding what to do. \n\nSo last year my girlfriend moved out of the house I rent and to help my coworker who needed a place to stay, I let him move in in my 3rd bedroom. My 5yo son also stays over 3 nights a week so my coworker just pays for the room, not half of the rent.\nNow the problem is he's creepy and bothering me, I don't feel comfortable in my own house anymore. He's 35yo and really weird. As mean as that sounds, I just want him out of the house. He doesn't give me any personal space, he uses my dishes and stuff and just stacks them in his room, plays music way too loud. He eats my and my sons food and uses all of my stuff since he barely owns anything. The word at work is he did too many drugs back in the day and it shows. He brings up hard drugs at basically any occasion we hang out, which is every single time my friends come over. He laughs to himself at 3am just starring at the floor, talks to himself and his stuffed animals that he sees as his family. I'm legit scared and don't do things I used to do like just playing video games in the living room. \n\nNow my best friend who usually comes over daily afyer work needs a place to stay too, I want him to move in. I feel bad for telling my roommate he has to leave, but I feel like for my own well being it's appropriate. He has no money saved up and nowhere to go so I feel like I'd make him homeless. We never talked about for how long he'll stay, but for me it seemed like it'd only be a couple months, till he figures his stuff out.\nMy best friend also works with us, so my roommate would definitely know that he moved in.\n\nEveryone I tell about this says I can't do that and it wouldn't be fair. I don't wanna tell them the things he does, bc I don't wanna talk bad about him, in the end he's a nice guy. I didn't bring it up to him yet, just gave hints he should start looking for an apartment, which he's not actually doing. \n\nAITA for kicking him out? ",

      "description": "Hey guys, \n\nI was thinking about this the other day after having read through this sub, and I've always considered myself to not be an asshole, but I'm beginning to wonder if I was an asshole in this particular situation. It happened a few years back. \n\nI went to a diner that I frequent quite often, and the waitress (we will call her... Fred, I don't know.) and I had struck up a decent rapport after a few visits. She was cute, funny and very.... clumsy? But in a good way. She would always say things like, \"god, I'm so dumb! Sorry, sorry!\"\n\nSo, I always give a good tip, but I thought I would tip more than usual on this one occasion because we had a pretty decent conversation and it had been a good day at work (for once!)Basically -- the conversation in question went like this (I'm \"John\"):\n\nMe: \"Here's uh, here's a little something extra for you to... you know, sweeten the pot.\"\n\n\\*\\*yes, I'm awkward as fuck\\*\\*\n\nFred: \"Ha, thank you John. You're spoiling me.\"\n\nMe: \"Well, you know. You do great service, seriously.\"\n\nFred: \"Thank you.\"\n\nMe \"Anyway I was thinking uh, since maybe we have known eachother for, you know, over a week. I was thinking that maybe we could go like.. on a date. Together, like... water slide or something. You like those?\"\n\nFred: \"Oh you know what... I'm really sorry John. I thought you knew? I have a boyfriend.\"\n\nMe: \"You have a boyfriend? You gotta be kidding me. Why didn't you say something? I've beeen coming here for over a week.\"\n\nFred: \"I just thought you knew.\"\n\nMe: \"Well you're not wearing a sign. That's ridiculous. I want my money back. My tip money\"\n\nFred: \"What? You're kidding, right?\"\n\nMe: \"No. I gave you a lot more tips than... somebody I wasn't interested in. I think at least part of that tip money is mine.\"\n\nFred: \"You HAVE to be kidding me. That's just ridiculous.\"\n\nMe: \"How come you're not dumb anymore?\"\n\n\\----\n\nAt this point, I just pretty much left to go sulk somewhere. I know some of my behavior was wrong, but I can't shake the fact that she was playing a \"dumb\" act all along and took advantage to some degree.\n\nAnyway -- let me know what you think so I can stop having flashbacks of this awkward moment and wondering where to go from here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

But that's fine.\nShe told me to post an ad too so I posted 3.\nSaid roommate wants to approve and meet anyone I find, but wanted me to just give up my bed for 3 months to a person who's name she didnt even tell me, then proceeded to get short with me when I said no.

      "description": "I live in NYC and work as a free lance artist but usually need a day job to supplement my income. I had been having a lot of trouble locking anything down, mainly searching for part time administrative roles, but not ruling out full time because my freelance gigs have been getting harder as I get older. Late nights, etc. \n\nAnyway, I happened to mention my job search to a woman I am instagram friends with and had met once before randomly in the corner store near my house. She said she is looking for someone, a role that plays many hats and to forward my resume. Thinking this could be an awesome opportunity to work with someone I seemed to have a lot in common with I jumped at it. When I met with her for an interview she asked what I expected for salary and I’ll be honest I undersold myself a lot, being pretty new to personal assistant type role at the level she was describing. She almost changed the subject and said the first month I worked would be a trial month and I’d be paid under the table. Being desperate and giving her the benefit of the doubt without pressing hard numbers I agreed to show up the next week for work.\n\nCut to this Monday and I start working with her. She is an entrepreneur and is very eccentric so I tried to write off any weirdness to that, but by day one she had me scrambling with 15 different tasks, every minute asking me to stop to write down another. It started to become obvious that her thinking and behavior was almost manic. When out in public she had no regard for other people’s social cues or couldn’t read them at all. She said overtly racist things about people she worked with and random people on the street. She was overly nice to me and buying me gifts when we went on shopping errands and making promises of trips to Miami etc. I was doing the job to the best of my ability but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was up with this person. \n\nSo yesterday after working a 10 hour day, running all over the city for her, selling items out of her apartment over craigslist and OfferUp. (She planned to turn her apartment into a photo studio rental space which she told me I would be in charge of booking and could take commission from. I’m not sure this is legal.) she casually mentions that I’m an unpaid intern. I stop and she says yes I assumed you knew this would be unpaid the first month and after that I will pay between 1000$-2000$ a month. All of this expecting me to work full time and emailing and texting me with work tasks as late as 2am I’m the morning. And running this supposed business out of her home.\n\nAfter talking it over with my boyfriend, whom is very business savvy and got mad for me at the fact that he felt I was being taken advantage of, I responded to her 2am work request saying this isn’t what I thought it was. I am worth more and need more to survive and calmly resigned.\n\nShe acted surprised by my text but said okay and agreed to leave things I had left in her apartment at the front desk. I don’t know I guess I think I did the right thing, but I want to know if anyone thinks I jumped the gun. \n\nTd;lr woman expects me to work full time for free and then way less than minimum wage. ",

She often used to make cutting remarks and i kind of used to ignore or laugh it off mostly. In the recent past the following things have happened when we hung out together\n\n1 . She is extremely rude to me for simple things. Eg. hey do u want to get coffee? I ll get it when i want it\n\nWe were outside and i mentioned- hey wait here for a minute let me check if the uber came to the other side of the street. When i came back she had a huge meltdown stating why i left her in middle of street in front of a hotel. Dont you have common sense etc\n3 i asked why are you mad at me. What did i do wrong? - response- don’t be a girl and get all emotional now\n\nWhen i asked why are you rude? Response- i ll stop talking . You are accusing me of being rude\nThere are a bunch of other things like this. I really try to tiptoe around and not get into any confrontation. I try to be nice always.\n\nBut i am not sure if it will make it better.\n\nShe is my best friend and I deeply care about her and don’t want to destroy the friendship.\n\nI came across this term after searching for what to do when some one is rude to you and came across this sub\n\nCreated a throwaway accounts so that this doesnt come back to anyone\n\nIs there any fix for this. I have tried to go as non confrontational as possible but still it comes back. If i let her make decisions she says you cant decide for your self. Grown man acting like a girl . I am 35 years old.\n\nPlease help me",

      "description": "My (37F) husband's (34M) friends (Mark/Sarah) are hosting a baptism for their baby. We don't see them often - a few times/year, usually at Christmas and may one other time. It was more often - monthly? - but since they were married in 2014 Mark has kinda dropped off the radar. Sarah is very much a \"Princess\" and very spoiled. She and I literally have NOTHING in common. Mark is a total braggart and always needs to one-up his friends.The last time we went to their home for dinner (to meet the baby when he was a few months old) I reached my boiling point and ended up getting into a disagreement (not heated) with Mark over how he was disciplining his dog (I run a dog rescue and he was shocking him with a shock collar on a remote and as a result the dog, whom he's raised since a puppy and is happy to tell you how BRILLIANT he is, was now a totally unhinged lunatic. He also flicked the tips of his ears if he didn't listen to him and the dog was visibly afraid of him. He calls it \"respect\"). I told my husband that I didn't want to go to their home anymore to listen to him brag about his house/cooking/baby/what-have-you and watch him abuse his dog. If he wanted to get together elsewhere like a restaurant, fine. Husband has been out him once or twice since for a guys' night with a handful of friends.\n\nWe are very child-free by choice. I dislike children pretty strongly and prefer not to be around them if I can avoid it. There are also no children in his family or mine so it hasn't been an issue.\n\nHusband saw Mark recently at a guys' night and we were invited to their baby's upcoming christening. UGH. Between Mark's stag and their wedding we've easily given them $1,000 in cash just for those two events. Their culture is very 'cash only' when it comes to these events.\n\nI don't want to go. They're all Catholic and I'm an atheist and am strongly against organized religion and the Catholic church in general.\n\nI told my husband I didn't want to go, but he's welcome to. He can say I already have plans that day. He has said he has no interest in going, but probably will \"out of obligation\". He said \"if you don't go that's fine, but it will look really bad\". I said, \"to who?\" and he couldn't answer. To them? Who cares? To their families? Literal strangers to me. I told him it's time to stop doing these things (like becoming someone's godparent for no other reason than to give them cash gifts at Christmas, their bday and Easter - WTF?) out of obligation. I stopped doing that shit years ago. ",

I notice these 2 guys sitting off to the side and it seems like they're waiting for take out too.\n\nAround 6:40, the staff hands these guys their orders. Once they leave, I ask an employee if they had called in as well. They hadn't. This began a discussion between the employee and myself as to why they got their food before me.\n\nI said to the employee, \"If I call for pickup at 6:40, shouldn't my food be ready by 6:40?\"\n\nShe responds by telling me that they have to serve the customers already in shop.\n\nI ask why they couldn't have timed the cooking so that my food is ready by the time I specify and still serve customers in shop.\n\nShe says that they don't want to cook the food too early so it doesn't get soggy.\n\nI respond by saying that if the food was ready by 6:40 and I were to arrive at 6:50 to soggy food, that would be my problem.\n\nShe then responds with \"That's just how we do it. That's how the boss does it.\"\n\nUnfortunately the boss wasn't there so I didn't get a chance to ask them about this.\n\nTo me, this is about principle. If I were to make a reservation over the phone, I would expect the table ready for me. Serving customers who arrived in person before me is not a reasonable excuse.

      "description": "First a bit of background. \n\n2 years ago my ex and i decided to go on vacations to another continent, to visit several places and countries on a spawn a month. \n\nWe were living together at that point, buying several stuff for the apartment, form forniture to electrodomestics, you know, the usual \"new couple living together\" stuff.\n\nMoving forward, as the date for the trip draw closer, she asked for a loan on her bank (since her interest rate was lower), and divided the money in half (4.000$ each) to cover the expenses of the trip (Hostels, food, bus tickets, plane tickets, souvenirs, etc) \n\nBad fortune wanted that my visa for travel had troubles and about 2 weeks before the trip i had to buy another plane ticket with another route and again, she paid for it with her credit card (900$).\n\nNow, a week before the date for the vacations, i found out that she was cheating on me so i took some clothes and left that same night. \n\nThe very next day she called me angry demanding some money that i owned for the \"expenses of the month\", saying that it was $400, when i asked for a clarification, the total amount was only for $150 (i paid those 150$). \n\nThat same day she started demanding the total amount for the second ticket (900$) and i told her to go f*** herself. \n\nThe next day, i went to the house to finish pack my stuff and when i checked the laptop, she had talked with customer service and they refund her 750$ of the total of the ticket, checked the time of the conversation and it was right after she called me demanding the full amount. (She knew she was gonna get refunded 750$ and then called me asking for the total amount $900) \n\nWith the money i was gonna use for the vacations i rented an empty apartment, and had to buy everything, from toilet paper to a mattress. \n\nOnce she left for the trip (i didnt travel, she did) i went full Sherlock Holmes mode and found that she was cheating on me for a few months, with several people (4 with hard evidence, several more just speculative)\n\nTl;Dr  i found out that my ex cheated on me a week before a big vacations we had over a year planning, left her with all the stuff we bought together she tried to scam me with money twice, and found out that she had cheated for more that a year with several people.\n\nSo, am i an asshole for not planning to pay her any of the money from the loans? Even thought i left her with all the stuff we buyed while living together?\n\nThere are some more details about the way she acted after i left her if you guys want them, but those are the major ones involving money.\n\nAnd im not from the US, so the numbers are just some aproximated convertions",

I can honestly tell her anything. Long story short, her birthday was this past December and she planned a small party with a mix of friends and family and I flaked last minute.\n&amp;nbsp;\nHer birthday happens to fall on a Tuesday but we made plans to celebrate on Saturday. I’m usually free on Saturdays but that following day I have work early in the morning. During the week we also celebrated going into her birthday by going out to grab a drink and the next day a little gathering with family.\n&amp;nbsp;\nI whole-heartily wanted to attend the Saturday celebration and actually looking forward to it over the course of the week but when the time came I just didn’t want to go. I totally understand that was a pretty douche move on my part and I definitely apologized about it later but now she won’t talk to me and essentially ghosted me.\n\nTL;DR My friend had a birthday celebration on Saturday that I flaked but was present at the previous celebration on the actual day of her birthday and now she refuses to talk to me.

      "description": "I was waiting in line at a dining hall with a very high-demand daily special, made-to-order burritos. Of course, because each burrito was custom, the line was significantly longer than usual. Directly in front of me was a guy standing alone. About five minutes into my wait, maybe a third of the way through the line, a girl appears, stops, looks around the cafeteria, spots the guy in front of me, and quickly rushes up to him with the classic \"Oh my gosh, how are you?\" and then proceeds to cut at least 10 students. She had obviously just gotten to the dining hall because of how she greeted the guy in front of me; it wasn't like she was already there and asked someone to hold her place in line.\n\nHaving just seen [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7XO18qxJg) scene from Curb Your Enthusiasm, I immediately realized that I was falling victim to the dreaded \"chat and cut\" and became infuriated. Admittedly, I was hungry, so I called her out. Here's how our interaction went:\n\n&gt;Me, maybe a little louder than I should have been: \"Yeah, I'm not going to pretend like you didn't just cut all of us in line. So I'm going to have to ask you to the back\"\n\n&gt;Her: \"Excuse me?\"\n\n&gt;Her friend, sarcastically: \"Wow, I hope you just have a great day\"\n\n&gt;Me, done with this: \"Thanks, I will\"\n\nAnd with that, they moved to the back of the line. I didn't see or hear any reactions from anyone around us, but my friend called me out later for what he thought was a dick move. Was I justified?",

Split up with his father before he was two, went to collage for two years to get an education so I could support myself and him. Moved back, met a nice guy got married had another child and provide a stable home and family environment for our children. \n\nOldest son is almost 9, he's very sensitive and a very sweet kid most of the time. He is with us 50/50 and compared to his father's home we provide structure and routine and discipline ( consequences for actions not physical dicipline). \nHe is also not very confident and says negative the gas about himself which is heart breaking. I try to be very encouraging and remind him of all the things he's good at and tell him all the things hat I think are great about him. \n\nHe is not very good at entertaining himself and very demanding of my attention, always wanting to be glued to my side no matter what I am doing. Most of the time when he asks me to play with him I do, but sometimes I am busy or doing something with the younger child and can't. If I tell him no he gets super pouty and quiet, or if I give him an alternative suggestion of something to do together he just says no. \nI played with him today while my husband and todler napped, we played outside then we played cards and then after the todler and husband woke up I told him I was going to lay down for a few minutes by myself as I had a headache. Less than a minute later he comes in to my room and wants to snuggle with me and I tell him not right now and he pouts and leaves \nAfter I get up I want to go outside with everyone and play, he's still pouting and says no, because it's not what he wanted to do with me. I invited him out again after a few minutes and when he came outside he just poured more and wouldn't participate with us.\n\nI feel annoyed, I am trying to spend time with everyone and I make an effort to spend time one on one with each child but damn I need to also do things I want to do and have some down time. \n\nAITA ? \n\nAlso not trying to indicate I feel my child is a but hole.
