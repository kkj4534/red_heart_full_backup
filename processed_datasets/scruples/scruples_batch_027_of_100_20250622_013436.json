      "title": "AITA for scolding my GF for almost poking me in the eye with a stick",
      "description": "I was sitting in my computer chair, talking to my GF who was standing next to me. At one point I turned myself toward her both with my chair and head, and she was holding a wooden BBQ skewer (very thin, wooden stick with a pointed end) directly next to my face, so that when I turn, my upper cheek bone turns into the point of the stick, poking me literally about half an inch under my right eye, above my cheek bone.\n\nNow, I didn't \"blow up\" externally, but I did get pretty damn angry internally, and expressed it to my girlfriend in a way I'll try to get across as follow, as best and honestly as I can describe;\n\nI don't feel I was like \"vitrolic\" or anything in my tone, but I would describe it best as a tone of definite incredulity, I said something along the lines of: \"*What* the hell? *Why* would you do that?!? Are you serious? You *don't* put pointy objects near eyes... wth?\" Now, I remember it will enough to remember myself purposely trying to add in at least a little bit of softer tone, like sadness that she had so little regard/respect for me, and not just pure anger. \n\nShe immediately responds by getting angry herself, with seemingly no sign of remorse or genuine apology. Best I can remember and describe is her own angry, incredulous, \"*Jeeeeezzz goddddd (very fake and ingenuine:) What's your problem.\"\n\nAt this, I reacted further by just being in disbelief she could show absolutely no apologetic response, and just immediately turn around to make me the bad guy in this, so I got even angrier and more hurt. I pretty much continued saying more of the same, with the theme of \"*How* do you not know the utterly common sense and safety rule of 'don't put pointy objects near eyeballs\"?\n\nShe then starts expressing that she's so angry at me and I'm the asshole for \"talking to her like a child\".\n\nNow, when I first reacted, I wasn't consciously thinking that at all, but as soon as she said that my initial thought was... \"Uhhh well YEAH, maybe I *was*, because this is like a ridiculously basic, and I feel, fundamental early learning *child's* lesson in safety and common sense\". Pointy objects near eyes... NO. BAD.\n\nSo at this point I'm much more angry that she immediately turned it around on me, tried to make me the asshole and showed NO remorse at all, more than I was about the actual act. During all this, she gives a few of what I feel are not just half-hearted apologies, but in fact 100% non-apology... like an \"eye-roll\" apology. Think your best impression of a sarcastic, not-sorry-at-all \"well soooorrrryyyyy\" (with, I feel, the attitude of \"sorry you're so sensitive about this. Sorry you're such an asshole, etc. Least genuine sorry you can imagine).\n\nAnyway, we basically did the classic unhealthy silent treatment fight for the rest of the night. I was purposely cold and didn't want to speak to her because of how angry I was (again, at the reaction more than the initial act). We ended up going to bed angry at each other, both refusing to talk.\n\nNext day, and I'm still very mad she hasn't apologized, so I passive-aggresively just leave silently, keeping up the silent-treatment fight we've got going. That day I come home for lunch and she's there, and I'm still being very cold and short, one word \"hey\" kinda shit... \n\nShe confronts me in seemingly diplomatic, almost sad tone of \"What's wrong, are you still mad at me\" with the kind of puppy dog effect of clearly trying to get sympathy.\n\nSo, I did my best to express honestly how I was feeling, and I really believe I wasn't nasty or hostile about it at all. I told her I felt like she completely disregarded my feelings, and I felt like she wasn't sorry at all. And that she *always* does this, with any fight we have, where IMO she refuses to *ever* admit any fault of her own, and always turns me into the asshole for even daring to be angry at her about anything ever. She then says, with more incredulity and attitude \"I *said* I was sorry!\" with a \"what more do you want\" kind of attitude. She also repeats how she feels I spoke to her like a child and I was totally the asshole for that. This just brought us back to square 1 because, to me, she was doing the exact same thing still. Pure attitude of non-apology and just disregard for my feelings. I was genuinely feeling she didn't care about me at all. I expressed this, and she proceeds to get teary and *further* guilt me with \"How could you think something like that, that I don't care about you???!\", and then starts crying.\n\nI then gave up and hugged her, and ended up apologizing to *her*, and life went on after that with some more good times and some more bad. But anyway, we're not together anymore so nobody needs to include any thoughts on the health or future of our relationship, I just felt like seeing what this sub would have to say about this particular fight.\n\n",

I was glad to find that my room isn’t the one that smells, but it’s coming from the people who live next to me. \n\nI don’t have a problem with people smoking weed, but my school has strict policy if you’re caught, and only one offense will get you banned from university housing. Just a couple of days ago, two guys that lived down the hall got arrested for possession, and yet my neighbors still smoking pretty often.

      "title": "AITA for laughing when my 6year old nephew called two nurses fat?",
      "description": "Okay, before I get dragged. Here is the story. I am 16 yrs old, My brother is married to a doctor. I went to pick up my niece and nephew from the hospital. They had some sort of holiday coworker family day. So my SIL had them briefly and asked me to pick them up. Whatever, I said okay. Anyway, while waiting at one of the hospital’s nursing station, my niece said she gave her phone to a ‘nurse’ to charge. I ask her who she gave it to. The manager asks my niece and nephew to describe the nurse. Nephew says she is very fat and chubby. He then points to the lady sitting on the computer and says ‘she is fat like her but smaller’ \n\nAt this point, I am trying to apologize. Then the actual nurse with phone appears. The nurse who was sitting down says “the kids just called us fat” I apologize again. So I am trying to drag the kids out before things go out of control. But for some reason I couldn’t control my face, so I had my hand on my face.\n    \nI got to the elevator and lost it, started laughing uncontrollably. Thought I was safe to laugh but My nephew pressed a key that opened the elevator while I was still laughing. I look up and both obese nurses are looking at me angrily. I am saying am sorry while trying to not laugh. Then we left. \n\nMy SIL later called me could not believe what had just happened. She said the second nurse was very offended. Not by my nephew’s remarks but by my laughing. Now she wants to go back and apologize in person. So AITA? \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to go on summer vacation with my parents?",
      "description": "This post is similar to another one that was made in this sub. I have a bit of a different situation. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI'm 20 and living at home while I'm doing my undergrad degree. For the past ever my family have gone on vacation every summer without fail. For the past couple of years, they decided that on top of doing summer vacations, that winter vacations should be taken every year as well.\n\nNow, I love my family. They get on my nerves sometimes (as family does), but they are kind people. I also really appreciate everything they have done for me and I feel very lucky and fortunate that I come from a family that can afford to pay my (and my siblings') tuition and take vacations once or twice a year with the whole family. However, if I need to take one more family vacation with them during the short amount of free time I have between the fall and winter semester to relax (about 2 weeks) or between summer courses and the new school year (also about 2 weeks), I might just jump off of the CN Tower.\n\nHere's what happens during every vacation. We go somewhere disgustingly hot (winter or summer), probably a beach. We don't go anywhere else because everyone but me loves the 35+ degree weather for some inconceivable reason. We used to get a hotel, now we AirBnB. I always have to share a room with all of my siblings (brother aged 17 and sister aged 13) or my sister. Everyone (not just me) is agitated because we do not like being this close together for so long. Everyone os already tense from a long flight or car ride. I have probably not had a cigarette for 15+ hours, especially irritable.\n\nWe usually have to go out to eat lunch and dinner. I hate eating in front of people, especially my mother (recovering from an eating disorder) and since we are Jewish we need to eat relatively kosher (meaning up until a few months ago we couldn't eat meat at any restaurants, I would always have to eat salmon bc it isn't considered as meat in Judaism, and we still can't eat a majority of menu items because meat and dairy are mixed or there is pork or shellfish). I always feel bloated and gross after and I can't smoke after I eat. Feel like shit for the rest of the day.\n\nIf on the beach, we go to the beach every day. I'm super insecure about my body and therefore despise bathing suits. The sand, as the kids say, \"it's course and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere\". The seawater burns my eyes even when closed and messes up my hair. I burn easily and hate the feeling of sunscreen. I hate, hate, hate the heat with a passion. Basically, I hate every single thing about the beach. I usually choose to stay back wherever we are staying and deal with being called a party pooper. I don't mind, because I'm the one who'll have the air conditioning.\n\nTalks about how my general attitude about vacations is putting a damper on everyone's mood are frequent. We usually walk for hours on the heat, causing a lot of sweat. I want to actually be able to relax on my time off of school but here we are, leaving the house by 8 am to go on a boat (???).\n\nAll I want on my time off of school is to be able to relax a little bit without needing to be anxious about school. I don't need much, just more sleep and some more time with my friends and enough time to prepare everything for the next semester. I did tell most of this stuff to my parents (barring the eating disorder stuff, I'm not even going to try) and by the luck of the draw they actually let me stay back last winter vacation. It was probably the best week and a half I've had since starting high school. It left me super refreshed and ready to start the next semester head on.\n\nI've basically been feeling like this since I was maybe 14. This summer, they want to go to New Jersey and then New York. I know for a fact that half of it will be at the beach. My mom asked me if I wanted to go with them this year. I told her I would think about it. I know they only want us to spend time together as a family, but I think we can do that in another way that doesn't involve leaving the country. Vacations just make me so uncomfortable when they are supposed to be enjoyable. I don't think my parents are being assholes at all by the way, but I just want to know if I'm being one.\n\nTLDR: Vacations make me feel very insecure, irritable, exhausted, and like I have zero personal space. While I'm grateful for my family, I just want my own space to relax and unwind after the semester is over.",

So I think everything’s fine. A few days later, he’s accusing me of pushing my religion on him. I try to explain that he doesn’t have to be religious I just want him to support me in it.

Admittedly, not the best choice of words, but I was trying to be honest with my feelings. He calls me a conspiracy theorist, breaks up with me, but asks if I’ll wait for him. I say I’d wait at least a year. Doesn’t like that answer. Two days later, he apologizes and says it was just because of stress that he reacted that way.

      "description": "So I have a neighbor whose wi-fi I use and give her like 10 bucks a month.  We have always been friendly.  The other morning I was going to the store and asked her if she needed anything.  At the beginning of this month I forgot to give her 10 bucks, I forget sometimes and she never made a big deal out of it.  So she tells me to pick her up eggs and milk at the store.  I did so, and knocked on her door 3 times that day to give her the milk and eggs.  Apparently she worked a double shift so she wasn't home  all day and evening.  No biggie.  Around 10 PM I got a hankering for some hard boiled eggs, so I boiled 5 eggs and had a tall glass of milk, HER eggs and milk.  I didn't expect her to knock on my door after 10, so I thought it was no big deal at all, I would run to the store in the morning and grab a fresh gallon of milk and eggs for her.  Well, she knocked on my door at 10:30 PM, and I gave her the milk and eggs I got into because I thought she needed them.  She was livid that I gave her eggs with 5 missing and the opened gallon of milk, and walked away from my door saying some pretty nasty things.  I have never heard her talk that way before, and after thinking about it, I went over to her apartment and gave her back the wi-fi extender she gave me for her wi-fi.  She was pissed and called me an ass.  AITA for getting into the milk and eggs?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for three years. I love her and I’m very proud of her (she’s had a tough time at work recently) so I wanted to surprise her with a really awesome gift for her birthday. \n\nHer birthday was last week. In the months and weeks running up to it, when I’d ask her what she’d want for a gift, she kept telling me she only wanted a card. Like, one of those custom made ones, for example. When I’d reply and tell her that she’s got to want more than just a card, she’d firmly state that was all she wanted. She said that cards were more sentimental to her and that they had long-time value unlike presents. \n\nThe thing is, I really don’t see the point in cards. I get why she would like a custom made one, but we have tons of framed pictures of us together. I’d just be recycling photos we already have on display. I’ve never got her a card before and she’s never complained or brought it up. \n\nI ended up buying her a new laptop as hers has been faulty for a while. I was super stoked about the present and thought she would be, too. On her birthday, when she found a wrapped present, she was immediately pissed. When she opened it, she was even more angry. Told me that it wasn’t my responsibility to fix her electronics and that she is perfectly capable of deciding when her laptop should be replaced. She asked if I had got her a card and I said no. I told her that I had spent enough money on the laptop and I didn’t see the point in spending another £7+ on a custom made card. She hasn’t spoken to me since. \n\nShe’s been staying with some friends who all live in a shared house and I cannot understand why this is such a big deal. I admit I could have handled it better, but the way she reacted to (what was supposed to be!) a thoughtful gift has me pretty shaken up. I didn’t realise a card would be so important to her. \n\nSo, AITA? I get that I should have got her a card... but not speaking to me for days.. surely that’s a bit extreme? ",

      "title": "AITA for not trusting my friends on Discord and questioning my friendship with them?",
      "description": "A few days ago I decided to reset my discord profile pic to the default icon, set my setting to offline, stopped talking in all of my servers except the one without any of my friends on it, and change my username to a bunch of random symbols because I was just emotionally done with everything. I don't know why or how it got to this point but I just felt emotionally done with these people which doesn't make sense. I care about my friends that I met deeply, but sometimes it gets too much and I hate it. I have a few ideas on why I'm upset but I need sometime to think, so buckle the fuckle up for a long and possibly confusing story.\n\nSo about a year ago, I was one of the first members of a discord server dedicated to a really small fandom with people I knew from tumblr and a few from another discord server. Over the months I noticed that more people were being promoted to modship while I was fine with it hoping that I would be next since I was very active and others weren't. This never came. I was also heavily involved in other servers were the same people resided but I had a feeling that there was more, it turns out that they were keeping whole servers hidden and doing everything right under my nose, I don't understand, but I started to try and fix it.\n\nAt the start of the year I was more aware and decided to stop waiting since that was getting nowhere in their social hierarchy. I would ask to join group calls and discussions but they still left me out of a lot. I think the last straw was a month ago when I asked to join a server and one of them said I couldn't and provided no explanation despite seeing her as a nice person. A few other small instances and I just got tired of it, tired of being excluded, tired of not being treated as an equal despite everything I've done, so I left.\n\nToday I checked back in and spoke to one of my closest friends about being in a one sided friendship, he told me to either confront the person or if it is emotionally bothering me to break it off altogether, which I still need to think about. The possibility of losing these people still upsets me because I've talked to them about everyday for a year, and I don't hate these people, I love and care for them but I just don't feel like I'm getting anything back. Also, I checked back today and nobody even was concerned over me or wondered what I did, while if it was with another person higher up in the social hierarchy, they would be concerned immediately, this makes me feel like leaving since if they didn't notice me in the first place and they wouldn't notice me if I was gone.\n\nThe reason I'm posting this here is because I still feel like its my fault somehow, and please tell me if it is, I feel like an attention whore who just wants to be noticed, or someone who is using jealousy to get what I want but I don't want modship even, I just want to be treated as a friend, am I the asshole here or not?",

      "description": "This last Friday I was playing Sekiro on the PS4 and my brother came into the den and started searching through all our games. I looked over and he was price checking each one on the GameStop trade-in website.\n\nHuge red flag because my brother has been going through a really bad drug habit, off and on for the past few years. He’s supposed to be off drugs now as a condition for living in my apartment.\n\nWhen I asked him what he was doing, he told me he wanted to see which games he could sell because he only plays free games like Apex, Fortnight, and Warframe. Then he asked me if we could sell the PS4 and split money 50/50 because “it’s just wasting our lives anyways.”\n\nSo the next day, while my brother was with his gf’s house, I packed up the PS4, the TV, and all the games and took them down to my storage locker. These are the only real valuables in my apartment, unless you count kitchen appliances.\n\nWhen my brother gets back he notices that the dens been cleared out and starts yelling at me about how I have no right to take his stuff. He did buy a couple of the CoD games, but the rest of the stuff I bought before he moved out of our parents house.\n\nI told them I pawned the stuff and I’d get it back later, which he responded to by demanding the money I got or that I go unpawn his games. Then he stormed out and I haven’t seen him since Saturday night.\n\nAITA? Should I try to find him and apologize? He has blocked my number after Saturday.",

      "description": "Title sounds bad but hear me out, throw away because my friends know my reddit.\n\nContext: My girlfriend [18] and I [18] have been in a relationship for two years after our anniversary a few weeks ago and this is more of a series of events than a one time thing.\n\nAbout 3-4 months ago my girlfriend and I had a talk and she told me that she wanted to be more spontaneous, I agreed so since then I started putting in my best efforts to do so. For our situation it’s a little bit harder because we can only do sexy stuff on the weekend. \n\nAfter that conversation, despite my attempts to be more “spontaneous,” the amount of sexual activity that we have has been on a steady decline. Whenever I try and be spontaneous like she wanted and initiate something when we are watching a show or getting ready for bed (which is what she told me to do originally when we first discussed it) she has shut me down about 95% of the time. Which has been discouraging, but I understand because she’s a human being and deserves the right to say no.  The only issue I’ve had is that I find this to be hypocritical of what she originally wanted and that the excuses are generally crappy, examples: “I don’t want to get dirty”, “I’m just not feeling it”, etc. which only bothers me because she recycles the same few excuses every week.\n\nNow listen, I’m an 18 year old guy, I have sexual needs and I won’t deny that I’m a horny SOB half the time, but either way this decline in sexual activity started to get to me after a month or two of these failed attempts.\n\nThe main thing that got to me was that half the time she would hype up all the sex we would have in the upcoming weekend, and then we wouldn’t even kiss at all or do anything remotely sexual, which added to the build up of sexual frustration.\n\nFast forward to our anniversary. We went on a three hour road trip to a beach, nice romantic place and the entire month before my girlfriend was hyping up all the acts we were going to do. Long story short, we had sex once over the two nights we stayed and not at all on our anniversary night. When she hit me with the “I just want to go to bed,” I let out a short sigh and turned off my lamp. She then proceeded to chew me out and say “I hope you know if you did that to any other girl then they’d hate you.”\n\nThe bottom line which I told her is that I’m a human being and I can’t control my initial reaction, but that after the fact I completely understand and want what’s best for her. \n\nI tried to explain my point of view and covered everything in this post, as well as we’ve talked about this issue before, she just doesn’t get my point of view I guess.\n\nAnyways, am I the asshole?\n\nI’d like input from both guys and girls so I can see a variety of opinions, also I know this isn’t r/relationship_advice but if any of you guys have anything advice-wise I’d appreciate it.\n",

      "description": "I’ve been torn up over this for a while, but never thought to post it here until I saw a similar situation posted to another sub.  Before I start, I want to make it clear that I don’t think I deserve to inherit more than my brother, but I understand why it’s happening.  For context: I am 27 and my brother is 32.  Our parents are very wealthy.\n\nMy brother has always had a rocky relationship with our parents.  He acted out a lot as a child and teenager. He stole, drank excessively, got into fights, and, on more than one occasion, threatened to kill one or both of our parents.  Toward the end of high school, he became addicted to opiates.  He did not go to college and has never had a job.  He has made it clear that he has no intention to work and plans to live off of his future inheritance.  Our parents support him financially, including paying for his food, rent, and entertainment.  Whenever they ask him to consider getting a job, going back to school, seeing a doctor, or anything that he doesn’t want to do, he threatens to “disappear.”  He has never directly said this but he has heavily implied “disappearing” means committing suicide.\n\nIn contrast, I went to college and graduate school. After I graduated, I landed a job that pays very well. I do not need or ask for financial support from my parents, but do not refuse when they offer to help.  For example, I got an academic scholarship for graduate school and initially planned to take out loans to pay the remaining amount of tuition.  My parents offered to pay the remaining tuition and I took them up on this offer.\n\nRecently, our mom was diagnosed with cancer and, fearing the worst, my parents updated their will.  I don’t understand all of it so I could be off about some things, but here’s a basic rundown:\n\n\\*I will inherit 75% of their estate\n\n\\*My brother will inherit 25% in the form of a trust which will pay him a fixed amount monthly\n\nI was informed of this because apparently I will have some duties in regard to my brother’s trust.\n\nHere’s where I feel like an asshole:  When I was informed that I will inherit most of the estate, I didn’t say anything.  I didn’t stand up for my brother or ask that they reconsider the distribution. My brother objectively needs that money more than I do because I have a job that pays well and he doesn’t.  He has an expectation that he’s going to inherit money and live however he wants.  He’ll definitely be able to live off of the money left to him but it’s not going to be what he’s expecting.  I feel like I’m taking money that belongs to him that I don’t really need but, at the same time, I feel like he dug his own grave. I feel bad about myself for not saying anything but I don’t feel bad for him even a little bit.\n\nSo I guess I’m asking two questions:\n\n\\*AITA for not saying anything?\n\n\\*AITA for not feeling sorry for my brother?\n\nSorry this got so long. Thanks to everyone who read this far.",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom\nSo some background information: my friends and I are all seniors in high school and have been looking forward to grad night for the past two years. My two friends also bought our school’s senior package that includes basically everything (prom tickets, grad night, cap and gown, etc.) for one flat rate; I did not. My school has previously had it at Amusement Park 1 (I don’t know if it violates the rules to specify the amusement park so I’m just gonna denote them as 1, 2, and 3.) Everyone in the school was looking forward to going there for grad night because many kids can’t afford the normal ticket price. \n\nUnfortunately, the school decides that our grad night is gonna be at Amusement Park 2, which has like 5 rides max and nobody liked. So many students expressed their disappointment that the school allowed seniors to get a refund if they bought a senior package. My friends and I didn’t want to go to Amusement Park 2 at all so I suggested buying a season pass for Amusement Park 3, since it costs the same as a grad night ticket. My friends were enthusiastic about the idea and agreed that it was much smarter than going to Amusement Park 2 and their parents agreed. We talked about this for 3 weeks and they remained enthusiastic about the idea. I then discovered about a sale for the season passes for Amusement Park 3 so I told them and they said they would buy them. I bought mine. One hour later, one friend texts me saying that they changed their mind the previous week (without telling me) and were going to go to grad night instead. They then proceeded to berate me about how I needed to buy a grad night ticket because they didn’t want to go without me. Didn’t apologize once for the fact that they didn’t tell me sooner. So AITA for being pissed at them? \n\nTLDR: friends agreed to buy a season pass for a different amusement park than grad night. Didn’t and got mad at me for not wanting to go to grad night. ",

      "description": "I do apologise for the length.\n\nTldr: Interrupted a guard at the turnstile to try and get my train. Got chastised for being rude.\n\nFor all my sins I have to commute through a busy London Overground train station, which is both overcrowded and chaotic due to trains constantly changing platforms at an instant or being cancelled for reasons such as 'the wrong type of leaves' fell on the track.\n\nToday my bus to said station was delayed and as such I was moments away from missing my scheduled final portion.\n\nI managed to position myself at the doors of my bus and was one of the first out. A ungraceful skip through the throngs of London commuters put me at the turnstile of my train with mere moments to spare.\n\nNow my annual travel pass, which I coughed up three grand sterling for, stopped working a week after purchase so I am forced to ask a guard to let me through instead of using the automated system.\n\nThis particular guard was leaning on a machine having a chat and I believe was trying to be helpful to a young tourist couple.\n\nAs I ran up I said, possibly a tad louder than I needed to, 'Here's my ticket, please let me through. I need to catch that train.'. All the while brandishing my card in a  rather panic stricken fashion.\n\nThe guard, instead of letting me through, told me to slow down. He was in the middle of helping this couple and would deal with me after.\n\nI informed him that I couldn't wait as my train was about to leave. He than told me it was no excuse for being rude, apologised to the couple, turned to me and again told me off rather than let me through.\n\nAfter he did finally let me through I managed to get to my train as the doors closed. I am now an hour late on top of a two hour commute and won't get to see my son today. I usually get to read him a story before bed\n\nAITA for interrupting a person just doing their job? \n\nIHTA for telling me off instead of letting me through? \n\nEHS because the world is full of arseholes?\n\nNAH because life sucks, people are just going through the shit together?",

      "description": "To give some background info, I live in a house with my parents, 5 siblings, my grandma and my aunt. I am the eldest of the 5 siblings, and my grandma doesn’t speak English.\n\nSo basically what happened is that last night, I was on my Nintendo Switch playing an online match of Super Smash Bros in our living room. I was in the middle of a game, and I was extremely concentrated on it.  2 of my younger sisters (2 and 5), are singing into some toy microphones they have, so I’m already pretty annoyed. I tell them calmly to be quiet, and go somewhere else, and they don’t. So whatever. \n\nThen, my grandma asks me a question, and I’m not really paying attention, so she keeps saying my name. I lose a stock in the game and say “What?” in a kind of harsh tone in her language. My mom yells my name and says why I said that to her in that way. I say that it wasn’t that rude, but she still is upset at me. After the match, I asked my grandma what she said, and she asks the question and I answer it (it wasn’t even that big of a deal).  \n\nI start another match, and this time, it’s really close. When I really concentrate on something like a video game, I kind of make little facial and head movements in a jerky way. My mom has pointed this out and laughed at me for it before, and my siblings have as well, and it really bothers me. My mom notices me doing it again and starts laughing at me, trying to tell me to keep my face straight. But I interrupt her and tell her to be quiet and I don’t care. She gets mad and spills all the a cup of water she was holding all over my shorts (it was lucky she didn’t get the water on my controller). My oldest sibling had a look of shock on her face when she did that. My mom has lashed out like this before. \n\nI get extremely mad and start yelling at her, saying “What’s wrong with you?!” She starts saying it back to me with an annoying look on her face. I leave the living room very mad and hotheaded. My grandma asks what’s wrong and my mom keeps repeating “He was disrespecting me,” which makes me even more mad. I go change my shorts and throw my wet shorts on her bed. I then take her tooth brush and rub it in the toilet in her bathroom. (I don’t know why, it seems very stupid now looking back at). I then throw myself in my bed and go on my phone, feeling sorry for myself, thinking how much of a b**ch my mom is. She then comes back half an hours later- and throws the wet shorts back on me in bed. I’ve calmed down a little and start laughing in my head thinking about how mad she was. I put my shorts in the laundry room and go back to bed. \n\nIt’s the next morning now, and I really feel like a dick, thinking I shouldn’t have done all that stuff. But I also think that my mom acted very irrationally too, so I don’t know who’s in the wrong here. Hence why I’m asking on this subreddit. So, AITA?",

      "description": "My husband gave me his cheap $2 drugstore headphones after he bought 2 new pairs of Apple headphones for himself. I misplaced them after a while but didn't really care since I dont use headphones often. He asked a few times where they were, and I was honest, saying I don't know but I know they're in the bedroom. He brushed it off each time, saying they're mine now and if they're broken not to ask for another pair. I didn't even ask for this pair but whatever. \n\nYesterday, I cleaned out our son's bassinet to put into storage. Since he's too big for it, it was full of eventual hand-me-downs for our next child. Low and behold, beneath the tiny baby clothes, the headphones.\nPlugged them into my phone and ran a bath. As I'm sitting across the room waiting for the tub to fill, I realize the headphones no longer work so I threw them in the bathroom trashcan. \n\nThis morning, my husband goes to the bathroom and returns with the broken headphones.\n\"You're gonna break them if you keep leaving them wherever.\" \nI respond that they're already broken, I found them in LO's bassinet and they don't work anymore.\n\"If you kept better track of them then they'd work.\"\n I just said I found them that way. \n\"They won't just break out of nowhere.\"\n No but they're cheap, cheap headphones do that. \"Stop making up excuses for why you broke them.\" I slowly explain it to him like he's 5. \n\"See how I haven't said anything? That's because I dropped it. Shut up already.\" \nYou haven't said anything because I'm still talking. See how I'm done now? It's amazing how quickly I can shut up when you don't interrupt. (He always complains that I bitch too much, but he never let's me actually speak.) \nHe then calls me a hypocrite and turns the argument to a different subject while I keep saying \"this is about headphones, not an argument we had last week.\"\nHe ends by calling me an asshole and storming out of the room. \n\nSo am I the asshole?

Long story short, my closet rod broke and was fixed, so I had to put all my clothes back in the closet.  I'm also preparing for a friend visiting, so I ran the shower a little to clean my mop.  This was happening around 12 or 1 am.  Apparently, the shower running briefly (what if I was had to work at 2 and was actually showering?  She can't be mad about that, right?) was too loud, so she banged on the ceiling again.  I stomped - once - back.  \n20 minutes later, the police are at my apartment door to let me know there was a noise complaint.

      "description": "I'm in a secular homeschool group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the moms is a lesbian (married to a woman) but is very, very isolationist driven.  Besides this class she doesn't do much with the kids besides some LGBT gatherings.  That's fine, to each their own.  I'll call her Jane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer daughters are 12 and 14 (almost 15) She came about them in the \"ordinary\" way but divorced her then husband and remarried when the girls were 6m and 3.  Their other mom is the only other parent they really know.  Their dad was in the military and died not long after the divorce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe happened to be talking while the kids were in an class (kids do swimming, gym, cooking and art while parents chat) about first periods, sex ed and all things puberty.   Jane admitted that she's only told her daughters about lesbian sex and that babies come from sperm added to a woman from a petri dish.  This seemed a bit odd.  Later on, Pam, a mom with girls the same age clarified with Jane.  Jane has taught her girls about lesbian sex, but has not taught them about heterosexual sex.  At. All.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJane claims that we are being narrow minded and homophobic when Pam and I suggested that she perhaps cover the basics of heterosexual sex with at least her older daughter.  She said it's not needed because her daughters are lesbian, period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept, I pointed out to her that her 14yo is very cosy with a young man and they sneak off for a lot of alone time.  Her daughter blushes profusely if you ask if she likes said boy. (Even though the activities are YMCA lead, parents help out a lot and we tend to share these sort of things with the parents)  But she also swears she's a lesbian.  Quite frankly, I'm not sure she actually understands what \"lesbian\" is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Pam and I told Jane that it's imperative she tell her daughters about heterosexual sex before she ends up a grandmother.   We told her we would never overstep her as that's not our place, but this is NEED to know information.  Jane exploded on us and said that we should watch out or she'd tell our all kids (even the little ones) the details of homosexual sex down to the last detail the next time she got the chance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, things are very icy between all of us.  All my kids know is that they are never to be in a room alone with another adult and I've been extra careful.  Pam's kids are 12, 9 and 5 and my kids are 9, 7 and 4.    And quite frankly, except for Pam's oldest graphic details about any sex are just not appropriate.  (my 7 and 9yos know about puberty and  well as Pam's 9yo.  Both 9yo's know the basics of sex.  Her 12 yo knows about heterosexual sex works and that homosexual sex can happen, too, but not details).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  AITA for confronting a lesbian mother when I found out that her 14yo didn't know about hetrosexual sex?",

Any chemicals that has a sent, cigarette smells, flowers can create a bad reaction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy MIL is aware of that fact because I had to tell her not to put on perfume when she met my mother for the first time (she did listen to me then).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my MIL brought the subject of buying a perfume for my (then) unborn daughter I gently told her I didn't want my daughter to have any perfume before being much older.\n\nI was afraid that because of my family's medical history she could also badly react to perfume and I didn't want to take the risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy MIL told me that she understood and that she would only buy quality perfume.\n\nI tied explaining to her that the quality didn't change the risk factor but she didn't really seem to listen.\n\nI talked it over with my BF who told his mother a little bit harsher not to buy perfume for our daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe didn't talk about it again so I thought it was settled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this weekend, we were spending the weekend at my MIL and FIL's house just like we do once a month and  I had my daughter on my lap.\n\nI had given her a bath the night before with my MIL's baby products that she buys so that we don't have to bring everything over when we come. I smelled my daughter's hair and I thought to myself to check the baby shampoo because I thought the smell was really strong.\n\nMy MIL sees me and the conversation went like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMIL: don't you think D smells good?\n\nMe: Yeah I just thing the shampoo smell is really strong did you buy a different one ?\n\nMIL: no its no the shampoo ! When I went to the mall one of the saleswoman gave me a sample of a baby perfume when I showed her a picture of D ! (We don't allow anyone to put pictures of our daughter on social media and my MIL shows pictures of my baby to anyone but since she doesn't share them we don't stop her).\n\nMe: NO NO NO NO NO ! YOU PUT PERFUME ON MY D ????! I TOLD YOU I WAS AGAINST IT !\n\nMIL: oh I forgot !\n\nI was soooooo mad I told my BF so he could yell at her some more and I made her throw away the sample (I watched her do it too).\n\nMy MIL is mad at me for reacting like this and think I overreacted, AITA?\n\nSorry it was so long but I wanted to give you all the details.",

      "description": "Not to different people, to the SAME GUY.  Last labor day, my mom got married.  It was a bit rushed because my stepdad had a medical procedure and she wanted to be sure they were married in case she had decisions to make or whatever.  We had a small party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, she had a second ceremony a couple of months later on the 4th of July.  I totally understand, because the first wedding was rushed because of medical issues, she deserves a big day.  I will say, she was a bit of a Bridezilla for that wedding, which I'd leave out, but it kind of feeds into my desire not to have to deal with her acting out again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so 3rd wedding rolls around, they drive to New York to have a ceremony with his family.  Seems like just inviting them to one of the other ceremonies would make more sense, but whatever, I wasn't even invited to this wedding for some reason (not complaining.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, I get a text asking if I'm free for memorial day weekend because they're having a \"reception\" they are exchanging vows at the reception. And having a cake. It's another wedding.  I am really big into water sports (like skiing and wakeboarding, not peeing on each other.) and losing all my 3 day weekends is getting pretty old.  I really don't want to hurt her feelings, but I feel like if I don't say something she's never going to stop getting fucking married.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLove my mom, please don't take this story and use it to construct a human you hate.  She is a good mom, who really likes to entertain and get married.  But, I really want to tell her that this is too much, or at the least tell her she can't keep getting married over and over.  When is their fucking anniversary going to be?!  Am I the asshole if I confront her?  Should I just shut up and show up?",

      "title": "AITA for not going to my girlfirend's recital ?",
      "description": "TL,DR at bottom\n\nSo some backstory\n\nWe're both on a small vocal group, and we've been together for almost 10 years, and members of the group for 8years. The group is formed mainly on post-highschoolers and undergraduate people who have been doing music almost their entire life, but don't want to quit doing it after pursuing a  different career like engineering, lawschool, medicine, etc. We sing from academic music to the popular type. There are plenty more girls than guys. \n\n3 months ago all the male members of the group have had trouble going to rehearsals, myself  included. The reason ? We are all at different points in our careers, some starting university, some finishing up, some already working, and that sometimes can get on the way of singing. Noticing this, the conductor decides she is going to do the end of the year program with just the girls and build a program made to work with female voices. A cool way of handling the temporal absence of the guys. While picking the songs, the conductor asks my girlfriend if she could have a couple of Christmas songs arranged to work on the female choir, since she's been doing some self-taught composition, so they'd add them to the program. She agrees and delivers. They prepare during the three months for the concert. During this time she also finished and got her engineering degree.\n\nNow, I'm finishing my degree on Computer Science and me and my friend are working on our dissertation/thesis, this is the last phase and we have to finish the project and deliver the paper this week. However, our project is quite big for an undergraduate project. When we started, our advisor, and also other advisors, told us it was a task closer to graduates. We dived right into the madness and went with it. Took also a part time internship at a software company.  Long story short, a year passed by and this is the due week.\n\nThe date for the recital, was last Sunday, late afternoon. She was really excited I was there to see her and the songs she arranged. I told her I would be there. A month ago I asked for a month permit at work so I could work full time on my thesis since there was no way I could finish working with them at the same time, they willingly granted it. Me and my friend are going every single day all day to the campus, Sunday to Sunday, for a month to work on it. Still managed to make time to see my girlfriend every Friday and Saturdays. We, myself and my friend, were at the university on last Sunday morning finishing the last details before collecting results, but something came up which could prevent us from finishing within the date limits, and my permit ended so I couldn't work on it the next day. I called my girlfriend and told her I may not be able to be at the recital since we had this problem, and needed to fix it, but will try to be there hoping she would understand. Stayed till late night at the university but we were able to fix the issue.\n\nShe was disappointed, and said she told me with time when the recital was. She's upset I wasn't there despite I explained why and now she thinks that her things are not important to me and that she always makes time for the things that matter but I couldn't make time to go to the recital.\n\nAm I the asshole ?\n\nTL,DR: girlfriend had recital on Sunday where she arranged the songs. My dissertation due date is the week after the recital, problem came up on Sunday and had to stay late night fixing it or else I might not be able to finish it and missed the concert. Girlfriend is now upset despite me calling her to inform her the problem came up and might not be able to go.",

      "description": "Completely hypothetical and may not even happen. But I want to be prepared in case of the event. \n\nMy Son, daughter and I are in a wedding in a month. I bought my daughters flower girl dress a size 3 (in January for April wedding) since I wasn't sure if she'd have a growth spurt and I wanted to make sure she looks right for the wedding. It was a $60 and I just spent $40 hemming it so it fits her perfectly just above floor length. Over the last couple months I have talked to another girl who is in the wedding with her children as well - a boy and a girl. Our children are to match and so I've tried to connect with her to make sure the kids are situated correctly. She purchsed the same $60 dress but paid $10 to have the company tailor it exactly to the measurements provided. I believe her daughter is about 4, but I am not entirely sure. She recently sent me a photo of her daughter in the dress and it hits just below her knees. My daughters dress is floor length. The dresses do not match at all because of this. I mentioned how short the dress is and she never said anything back. Honestly it looks about 3 sizes too small. Maybe for a 1 year old. It doesnt fit her at all. I feel if I received this dress for my daughter I would have contacted the company and made sure it got fixed. However I cannot tell someone I dont even know what to do. I don't want to bring it up to the Bride cause I am worried she'll freak out and Im not even sure its my place. It is the brides future sister in law. So now Im feeling like the day of the wedding they will ask my daughter and her daughter to switch dresses so that there isnt a huge difference, since obviously my daughter will be much shorter than the other flower girl. I feel I spent the time, effort and money to make sure my kids (and myself) look right for someone elses wedding. So if I say no I wont switch the dress, does that make me the asshole? The wedding is in 4 weeks and a new dress can still be ordered. ",

This program provides housing, and we each have one roommate (so 6 people in 3 apartments). Staff come in all the time to work with us with a set amount of hours before they leave in the evening.\n\nMike (the person I mentioned in the last post and the resident asshole) hasn't been kicked out, unfortunately. He is still discharged, but apparently he has 3 months to find a new place to live. In the meantime, he has to stay here, and according to one of the staff, we have to \"be civil\" with him.\n\nHowever, my roommate's idea of \"being civil\" means inviting him into our apartment, hanging out with him more and more often, and being nice to him. She claims that when he leaves she's done with him, but I don't believe it.\n\nNeedless to say, apart from when he called me a \"lazy fatass\" (multiple times, despite me not being super-lazy in the slightest), I view him as an irredeemable asshole and an annoying little prick, like a bug you can't pick off your skin. He's obnoxious, pompous, and is generally, well, annoying and loud.\n\nI will still greet him with \"hi\" and maybe a \"how are you\" and I'll still say \"nice\" in response to whatever he says, but I am in no way friends with him. This is my way of \"being civil\". However, when my roommate invites him over, I end up going to my room to get away from him, and when someone tells me my roommate is with him I go, \"Of course she's with Mike.\" While rolling my eyes.\n\nI understand my roommate can deal with him how she pleases, but am I the asshole for not being more nice to Mike?",

We had no idea what it was but as soon as we arrived up top we were handed a bunch of milk crates that were stacked full of books with plastic binding. You know the cheap curly binding that a lot of texts are made up with? Yeah those. We were told to undo all of the bindings with no scissors or any kind of tools to help us and we need to get it done as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the lads are still slaving away in the sun whilst we're doing this. \n\nThe resulting stacks of paper from these books were absolutely massive and of course we had to shred every last piece in a really old run down shredder that barely fits more than two pages at a time. Needless to say, it was taking forever. \n\nSo anyways, lunchtime comes around, my mate and I decide screw it, we should go get something to eat and come back to this afterwards. So we go away and get a feed. When we come back however we find out that nobody back down the bottom has been released to go to lunch because there was a surprise meeting going on. No way I could've known, but I guess if I had stuck around for 5mins more it might've been different.\n\nSo we walk in with full bellies whilst the rest of the workplace has been stuck there the entire time.

      "description": "I’m sure this seems like a NTA based on just the title, but it doesn’t feel like it. \n\nSo this happened a week or so ago. A kid in my band class, let’s call him Adam, picked up a graphing calculator on the table at the back of the class. He picked it up and started playing with it, and a few of us told him not to. It was an expensive model, and it definitely wasn’t his. Then he said he’d keep it, and that’s when I went up to the teacher and told her Adam was going to steal an expensive graphing calculator. She laughed at this and didn’t really believe me. \n\nAt the end of class, I saw him bragging about “his” new calculator. My friend (let’s call him Gabe) and I told him again to turn it in to someone. We wouldn’t have been triggered about this if it wasn’t so expensive. Someone would definitely miss having it. Someone else said “I’d keep it if it was me.” We then asked her why, and she told us that it didn’t really matter and that we needed to “chill.” She also said this was why “Gabe” wasn’t in the same advanced math class as her and Adam. \n\nA few days later, I told the office staff that “someone” had stolen an expensive calculator and to announce a missing calculator somehow. If anyone could verify the model or brand or when it was missing, they could have it back. When Adam saw this, he got really mad at us. He keeps insisting he “was going to give it to his math teacher,” and all his friends are acting like I snitched for something really horrible. I feel like returning  someone’s $150-200 calculator isn’t really “snitching.” Well, Reddit, you decide. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So here's the scoop:\n\nMy (M24) grandpa was always a part of my life, we would spend summer vacations with him, every Christmas, every Fourth of July, we were never CLOSE close (I've never had a real heart-to-heart with him), but he was always one of the most significant relatives in my life. My mom was always the one initiating our visits.\n\nHe's sometimes a little cranky the way older men can be and has a very dry sense of humor that can come off as rude at times, but he NEVER did anything to hurt me or any of his kids or grandkids in my lifetime. He quit drinking long long ago and \"got his life together\" so to speak before I was even born.\n\nHowever, my mom says that he was emotionally abusive to her when she was growing up, which I fully believe. I don't question her experiences for a second. My grandma (his ex-wife) has told me stories about him drinking heavily and treating her badly, which is why they divorced, so I 100% believe my mom that he was emotionally abusive to her when she was growing up.\n\nAll this came to a head several years ago when he and my mom had a bad falling out and she REFUSES to have contact with him now. Because of that, I've only seen him a handful of times (by myself) in the last 5 or 6 years.\n\nSo here's my dilemma: he's never been anything but loving to me and his other grandkids. He's nothing but loving to his son (my mom's close brother) who he's still close with. He's made up with my grandma and they're on good terms now and talk regularly. But him and my mom aren't on speaking terms and my mom has zero desire to change that. He's done everything he can do to reconcile with her, even reaching out to me to be able to talk to my mom and make things right, but my mom just won't hear it. I've tried to talk to her about it before, and she just says that I can't understand because I haven't been abused, and she's just waiting for him to die. I've kind of just let it go because I truly can't understand what it would be like to be in her shoes, but its still heartbreaking to see him in the last few years of his life, seemingly trying to do right by his kids.\n\nWhile he IS important to me, obviously my mom is more important and I don't want her to have to have contact with her abuser, and I hate to make her chose between having contact with him and being at my wedding.\n\nIt's very hard for me to understand, since I really have no frame of reference for how she must feel. It's also hard for me to understand how she could be so close to him for all my life, then completely flip and go no-contact over one argument. I'm not saying she's wrong, just that I don't understand. Any advice? Have you been in my shoes?\n\nTL;DR, my grandpa emotionally abused my mom as a child, turned his life around, and has been a great father and grandpa for my whole life. However, mom refuses contact, and now I'm in the position of deciding if I should invite him to my wedding or not.",

      "description": "I now manage people I used to work beside. The transition has been relatively seamless, but I have one employee, who I feel, is always testing boundaries. I was instrumental in getting them the job, we used to be closer, but not anymore because of these issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 100% OK with talking out decisions, but they consistently question decisions and push back for longer than I think is normal, and often about minor considerations. They make excuses when I assign any task they do not want to do. Are pedantic and will quickly point out any misspeak I make, especially in front of others. It's to the point where we've had a meeting with my boss, and I gave them a verbal warning where I laid out actionable changes that need to happen. I also feel they consistently try to gain control/favor/sympathy from their co-workers regarding this issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of this, I do not trust this person and am more critical/suspicious of their actions, and because of this, they are claiming that I'm harder on them than the rest of their co-workers, criticizing them for things I would not criticize others. I try to be fair/professional around everyone, and respectfully and constructively give critical feedback, but I must admit, because of the past and current actions, familiarity, and general annoyance with them, I am more critical. I told them I correct you for behavior your co-workers do not display, and I will continue to be more critical until you can show me this behavior has stopped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked them what the best way was to correct them or talk out a misunderstanding (because I know everyone has different preferences and communication styles) they stated that they did not know what that would look like for them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is very frustrating because I'm trying to be a reasonable and fair boss, and am a bit insecure atm, so I may be seeing things that aren't there. At times I feel like an asshole when I have to correct behavior; at times I feel like I am being gaslit.  I need to be able to control and manage my section, but I don't know which end is up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My father posts almost everything to social media and I have asked him specifically to not post about me in the past. When he got remarried, I asked him not to post pictures of me from the wedding on there. He agreed and I didn't think it would be an outlandish request given the fact that I wasn't asked to be in his wedding. \n\nWeeks go by and I get a text from a family friend saying how great I looked at my dad's wedding. I asked what they meant by that (they weren't invited) and they said they saw the wedding pictures on my dad's Facebook page. I texted my dad and asked him to remove the ones of me. He apologized and said his wife posted them for him.\n\nHe came to visit me not too long ago and I asked him not to take any pictures of me. I said that I was upset that he and his wife didn't respect my request to remain off of the internet and he said he wouldn't take any. During the course of our visit, I noticed he would sneak some shots of me around my house or while we were out in the city. I asked him to delete the pictures of me and he said that he would. \n\nWhen he returned home, he sent me some pictures from his trip and he included some of the sneaky shots he took of me. I went off on him, stating that he betrayed my trust once again. He said that I'm his daughter and he has a right to take my picture. I told him he does not, especially since he has lied to me in the past about keeping me off social media. He goes on about how, in the end, pictures are all we have and since we don't see each other often (due to a strained relationship), he wants something to remember me by. \n\nWe didn't talk for a number of months and he ended up texting me, apologizing, and said he will respect my request to not have my picture taken in the future.\n\nHe is coming to visit again soon. AITA if I continue to not allow my father to take my picture in fear he will post it to social media?",

From the start, it wasn't great. He could tell I wasn't feeling it, but I tried to assure him that all was good, I wasn't in pain, I was just a bit tired. I finally tell him that I'm sorry, but something is obviously not working down there for me, maybe we could try again tomorrow. He agrees. I get up to go to the bathroom and he says to me:\n\nHusband: \" are you still taking the muscle relaxers from your back?\"\nMe: \"No. I took the last one 3 days ago\"\nHusband: \" Yeah, those stay in your system for like a week\"\nMe: \"I did not know that. I'm sorry things weren't working out\"\nHusband: \" It makes sense though. It was kind of like throwing a hotdog down a hallway\"\n\nI was genuinely hurt by this and didn't come back to bed, but laid down on the couch instead.

      "description": "Sorry, this is long... I'm basically venting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I (35M) live with one of my college classmates (call her Lily 30F) in our final semester. She did me a solid by letting me live with her and her gf, and not charging me exorbitant rent. Tbh though, I felt she kind of owed me for basically dragging her ass through all the previous semesters. Not to mention befriending her when the entire class either pretended she didn't exist or made jokes about her. Since I became her friend, the other students quit being dicks. Ironically, Lily talks about how she is glad she had the courage to come out of her shell and become friends with people (absolutely never happened). I give her weed, feed her pets, fix things around the house, etc. The odd time she gives me a ride to and from school. \n\nIn between bong hits (at school) Lily complains about how confusing things are. When I helped her in previous semesters I tried to actually teach her, not just give answers like she wanted. So eventually I decided to give her some diplomatic advice (stop smoking weed all the time, attend lectures, and stop playing video games all day). I'm a pot smoker myself so I figured my advice might hold weight. She instead acted like I was a total asshole, which I assumed would happen even though I was really nice about it, and since then our relationship has been strained.\n\nIn the meantime, we were given a large project and two months to do it. I spent a month doing the work on and off, and yesterday we were scheduled to present it. Now I knew she wouldn't do any work, but she kept saying how she wanted to do something. So, when my girlfriend was able to visit me last minute a few days before the due date, I asked Lily to spend about 15 minutes preparing a Power Point format and grabbing a couple screen shots while my gf and I spent the weekend together. When the time came for her to show me what she did, she of course did nothing. She spent the entire weekend getting stoned and playing RDR2. Instead of apologizing, she simply stated she did nothing and gave me a bs excuse. I expected her to do nothing, but lying to me and not apologizing pissed me right off. When she then told me I can take time out of my day and do the work with her I acted pissed off but didn't speak my mind clearly, just kinda pouted and gave her the cold shoulder. I was hurt, and quite honestly I'm afraid she'll fuck with my stuff at home or change the locks (probably just me being paranoid). But I should have been clear.\n\nShe reciprocated the cold shoulder. Soon after I broke the ice and tried to coordinate our presentation. She presented me with her late contribution, that was a total piece of shit, yet still probably took her an hour (bravo). Over breakfast I redid it entirely, keeping only a background image. I ask her to come to class a little early so we can set up. She agrees but doesn't offer me a ride or anything (it was cold and raining, and a 30 minute walk for me). I again do all the prep work, break the ice again and make jokes to ease the tension. We present, and it actually went well. I did all the complicated explanation, and somehow she came out looking like she did work. Things aren't as tense now, but I'm still pissed. She doesn't thank me, and of course still doesn't apologize. Which is all I want. I can't stop thinking about it, which is why I wrote this post. Because quite honestly I know SHE is the asshole and she can go fuck her incompetent, self-absorbed, trashy self. I hope her cowardice and addictions haunt her for ever. Maybe that actually makes me an asshole :P",

      "description": "His ex wife left him homeless and everyone is staying with me because she no longer has custody. He's been saving up a lot to get gifts for his kids. I didn't really realize that. I don't know why but when I was buying gifts, I immediately thought of it as a way to be better than him at it. It was kinda playful to me. I bought extremely expensive gifts and I specifically went for stuff that they're extremely interested in. I've been shopping for a while and I finally showed him what I bought for them. He immediately bursted into tears. He ranted about everything going on with him and he said that he felt ashamed. I felt extremely guilty about it. He obviously felt extremely insecure about everything he bought. I thought since we treated everything as a competition, he'd be fine. But, he wasn't at all, I ended up putting on all of them were from him and only leaving a few from me but I still feel like a huge asshole. I talked to him about it earlier today and he said that it's not about him. Nonetheless, I don't feel any better. ",

We got into a lengthy discussion at dinner today about the poor vs rich. I'm well read on political theory and he is not so it was a fact vs emotion argument. I flat out told my brother that he is poor because of our parents I said Jeff Bezos didn't force our parents to give birth to children they couldn't afford, send us to public school, feed us food doused in chemicals and sit us in front of the TV instead of teaching us valuable skills.  Our parents did that and their parents before them did that our entire bloodline is fill with bad parents. I didn't insult anyone, I didn't say it was necessarily my parents fault I said their parents did the same thing they perpetuated the poverty cycle and it's up to someone in our bloodline to make a sacrifice and be a good parent which no one thus far has done. My brother again did not hear it and simply believes in this zero sum game of finance. ",

      "description": "I’d like to start this off with a bit of background info. \n\nI am a 15 year old boy. When I was 10 my mom lost custody of me after a long battle (around 2 years). Since then, I’ve been living with my dad, which has improved my life for the better and have had no contact with my mom other than the time I texted her wishing her a happy mother’s day back in 2017. She asked for an apology after I texted her that, saying that what I texted her meant nothing.\n\nMy mom was mentally and sometimes physically abusive, which made me want to live with my dad. My parents divorced back in 2012 when I was 8.\n\nFast forward to last week when I was visiting my hometown (St. John's, Newfoundland). Up until then, it had been around 2 years since I was last there, and I visit every so often because a very large majority of my family lives there. My grandma on my dads side lives in St. John's, so we spent most of our time there. \n\nHowever, we decided one day to visit Bell Island, which is another island in Newfoundland where I spent a lot of time. My grandma on my moms side lives there (which is why I spent a lot of time there). I have not heard anything from my moms mom for about 7 years, so I decided to visit her out of the blue, just to see how she was.\n\nAlso for a bit of context for this next part, I have an 18 year old sister. \n\nEverything was going great until I asked how my mom was (not in a shit disturbing way but I was genuinely curious). Once I asked this, my grandmas tone completely changed, she said “I think you should ask for yourself, I hate what you did to her and I find it unbelievable”. \n\nShe continued on her rant and my sister even joined in, making me feel like an asshole. I was incredibly angry until I realized that she only knows my moms side of the story, which is probably some victim bullshit sob story. \n\nAs my sister and I were about to leave, she made me promise that I’d see her again before I left to go back to Ontario, I quickly said yes and got the hell out because I was feeling very uncomfortable. \n\nI haven’t spoken to her since and I didn’t see her, I’m back in Ontario now and I’m feeling very conflicted because she made me super uncomfortable but I feel bad for some reason. \n\nSorry for the super long post and shitty writing, this is my first time making a post like this. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\n\n",

      "description": "A friend of mine (let's call her \"Katie\") recently organized a camping trip to celebrate her birthday. Everyone split the cost for food and reserving the campsite, and a few of us (myself included) pitched in extra by bringing tents and other camping gear or driving people to and from the campsite. Most of us also brought a gift for Katie. There were around ten or twelve people on the trip in total, though not everyone stayed for the whole time.\n\nA few days before we were supposed to leave, I realized that one of the other attendees (I'll call her \"Elizabeth\") was also going to have a birthday during the trip. Elizabeth is one of my oldest friends, but has only been good friend with Katie for a year or so, so I figured that Katie hadn't realized that their birthdays are so close together. Elizabeth is a quiet and modest type, so I doubted she'd speak up about it herself, but I would have felt bad if her birthday went by without anyone acknowledging it. So, I texted Katie to give her a heads-up that Elizabeth's birthday would fall during the trip, and offered to pick up a cake or a card or whatever she thought would be best.\n\nTo my surprise, Katie was completely against the idea and told me in no uncertain terms that she did not want to celebrate someone else's birthday during her birthday trip. I reminded her that the whole trip was already dedicated to celebrating her birthday, and it didn't seem like a huge deal to briefly acknowledge Elizabeth's birthday as well. She just kept repeating that it was HER birthday and HER party, and she wasn't going to share it with anyone else. \n\nI was really upset by that point and almost decided to skip the trip entirely, but ended up going because I'd already paid my share and committed to bringing a couple of tents. I brought a card and a small gift for Elizabeth, which I gave to her privately.\n\nWeirdly, Katie did end up bringing a cake for Elizabeth. My theories for this are: 1) she had a last-minute change of heart, or 2) that was the plan all along, and she wanted to make herself look like the only one who bothered to remember.\n\nI feel like I wasn't out of line here, but I don't know. Is there some rule about this that I didn't know about? Am I the asshole?",

I was able to say goodbye and see him last week but will be returning home tomorrow to spend the weekend with family.\n\nToday has been an obviously weird day for me. \nI’m already terrible at expressing my emotions (I bottle everything in and compartmentalize it)\n\nI’m on my way home from work when she calls me and reminds me of the happy hour. Turns out, this happy hour is a memorial happy hour for one of her friends that died recently. Literally the last thing I want to be at. \n\nI show up and I will admit that I wasn’t really trying to be social. It was a loud bar and not really where I spend my Friday nights. After about an hour and a beer I see that this wasn’t just a happy hour and that her friends came a long way and wanted to go out somewhere else. \n\nI felt misled a little and pulled my gf to the side and told her that I was going to head home soon. \n\nShe immediately starts tearing up and we walk outside and have an intense 15-20 minute conversation outside.\n\nBasically I was saying that I wasn’t really in the mood to be social and wanted to go home and think about my day and family. I didn’t want her to leave her friends because she doesn’t see them often and they came and long way but would also be happy if she wanted to join me as well. \n\nShe was upset and thinks that I don’t want to her to be with me and why can’t she come \n\nI started to get pretty annoyed and said something along the lines of wtf my grandfather died. I don’t want to be at an event remembering someone who recently died. It has nothing to do with you but I also don’t think you shouldn’t ditch your friends because they are expecting to hang with you and I will be okay let’s hangout later.\n\nShe doesn’t like this response because me asking her to stay with her friends means that I don’t want to see her. She’s crying outside of this bar and this conversation wasn’t going anywhere so I caved and we both went back inside only for her best friend pull her to the bathroom and then come back and decide that they were all leaving and going back to my gf’s house. My gf then passive aggressively told me to go home since I didn’t want to be there anyways and that she was sorry for forcing me to come. but I stuck around and spent time with them and we all ordered food and hung out for a few hours.\n\n\nI feel like she shouldn’t have reacted the way that she did. It was annoying that she immediately turned me wanting to be alone into  me not wanting to spend time with her and her friends.\n\nAITA for wanting leave her friends and wanting her to stay with them? \n\nI have to say that my grandfather and I weren’t very close and I didn’t know him that well. She knows this.",

      "description": "I'm using a company's pretty expensive service to help me with a visa process to move to another country for work. My background is complicated so I need their help.\n\nBut they have presented issues I'm not happy with and I'm trying to figure out if me getting frustrated and angry with them is valid or me being an asshole -\n\n1. They don't respond for days unless I ask for an update. The work has been delayed by a month so far. Once they took a week to let me know that they couldn't open a document. They only informed me of this when I emailed for an update and right after the call they magically managed to open that document. Indicating they hadn't tried to work on that before I contacted them. \n\n\n2. Most of their work revolves around entering information in forms based on documents that I provide to them. So, far they have made mistakes in multiple places in those forms which could have been resolved by going through the documents properly or asking me.\n\n\n3. The above wouldn't be an issue if they hadn't decided to submit my application even though I asked them not to till I cross check and confirm those changes.\n\n\n4. They made an assumption about a detail related to my education that would have been considered as \"misinformation\" for the application and could have led to officials banning me from applying for a few years or worse. All they had to do was ask me to confirm first. The online form has some viewing limitations, so I found out about this mistake through pure luck.\n\n\n5. They didn't provide me with proper information about one part of the process for my work history even though they were aware of my situation for months. I had to request my employer to correct things on documents I was requesting from them which is an awkward thing for me because I feel I am bothering them and also they might think of me as not being thorough before asking for help. It's even more complicated because one of my past employers\n\nAll of the above has caused me to get frustrated and tensed over a period of time and I end up getting angry at them about these issues.\n\nTheir point of view as per me for the above points - \n\n1. I am responsible for making sure I reach out to see if there has been progress even though I think it's just as much their responsibility if not more. \n\n2. Mistakes happen and I was fine suggesting changes to some extent. But not after point 4 happened. \n\n3. They can update information later on for the application but this shouldn't have happened if the client explicitly said not to. \n\n4. Check point 2\n\n5. Companies/employers shouldn't have problems with helping me out and it's my own hesitations in bothering them repeatedly. \n\n\nI feel guilty for expressing my frustration because I want to do a better job of talking calmly and discussing thing through. But AITA for reacting like this at all? ",

      "description": "The idea came to me about a month ago based on a Reddit post. I went to various adult chatrooms, and I went to the \"older for younger\" section. I made a fake Kik account and I then I went into the chatroom said that I was an 18 year old college student who was selling nude pics (I'm actually a 22 year old male). I downloaded a bunch of nudes (no faces). Then, I went into the chatroom and said something like \"18f looking for an older man to spoil me. Kik me at xxxxxxxxx\"\n\nAfter posting this in the public chat, I had almost 30 Kik messages. All these men were desperate for the \"privilege\" of getting to spoil some girl online who they never met. Some of them would ask for face pics, and I just deleted those chats because I don't think that it's right to use somebody else like that. \n\nI asked for a 20 dollar Amazon gift card in exchange for pictures. I used an old rooted Android phone and a tool that makes the pictures look live (because Kik tells the other person if the photos were taken with the Kik camera) Someone offered me 50 dollars to see a video of me using a dildo. I sent them a video I got from Pornhub (again with no face) and sent it to him. Many men would come back to me asking for more but I would just tell them that I couldn't send any more because my boyfriend found out what I was doing.\n\nI kept doing this whenever I had free time. Out of every 10 men who messaged me, I probably sold nudes to 2 or 3 of them. \n\nPart of me feels like this was wrong. I certainly was ripping these men off. They could have easily found similar pictures or Brazzers or Reddit or Google images. But the other part of me feels like I did nothing wrong. They get exactly what they asked for and they probably felt pretty good about their purchase. I didn't scam anybody. I said that I would send pictures and I did. Even though I did use pictures of somebody else, they had no faces in them so they could never be traced back to the person. \n\nSince I didn't want anything traced back to me, I only accepted Amazon gift cards from my \"clients\". I spent them quite soon after I received them, because it was the holiday season and I also had quite a bit of things I wanted for myself. Today, I went into my Amazon account and added up all of my orders and my current gift card balance. They totaled to $690. I had made almost 700 dollars from pretending to be an 18 year old girl and selling nude pictures. I had no idea I was making so much money from this. I couldn't have done this more than 15 times in the month, but I made 700 dollars from desperate old guys online.\n\nTLDR: I made a fake Kik account, posed as a 18 year old girl, and sold nudes to horny older men and made $700 dollars in a month.",

      "description": "So I've been seeing this girl (who we'll call Sarah) since two Saturday's ago and we immediately hit it off. We are always joking around and messing with each other. We would text all the time and she would always respond to me within a minute or two even if she was at work or with other people.\n\nNow, this past Saturday, we went to her brother's (who we'll call Dave) house to drink and play Cards Against Humanity. Her brother's fiancee (who we'll call Jane) was there and so were a couple other people. \n\nAfter we had been drinking for a bit, I noticed Jane had a tattoo behind her ear of a college logo. This college logo happened to be my alma mater and I told her I liked it. Now, while telling her this, I pointed at it. I'm 70% sure I never touched her, but I was drunk so I might have. But even if I did, all I did was touch briefly behind her ear. \n\nShortly after this, Dave stormed out of the room and Sarah chased after him. They were outside for about 20 minutes, and then Sarah came back inside and told me Dave was super pissed off because I touched Jane's tattoo. \n\nDave avoided me for about an hour and then eventually sat down next to me. I struck up conversation with him about video games and marvel characters, and he was totally nice to me and didn't mention me touching his fiancees ear once. \n\nSarah and I left a few hours later, and her demeanor toward me immediately changed. She just acted started acting weird. We didn't joke around at all, and she showed no affection toward me. \n\nOver the next few days when I would text her, she would take hours to respond, and when she did respond, it would be very short and straight to the point responses. After a few days of this, I flat out asked her what was going on, and she flipped out. She's taking her brother's side and saying it was completely inappropriate that I touched Jane's ear. Apparently Dave told his and Sarah's mom that I touched Jane's ear and now Sarah's whole family hates me. \n\nSo AITA in this situation?",

The funny thing is that I was actually getting along with the family, particularly her uncle. \n\nAfter they left, she told me she was sick of their bigotry and I said that I think the best approach to the situation is a charm offensive not through anger.

She told me not to worry about it and to pay her back after I get paid.\n\nSo I paid for my ticket, and exclusively told her that i ONLY had enough money to cover myself (food)  and no other expenses.she was begging me to go up an extra day- i advised her i am not willing to pay the extra day airbnb fee because i am not a strict budget and one day was enough for me.\nShe told me that she would cover the cost in total.\nFast forward to the trip, 3 hour drive, her car. I DROVE because she didnt want to, I also put 45$ of my money into gas.\nWe get to the airbnb, which has cameras- she tells me that it will cost EXTRA for me to be there bc she thought she could sneak me in.\nI ended up paying the 15$ extra for night 1&amp;2 bc she was yelling at me and told me if I didnt pay she was going to ignore the airbnb owner until he came up himself and confronted me (?).\n\nDay of the concert- i sit in a tattoo parlor for 6 hours with her so she can get a 700$ tattoo....\n\nJust so happens I had 2 buddies from our hometown visiting family near venue and they were also going to the concert. I told my friend we can meet there and take a 2$ subway trip to venue. She agreed.\nWhen we got to buddies place she was complaining &amp; btched and moaned until we agreed we would get in uber with her. \non way back buddies asked if they could tag along on trip home in the morning as train tix would cost them 150$, and THEY LIVED LITERALLY ON THE WAY HOME. WE WOULD *NOT* HAVE TO GO OUT OF OUR WAY TO PICK THEM UP *OR* DROP THEM OFF*\n\nMy friend said yes as long as they tossed gas money- everyone was happy and we departed. (When i was alone with my friend i made sure to ask if she was comfortable/ didnt feel obligated)\n\nFastforward to morning, I am driving. In car friend asks me to ignore my buddies and just leave without. I said no?\nWe made it to my place and instead of taking the boys home, just kicked them out at my place and sped away.\n\nAnyways fast forward a week.  I send the money for the airbnb and the extra person fees.. \n texts me saying I owed her 60$ for parking fees, and '60$ for the second airbnb night &amp; asking me to have BOTH my friends pay her 60$ each for the ride back to our hometown (they agreed to 15$ each as 30$ is gas for the whole way). Her excuse for asking for so much is that they would have had to pay more for a train so 60$ each aint too much...\nAnyways i sent her the screenshots of our previous conversations of me exclusively telling her the money i had and what I could spend, and advising none of this was an issue until she spent 700$ on a tattoo. \nShes now told me that i am a piece of shit and a good friend would give her more money and shes broke.\n\nTL;DR\nFriend invited me out and after exclusively advising the money i had to spend and contribute (which she was paid and more), she still asked for more money.",

      "description": "Throwaway yadda yadda yadda TLDR at the bottom.\n\nMy boyfriend works 3rd shift at a job that that has lots of room for upward mobility, but his position is kind of low on the totem pole. He was looking for new work for a while but caught wind from his superiors (who he is in good standing with) that he’s the next in line to move up. This means he could get off 3rd shift and make a lot more money, which he really needs right now.\n\nLast week my boyfriend was asked to work 3 days of 1st shift at a second location this upcoming week. They didn’t tell him why but he jumped on the opportunity. He theorizes that they’ll looking for a new supervisor at this second location and they can use this chance to see how well he works there. He asks me if I can make sure he’s up at 8:30-9 Monday morning and I figure sure, no problem, I’m always up by then anyway.\n\nFor some relevant information, he was up at 10am Sunday then went to work at 9pm, then came back home at about 4am and went to bed shortly after. Both our alarms go off at the same time at 8:30am but he cannot be woken up. He is the heaviest sleeper I have ever met, he will sleep through natural disasters if he’s tired enough. I try to get him up and all I get is snapped at to “fuck off”. I go give myself some space and at a little after 9 I try again. He’s coherent enough to tell me that he isn’t bothering, he absolutely cannot get up and be functional right now.\n\nOn one hand, I know that being awake for so long has to be very hard and switching schedules is even harder, and since his job involves operating heavy machinery he had a point. But on the other hand I’m so upset because he need a promotion. He lives paycheck to paycheck and I’m happy to chip in more since I make more (we live together) but I’m about to have new car payments and I would like to see him start saving. We’ve been talking about moving and potentially my going back to grad school and we both agreed that can’t happen until he has a better position. He could have just ruined his chances.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend slept through an opportunity to look good for a potential promotion at work. He didn’t sleep in because he is lazy, he slept in because he worked an 8 hour shift after being up for 12 hours before that. It’s not my job or my life but I’m still mad anyway because we’re stuck in a rut until he advances in his career. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting a relationship with my Biological father?",
      "description": "First post on Reddit and I’m typing this up on mobile. I’m a 24 year old male and I want to get to know my biological father. \n\nMy mom got pregnant with me when she was 16 and at the time she was in a relationship with my dad. Things were fine for awhile and they kept their relationship together throughout the pregnancy. After the pregnancy is when the issues started arising and their relationship ended. \n\nMy dad was hanging around with the wrong people and got involved with a group of guys going around and breaking into stores after business hours and stealing merchandise. Without going into too much detail it all came to an end after a couple years and he had spent most of my life in various jails and prisons. An important factor in this for me is that none of his crimes were violent and he has not been to prison since he last got out around 10 years ago. \n\nWhen I was 16 my dad signed his parental rights to my mom and my step dad adopted me. This was in exchange for all past child support to be “forgiven”. My mom and step dad always told me that he was essentially putting a price on me as if I was only worth \nso much money to my dad. \n\nAfter I turned 18 is when my dad began to try and contact me again, but he wasn’t asking me for anything other than to meet up... so I gave him that shot. I met him for a burger and noticed he wasn’t quite the guy that had been describe to me. He was friendly, laid back, and looked identical to me. When I told my mom and step dad I had met him they were furious and went into detail about how abusive he was and essentially what a piece of trash he was. I believed them. \n\nAt this point I’m 19-20 years old and have moved out of my moms house into an apartment of my own. The woman I was in a relationship with at the time suggested I try to reach out to my dad again and get to know him more, which I did. I met him and his soon to be wife for dinner and after that they invited us to their house. We went and spent a few hours up there but I couldn’t help but feel guilty for going against what my mother had said. \n\nFast forward to just before my 21st birthday. I had been around my dad off and on the majority of the previous year and had nothing but good experiences. But this is where the AITA part comes in. My mom and step dad somehow found out I had been hanging out around my Bio dad and essentially gave me an ultimatum. They said I could choose between seeing my dad or seeing my mom and step dad. They also threw in that if I chose to stay around my dad they would prohibit my younger brother and sister from seeing me (Both were minors at the time and one is still a minor currently). So AITA for wanting a relationship with my dad without having to sneak around and hide things from my mom? ",

      "description": "Me and my SO have been together for quite some time. We've been through rough patches and worked through them all. We love eachother to bits. Ive told her that she's my first everything (from relationship to sexual stuff) - this is completely true. She told me the same and I believe her.\n\nSo the other night we were together getting takeout and I saw her logging in to her account on the delivery app. I saw her password and jokingly tried logging in to her social media account infront of her. The password worked and we both had a laugh because of it working but because we had to do something else I forgot to log off. \nThe next morning I woke up and scrolled through said social media site, *thinking I was logged in on my account*, I saw I had a DM from someone and opened it. As I was still fuzzy from waking up and confused because I didn't know the person messaging me I did a quick scroll through the list of contacts to see if I was on the wrong account. This is where any trusting BF may stop and log off but my eyes came to rest on a message where she texted the dude saying stuff like \"I love you❤❤❤\"\n\nThis worried me and upon further inspection I saw that she started talking with the guy during one of our rough patches, telling him that he's the only one for her and even sexual talk.\n\nI'm afraid to talk to her about it as it happened a while back and since then she's stopped talking to her. I just can't stop thinking about it and want to know if I'm in the wrong here",

      "description": "2 situations presented themselves to me. \n\nI didn't want to invite my sister to Thanksgiving despite the rest of my immediate family coming up. I regularly bash heads with her and she regularly creates an atmosphere passive aggression and all around disingenuousness. She has consistently came to my town to see her boyfriend(4-5 hours from where she lives) and doesn't tell us or say hi but gives us flak for not catching up with her. She could go to Thanksgiving with her boyfriend instead. WIBTA for not inviting her?\n\nI don't want to invite my Wife's Brother's Wife's Mother to Thanksgiving. She's a constant source of negativity, able to turn the mildest comment into some cospiritorial slight. She's got her good days but she's controlling and manipulative and her daughter is constantly guilted into appeasing her. We're fairly sure it's all the drugs she did in the 60's-80's that makes her be not her best self. My brother in law and his wife are good friends of ours and are coming but her mom is a terror. But she has no one else to be with for Thanksgiving. I don't even know if this should be part of the equation or if it's part of her manipulations by excluding herself from her other kids' plans or at least omiting her options. WIBTA for not inviting her?\n\nI know I don't owe it to anyone to feed them and include them in an event, but one is family and the other is basically also family. \n\nBonus round: I did invite my sister, she's coming for dinner but going to her boyfriend's after, I'm glad this plan happened without her knowing I was iffy on her coming. And we left the decision to my BiL and his wife, they're the closest to her mother and will be able to best determine her state of mind for the day and whether she wants to handle the crowd. We are determined to be okay with their choice. I am fairly sure I was not the asshole in these situations but I'll leave it to the vote to see what come up.",

      "description": "First of all, my family is pretty notable because my dad is a somewhat famous politician. I hate talking or telling people about it and usually don't even tell people so they don't judge me. I actually think I am pretty humble about it and am actually making a name for myself through basketball. But anyway my families been campaigning pretty hard to get my dad back in office and, one day, my family holds a raffle for an event, and that morning my mom wakes me up and tells me to wake my girlfriend up to sign a couple raffles on her way out the door. Me being super groggy, thinks why wake my girlfriend? I'll just quickly sign this with MY name and crash back out instead of waking her up. And what do you know, I win the Grand Prize of a signed guitar by my dad lol! It's funny and badass that it's signed by my dad, but my older brother who's actually been working pretty hard on the campaign aswell, texts me saying everyone agrees he should keep it because he's been one of the hardest workers, and I'm thinking 'Fuck that, if they thought that, why don't they just pitch in and grab him one?' And also, i was a little pissed they just gave it away right off the bat without saying anything to me. So they get back, and we're all checkin it out, and I just straight up say it, 'it's my guitar, I won it man.', and he goes 'we already agreed dude' and 'it's not even supposed to be yours, mom said tell *girlfriend* to sign it. It doesn't look good having his son participate in the family raffle, it's for the people.' I understood that last part, but completely spaced it out when I was filling them out that morning. But to be fair, I won it under MY name. He gives it to me kinda pissed. Then I tell my girlfriend, now she says it should be hers and she can give it to her brother who plays guitar. But then again, it was won under MY name. I was just as hopeful as any other raffle and genuinely felt pretty ecstatic to win the GRAND PRIZE. I definitely wasn't gonna give it up that easy. Tbf, I don't play guitar, but it's signed by my pops which is pretty dope, and sure as hell don't wanna give it up.\n\n\"money won, is a lot sweeter, than money earned..\" -Dodgeball, 2004",

      "description": "FYI: On mobile. I’m sorry for any formatting issues. \n\nOkay, so here’s what happened. My parents are a prime example of people who should never ever own dogs. They have a bad history of surrendering them and, yet, they keep getting more dogs. A few weeks ago, they told me they were getting a new puppy. I explained to them why this was a terrible idea, and they still got a dog (craigslist puppy, taken too early from mother, no vaccination record, all the red flags).                                   I decided that, while I couldn’t do anything about their decision, I could love and train the puppy. \n    \nThe puppy play-bites, like all puppies do. It’s a completely natural thing and one of the easiest things to anticipate a puppy doing. The problem is, my parents keep hitting the puppy when he bites. I’ve explained to them that it’s not constructive, harmful, etc... and provided better ways to teach the puppy. They wholeheartedly defend their decision to constantly hit the puppy on the nose. \n\nToday, I once again began explaining thoroughly that it’s not the best way and I got fed up with their insistence that they would keep hitting the puppy, who doesn’t understand and can’t defend himself. He’s not an aggressive pup. He’s just teething and needs positive training. I popped my dad on the nose (no harm, right? according to them). It wasn’t enough to hurt, just enough to reinforce that he doesn’t like it either. Of course, he was pissed and I’m wondering AITA? \n",

      "description": "My stepson is 8. I've been with his dad for 5 years, married for 1. I've been involved in my step son's life for 4 years. Last year, my step son was diagnosed with a learning disability that is not an insurmountable obstacle, but is bad enough that the specialist recommended a specialized school for him.\n\nBetween my husband, my stepson's mom, and me, we didn't make enough to afford the school. My parents offered to pay, and my husband and my stepson's mom agreed because it was best for my stepson. My parents are generous people and just came into a large amount of money from my grandmother's passing, which they have put away entirely to fund their grandchildren' education. They also live on the other side of the country, so we rarely see them, but when we do, they definitely take on a grandparent role with my stepson.\n\nThe thing is, my husband and his ex refuse to tell my stepson where the money for his education is coming from--ever. I don't think they need to tell him right now, but I think when he's older, it's unfair not to tell him that the reason he will graduate debt free from college is because of my parents' generosity. My step son's mom is open about the fact that she does not want him to know because she doesn't want her son to value my family's contribution over hers. My husband won't even engage with her over it, but I can tell he agrees with her and is uncomfortable with the difference in resources.\n\nI'm not trying to do this so my stepson will like me more than his mom or anything like that, I just feel terribly for my parents because they aren't being recognized or thanked and never will be. On top of that, my stepson often asks why my parents don't come around very much and don't take him out and buy him gifts like his bio grandparents do, and it makes me so sad that he can't see what they're doing for him because they love him like they love their other grandkids.\n\nMy husband is refusing to engage with me about this and it's making me feel terrible. I know I'm just a step parent and not a bio parent, but it hurts me to see my family be treated like this. I just want my stepson to know one day so he can look back and understand that my parents love him much as they love their other grandkids. It's making me question how much my husband values me and how he sees me as a step mother. Am I wrong? Should I let it drop? I'm hurt but also very conflicted, because I want what's best for my stepson, but I also want my parents to feel appreciated.\n\nAITA for wanting my stepson to know the truth, even though his bio parents don't agree?",

      "description": "My husband is one of those veterans who feels uncomfortable when people thank him for his service and never takes advantage of veteran discounts, so yesterday he didn't feel a need to go to Applebee's for his free meal or hit up any other spots for a freebie. Since he had the day off, though, a haircut was in order. He kissed me and our 6-week-old baby goodbye, and off he went. Seven hours later he returns, very drunk, and passes out for a few to recoup.\n\nHe's a veteran and had the day off work, so why am I pissed? Because it was my first day back to work. Granted, I'm working from home right now, but I had to show up on my laptop and address issues, reply to emails, etc. On top of that, new baby was not in the mood to take a nap unless he was in someone's arms, which were mine because mine were the only ones available. \n\nNo call, no text to check in. Part of me feels like an asshole because he's a fucking veteran, deployed three times, lost friends to war, both during and after to suicide. He deserves to drink beers with his buddies and toast everything army-related, but I'm also at home with our baby trying to get some work done, feeling alone and overwhelmed. Am I the Asshole? ",

      "description": "I’ll try and give as much context as possible in the shortest amount of time, for the purpose of the story we’ll call the manager Cheesecake, because I feel like it and people usually give the person in their story a bland name.\n\nSO after a small period of time working this job cheesecake began to move my shifts around to be different days than my contract (she does this with most people), we see the weekly timetable 4 weeks ahead so we have time to say no if we’re not able to do the swaps. I only work 3 days a week for short shifts, the main reason I have this job was to be flexible around my life and make sure I’m able to do most last minute plans that tend to pop up, often I had to say no just because I wasn’t sure if I’d be busy or not yet. I did however make it clear that IF I was free and they asked me first, I was fine doing overtime about a week or two in advanced.\n\nCheesecake starts swapping my stuff around a LOT, it gets a little bit stupid, I ask her if she’s able to stop doing that as I don’t want to keep having to say no and waste her time, explaining again that I’m happy to do overtime when I’m ABLE to etc to help out, Cheesecake does not take this well, is unhappy with me and claims I’m only willing to do things to suit me etc, conversation/argument ends in “fine, I’ll stick purely to your contracted hours and nothing else”, I try to remind her I’ll help when I can but Cheesecake doesn’t seem to care as she scribbles out my overtime.\n\nTime passes, sure enough my days don’t get swapped, I’m also asked to do overtime a LOT less frequently and when I do ask I usually get turned down, at one point I watched them ask everyone in the isle except me to stay but whatever, it’s better than my contract being a mess.\n\nHere’s where the problem pops up, you’re allowed to swap shifts with other colleagues here as long as you both consent to it and the hours covered/worked remain the same, I ask another manager (let’s call her Apple, why not), to swap a shift for me about a week in advanced as some last minute plans had come up, Apple swaps it for me and I figure that’s the end of it.\n\nNext day, Cheesecake comes to speak to me and she is not happy, complains that I’d agreed to stick to my contract and now I’m swapping when it “suits me”, I explained to her yet again that I’m happy to swap when I’m able to and do overtime if she asks, she tells me it’s not about overtime, it’s about suiting the needs of the company etc. The argument here is “if you don’t suit the needs of the company why should we suit you?” which tbf isn’t a bad argument, except that my whole point that “I can only help when I’m able to” is being treated as “can only help when I feel like it”. This conversation goes around in circles to a bit, apparently the fact I’m willing to do overtime if she asks is irrelevant cause, despite me doing them a favour in that aspect, it’s not do with swapping so there for I’m not doing my bit. Conversation ends with “you know what, next time you have plans on a day you’re working move your life around work instead, you’re no longer allowed to swap”\n\nI really don’t know if I’m in the wrong here, part of me wants to go to HR about it because (to my knowledge) I am the first/only person to be banned from swapping and this isn’t the first issue I’ve had with Cheesecake, there isn’t really a “business” reason for not allowing me to swap, it just effects me and the colleague I swap with, the hours get worked and it’s all fine. Other part of me thinks that because I’m unable to swap I’m bringing this all on myself/I deserve it, even though I’ve offered to help them any other way I can.\n\nTL;DR: Manager wants me to swap shifts in advanced, I don’t know if I can that far in advanced so I say I can’t do them",

      "description": "2 years ago me (german) and my bf (korean) quit our around 1 year, long distance relationship. The breakup was messy, emotional and not clean at all. However we have had genuine feelings for each other and though it wasnt easy, we stayed sporadically in contact.\n\nI visited him in Korea when we were still together and he introduced me to his best friends. I am and was very friendly with all 3 of them, though only one actually knew english decently enough to hold a conversation. He also is genuinely comfortable and funny to talk to, so we kept in contact even after I left Korea (which my ex was aware of) and developed a friendship ourselves. \nWhen my ex and I broke up, my contact with his friends except for that one faded. \n\nRecently my ex and I had a melancolic, yet friendly exchange and as per request i agreed to share more of my life with him. \nYesterday i told him that i was planning to send his friend a package per mail and that ive decided to include some small gift for himself and the friends I got to know during my visit all those years ago.\nHe flipped it.\nHe demanded to know if the friend i was sending it to, knew about the package. Ex then said that he intruduced me to his friend because he knew his friend wanted to have some foreign friends and that this kind of behaviour ( him not telling my ex earlier) is rude and not according to korean culture, basically implying that he did us a favour and that we now betrayed him. \nMind you, he knew that we have been in contact all the time, though.\nHe accused us of hiding the package-plans and we had a more and more escalating conversation.\n\nI guess its something that they, as friends have to figure out themselves, but i was so embarassed that my friend got in trouble because of me not holding my tongue and also outraged that ex felt the right to tell me how to handle my friendships that i ragequit the conversation and cut my contact with him. \n\nIm even more outraged that he cites \"korean culture\" as the reason for his reaction. Though I know enough Koreans to know, that its a totally individualistic choice to react in this kind of manner. \n\nCulture or not, am i right so suspect that his behaviour is hysteric or am I actually an insensitive asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to divorce my transgender wife (I am a lesbian)?",
      "description": "So I made a throwaway account because I really don’t want my wife finding this. I am a lesbian (38F) who was raised by extremely homophobic parents. They were Catholics and would often lecture me on the dangers of homosexuality, banned me from seeing my gay friends, etc. When I was a teenager they caught me kissing my girlfriend at the time because I got careless and left my door open, and they immediately kicked her out of the house and would not let me see her any more.\n\nSince then I’ve had to convince them that it was just a phase, otherwise I would be written out of the will and most likely disowned. I have no other family except my sister, but she’s 11 years younger than me and at the time would not have been able to help as she was still basically a child. So, I did something a bit regrettable. I married my best friend from high school. He was straight, which was a bit of a red flag, but at the time I didn’t really question it because we were very close and I would have done pretty much anything for him. The agreement was that our marriage would be completely platonic and for convenience’s sake, and that we could pursue relationships outside of it. \n\nSo 10 years pass, and in that time I get a girlfriend, who I’m still with to this day. She moved in with us, and wasn’t too happy about the situation, but got along well with my husband so she accepted him as a weird kind of roommate. \n\nThen my husband comes out as transgender. \n\nIt was a huge shock, as she (I’ll be using she from now on) had never really discussed this with me before, or given me any indication that she didn’t identify as a guy. She’d always been quite masculine (not to stereotype) and was into typical male things like football. Again, I don’t mean to be transphobic here at all, I’m just emphasising my point at how much I didn’t see this coming. Anyway, she tells me that she wants to start transitioning, which is a bit of a problem because my parents would not accept that. I suggested that it might be a good idea for us to get divorced now, but for some reason she refused. This was the point when I started to realise that she might have actual romantic feelings for me. She’d never really shown interest in finding anyone else, and often wanted to do things like cuddle with me, even kiss me on the cheek and things like that, but I’d always thought that was because we were such close friends. Anyway, I tried to insist, but she told me that my safety means more to her than transitioning. I think this is ridiculous and I don’t want to let her do that, because dysphoria is no joke. I think she’s hoping that I’ll magically become attracted to her and want to be together for real, but that just isn’t going to happen. I only see her as a friend. I want what’s best for her, which I believe is for us to divorce so she can get on with her life, but I feel bad forcing her into that when she’s done so much for me. \n\nAITA???",

I don't know why I did it but I'm trying really hard to get over it now, but even though I haven't cut in a while I still have the scars on my forearms, and I don't know how long they'll take to fade.  \n\n\nSo, here's my question: would I be an asshole for wearing short sleeves which expose the scars in public? I know that people don't want to see them, and they're kind of obvious if you even take a glance at my arm. I know seeing the scars could be a trigger in some people, and make them feel really uncomfortable, or worse it could be traumatic for other self-harmers to see them. On the other hand, it reaches 100+ degrees where I live in the summer, and I don't want to be wearing long-sleeve shirts through all of that.",

      "description": "So for context: I (33M) live in a city with crappy weather, and with my new work contract I negotiated for a pretty liberal remote-work policy specifically so I could spend time in sunny places during the cold, rainy months.\n\nSo to test out this plan, I've been planning a trip to Thailand for the next couple weeks.  My girlfriend(29M) has been mostly supportive, if a little bit jealous that I would get to go somewhere awesome and sunny while she's unable to join.  She has to work, and she's still in the probationary period with her new job so she can't take vacation at the moment.  We do have plans to go somewhere really beautiful together in September when her probationary period ends.  \n\nSo that vibe changed this morning: I was researching my itinerary, and while watching videos about Thailand I found out that there's this island there where they do this huge party for every full-moon.  It would fit into my dates, so I told my girlfriend that this was something I wanted to do.\n\nWhen I told her this, she got kind of cold on the whole thing.  I can tell by the tone of her voice that she's clearly against the idea, and she told me \"just do whatever you want\" where before she was sort of positive about the whole trip.  She also told me she's disappointed that I still want to do go to a party like that \"at my age\".\n\nI think maybe I am too old for it, but at the same time when I'm traveling I try to be open to experiences, and not to worry about how I might be judged doing something because basically I won't ever see those people again.  Also I feel like if I'm a little too old for it now, if I don't go this trip then that will become more and more of an issue since I'm not getting any younger, so I partially feel like this is the time to go or chances are I not get another opportunity, which is something I could regret later.\n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to go, or am I being selfish for wanting to go to a massive, debauched party without my GF?",

      "description": "So me and this person have been friends for almost a decade.   we've done a lot of friends stuff together.  movies,  sleepovers when we were younger,  road trips, etc.\n\nAnyhow,  things began to get bad when my local newspaper that I work hired Amy to work under me. things were okay for a while until she started ditching me to hang out with her new partner,  leaving me to take photos and write for the paper.  because she was a friend and it would look bad on me,  I said nothing to anyone but her in private.\n\nShe then told me her partner was emotionally and a physically abusive to her.  she showed me messages he sent,  pictures of bruises,  very troubling stuff.  and I helped her break up with him. he know me enough to know my number and would call me and I would  either ignore it or  conjure some excuse.  they got back together and she started  ghosting again.  for 4 days,  she made no effort to communicate and kept her phone off. \n\nFinally she messagged me  telling me that she told her boyfriend everything we said in private and that she was cutting me out of her life. To better their relationship  then after I got angry,  she ignored me only to message me a few days later saying that he read our messages  and made her write that.  we met in private  because she didn't want to leave any cyber trail,  and she told me she was going to get a  restraining order on him and move back with her family.  but he had stolen her money before she left.  so I gave her $500  to go to her parents(they live on the other side of the country).\n\nHowever as soon as she leaves,  I noticed the camera for work is gone.  suddenly she blocked me on everything and my friend tells me that they were still together.  I finally caved and told the newspaper what it happen and managed to keep my job,  but I had to buy back the camera  and it's expensive lenses. so now I'm down $2,000. People keep telling me that she saying I was lying to her and Incredibly controlling and blackmailed her into sexual stuff over her job and when she refused,  I got her terminated. Those lies hurt more than anything.  I lost several good friends because of this.\n\nThat was a month ago.  a few days ago a strange number kept calling me,   I thought it was a robo caller until I noticed that they kept calling a lot more frequent. I answered the phone and it was her.  she said she wanted to talk to me in private and I said no and hung up.   and that brings us to Friday,  I  came home to find her in front of my house begging to talk to me.  I told her I had nothing to say to her and that I know about all the lies.  she tried countering and saying she was sorry and she wants me and her boyfriend in her life. that she knows he's abusive but he cares for her and is trying to get help for his temper.\n\nShe tried to apologize as I tried to unlock my door.  as I'm getting inside,  she catches the door and  attempts to get into the house and lost it.  I started screaming at her to get out.  after a bit to collect myself.  I told her I'd had enough.  I said something like \"you lied to me,  stole money and a camera off me.  I want you to remember how scared he made you feel the first time he punched you and you deserve it the next time it happens because you're still with him\",  I slammed the door.  she tried knocking  a bit without saying anything and then she left. Haven't heard from her since\n\nI shouldn't have said that last part but I'm not going to apologize or say another thing to her. She's done so much to me in the past couple of months that that would just open another way for her to continue this cycle. She's cut contact with most of her friends,  she doesn't talk to her parents and I've told them the basis of what's going on but won't go into detail. I do care for her but I tried to help and she stabbed me in the back.\n\nTL;DR: friend I work with tells me partner is abusive,  lies to get money off me to leave him, steals my work camera, gets back with him, then attempts to come back into my life and I snap and tell her off in the worst way possible.",

We talk almost everyday despite me moving away, and still meet up. She knows how I am and supposedly knows how I feel even if I don’t show it. She’s a really kind person and I’d do anything for her, so now I’m wondering if I should make more effort to show affection. I say this because she’s really cuddly. Like she’ll come sit on my lap or link my arm while we’re walking, that kind of stuff, and I just kinda stand there like an idiot trying to figure out what to do, which she finds hilarious. So considering how much she means to me am I an asshole for not being 'affectionate'?",

He got really mad about it and told me he never would, blah blah blah...after a couple of months of asking I gave up and the topic was never really brought up again. I have had a lot of issues with my mental health, depression and lack of self worth which I suspect led to these kinda fantasies. However, after a long hard year of learning to respect&amp;lovemyself more and value my relationship with my partner, I eventually stopped having those fantasies and could never dream about letting someone else have him (although this was never really discussed with my partner, the topic was just dropped)\n\nAnyway, fast forward to yesterday and my boyfriend is talking dirty to me and out of nowhere says he’s been “considering that fetish of mine”, that there’s some girl he’s extremely attracted to and would love to fuck. Basically felt my heart drop after, was absolutely heart broken and told him I needed space. He’s upset with me and is saying that it’s not fair for me to be upset when I’m the one who said I wanted it in the first place. (Last time I asked was well over a year ago) \n\nSo, looking for a third opinion here...AITA?",

Well as long as you ask for the day(s) off two weeks ahead of time you didn't have to get someone to cover you. I was always really good about putting in the days I needed off ahead of time. So I rarely need someone to cover me. however a couple times a few surprise things would pop up and I needed a cover it was a little hard but never too difficult. If they cover me I would cover a shift of the same hours at some point so if they asked me to cover a 5 hour shift and they only covered my three hour shift I would refuse. My coworkers started to get angry at me because whenever they asked I would tell them that since they haven't covered a shift of mine before so I am not gonna cover them. So am I the asshole?",

She's really beautiful (way above average, tall and attractive) but she still look a bit older than her age.\nI am not someone who mocks others (certainly not a bully), on the contrary. Even when I said what I said, I didn't mean it in a bad way. I said it like it's a fact (you know objectively without emotions) and certainly not like I was judging her looks.\n\nI feel such an asshole. I am honestly a very unattractive man. Short and ugly, top that with the fact that I'm old (29). She's in her early 20ies. I could've talked about myself. I definitely look like a 39 year old but NOOOOOOOOOOO I had to give an example of someone else.\nShe acted professionally. I mean she could've easily roasted me in front of everybody. \nI just feel like I am a bad person. I gave the impression that I am a bad person. And now that I look at it, I think I am a bad person. \nNow I feel that I am as much ugly on the inside as I am on the outside.\n\n",

      "description": "I’m on vacation and the entire time I’ve been pretty exhausted. My sleep clock hasn’t adjusted properly so I see myself collapsing at around one pm and waking up at around eight and staying up all night. \n\nYesterday was pretty harsh for me as we had a tour showing us Christmas markets. We had to walk everywhere and near the end I was getting pretty cold, tired, uncomfortable, etc. My mother didn’t take notice until the end and said that the next day (today) that I could stay back at the hotel to rest instead of coming with them to a black light show. \n\nToday I’m feeling pretty tired so I decided to tell her that I planned on staying. She and my brother (who always chips in whenever he sees her getting angry at me) started saying stuff about how “I wasn’t really tired and only wanted to go on my phone” and how I’m really selfish and rude for not going to this, how I’m going to “regret things in life if I don’t go to this”, when just earlier today my mother was saying to me about how I’m much more well behaved than my brother (who on the same day accidentally converted 1000 dollars into Czech money and then shifted the blame on my mother by saying “you shouldn’t have let me done it for you). I’m feeling really bad for staying in the hotel with the dog because I’m tired of today. So, ATIA? Are her actions justified? Or am I wrong and should’ve went with her \n\n",

I tell him that it is normal and that he shouldn't take any more since we don't know if it hasn't kicked in yet. I leave the room and when I come back he and a few others decided to take more. (you all know where this is going) After a while, Joe begins to cry while looking at pizza rolls on his phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone (around 10 more people) is looking at him and laughing. He then stands up watching everyone while balling crying. Tear by tear is running down his face. He goes to another room and sits crying alone. Two other guys, Jack and Jim, follow to help him. I tell them that it's better for him to be alone. They go and assist. I hear Joe say \"They are all cameras looking at me\" which is an indication that he is extremely paranoid. Jack comes back to me and talks about how funny it is to see Joe in that state. I tell him that he is an asshole and that he shouldn't be laughing at the way he is feeling. Joe was likely extremely paranoid and possibly having a panic attack. Yet, Jack thinks that it is ok to think that the situation Joe was in, was in fact, funny. Jack thinks I'm an asshole for yelling at him and some others for not taking Joe's crying seriously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr: one of my friends got too high and started crying. people laughed at him.

      "description": "(Please tell me if i'm doing something wrong - I am new to Reddit and i'm also on mobile, so formatting may be weird)\n\nSo, a couple of years ago, I was attending this summercamp. I was about 11-12  years old. \n\nAnyways, the first day of summercamp, I arrived and everything seemed normal. One thing that didn't seem right was this one kid, who held the door open, but always stared at me as I walked past with my friend. \n\nNear the end of the day, he moved to sit next to me during an activity, and I was a bit uncomfortable. He had been giving me weird looks all day, and trying to get close to me. \n\nHe then asks me to be his girlfriend (I have never spoken to him before this, besides \"thank you\") and I sorta freak out. We were in a public place, with other kids around. I explain to him, as calmly as I could, that I wasn't ready for a relationship. (Please note, he didn't know my name. I didn't know his either)\n\nAlthough he seemed a bit upset, he said ok, and that he wouldn't ask again. \n\nThat was a lie - \n\nHe asked me THREE more times over the next 2 to 3 weeks, constantly trying to get near me and asking me if I had though about it and wanted to be his girlfriend. \n\nEventually, I had enough, and told my friend to tell him that I had a boyfriend so he would leave me alone (I know, that's childish, but I was young and quite honestly, creeped out. I also felt bad, because he had hinted that he had a mental illness of some sort and I wasn't sure what to do).\n\nLater, he confronted me about it, claiming that I had told him 'I wasn't ready for a relationship' and stuff. Knowing I had been caught, I stuttered something, before practically running away. \n\nI stopped attending (not because of him, but moreso because my parents could no longer afford the camp), and when I returned the last couple weeks of Summercamp, I found out that he had stopped going when he figured out I wasn't going either. \n\nBut I want to know - was I the asshole for doing that? Rejecting him and telling him I had a boyfriend besudes the fact that he was intellectually disabled?\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend (30M) and I (28F) have lived together for about 3 years, we both smoke a lot of marijuana, cannabis, weed, pot, devils lettuce, whatever you want to call it. He works in the industry so he gets quite a bit for free and when we run out I buy more (with his industry discount). We have arguments over who smokes more or he gets upset because I like joints and he thinks they waste weed.  \n  \nBut that’s not what this is about, this is about a lighter. He goes to work really early and usually takes all of the working lighter with him to work. There have been so many times that I have searched high and low for a lighter with no luck. So I run to the store and get a new one. A few weeks ago I had a brilliant idea, I bought a bright pink Djeep lighter instead of a Bic and thought ‘he will never take this’ and when he got home I even said “I bought this so you won’t take it to work”.   \n  \nFlash forward to yesterday morning, we were both getting ready for work. He put the bright pink Djeep lighter in his pocket. I rolled a joint and before he left I said “hey you have my lighter!” He gave it me to light the joint and I put it in my pocket. He got super upset and went into this whole rant about how I can just buy a new one. He is right, I can.. but he can too. He made me feel bad for smoking weed that he got from work and I gave him the lighter to take to work. He left angrily without saying goodbye.  \n  \n\nI’m not sure what to think and I feel like an asshole for caring about a cheap little lighter but another part of me doesn’t know.  \n",

      "description": "Hey.\n\nFor context, \nI went out for dinner today with my friend, let’s call her Karen. Karen and I hang out everyday and talk, and I do enjoy her company, however, she isn’t the type of friend I would go to to talk about extremely personal matters, because she’s a very judgmental person and always has something bad to say about anyone, even if it’s just someone crossing the street or walking by. She also is very much involved in drama and her life revolves around social media. She’s been involved with SEVERAL drama and talks smack about anyone she doesn’t like or does something she doesn’t like, so I don’t trust her much. \n\nThere’s been some personal issues with my boyfriend lately, so I’ve been spending some time talking with him on the phone and to see how his day is. I don’t really talk to her about him, I would mainly go to our other mutual friends to talk about that, because they are more empathetic and aren’t the type of people to judge. They’re just easier to talk to. \n\nAnyway, onto what happened today. I was telling my friend about my boyfriend because she was asking, but Karen overhears this and starts asking me, “so when are you going to tell me about him?!” “Please I want to know, you won’t tell me!” “You’re keeping secrets” \n\nTo which I reply, “Sorry. I just feel like you’d spread it to everyone and then make judgmental remarks about myself and my boyfriend, that’s why.” \n\nThen I receive the silent treatment and she won’t talk to me about it. I genuinely want to know her thought process and communicate about it, but I really think there’s just a miscommunication here; would love to solve the problem if she would talk to me about it. \n\nPretty sure what I said was an asshole move, but I tend to be a direct/straightforward person and so I was just being honest.

Now fast forward to now. We still do not have a washer and dryer. It’s not for lack of finances because he bought a new tv. So I’ve started hand washing clothes at home and I am not going to the laundromat anymore. (Always creepy dudes, expensive, half the shit doesn’t even work etc.) I’ve been bothering him about getting one since we moved in and now I’m just so fed up with it.

      "description": "Title says most of it. My mom really wants me to come home for Thanksgiving because she hasn't seen me and my dog since August, and really misses us. My reasons for not wanting to go are:\n\n\\- I have no car and have to find a way to transport my dog home, and I haven't found an affordable option yet. It would literally be cheaper for me to pay for my whole family to come visit me instead. I could also work during Thanksgiving and make money to pay off a bunch of things I need to pay off.\n\n\\- We'll be spending the holiday away from my hometown, and the main reason I like coming home is to hang out with my friends from said hometown\n\n\\- I'm a college student, and quite frankly I'm very burned out and I have exams and essays due the following week. I am not doing as well as I want to this semester, and need to focus my energy on this final stretch so that I do well\n\n\\- I think I would enjoy a simple friends giving, and wouldn't be miserable staying on campus\n\n\\- I'm going home December 15th, so it's only a few weeks before I get to see my family.\n\nThe thing is, my mom REALLY wants me to come and I don't think she'll take it well at all. I'm thinking I should just suck it up and go, but I was wondering would I be the asshole if I told her no?",

      "description": " \n\nIn October 2018 I received a notification that a group I like will be playing at the local arena. I immediately sent it to my friend (Sarah) as she like them too and we agreed to get tickets. About an hour after that she texts all excited about the seats she got.\n\nWhich, to be honest are pretty good, center floor. However she's 5’9” and I'm 5’0”. So while she will have a great view I'll be spending the majority of the concert looking at shoulders and backs. I replied that those don't work for me both the location and the price and offered to back out if she had her heart set on them. I explained that I'm short and wouldn't be able to see the stage. \n\nSo later that day I receive another text that she bought 2 more tickets on the side bleachers that only cost $30 more than I had set as my limit and she could resell whichever set we didn't want. I said that it was too expensive for me and said I just couldn't attend at this point. I would have had trouble affording the ticket then. Now I wouldn't even consider - my expenses have exceeded my salary for 4 months now due to emergencies. The original plan was for her to post 2 of the tickets on a resell site and then see if another friend would sit with here but what happened is another friend and her mother are now going which still leaves 1 ticket and means 1 person will be sitting alone.\n\nAITA insisting that my ticket needs to be sold even though the concert was kind of my idea in the first place?

Next thing you know, girlfriends flatmates friend has walked in. Says his toilet is broken and flatmate doesn’t have any toilet roll so needs to use my girlfriend’s. I say “don’t worry about knocking” in a stern and sarcastic tone. \n\nHe mumbled something like “don’t be like that” as I left the room to make the cup of tea. A short while passes and I return to the cesspit that is my girlfriends room and I’m met with a reprimanding lecture about how rude I was and how I should apologise. Am I the asshole? \n\nIMO the guy just walked in to the room about a second after he said my girlfriends name. We could’ve been doing anything. What’s more is they are not friends, in fact my girlfriend is actively hostile with the flatmate, so why can the flatmates friend walk in like that?\n",

Sam's brother Luke insists I should've approached him about what I intended on doing, and we could've worked together and approach this from an angle of wanting to help Sam, as opposed to \"let's tell his parents for the sake of *hurting* him.\" Although this is true to an extent, I don't think me acting out of anger necessarily makes my actions bad.

      "description": "For background, my boyfriend of four years and I live together and share use of my car. The car is in my name, I purchased it before ever meeting him, it’s fully paid off so all I have to pay relating to it is insurance, maintenance and gas. My boyfriend still very much treats it as my car, and asks if he can use it before taking it. It is not used very frequently as we both walk to work, so it’s only used 2-3 times a week in the evenings.\n\n\nDuring my last oil change in the fall, I asked my mechanic for a full inspection and was told I would need a new battery soon (as expected since the car is almost 7 years old). I had planned to get a new battery installed, but then the car’s horn broke and needed to be replaced so I had that fixed instead. So the car still needs a new battery. It’s not a dire situation, I have indoor parking so I’m not leaving it outside in below freezing temperatures which would be worse for it. I was planning on replacing it in the spring. \n\nCut to tonight, my boyfriend used my car for a bit, and was talking to a friend on the phone while driving home. When he got home he parked in front of our condo building instead of the underground parking so he could continue his conversation before coming inside. He had the engine off during this time, but the car was still running and using the battery. My car now will not turn on as I’m assuming he’s drained the battery, so it’s stuck in front of our building until I can get a boost. I obviously need to have the battery replaced now rather than later, and I will now need to take time out of my work day to bring it into the shop to be fixed, which inconveniences me. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I asked my boyfriend to help pay for this repair, or do I suck it up and pay since I was going to have to eventually anyways, and I chalk it up to the cost of owning a car?",

      "description": "We've been together 3 years, married 1 month. In this time he's never had a coldsore before. I am not worried at all that this is a cheating situation. My husband has/had the habit of sharing everything with people (friends and acquaintances). Trying a new beer? Why not offer it around the table for everyone to sample. I warned him before that that's not really a good practice, but here we are.\n\nThe new husband part is important because since we got married he's been in a bit of a honeymoon phase, extra cuddling, extra affection etc, and this has put a damper on that.\n\n**His side:** It is cruel and unfair of me to turn down his affection because of a condition that is incurable. He feels that it is inevitable that over our next 50+ years of marriage I will get it, so I am being unreasonable now in not letting him kiss me. \n\nIn my defense I am still being affectionate, I will kiss his face and cheeks etc, snuggle with him, and we are still having sex with our typical bc (condoms) etc.\n\n**My side:** I don't agree that it is inevitable that I catch coldsores from him and I think I am entitled to try to avoid infection for as long as possible. If that means that for the next 50 years if he gets an outbreak = we don't kiss, then I accept that condition if it means avoiding an uncomfortable and unpleasant infection.\n\nAlso, it's not like I'm saying 'Ew gross' to him or being rude or a jerk about it. If he tries to kiss me I turn as gently as I can or pull away. He finds this very rude. \n\nTLDR; Husband recently started getting coldsores and I am refusing to make lip contact with him during outbreaks. He says my infection in inevitable and that I'm being unfair. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I find out from a good friend of hers that she went on a date with someone that I knew. Later that day I tried to call her within the week as well so I wasn't forgetting about her and such and I find out that she cheated (it was more than a date.)  so I try and push it back like nothing happened because I didn't want to instantly get into  a argument, little after that day I confront her and she was trying to act innocent and after that we got into a huge argument about me not talking to her for around a week after I told her that I wouldn't have any time to talk but I tried to call a bit but couldn't since she was sleeping. Little after that argument we broke up and continued our lives.",

      "description": "Hi all, I am feeling awful and disgusted/disrespected. Long-short story, we have been married about 2 years and have a little one together. Our relationship is not healthy at all, I feel like she is mentally abusive and constantly put me down for anything.\n\nHere is the thing, she is currently on a work trip, she does inside sales so she doesn’t have to be on the field at all. Anyway, she decided to go saying that she would meet partners and stuff but to me sounds like she planned or offered to go.\n\nBefore she leaves (Monday) she texted me saying that she will just work and to not worry at all. Yesterday morning, she texted again saying that will have a happy hour at a “restaurant” which I was okay. I called her around 5:30 to see what was going on and she barely said anything, saying that she was in the car with her coworkers heading to the place and then I asked for a pic when she gets there. Turned out that she lied about it and it’s a bar, fancy bar by the way. Texted her, called her twice since my little one wanted to speak with her and she ran to the bathroom to talk to us. I know her and the way she sounded was a drunk fucking person. About 9pm I asked what’s up and she said she would leave soon and I just got pissed and blocked her number. Last time she’s seen online was around 12;30am so I have no clue what happened and I am lost now on what to do.\n\nHer number is still blocked, not sure what to do.",

      "description": "Me and my boyfriend have a long distance relationship for a few months now, and we rarely get to see each other (about once a month on average), and next weekend I'll be attending a convention we planned on going to together since before we started dating. The convention is in the city he lives, so he offered to have me stay at his house (wouldn't be the first time) for the whole weekend, and I naturally accepted, and told my parents about this. This was weeks ago.\n\nFor some context: I don't live in the same city I attend University in, but I go home almost every weekend. The past two weekends I could be with my boyfriend (once at his house, once at mine), and the next four or so weekends (after this of course) I'll be going home to stay with my family.\n\nNow my sister decided she's attending the con too, and my parents come with her and stay at my aunt's, who also lives in the same city. Suddenly they're super against me staying at my boyfriend's because I'm not staying \"with my family\", and I'm \"valuing him over them\", and \"acting as if we're already married\" (their exact words). They are holding the fact I was with him for two weekends in a row against me, despite the fact I will be with them every weekend in the next month.\n\nThey are basically forcing me to stay with them. My plan was to go on Friday and return Monday, they want me to go Saturday and return Sunday, with them.\n\nThis has already caused us to have a massive screaming match over the phone in which my mom accused me of permanently making a hole in our relationship. I feel like they are not treating me like an adult, and want to be valued above my boyfriend regardless of circumstance. AITA for telling them point blank I don't want to stay with them over the weekend, and want to be with my boyfriend instead?\n\nTL;DR: Weeks ago I planned to spend next weekend with my LDR boyfriend for a convention, my parents are going to my aunt's in the same city that weekend and are forcing me to stay with them instead.

      "description": "EDIT: This turned out longer than expected. See TLDR for summary, skip to last two or three paragraphs for the important stuff.  \n\n\nSo, I \\[M18\\] have had this friend \\[F18\\] for several years. We've been friends for a few years because we're both in the same social circle, but neither of us are the type to try to hang out with the other gender alone (ya know, being a teen and weird and all). However, over the past few months she'd expressed an interest to maybe do some stuff together. She didn't mention anything specific, only that it might be nice to hang out. Over the past 2 months I (platonically) invited her twice to help me with school projects  (I'm at college for video production, and need friends to be \"actors\" sometimes) and once to go to a mutual friend's house for a \"discussion group\" (ie talk about interesting things). All 3 times she said No, but she always said she (A) was sorry it didn't work out (B) had a good reason not to (C) asked how it went anyway. ALL three times.  \n\n\nEnter Saturday this week. We're texting, and she talks about how people in our \"mutual group\" often don't get very much social interaction (we were both homeschooled before college). I invite her to help with a project, thinking it'd be fun. (this is the second project mentioned above). She says she doesn't like acting, but asked several questions about what the plan would be and said she would. The next day she texts me that I need to call her Dad first. I'm not annoyed by this, because where we live it's normal for dads to look out for thier daughters, and I'm expecting him to just make sure that I'm not going to hurt her. Completely normal, I'm not interested in her romantically, so I have nothing to worry about, right?  \n\n\nNow, before I go on, I will admit that two years ago I had a pretty serious crush on her, and definitely tried WAY too hard to hang out, and definitely gave her GOOD reason to be uncomfortable (nothing sexually innapropriate, just always finding way too many excuses to be in her vicinity). I understand that it was wrong, and apologized once I was called out on my behavior, and she was mature about it. I was actually really impressed that she was didn't let it harm our friendship.  \n\n\nNow, a few days later (yesterday) I meet with her dad. I'm expecting the ol \"make sure you behave yourself\" speech. Instead, he tells me that she's feeling \"pressured\" to hang out with me, and that I should probably stop asking. He said that it appeared that I wasn't being respectful to her. Now, I wasn't expecting that, but given past experiences, I could understand, and told him so. However, when I got home I turned my brain on. I asked her THREE TIMES in TWO MONTHS to do stuff with me. That doesn't sound pushy to me. EACH TIME she showed interest, but had legitimate reasons not to (out of town, family obligations, etc), and asked about the projects after the time they were done. Maybe it's my fault, and maybe she was being obvious that she didn't want to hang out (after all, I don't take hints very well), but that's the dumbest \\*profanity\\* of a reason to be disingenuous ever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see her weekly at a sporting event, and today she came up to me, knowing full well her dad had that conversation with me, and did the whole \"Sorry I can't help \\[my name\\]! Something came up! Will you be able to get it done???\" thing. Needless to say I'm pretty insulted, and I tell her I've lost a LOT of resepct for her because her actions are \"just really disengenuous. If you don't want to hang out with someone, just tell them to thier face! You don't gotta be a jerk about it, but just be freaking honest for christ sake!\" Sure, she might've hurt my feelings by outright saying no, but I'm way more angry that people can't just have an ADULT conversation. If you don't like me, tell me to my face. I can handle it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Girl says she wants to do stuff with me, in reality she doesn't, I get mad at her because I hate how people can't just be honest about stuff and are expected to \"uNdErStanD sOciAl HiNTs\" BS.**  \n\n\nSidenote: Now, I know many redditors will say that it's just her dad being \"overbearing\" and speaking for her what wasn't the truth, but I know she trusts him 100% and he seems very honest and understanding. \"  \n\n\nand yes, I am in the south USA. Our culture is mostly awesome, but it can suck sometimes.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to dance with a certain girl in my school musical?",
      "description": "**TLDR at the bottom**\n\nSome notes before I begin:\n\n* I am 16M and in 11th grade.\n* I am not comfortable in holding other people's hands, being close to someone I don't know too well, etc.\n* I have Asperger's, so I am relatively introverted. Note that I am high functioning, and most probably don't notice it until I say that I am, to which they say, \"Makes sense!\" (I am not offended by this)\n* Despite what is stated above, I like doing theater... granted, this is my first *school* show.\n\nSo at my school, there's a musical that I am currently in. I'm a \"Chorus Boy\", so I basically act as a stage prop in the background until I actually do things like dance or maybe even sing.\n\nThen we get to a girl that I will name Susie (not actual name).\n\nSusie is a freshman that has some tendencies that I think are odd. She gets obsessed with other people or other things pretty frequently, she constantly gets absurdly close (literal sense) to other people (especially guys, but they're fine with it sometimes), she's a bit loud, and she randomly scowls at other people, although I'm not sure if it's intentional.\n\nOne thing I should expand upon is Susie's \"obsession\" with other people: I don't think it's really so much of an obsession as much as it is a joke obsession that Susie herself treats a little *too* seriously, but other girls in this class will tell her something like, \"Oh, I think John Doe has a crush on you\", and she'll run up to John, hug him, call him her boyfriend, and etc. This \"boyfriend\" changes every single day. Most of the guys find this more amusing than anything else, and Susie is kind of like the \"mascot\" of theater class, as everyone seems to like her... except for *me.*\n\nI have never been openly rude to her before, and none of the other girls say anything to Susie about me (at least, I don't think), and I don't plan on being rude to her, I just don't want to hang around her.\n\nNow to the actual story.\n\nThere's a slow dance portion in the musical, and everyone in the musical *has* to participate in it, no exceptions. As I've stated, I am uncomfortable near/touching other people, but this slow dance portion was not much more than holding hands, having the girl's hand on the guy's shoulder while the guy has it above their hip, and touching cheeks. I'd gladly bear through it for the sake of being a \"chorus boy\", though, and the dance isn't that long.\n\nSo when the teacher was calling on people to pair them up, there were very few people left. She called me up and asked me if I had a preference, and I said no. She then asked if I minded being with Susie, and I, forgetting who Susie was, said that I didn't mind. The teacher then called Susie up, told her to go get her dance shoes, and then dismissed her to go get the shoes.\n\nI made an awkward wincing expression after Susie left, and the teacher asked me again if I minded having Susie as a partner. I paused for a few moments and said that I *did* mind, and that I was sorry and hoped I wasn't being rude. The teacher then called on a senior girl to be my partner, and that's about where the story ends.\n\nMy main concern is if I was the a-hole for turning her down, even if I didn't do it in front of her face. The sole reason why I  turned her down was because I was uncomfortable with her tendencies.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* There's a slow dance portion at my school play\n* I hate being close to people and am awkward around people\n* There's a girl that likes being close to other people and have \"obsessions\" with other boys, typically due to other girls having fun with her\n* While the teacher was pairing people for the slow dance, I asked to switch with a different girl when I was selected to dance with her.

We met at a sports event but I only talked to her because I knew her cousin. During the past year me and my friend have gradually talked less and less and now we don't ever talk. This is because of the awkwardness and sadly this situation has made family events awkward as well, apparently they don't really talk anymore.

      "description": "My mom has a lot of acquaintances and recently got an offer to make a poster/facebook banner for a weekly vietnamese musician concert at a local radio station. It was $50 and she was asked by the organizer to make it for wednesday , I don't know why she accepted it because she has never done any graphic design at all or maybe the organizer has no idea what is the difference between a painter and a designer... \n\nKnowing that I make digital art and video game concepts with my laptop and tablet, she kept asking me to do it even though I have no experience in it. She said that \"I'll think of the ideas, and you can just make it digitally, it's simple\". I decided not to do it because I'm quite busy with school lately. My mom ended up saying that she'll just do it on her own. Moments later she asked me to give her my laptop and tablet so she can do it on her own and also asking me to help her get started with the tablet.\nI am super paranoid because of all the files I have on my laptop but also because I needed it for my classes, plus I feel like I was being used as she gets 50% of the commission money by just \"thinking of ideas\" while I get 50% for doing the actual work. (I have 2 year online commission experiences so I felt a bit uncomfortable) \n\nI ended up refusing to borrow her my setup and she told me that I'm \"selfish\" and \"ungrateful\". \n\nAITA? \n\ntldr; mom accepts making graphic design banner, tells me to do it, i get 50% of the money and feel like a ripoff, i then refused. she later on asked for my laptop/tablet to do it on her own while begging me to help her do it. i refused her demand and now she calls me a selfish &amp; ungrateful chhild.

      "description": "My  partner (\"P\") has a friend (\"F\") and they have been friends for a long time, and are very close.  F has a history of depression and anxiety.  When P and I first started living  together, F moved in also, and all three of us lived together for a few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhilst  we living together, F was self destructive in terms of personal relationships, work and general selfcare.  F would come to us for advice and help, which we would give but F would often ignore the advice and do the complete opposite.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually,  F found someone who seemed right (\"N\") and things calmed down a bit.  After a while F and N decided to move across country on a short term basis. P and I supported this, and we found a place of  our own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter  6 months they moved back.  Things seemed a bit weird and F  told us about the abusive nature of their relationship.  One night things blew up resulting in the police being called.  We helped F navigate the police issues and cut off all contact with N. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis  happened months ago, and slowly it has been coming out F and N have  still been seeing each other behind everyone's backs.  F recently had a breakdown and F's parents were considering hospitalising F.  Although F had issues when we were living together, this new wave is a lot worse than what we have  ever seen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout  this time, F has been regularly been asking me and P for advice/help, and we were more than happy to help.  Slowly I have become less  tolerant as F again ignores advice.  Whenever F needs anyting, P will drop  everything to help. Because of F's relationship issues, F gets upset  whenever P and I talk about our plans for the future (or any of our  friends who are in long term relationships for that matter).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF  is always grateful for out help.  F has acknowledged  they have made bad decisions and say they are trying to get things back  on track.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF  also stays at our house a few nights each week.  It started with F  asking for permission, but slowly over time it seems more F is telling  us they are staying over rather than asking. Our new place is far  smaller than our shared place, and only has room for two. Most of my things I need for work  (I work from home some days) are kept in the room F sleeps in.  F will  regularly sleep in past 11, meaning I need to get everything I need the  night before or do without until F wakes up.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am frustrated our advice is being ignored and feel we  are being taken advantage of.  I feel a lot of F's issues are because  they have made bad choices for a long time, and this all is a result of a  situation they have created.  I have told P this, and P mostly agrees with me but wants to support F still.  It is starting to put a  strain on our relationship as I resent F's behaviour and taking a  lot of energy away from each of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for resenting F even though it is a result of mental health issues?",

      "description": "Backstory that might be relevant: Her brother died recently, she's still grieving. One of her exes abused her verbally and physically apparently. And cheated on her.\n\nOkay so, my ex has cheated on people and lied to me about the nature of her relationship with people before. She's also led me on and basically \"cheated on me without cheating\"\n\nBefore she's had a guy fly to meet her when we tried to date and I blew up and that kinda contributed to me absolutely hating her. I was convinced I was in love and convinced she changed. She's kind of a social media butterfly and legit half her close friends are people online.\n\n\nMe being the complete idiot let time get the better and 3 years+a new kid down the road, we reconnect and everything was wonderful. I told her explicitly that I needed clear communication, openness, transparency, and honesty. \n\nOf course, got none of that, and even on her birthday weekend she planned to spend with me she was talking about going to one of her friends art shows with him and he was getting angry at her cause she chose to spend it with me. I didn't know about this guy until two weeks later so I got mad and said I thought it was inappropriate.\n\nThen I saw more comments from another guy and this was her best friend or some shit? Like a dude she comments with online. They would leave hearts and be kinda weird in general so I just thought it was inappropriate and wanted to know more. \n\nEventually I saw another and that was the straw that broke the camels back and we started breaking up because she said it was emotionally draining. That she had to focus on her and her son and I was out of line for being upset and asling who people were.\n\nNow she won't talk to me lol. I feel bad and want a non biased perspective so I can know how to change. I don't want anything else to do with her, but to be a better partner for someone worth my affection.\n",

I’ve done about 75% of the work on the last 3 assignments.\n\nThis week’s assignment is due today. I’ve been trying to find a time that’s suitable for all three of us since Saturday, texting them multiple times, offering to help any way I can. I got basically no response, today one of them said she “forgot about it”, which I can hardly believe, since we’re assigned homework each week. I finished the assignment alone, and I’m pretty much fed up with them at this point.\n\nWe’ve already had a project that got rejected because of them, so if they don’t turn in anything this time, they will probably fail the class. WIBTA if I only put my name on the paper?\n\nEdit: update\n\nSurprise surprise, the girls texted me saying that they both work in the morning, so they won’t be able to contribute today either. In turn I told them that they won’t be given credit on the assignment, and it’s been silent since then. One of them didn’t show up for class in the afternoon (which isn’t unusual), the other didn’t even look at me.\n\nI talked with my professor after the class and showed him evidence from the group chat. He understood the situation and told me that he will definitely take it into consideration and grade accordingly. Their fate will be decided soon, and I have a feeling it won’t be pretty. On the bright side, the assignment was accepted. (To be clear: this time the others didn’t contribute anything at all, it was entirely done by me. All three of our names were included in the previous projects.)\n\nI appreciate everyone’s opinion and advice. This was a lesson for me as well. In the future I will act sooner and won’t let other people take advantage of me. Also, fuck group projects.",

      "description": "This weekend my girlfriend and I went skiing in the Alps. I'm a 24 year old guy and she's 21, if it matters. We've been together 4 years. We are both pretty good skiiers. A lot of women go to fancy ski resorts to wear expensive outfits, drink at bars, and party, but my girlfriend means business. She can ski circles around me, and I'm 100% proud of her. \n\nUsually she dresses nicely to ski, since it's a fashionable ski resort and she's a fashionable person. However, this weekend, she said she didn't feel like dressing up, and instead just wore black snowpants, an old parka, and a hockey jersey. I didn't see anything wrong with it. She also wore a pair of my old skis with the bindings adjusted to fit her boots and a black helmet. What I'm saying is, anybody who saw her would have thought she was a man. \n\nAnyways, we were in the gondola with this old couple. My GF (her helmet was still on) rested her head on my shoulder and we were holding hands. The couple must have mistaken her for a dude, because they gave us a weird look. The old lady whispered something to her husband. Then my GF took off her helmet, and they looked really confused when they realized she was a girl. \n\nWe were making conversation with them, and then, just as we were about to exit the gondola, the old lady goes, \"Oh, we thought at first that you two were gays. Thank God.\" She laughs and expects us to laugh with her. I reply, \"That's really fucking narrow minded of you. You should be ashamed of yourself.\" Then her husband tells me to watch my mouth, my girlfriend basically drags me away before I can respond. \n\nLater, she told me that I was way out of line to swear at the old woman like that. She says I shouldn't be so reactive all the time and that my response was rude and uncalled for. She said yeah it sucks that the old woman is bigoted, but she's old, and I should have been more respectful. I apologized for making her uncomfortable in any way but it needed to be said, and that I can't stand people like her. \n\nAITA in this situation or was it called for? ",

D and I were pretty good friends at first and we continued so, but shortly in the friendship, I noticed she was listening to music with anthropomorphic animals on their covers/animations. So like any person on the internet I called her (affectionately or so I thought) a furry. She seemed playfully annoyed and brushed it off as no big deal. So I'd call her it occasionally.\n\nFast forward from summer to January, and I got one of her best friends who I play soccer with to call her it.\n\nI was PRETTY sure I specified ONCE.\n\nUnfortunately, it caught on around her school because her best friend started calling her it over and over. Now she's saying I ruined her life, she hates me, and never wants to see me again. Oh and to top that, she wants to get one of our mutual friends to hate me too.\n\nI've apologized profusely but she won't even acknowledge me. I've tried to get her best friend to stop it but it's too late. She's really cool and I never meant to hurt her. AITA?",

Which I’m okay with, just not wanting to keep increasing. \n\nThe AITA question comes into play here. His girlfriends family? Her brother is a very close friend of mine. I’ve helped him out a lot, he’s a poor college kid and I make 50k a year. I wouldn’t question helping him. I feel like it could increase me being a asshole in this case. \n\nThe third factor is I’m paying off (and have been) legal issues between this past May and this coming May.

Things were going alright, no great sparks but no blaring “red flags” either. Our last date wasn’t the best but not all are slam dunks.\n\nWell, she and I were txting about a recent lifting competition I was in and leanout goal for my size goal. During this conversation, she told em she hated how men can just sneeze and lose weight. So I responded by stating, each gender has its advantages. Hers get free drinks (a statement a female friend(34f) “M” stated to me week prior) and mine just happens to lose weight more easily. I didn’t think anything of it, except it’s what I had discussed and was told by M so no harm for restating.\n\nWell, after that I’m he proverbial stuff hit the fan. Apparently, K thinks it’s sexist to believe each gender has its own advantages, the statement I had was overly sexist, M’s beliefs don’t count as they are perpetuating patriarchy, that since I’m a white male ai would never understand what she goes through as a white woman, I need to check my white privilege, that I should go read up on things like the wage gap as I’m ignorant about life and social justice, etc.\n\nI apologized for offending her and admitted I had a bad equivalency with my examples only but I stand by the premise, each gender has advantages. \n\nThat’s the short synopsis of the events.\n\nAITA believing and telling her the above? For Brushing off her comments which I found belittling as I struggle to lose weight, but she can’t let go of mine? Or is my instinct that she is trying to pick an argument to end things the right one? (I Still think her saying I’m not feeling the relationship would be good)",

He *really* doesn’t like horror as a general rule, especially anything gory. But just as I watch things that are more in his wheelhouse than mine (think historical documentaries), he’s happy to suck it up once in a while. \n\nI saw that Hereditary was on Amazon and asked if he was up for it. We had seen the trailer for it ages ago at another movie in theaters and I had mentioned I was excited about it. Beyond the trailer neither of us knew much about the movie so we hit play. \n\nAbout a half hour or so in, something pretty awful happens, I won’t spoil it for anybody who wants to watch it themselves. Suffice to say, my boyfriend did not take it well at all. He couldn’t look at the screen and started yelling things like “What is wrong with you?” and “How could you make me watch something like that?” \n\nI turned it off as soon as I realized how upset he was and tried to comfort him and apologize. He’s been a little rattled ever since, I think it really got to him. He’s been kind of cold to me and I do feel absolutely horrible, but I also kind of feel like he’s overreacting.

Yesterday, me and her watched episodes 3-6 of a show I had already started (\"Back with the Ex\" on Netflix) until we both had to sleep. We live about 2 hours apart, so syncronized Netflix-watching is a regular thing for us during the week when we can't spend time together physically. Today, after an exhausting, long day at work I came home and made myself some food before working again for a couple of hours from home. While having my meal, I made a impulsive decision to watch the final episode of the show that we hadn't finished before.\n\nFast forward to 3 hours later, I'm facetiming with my girlfriend and casually mention having watched the last episode. She then proceeds to make a pretty big scene, telling me how incredibly upset she is feeling, how selfish I am for watching the episode without her - you know, generally trying to make me feel super guilty. She was apparently looking forward to watching it with me, which I understand, but I feel like I should be allowed to make my own decisions as to what I am watching when I eat. I did obviously offer to rewatch it again right away, and reassured her how much I would like to share the experience together, but she's having none of it and keeps labeling me an asshole here.\n\nSo, folks, what's the verdict?",

      "description": "Despite the fact I tell my husband's brother and his wife that my kids don't need anything for Christmas and birthdays, they continue to buy them clothes for all of these occasions. It is very nice of them. But the problem is that they only buy them clothes that are camo. I for one hate camouflage. It belongs on hunters while hunting and that is it. My husband (an avid hunter) doesn't even wear camo when he isn't hunting. \n\nSo they end up buying all these clothes that I literally don't put my children in ever. I have numerous onesies, shirts and pants in camouflage that get donated with the tags still on. \n\nWhile I wouldn't mind keeping the status quo and letting some lucky camo loving family find their kids a wardrobe at the ARC, BIL and SIL have trouble making ends meet without buying clothes for my kids. They're always talking about pawning stuff for bill money or calling us to borrow $20 to get gas to make it back home (which they always pay back). So it makes it even worse that they're wasting their money.\n\nSo would I be an asshole if I told them not to buy stuff for my kids anymore? ",

My father is not in the picture and she lives alone, no partner.\n\nShe mentioned that she was going to go into the woods and chop down a tree for our xmas tree. I said by yourself? And she said yes, and i asked her if she was going to call anyone and let them know where shes going and she said no, Frank (her brother) lives an hour away and works til 6 ect. I got kind of frustrated and said youre a woman, alone, its the middle of winter in maine and youre not exactly young and you want to go into the woods and cut down a six foot tree. All im saying is call Frank and say \"hey, im going to go cut down a tree off Hancock road by such znd such, if i dont call u by six somethings wrong\". And she got mad at me, said shes only going maybe 100-200 feet, she doesnt want to bother Frank, shes fine, she does this every year.\n\nSo am i being a bossy asshole, or a concerned daughter?

My BF &amp; his BFF are really the only housemates who hang out with/speak to one another, at least that I have noticed. \n\nEveryone in the house works full-time and travels a lot, my bf included. He hasn’t been home for the past 6 weekends in a row. \n\nHowever, when he is home, I’m almost always over. I don’t get there until 9:30pm at the earliest  and I  leave between 8-10am next morning. \n\nWe keep to ourselves, in his room which is on the opposite side of the house from all the other rooms. We never make messes and are really never even in the living room or kitchen. I don’t leave any of my belongings lying around at his house either. \n\nI’m quiet, and respectful..... except for when we have sex. I literally scream. I try to keep quiet but struggle to, and i feel awful for it, because surely his housemates do not want to hear that?! However, my bf’s BFF, who’s room is next to everyone else’s, says he can’t hear us from his room. \n\nI also feel nervous about always being parked at my bf’s house - the driveway is narrow and awful, and when I’m there my car takes up a space. \n\nThe other housemates almost never have people over. The only time I have seen guests besides myself have been at parties, and when my bf, his bff + girlfriend, and another couple we’re friends with have all hung out. \n\nThe other housemates seem to be courteous towards me and my boyfriend? I’ve never noticed any rude behavior from them. \n\nI’m just nervous that I’m breaking some unspoken rule in the roommate code of conduct. :(\n\nTLDR: I spend the night at my bf’s 2-5 nights a week - basically whenever he’s home and not traveling. I’m quiet and respectful but scream when we have sex... feel like I’m being terrible! ",

      "description": "      This is my first post ever on reddit, so please take it easy on me if I screw up on protocol. \n      I'm a guy that really values his personal privacy/space and I don't like people randomly showing up at my house. I'm not particularly religious, but I don't care if people want to believe in something, just don't try to force it on me. I'm all about people being free to do what they want to in their own life.\n      Before I get too deep, a little background info and I'll try to keep it brief...I had a fairly large business in a small town with a large customer base. My dad passed away and left me a big enough inheritance that I decided to shut down my business and take some time for myself and to process losing my best friend. I enjoy building cars, so that's what I do for entertainment. \n      During the summer I usually work at night and sleep during the day because of the heat. Several times I would go to bed at like 8 or 9am and be woken up by friends or former customers beating on my door at like 11am and giving me shit because I was sleeping. Like I'm just being lazy when they have no idea what I've been up to. I got sick of it. Don't show up randomly, wake me up, call me lazy and then ask me for a favor because I did you a favor before when I had my shop. Fuck you. I wound up putting a sign on my door that says \"If I didn't specifically invite you here, you don't belong here. DO NOT knock on my door for any reason.\"\n       Saturday late morning, I'm in my kitchen and I see Jehovah's witnesses across the street. I shake my head and go about my business. A couple minutes later, I hear car doors shut in front of my house. I'm irritated. I can see through the curtains on my front door, a silhouette of a small elderly woman walk up to the door, read the sign and, of course, knock. I lose it. Keep in mind that I'm a 6'3\", 300 pound biker kinda guy that can make a racket. I yell from inside \"Get the fuck off of my property! Now!\". She shits a stripe in her undies and I see leaflets go flying. She's apologizing and picking up the leaflets and I yell something to the effect of, \"You better pick up that bullshit and take it with you.\" She does and apologizes again while shes walking back to their van. I move the curtains to get a good look at them, and it looks like she is crying when they pull away.\n       I feel like a major asshole for making an old lady cry, but I feel like they invaded my space when it was clearly stated that I didn't want to be bothered. AITA here?\n\n",

      "description": "Hey everyone. I’m a uni freshman, and I’ve been trying to do some things I haven’t done in high school. I’m big into music, but I mostly did instrumental stuff, and I like to sing. I joined a singing group and it’s been a ton of fun. We’ve been learning a bunch of songs and things are going well. I also was recently offered to join a small group that’s putting on a concert performance of a show. The only issue is that the practices run at the same time.\n\nThis would basically mean I would be missing half of each practice for around a month. My main group practices twice a week though, so I wouldn’t be missing out all the time. It just so happens that the scheduling makes it run semi-close to our big end of semester concert, where we would be in full swing with rehearsals. Normally I wouldn’t have any doubts about doing both, but another kid from our group planned on doing the other show and then quit. He claimed that he didn’t want to be uncommitted to our main group by missing practice. He made it sound like I was a jerk for flaking on our group.\n\nSo am I an asshole for wanting to do two groups at once? People miss practices all the time for stuff, and I don’t think it would affect my knowledge or skill of our music in any way.",

      "title": "AITA For refusing to get a product from another location for my assistant manager",
      "description": "First time posting on this sub, testing the waters and looking for an opinion(s). \n\nSome back story further back before this happened. I work about 5-6 minutes from my current place of work. My assistant manager works about 30+ minutes away. From time to time, when there is an order that needs supplies that we don’t have, she has the most (of all 4 of us employees) locations to stop by on her way work from home without going out of her way. Where as I am limited to one location myself. And we only go ourselves instead of sending a truck to pick up the supplies when the time limit has passed and we can no longer get it delivered due to drivers being off the clock. \n\nSo a couple of months back at my place of work, my assistant manager (F) got an order from a customer that needed to be filled by the next day. She waited until 15 minutes before the delivery deadline for the day to place the order, and by pure coincidence, one of the last two drivers for the day was at my store. The drivers have company vans they use, not their own. This driver did not, does not, like me at all. And even the others can see it. As he came in, my assistant manager asked if I could go across town (15 miles out of my way) to the other location to pick something up for her order before I came in to work the next day. I politely said no. Because that’d mean I’d have to go out of my way 15 miles there and back. That’s an extra hour in the mornings. And I closed the store that day. Both my store and that store closed at the same time. Due to the fact the straight roads that lead there both have 2+ school zones at the time I’d have to go there. She kept insisting in a way that made me uncomfortable. ALSO, the location she wanted me to go to was my old work establishment. Same company, different local. My best friends also worked there. And she used that as an excuse for me to go. Again, I said no. \n\nShe keeps pushing to the point where I told her “listen, I’m not getting paid to go hella out of my way to get the things for you and drive back. I’m sorry but no. Put it on order now, so you get it tomorrow morning.” Again she insisted and said that she needed to ship the whole order in the morning, and it’s take longer. Also again, I declined. She kept pushing to the point where I tried respectful telling her it’s not my job, even if she’s my superior. To THIS, the driver stepped in. \n\n“OH BOO HOO, you just have to driver across town? I have to drive AAAAAAALL THE WAY SOUTH AND BACK UP EVERY DAY! And you’re complaining about 15 miles?????? Grow up! Just go get the things for the lady! Be a man!”\n\nAlright look. I was so shook, I paused, looked at him dead in the face and said “but that’s YOUR job my guy... and you have me HELLA twisted if you think I’m wasting my gas because she forgot to order the supplies during the day when she had time. That’s a no for me dawg” and I walked away. \n\nShe was upset for a day or two and now the driver hasn’t come in months. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "So this story is pretty long, just go to the end if you want the tl;dr. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened years ago and we have both since moved on, but I just wanted to know if what I did at the time had been an asshole move or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring my childhood, my parents were always kind of ( they had fights every now and then) happy together. But as we grew older, my siblings and I, they started to get angrier and angrier at each other. But I didn't get to see that development to the end as I left the house for my studies. I hear a few months after I move out that they were getting divorced. No big surprises there. \n\nWhat was surprising was how explosive that divorce was. There are two elements that you have to keep in mind here. First is that my mother has always had problems with depression and I have always supported her ( I was the one to call the ambulance after her suicide attempt and always tried to help her cope with it and try to get over it by having long discussions with her. I also proposed to be her guarantor for her loan, even if it did make me sell my bike when she suddenly stopped paying it back). The second element to keep in mind is my father did not help her a lot with it. He wasn't the cause of it nor did he make it worse, but he didn't help a lot. \n\nWhen I say that their divorce was explosive, I mean explosive. They fought non stop whilst they had to tolerate each other(signing papers and everything).  After that, whenever you went to see one, you couldn't spend 5 minutes with them without them insulting the other. And I'm not exaggerating here. It was so bad that one of my sisters cut all contact with them because of it. \n\nFew years go by and I'm about to get married. Since they got divorced, their relationship had not gotten better. It was still the same as the beginning. So much so that I had to go through tedious months of negotiating because they didn't want to be there if the other was there. I had to negotiate and negotiate with them, for both of them to finally accept to be there. \n\nThe wedding happens and all goes well. Too well. I was worried right before the marriage that they were going to make a scene but nothing happens. I then find out that they spent the whole wedding together. I was pretty surprised. I go and ask the other guests indeed I found out that they had spent the whole just sitting next to each other and quietly talking, not talking to the other guests. I don't make much of it though and continue on with my life with my wife. \n\nFew months happen and I receive by mail an interesting card. On it, it announced that my parents were getting married, and that my wife and I were invited. That's when I thought, \"None of that for me\" and I just didn't go, my wife not going either. I had not tolerated years of constant hate just for them to get married again.  \n\nTL;DR: My parents had an explosive divorce and hated each other for years. Then my wedding happens and they kept talking to each other. Then a few months after that they decide to get married again, and I just decided not to go. \n\nWas I an asshole for not going? \n\nEdit: Thanks to everybody who commented but I got to reveal the truth. This actually isn't my story but my dad's. He's always wondered if he had made the right decision by not going to his parent's second wedding and I thought I would take it to you guys. Thanks again for everybody's feedback.",

      "description": "TL;DR: My gf of 6 months is constantly scared about me interacting with women in any way, regardless of the fact that I share everything with her. I think her worrying makes the relationship unattractive AITA? \n\nA little context: We are both 18, in the first year of uni, and have been dating for almost half a year. My gf's last relationship was toxic, her ex would berate her constantly for just about anything. She would often feel awful staying up all night bc she didn't know how to handle the toxic relationship. The relationship ended when the ex left her for another girl. But that was long ago, and I've tried my best to be the antithesis to him. I always asked her if she was comfortable, even if it was something as innocent as holding hands in public, and I waited till she was completely comfortable to start a new relationship. \n\nHOWEVER after 6 months of a good relationship I constantly find myself irritated by how insecure and non-assertive she is. She said she doesn't like me watching porn bc it makes her jealous; ok I stopped watching porn. Since uni has started Ive met new friends, 2 of them being female, my gf now cowers away from my phone whenever I get a sc from them, regardless of the fact that I open them in front of her, and share every time we talk and exactly what we said. My gf is beautiful and theres no reason for her to think I think otherwise but the way she is constantly scared of me interacting with other women bothers me a lot.

      "description": "I have never used reddit before but I am hoping to find a little peace of mind for myself here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made plans to see a friend of mine several days ago. She lives a good bit aways from me but she had planned to cook and just make a day of it. I wake up that day feeling out of it but since we made plans and she had already started to prepare the food I decided to go instead of canceling. I get there and we hang out a little while. Her neighbor calls and decides to come over. I usually don't mind her neighbor but she can be very loud and touchy. I wasn't in the mood to deal with her personality that day. After a little while I decide to leave. I didn't make a scene or say anything I just said I was going to go and that was it. It really upset my friend but I think it handled it appropriately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have talked about it some since and she insists that I was in the wrong. I fully believe that I was the problem in this situation and that is why I left. She has said if I didn't want her neighbor to come over I could have said something to start with but it doesn't feel right for me to say I don't want her friend to come over while I am at her house. She has said if it was bothering me she would have sent her neighbor home but again it doesn't feel right for me to have her picking between me and another one of her friends. Me leaving has also upset her neighbor because she felt as if she was intruding. I didn't intend for that outcome. They seemed to be having a good time laughing and joking and since I wasn't I thought it best that I left. I was a little annoyed in the moment but I wasn't upset or angry or anything I just wasn't having a good time. It also ruined the big dinner she had planned which I know was looking forward to all week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't stress enough that I don't think my friend or her neighbor did anything wrong in this situation. I was the problem and that is why I handled it the way I did. I still think I wasn't wrong to leave but she disagrees. I guess I am hoping for other's opinions on if I screwed up and how I could have handled it better. ",

      "description": "I work at Walgreens and we have a corporate policy that if two younger adults want to buy cigarettes, we have to I.D. both of them.  These two girls come in and I recognize one of them from my school.  I ask her how's she's doing and we chat for a bit.\n\nShe comes up to the counter and says that she wants to buy some cigarettes with the other girl standing right next to her.  They both look about eighteen.  I ask to see both of their I.D.s in accordance to our policy.  She says that the cigarettes are just for her and that her little sister isn't going to use them.  Since I knew her, I told her that I wasn't really supposed to sell them to her but I'll make an exception this one time.  I told her to \"leave her sister in the car\" next time because I don't want to get in trouble and most other employees wouldn't sell it to her.  \n\nShe seemed irritated with the situation but finished paying and told me to have a good night.  I had completely forgot about the interaction until about an hour later, when she walks in with her dad.  Her dad makes a beeline towards me and starts yelling at me.  He tells me to call up my boss.  My boss doesn't work most nights so I called up my shift lead.  He starts to yell at her about me.  He tells her that whoever is paying for the cigarettes is the one who gets carded and that I should be fired.  \n\nI'm pretty upset at this point so I tell him that it's corporate policy and if they don't like it, they can buy their cigarettes somewhere else.  He tells me to keep my mouth shut and that he's the customer.  He then says that \"I had the audacity to tell his daughter to wait in the car.\"  I tried to interject but the shift lead cut me off.  The man said I shouldn't treat woman that way.  I felt like saying that I would've said the same thing whether it was a boy or girl but I kept my mouth shut.\n\nHe finally left and my shift lead told me just to ignore him.  She wasn't upset with me and even let me go to the break room to calm down for a sec.  In my mind, the only thing I did wrong was violate the policy to help a girl that I knew.  I think I could've maybe worded it differently when I told the sister to stay in the car but when I was saying it, I was trying to be helpful.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I sold cigarettes to a girl with her sister but told her to leave her in the car next time.  Her dad came in and tried to get me fired.  AITA?",

      "description": "My ex-girlfriend got kicked out by her abusive stepdad without warning, she's only been in this country for 4 years and she doesn't have that many people that she can turn to for help and that she trusts. We stayed on good terms after our break up and we still hang out regularly. She came knocking at my door and told me everything, and I told her to stay at my place for a while. My parents always liked her so they were cool with it. She also gets along very well with my mom who doesn't have that many friends either, so I'm happy about that too. \n\nI decided to keep it from my girlfriend because she has trust issues that she's been struggling with and she has always been jealous of my ex, and I know that she would lose her mind if she knew. I thought it would be better if I just don't tell her, my ex isn't around that often anyway, she mostly comes at night occasionally to sleep and she's around in the morning but that's it. Furthermore, it's not gonna be for a year or anything like that. Maybe a month or two. \n\nAITA for keeping this a secret? My friend says I am. It's not like my intentions are bad, I see it as more of a white lie than anything else. What you don't know can't hurt you, and I'm not doing anything wrong anyway. ",

I don't correct her, because I've always figured it's rude. I won't deny that it annoys the hell out of me. Anyway, we went all over town browsing furniture stores, shopping for nothing in particular, when I observed that I liked the look of a certain dining room suite. She said, \"It's a *suit.*\" Okay. I know she always says \"suit.\" That isn't going to make *me* say it that way. I looked at her and rolled my eyes. \n\n\"Well,\" she said \"I'm just trying to help. I know you don't want to run around sounding like an idiot.\"\n\n\"Thanks, but you are the one who sounds like an idiot. Google it or something.\" She got on her phone and I guess must have looked it up, but commented, \"It might be spelled with and \"e,\" but it's silent.\" I probably rolled my eyes again, but didn't say anything.\n\nLater, she said, \"Hey look at the price of that CHESTER DRAWER!\"  \n\n\"I believe you meant to say, 'chest of drawers?\" She didn't respond.\n\nWe were driving home. I passed up an opportunity to correct \"pacifically,\" \"rod iron,\" and \"touch basis\" but I did correct her when she said she hated driving under \"viadocks\" in the rain.\n\nThat prompted her to stop talking. She just sat there staring ahead until we got to her her house. She got out of the car, slammed the door, and hasn't responded to any texts.\n\nI know she is angry at me, but how much of an asshole am I?",

Everyone has been super supportive up until this point, and 99.99% of our families are beyond excited. A couple days ago my mother in law called us and said that she wouldn't be attending the wedding because we are living in sin and she doesn't support gay marriage, but she would still be attending the reception. Which boggles my mind because I don't know how that could be rationalized as being any different from not attending a secular marriage ceremony. She is a devout catholic, as are both of our families. She is the only one who has said anything.\n\nAnyway, I told her that she would be more than welcome at the reception, if she also attended the ceremony. It would be awkward for everyone involved, especially because she has aired her views publically on Facebook. To me this isn't a thing you can just pick and choose. My father in law agrees with me, as does everyone from her family I've talked to. I would hate for her to miss out on this, but she claims now that I am persecuting her for being catholic. AITA??",

He was okay with it and told me he would be fine accepting it on my behalf.\n\nThe day the shipment was updated to have entered the country, I contacted him telling him that it was most likely coming the next day and he acknowledged what I had said.\n\nThe next day, he's in school with me and I tell him that according to the postal service website, it would take 2 days instead of 1 for the delivery to be made and tell him that it may or may not be arriving. Couple hours later, he receives a message which says, \"There was a delivery for John Doe here. Does anyone know a John Doe?\". So apparently, he didn't tell anyone at home that there was a package delivery being expected with my name on it and so the delivery person was told that there was no person by my name who lived there.\n\nNow, the package is en-route to sender because the postal service doesn't have the authority to hold it. If I want it asap, I have to pay a retrieval fee of $21.40. So I'm obviously pretty angry because I already payed like $25 for shipping the first time round. I ask him to give me half the money because he didn't live up to his end of the agreement and notify anyone at home. When I asked him why not he said that it was my fault because I told him that the postal service website said it would take 2 working days.\n\nI'm still asking him to pay me half the price before I have to go collect the thing and have made it pretty clear that I am pissed off at him.

My boyfriend has the more private bedroom in the basement with an en suite bathroom and another sitting room. He’s been living there and paying rent for almost 3 months now. Since I live about 1.5 hour away from him, most weekends I stay at his house from Friday night to Monday (sometimes Tuesday) morning. Just recently Collin has made a point of telling him that I’m no longer welcome to stay overnight anymore. \n\nBefore my boyfriend moved in, he made a point to make sure there was nothing in the lease that would prevent me from staying there. The only part of the lease addressing it is a part that states guests cannot stay more than 7 consecutive days at anytime. I hardly spend any time upstairs in this house and if I do, I’m with my boyfriend. \n\nI’ve tried to let this be an issue between them, but I feel like I need to speak with Collin. The house that they live in is owned by Collin’s parents, which I believe Collin thinks gives him the title of primary roommate? He stays in the master bedroom and make big decisions like knocking trees down in the backyard, etc. \n\nSo AITA for thinking that a ban on overnight visits is ridiculous?\n\nEDIT: Also a little background, Collin used to date my former roommate and best friend, and therefore would stay at our place 4-5 nights a week. They’ve recently broken up, after she spent 3 or so weeks living 24 hours a day at their house. \n",

I think it's disgusting.  I hate it.  I can't breathe when I'm near smokers.  Smoking is awful and disgusting.  \nHe interpreted that as me saying that I hate his family and think they're awful and disgusting.  I do not hate his family, I think they're lovely.  \nWe've been together four years, my weak-ass lungs have never been a secret.  He has made it so that I won't be able to spend any period of time at his place.  I'm hurt, but I feel like an asshole.  \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My roommate would prefer the air to be at 74 degrees. I would prefer for it to be at 68 (both for comfort reasons and for cost reasons).  My roommate and I talked and agreed to keep the air at 70-71 so that our electricity bill wouldn’t cost as much. It’s mostly remained at 71 because I try to be nice and I know she gets cold.\n\nWell, I at least try. Multiple times now, I’ve caught the air back up to 74 or 73, coming home after weekends away to a super hot apartment. Sometimes even if I’ve been in my room too long she will secretly raise the temperature despite our agreement.\n\nI have tolerated this for about two months now (we made the agreement in November, she began fringing on it in December). For awhile, I would just lower it back down to 71 and move on.\n\nBut this week has had nice weather, to the point that without our air on, our apartments temperature has remained at 70 which is pretty damn nice, except she just raised the air to 72 right before bed.\n\nI would feel bad if it wasn’t for the fact she does nothing to help herself. She wears short sleeves in the apartment, no socks. She won’t use blankets or keep her door open at night to allow air to circulate.\n\nI just feel that if she is going to ignore our agreement then I will as well. We had talked about this once and it bothers me that I have to keep talking to her about the air.\n\nSo, will I be the asshole if I turn the air off at night (only on warmer nights) without my roommates knowledge?\n\nTLDR: Roommate and I agreed to keep temperature at 71, she keeps turning it up to 74. Am I the asshole if I turn the air off at night?",

      "description": "Let me start by first and foremost saying, I did NOT out her or out her sexuality to anyone. Secondly, I’m using a throwaway account because my friends know my actual account. Lastly, I’m on mobile so sorry for shitty formatting :/\n\nFor the sake of the story let’s call this girl “Liar 1”\n\nSo I met Liar 1 in December of last year and we really hit it off. Same interests, differing in some areas. It was almost perfect, shortly after we began dating. Things were weird at first but it slowly became normal. We were going steady and I THOUGHT we were exclusive, of at-least I was expected to be. \n\nTime passes by and she has to leave to go to a special school. We both knew that we would be breaking up and going separate our ways for quite some time. I was fine breaking up as it was going to happen eventually. Liar 1 handled the situation poorly, breaking up with me over text at 3 am while I was a sleep. She never made any plan to see me in person to talk to me about it or anything, it’s like she died. \n\nI was immensely hurt by this as we had dated for 7 months and I had grown attached (my own fault) never receiving any contact from Liar 1. About 3 months go by of zero contact and one evening she tries to contact me over Instagram. Again, while I was asleep; while I accept it was foolish of me to begin communicating with her again. I originally had her number blocked at the request of a therapist. \n\nWe began talking as friends, she was talking about her life at her new school and wouldn’t quite let me get a word in on the conversation. Everything I had to offer about my new life was quickly dismissed Liar 1 even went as far as saying “I don’t care about that” whenever I talked about how my school was doing in activities I’m involved with. \n\nNow her dismissing my personal conversation topics bugged me, NOTHING bothered me more than her shitting on my new friends. She even went as far as to diss her old friends. Calling them a variety of names and being nasty overall. \n\nThe conversation upped in awfulness when she told me she was Lesbian and liked a female the entire time that we dated. She also went as far as to say she wished she posted photos of her kissing women to get a rise out of me.  Then she goes on to explain that everything she did was just to distract people from her “very obviously gay” sexuality\n\nA few days pass and she decides to come to one of my schools public events to see her friends, the same friends she was talking trash about in the days prior. This didn’t quite sit right with me as she was blatantly lying to her friends saying how much she misses them. \n\nAfter our conversation she asked me to unblock her number, and I foolishly did so. While at this public event she asked me to speak with her in a public area. I saw this as the last time I’d ever speak to her because I was so hurt about her shitting on my friends and everything we already talked about. The same conversational topics came up and this time she was even more condescending. \n\nI realize I shouldn’t have spoken with her, but here’s where shit hits the fan and leads to me making this post. After her constant barrage of trash talk at my school I finally decided to have enough. I communicated the negative words she had to say about her friends and my friends to them providing them evidence and everything, my friends already didn’t like her because of what she did to me but her friends who she dissed a lot were mad at ME that I said something about. This lead to Liar 1 calling me and screaming and yelling at me about how much of an awful person I am for communicating what she said about everyone to them. I was tired of hearing things from her so I hung up and blocked her on all social media platforms etc\n\nAm I the asshole for exposing her shittiness? Was what I did immoral or undeserved?\n\n#tldr \nShitty ex girlfriend comes back from school to shit on all of her friends and proclaims her sexuality to me and explains how I was used as a fake cover for her sexuality. I exposed all of the shitty things she had to say about her/my friends. \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "*I should preface this by saying that my relationships with my much older half sister and her grown daughters are quite strained due to several narcissistic traits I’ve dealt with over the years that have caused me to go very low to no contact with them.  I don’t get invited to family events of any kind, don’t get birthday/Christmas wishes, etc.  My mom and I are fine most of the time, however she lives with them and can only see me if they let her use one of their cars, so it’s next to impossible to stay close with her when I can’t see her, even though I try to keep up with text often.*\n\n_____________\n\nLong story slightly shortened, I found my biological dad via Ancestry.com and have slowly been reaching out, talking to him and some of his family members, and finally met his wife this past weekend at dinner.  In addition to that, we made weekend long plans for a few weeks out to meet his other daughter, so I knew other social media posts would be coming soon, as this is all very exciting to me!!\n\nI should add, my mom knew about the numerous meetings, us talking and making plans, and our dinner out to meet his wife, and seemed fine with it, including sharing fond memories she had of him back then. \n\nSo, I felt the desire to share my excitement over being accepted by them, so I made a very respectful post with the photo we took with our significant others at dinner.  It mentioned I never knew who he was, which everyone who knows me knew I didn’t know, so this wasn’t some dark family secret.  I also reiterated that I never felt like I was missing anything by not knowing him growing up, and had a very happy, fulfilled childhood with just my mom. I would have never looked for him, so this wasn’t some desire to find a new family.\n\nWell apparently I’m a huge asshole according to my entire family because I’ve upset my mother by “making it public” because now “everyone knows she didn’t know who your father was” and “they think he was married” (he wasn't then), and “she’s’ so humiliated about people making these comments”. They hope I’m happy with my “new family” and that I treat them better than I do my “old family”.\n\nSince my profile is very private, the only mutual friends who would have seen it would not have made comments like that.  Most of them I’d talked to after the post and they were nothing but supportive, so I’m not even convinced comments were made to my sister like she claims.\n\nI understand that this was highly frowned upon many decades ago, but it’s 2019 now, we have a musical and two movies on this exact premise, so it’s not really a taboo topic these days.  These DNA tests are confirming far worse realizations for families that people should probably be embarrassed by, but I don’t see this as being one of them at all.  I’ve never felt uncomfortable knowing we didn’t know who my father was, but it was a huge part of my life, how I grew up, and who I grew up to become. To me, it’s not shameful at all.  It’s my story.\n\nSo AITA for sharing something publicly that involved my mom without telling her about it first? \n",

      "description": "So, my good friend is married to a man, let’s call him Jim, who’s easily pushing 300-350lbs. He’s about 5’8”, and just a huge dude. He’s quite clearly a food addict/binge eater and is both very sensitive about his weight and very unwilling to change any of the habits that have caused him to get to the size he is. I feel for the guy, as someone who’s had issues with food addiction ad BED in the past, I know how much shame and self hate he must feel. I’ve made a point of never bringing up his weight to him or my friend or anyone, but a situation has arisen and I feel that his weight can not be ignored. \n\nAnother friend of ours wants us all to go horseback-riding for her birthday. Initially it was just 4 of us gal pals from high school who were invited, but two of the boyfriends also wanted to come so everyone’s SO is getting a default invite. \n\nJim was talking today in the group chat about how excited he is to go, since he’s never ridden before. My problem is, that I have a serious ethical issue with someone of Jim’s huge size riding a horse. I feel strongly that it’s animal abuse for a horse to be asked to carry more than a maximum of 20% of its weight (this isn’t just a personal opinion, this is backed up by science and professional opinion as well). \n\nI don’t want to fat shame Jim, but I also really feel morally bound to say something to either him, his wife (my friend), or the friend who’s birthday it is. I’m not even sure what I would say to be honest, weight is such a hot button issue, and such a huge source of stigma and judgement. But I can’t endorse animal abuse just for the sake of an obese man’s feelings. \n\nAm I the asshole if I bring this up? \n\n",

      "description": "This starts November 2017 when my boyfriend (who I will call V) and I start dating [18F &amp; 18M now, for reference]. I go to his house for the first time and it’s kind of gross looking, but I decide to ignore it, thinking, “Maybe it’s just an off week?”, but every time I go there, the house is the same. Papers and trash covering tables, old food and empty bowls/cups sitting on end tables and foot rests, dishes filling the sink, kitchen counter covered in food muck and dirty dishes, bathroom floor, sink, and counter covered in hair, soap scum, and dirt, toilet with brown dirt covering the back, and more. However, I loved V and said nothing about the house. Most of the times I came over, we just stayed in the room that he shares with his brother (still messy, but less so).\n\nAs our relationship progressed, I found out whose job it was to clean the house. All mess was left solely to my V’s brother (who I will call T). T is a sweet guy, slightly older than V. However, he has a myriad of problems that make it difficult to stay on task and motivated for long periods of time [Autism, ADHD, auditory processing disorder, depression]. V tells me that their mother pays T money every month to clean because she’s always working and V is busier than T is.\n\nFast forward to October 2018, I end up moving out of my house and moving in with V and his family. It is with great displeasure that it dawned on me afterwards that I would now be living in previously described mess. At first, I tried to help out. I cleaned the whole kitchen as a sign of gratitude, but it turns out me cleaning hurts T’s feelings because it makes him feel incapable. I have had discussions with V and T several times that this house needs a different cleaning system, and offer every time to pitch in. V has gotten better at cleaning up after himself, but T shuts down any time I mention cleaning and goes down a depressive spiral of self-loathing.\n\nI talk with V about this a lot. He tells me that it’s his mother’s fault; she hasn’t set good standards for T to follow, resulting in his inability to find reason to clean since a) it’s just “normal” for their house to look like this and b) he’s not the one creating her messes (though it’s not like he cleans up after his own). She leaves food everywhere, so does T. She leaves clumps of hair all over the shower, T leaves hair all over the sink. She doesn’t clean up after she cooks, neither does T. She leaves her clothes all over the house, so does T. \n\nI just want a sit down conversation to maybe try something different.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend’s mom assigns all house cleaning to T, her son with a myriad of complexities that prevent him from cleaning in the way that’s needed. Half of the house’s mess is hers and the other half is T’s. I don’t know what to do or if/how to bring this up to her, considering she has been gracious enough to let me live with her and has treated me with nothing but kindness.",

      "description": "So I’m 19f and my best friend throughout highschool is getting married. Last summer we had a big fallout because we have both changed so much and I kind of became a socialist who does my own thing and doesn’t shave and she’s more centrist but is more focused on maturing and building a life with her fiancé and taking care of her brothers kids. I really respect her and what she has gone through because it is so hard but the falling out was hard for us. To accept each other as we are and forgive things that I said. \n\nBut fast forward to now. Had some spiff about Airbnb’s which I apologized about because it was my bad. When I talked to her mom to get advice (we were buddies too) about the rift in the relationship and the spat about Airbnb’s, she said I was being selfish and that the priority is to be my friend at all costs. It felt like I was reaching out to talk about the things I’ve gone through and my emotional and mental problems (it’s been a hard year at college for me, financially and with my family) and everyone was like “you’re being selfish, it’s her wedding”. \n\nMy friend then sent a message that she can’t be selfless anymore and there is to be NO DRAMA till the wedding. I was also asked to shave my armpits and wear pasties and be on my best behavior (which I agreed to do and I’m fine with it but still think it’s kind of shitty).\n\nI am definitely a self-centered person, I look to help my emotions first, but I never try to harm others and still try to help others. I know my friend is a very good person and is just under a lot of stress. \n\nBut AITA for thinking a wedding doesn’t mean I’m this selfish awful person for creating some inconvenience or not covering up my struggles or thinking it’s pretty wack to be asked to shave?",

      "title": "AITA For not Buying My GF a Gift for Her Birthday?",
      "description": "About 2 years ago I basically confessed my love for my now gf when we were just friends and she rejected me and said she just got into a relationship with a guy but didn't tell me. I was pretty devastated and all that and cried to her blah blah classic neckbeard type of shit. I also bought her about 1k worth of gifts in that time trying to buy her love towards me, it didn't work but she accepted all the gifts even though she was seeing someone else. For context I'm 22 now and she's 24, a few months ago we reconnected and one thing led to another and we started dating in September. It was her bday yesterday and we went out to this really expensive restaurant like the bill was almost $250 with tip, and I ordered the cheap food and 1 beer and she went all out lol, I didn't mind because she's my GF and its her bday. Later when we got back to my place she was visibly sad and I asked her whats wrong and she said that its her birthday and I didn't get her anything. At this point I pulled out a card I got her which I wrote a lot in saying how much I love her and everything which I really do I've loved her for years. And she opened it up and was thankful about being taken out to dinner and getting a card but she said she thought I'd actually get her something. I was kinda shocked because a nice dinner and a card is pretty good gift? Anyways it looked like she got over it quick and she left happy the next morning, but then after her sister texts me saying it was dickish not buying her a gift and I should buy something to make up for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "So, for about the past week these two kids have been riding an ATV up and down my street, and assuming the rest of the neighborhood. This normally would be totally fine with me except in this circumstance these kids are riding im excess of the speed limit (20 mph), they appear to be young (im guessing 14 and 12 years old) or at least not old enough to have a license, the ATV isn't registered, they are riding around with headphones on, and they have absolutely no safety gear on (no helmet, no gloves, hell not even a reflective vest!).\n\nThis is extremely dangerous! And very neglectful of the parents to even let their children do something so reckless. ATVs, while they are fun, are not toys! They are motor vehicles capable of traveling in excess of 50 mph! I don't want to file a report to get them in trouble, I am just worried about their safety. All it takes is one spill to lose your life, I would hate to be in my garage working and hear the squeal of some tires or a loud crash and have to see someone poor child laid out on the road. \n\nNormally, I wouldn't get involved in other people's business, but this just feels so dangerous that I can't help but feel like I need to contact someone who could assert some authority and maybe prevent a terrible accident. \n\nIm actually going to call the police now because they are now driving by dangerously close to other children playing in the streets, taunting and showing their middle finger as they drive by. Am I the asshole? Or is my worry valid?",

      "description": "Background- We have been friends for 8 years and we have had our ups and downs of course she's a bit younger then I am let's call her Lani for now. \n\n-THIS IS SUPER LONG IM SORRY!\n\nSo she's always been a lil hard to be around because she was raised different, which is understandable. She was raised as an only child who was quite spoiled. Im a middle child and it was either money being spent on my big sisters shopping habits or my lil brothers toys. Which I'm not complaining I love my siblings to death. Anyways me and Lani had certain disagreements, mostly when it came to her phases. As kids and teens it's normal to go through phases but it was just too much with Lani. First it was her \"gay\" phase (I'm bisexual so I'm not saying gay in a mean way) I have no problem with being proud but she was extravagant. The \"if you aren't gay I don't like you\" type. It was the only thing about her at the time her personality: Gay, Hobbies: Being Gay ect. It was just her default nothing about her stood out anymore and I told her \"The reason I don't hang out with you anymore is because I don't want to sit around and talk about how gay you are.\" I know a little harsh but shit it was sad to watch a creative being become a literal label. She did end up agreeing with me sooner or later. (She's pansexual now she says and I don't mind because she also has more to say then that ha) then she thought she was a boy (sensitive topic I know but they claim they are female now/ also I'm not transphobic my boyfriend of a 2 years is trans) but the thing is she never had dysphoria or had ever brought up wanting to be a boy and she told me everything. She decided to come out as trans and in a weeks time \"I want to change me name\" \"when can I get on T?\" \"Ugh I want my boobs gone ewww\" \"my mom won't buy me boy clothes what a bitch!\" This time I was like oh bloody hell. I told her \"do what you will but please think before you make drastic changes\" in a month \"I'm not trans I'm just changing lol\" ugh if another phase happens I'm gonna just stop trying I said to myself. And behold the latest trending phase Lani has presented. \n\nShe claims she has DID which is a personality disorder. At first I was like okay this kind of makes sense so I didn't think she was bullshitting so I just made sure she got properly diagnosed. It's been 5 months now she owns a ig page fairly popular and has over 30 alters or personalities. I have I hard time talking to her because she just blames anything she says on her other personalities. She went to a therapist and they said she doesn't gave it but she continues to say she does. Am I the asshole for telling her she's lying to herself and she's in denial? ",

      "description": "Went on a date with this girl last night it was going extremely well and after we finished eating and bowling I asked if she wanted to come to my place for drinks/dessert. I'm 22 she's 19 for context, she says yeah and we're in the uber making out and I tell her after we hook up she has to leave because I have a big day at work the next day and I'm gonna be up at like 5:30 so need a few hours of sleep at least. She says yeah thats fine and I even say I'll pay for her uber back home. After we're done banging, I say hey take your time freshening up and shower or whatever you want and let me know when you're ready and I'll order the uber. She looks really sad at this point and just tells me to order it now and she'll wait for it in the lobby of where I live and looked super pissed. I say ahh alright np and she storms out, the uber was $50 btw in addition to the food drinks at the bowling place which I all paid for happily. I get a text at lunch when I'm at work saying I'm a dick, asshole, cunt little boy, not a man, etc from her for kicking her out and she says the sex was bad because I only lasted like 15 mins (thats long for me LOL). I didn't respond yet but am I really a dick in this scenario? ",

      "description": "  \n\nThrowaway account. The background is that my bf and I are both in our early 30s, been dating a little over 6 months. He has 3 kids, I have 1. We have never met each other’s friends, family, or kids yet. I have been divorced almost 4 years. He has been living separate from and been separated from his wife for over 2 years, but they are just now officially getting divorced. This is a big point of issues for us, as I feel uncomfortable with him being legally married. I was aware of this when we first met, but once I voiced my concerns, he said it would be done immediately. Well, fast forward, and here we are 6 months later. However, it does seem to appear that they are actually working on this at this point. Anyway, my family members are either deceased or I have a distant relationship with them. I am kind of solo in the world. I feel really hesitant to meet my bf’s family because it seems like they’re all still so involved with her “ex” wife. The “ex” wife and one of his sisters work together. Every morning, the ex drops off their kids at his mom’s house, picks up his sister, and they go to work together. Then she takes her home, gets the kids, and goes home. He sees the ex daily. His brother is always doing various favors for her. He always tells me that he himself (bf) has “nothing to do with her” but I don’t see how he can seriously say that. I am not the type of person who thinks you can dictate others’ relationships. I would never say or think, hey, she can’t talk to your family. I just feel profoundly uncomfortable. It seems like they are all so close. Where would a new person fit into that? I have never dealt with a situation like this before. Am I the asshole for feeling uncomfortable about this? I dated a single divorced dad in the past, and although he remained close to his ex’s family (her mother and brother), it seemed like he had better boundaries. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense. I’m trying to figure it out myself. I guess I just don’t see where I fit in and it makes me insecure. ",

      "description": "Well this is a difficult one to write because I can already see what some of the answers are going to be, and that’s okay because I’ll accept anything I am given.\n\nA few months ago my wife and I had decided we should split up, for various reasons that I won’t say here and we are still living together. A few things had been happening and she wasn’t taking them very well and the best way she found to deal with it was getting drunk excessively and often. \n\nOne day after I had come home from work she seemed a little tipsy, and was sitting in our living room. I sat down by her to talk and ask about her night, and other various conversation topics that I don’t really remember. She then started to make out with me and insisted that she wanted to have sex, which wouldn’t be the first time we’ve had sex with one of us being drunk. I had pushed her away and said no multiple times but she wasn’t taking that for an answer and was being very pushy so we eventually ended up having sex.\n\nThe next morning when we both had woken up she asked if we had sex the night before, and after telling her that we did all she really said was “cool”. She later informed me that she had found some strong prescription painkillers and had taken some, and thus could not remember anything. I did not feel great about what happened but she never brought any issues up with me so I didn’t think there were any.\n\nI have now learned that she has told multiple people about what happened and that I had taken advantage of her. I am absolutely devastated because I thought everything was going well with us lately being friends and helping each other while dating others, and I really did not know his was how she felt until she brought it up the other day. I truly wish she would have spoken to me about this being an issue instead of telling others, but I am trying to be understandable since I know it’s not the easiest to talk to the individual you have an issue with.\n\nI know I should have stood by my initial answer of no and ignored her advances, but I didn’t even realize she had taken any medication and her actions really weren’t all that weird compared to normal. I am also not looking for validation from people saying that it wasn’t my fault or anything, I really just want other opinions on this whole situation because it really doesn’t make me feel good and she doesn’t seem to want to talk about it with me.\n\nTl;Dr: I had sex with my wife while she was on strong prescription painkillers which I didn’t know about, and she is telling people that I took advantage of her after she initiated sex.\n\n \n\n",

      "description": "I was at the gym with my sister who is much stronger than I am, and she wanted me to try a new workout where you put a bar weighing 60 pounds on your shoulders. I agreed, only if she’d help me put it on my shoulders and take it off again because I’m not strong enough. I did as many reps as I could, then looked to her for help, and she was nowhere to be found. I struggled for a couple of minutes and eventually some random guy at the gym came and helped me get the weight off. When she came back she said she saw a friend and forgot she needed to help me. I was mortified and angry and told her to fuck off, which made her so upset she said she didn’t want to go to the gym with me. Did I overreact? Is she overreacting? I apologized but she says it’s unforgivable, but I feel like I should be the one waiting for her apology.. help me out!",

      "description": "Going Dutch means each paying for their own meals. I am Dutch (this way of paying for dinners is normal in the Netherlands) and shared a dinner with two French friends. We finished our meals and received the bill. We noticed the waiter forgot one of our meals, and this meant that we were faced with two options. Either we're honest and tell the waiter that she made a mistake and pay for all of the meals, or we just pay the bill and pretend we didn't see. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we agreed to not go Dutch and each pay one third of the meal, there wouldn't be a dilemma, but there was. Let me explain. One of my french friends decided to go and order a much more expensive meal than what I ordered, the other friend ordered the same dish as I did (so, same price). Remember: We agreed to go Dutch before ordering. When we saw the bill, we noticed that the waiter forgot to push the \"2x\" button on my and my friend's cheaper meals. So let's say we went from a €35 (10+10+15 euros) bill to a €25 bill (10+15). We sort of decided as a group to not mention the error and pay the bill with the lucky mistake (€25). But then the friend who ordered the expensive meal suggested we still go Dutch (on the drinks and dessert), but we don't go Dutch on the meals, and split the €25 between the three of us. We'd each pay \\~€8,33 then, which, to be fair, is lower than each of us expected to pay when ordering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever I think it's very opportunistic of the friend to suggest this. I think that if you make an agreement, you should stick to it. Me and the friend who ordered the same meal as I did got lucky, the other friend didn't. The very reason the mistake was made was that the same meal was ordered and the waiter probably forgot to push on the meal on their touch screen twice. What my first suggestion was, was to share the 10 euros we had to pay for the cheaper meal amongst the two of us (who ordered the cheap meal). This way we both had to pay 5 euros, and the other friend 15 euros. After a short discussion my friend who chose the cheap meal chose to pick the other friend's side and split the bill evenly between the three of us. And so we did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still felt bitter about it though, and we kept discussing it afterwards. At some point I even suggested going back to the restaurant, telling the waiter about the mistake, pay for the forgotten meal and reallocate the money so that in the end we would have gone Dutch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe didn't do that though. Now I know that the Dutch are known for being greedy and cheap bastards, but I'm still not sure whether my suggestion was the better way to deal with the issue. Of course we should have chosen to be honest and tell the waiter that she made a calculation error in the first place. You don't need to tell me that. I am interested though in what your opinion is, which side would you have chosen, and... uhm... am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So, this happened last year while in Detroit for a Fleet Foxes concert. I drove up there with my girlfriend at the time and arrived a few hours early, so we decided to kill some time before the concert started. Once it got close to time for the doors to open, we decided to head down to the venue. \n\nOnce we got there, we noticed that even though we were 45 minutes early for the show to begin, there was already a large line of 50 or so people waiting to get in. So, as any normal person would do (at least in my mind), my girlfriend and I got in line behind everyone else. \n\nIt only took a few moments after we stepped in line before people started filling in behind us, as it was getting closer to showtime. After about 5 more minutes, I see these two younger girls, about mid-twenties, approach the two people in front of us. They proceed to ask if they would mind if they cut in line. The two people in front of us, also girls, said they wouldn't mind and looked behind while quietly asking aloud if anyone else would mind. \n\nThis is when I piped up and said that yes, we would mind if they cut in line, as we had gotten there before them and had been waiting in line a long time. Adding the fact that they had not even bothered to ask the other people behind them, who had been waiting just as long. Normally, I wouldn't have felt it was such a big deal but the audacity of these two girls thinking that they can just show up whenever they felt like it and shouldn't expect to have to wait in line like everyone else just really pissed me off. I also had a few beers before we got there, so that definitely made things worse. The girls then got looks on their faces that could only be described as a mix of annoyance and pure astonishment. \n\nThey then proceeded to chide me about how it was not that big of a deal and how they could not believe that I wasn't okay with this. I just reminded them of the fact of how long we've all been waiting and pointed out that it is extremely rude and inconsiderate to think that they could just show up whenever they wanted and expect to not have to wait like the rest of us.\n\nAfter seeing that I wouldn't back down over this, they eventually started making their way to the back of the line, as the crowd started making their way into the building. The two girls in front of us made some comment that I couldn't hear but could only assume was about me being an ass or something along those lines. I then asked my girlfriend later on whether or not I was in the right and she wasn't so sure and felt that it wasn't that big of a deal to let them cut in front of us. This made me feel like I was in the wrong about the situation and should've just let them go ahead of us. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Waited in a long line. Girls asked to cut in front. Said no. Was made to feel like an asshole",

      "description": "My friend and I go back for years. We always had each other's back in high school and now we're in college. She recently broke up with her boyfriend and went back into modelling/instagram photoshoots which is fine, I'm happy for her but there is this one specific photographer she shot with.\n\nI really don't know where to start. This photographer and I matched on tinder and he was super charming and sweet so we followed each other on Instagram but then I received messages from his ex girlfriend as a warning that this man is dangerous. He has beaten her, he has raped her, he has twins with her and does not pay support or spend time with his children at all. He is a psychopath basically. She did not send any proof at all about her side of the story but I still listened and thanked her for it. She and I had one mutual follower/friend so I asked him for confirmation and he confirmed the story and told me to stay away from this guy. I later tell my best friend because woah that's so wild and scary. She follows him on Instagram even after I tell her he's been charged with assault and sexual assault. She said that she wouldn't talk to him and just 'liked his aesthetic'. Ok.\n\nI later receive a document from other girls he's been talking to and they all have the same theory of the photographer being dangerous but this time there's proof with photos of bite marks, bruises, cuts, etc. It was pretty bad I sent it to my best friend. The photographer and ex girlfriend were both toxic to one another but that's their business and doesn't matter because I'll just stay the fuck away. \n\nMy best friend does not. She \"ran\" into him as this mall with him, another photographer and model. She posts photos of it and I explode on her. Telling her about how he's dangerous and she shouldn't be hanging out with him but then she says that she didn't know hanging out with him supported what he did/does. Literally she could've been hurt or raped. She doesn't know this guy personally, that was the first time they met up. She kept saying she was really careful and stayed with others. I have personally experienced being sexually assaulted and it still happened with my friends around so I literally just took it as a naive girl trying to push it under the rug. She knew what he did and does and stayed. I can't control her and not trying to but especially after the break up, nobody is there to help her realize that she just placed herself in a dangerous situation. Am I wrong or an asshole for cutting her out of my life? I can't see or feel the same about her or our friendship knowing she wants to associate herself with a rapist. It is her decision but it's me or him kinda deal.\n\nTldr; friend hung out with confirmed abuser and rapist, I don't want to be associated with that\n",

      "description": "So I’m 19, I graduated from high school last year and recently I got an invitation from my co-worker to go to prom with her. \n\nWorking in the same department for about a year now we’ve grown close over the past couple of months. Not in the “lovey” kind of close but rather just simply as friends. Anyways over the past couple of months every now and then the topic of prom would be brought up and she would generally just talk to me about her plans really. Things like what dress she’s gonna ware, if she wants to rent a limo or not, you know stuff like that. But most Importantly who she’s gonna go with. She doesn’t have a boyfriend or anything so she would talk to me about her guy friends and try to get my opinion on them and see if she should ask them. (I went to the same school as her last year so I know most of the people she talks about.) \n\nAnyways she never really told me but I imagine she never found anyone to go with as the other day she asked me if I could go with her. I knew the lengths she’d gone thus far to try and get a date so when she asked me to go with her I said yes. But now I’m starting to regret it. It’s not that I don’t wanna go with her specifically it’s just I’m not really the most sociable person so I’m kinda nervous about going to a party with people I knew last year. To give context I have some serious social anxiety so I’m already nervous going to a party with a lot of people, let alone people I don’t associate with anymore. \n\nAnyways lemme know what you guys think. Should I back out? Or should I just pull through? ",

      "description": "So, I need some help. \n\nA little (lot) bit of background: I'm a 13 yo kid, who's going through some shit. My biodad (biological dad) was really abusive. He emotionally abused the fuck out of me and my family. For all of my life, and most of my brothers life (my brother's 18) my biodad ignored us, and when he wasn't, he would be yelling at us or bullying us. He would bully us like he was a middle school kid, not care about our problems, and mock us. He didn't care about my mother, either. My mother and my biodad separated in August and legally divorced in September, and he left in October (2018). Ever since he left to live with his mistress (just a theory that he was cheating, but its a little obvious) half way across the US, we haven't talked that much, which makes sense, we never really talked while he was here. My mom and my biodad had some disputes over the phone, but nothing much. We did have quite a dispute during December though, but not going to get into that. \n\nMy backstory TL:DR: My dad is an emotionally abusive motherfucker \n\nThe current problem:\n\nSo my family and I (me, my brother, my mom, and my step dad [not married yet but I really like him so I call him my step dad]) planned on making another visit to where they live during the summer, and spending all of June plus some days in the other months (May and July). He wanted to spend a weekend with us at the lake, and we were cool with that. We said the only date we wouldn't be able to go was the 15th and 16th (fathers day) because its my step dad's birthday. He didn't notice that was Fathers Day (we didn't either) and he said he was cool with the 22nd. He then looked at the calendar and realized that the 16th was Fathers Day, and IMMEDIATELY escalated the entire thing, and insulting my mother saying it was \"fucked up\" that she didn't remember. My mom tried to defuse the situation, offering the evening of the 16th, and he through a fit, and said that was ridiculous. He insulted my mother a bit more, blah blah, and the end result was him texting us saying \"You guys really are cool with staying with some other dude than spending time with your own father?\" and my brother and I went off on him, saying what we have wanted to say for a long time (i.e \"my step dad is more if a father than you ever will be and ever was\"), not holding back. He didn't respond, and told my mother \"I get the message, keep them. I don't want to see them anymore.\" And that was that. \n\nIF TOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE ASK.

      "description": "I grew up in the UK and moved to the US when I was 19 and have lived there for the past 14 years and married my husband who has always lived in the US. Recently I went back to the UK with my husband for a few weeks to visit family. While we were there we went out to a restaurant, not a super fancy one but it was nice enough. In the UK you never really leave a tip at a restaurant, it can be seen as rude and usually won't even go to the waiter/waitress, it will just be given to the restaurant. My husband only really knows the american way of tipping so left a £10 note as a tip. I told him not to and explained the reasons but he said it was only fair to. He left it on the table as we were leaving but I turned around to pick it up without telling him. I didn't want to be seen as rude and thought my understanding of tipping in the UK was better considering I grew up there and he had only been there once before.\n\nAITA?",

I moved 5 hours away right before I turned 18 and have been in the same city since. We've gotten closer over the past few years because we don't see each other that often.\n\nMy brother and his girlfriend broke up and got back together recently. I had free time this weekend before the finals crunch so I texted him last night to see if I could come up to his city (around 3 hours away) and spend the weekend with him and we could hangout. He replied with the fact that he's going to his gf's hometown to spend the weekend with her and her family (at this point, he spends more time with her family than with his own biological family but whatever). He said he could *maybe* come back to the city today and we could hangout. I told him to forget it and I'll see him sometime after easter since I'm unable to go home for easter this year. Him and his girlfriend offered that I could go up to her parents place and spend the weekend with them but the thing is, I want to spend time with my brother. Not with his girlfriend and her family. I've never met her family so I'd feel a little uncomfortable staying in their house since I haven't met them before.\n\nI must add that we never really have brother/sister time. His gf is usually with him when we both are in our hometown visiting. I know that I have to suck it up since his girlfriend is now apart of everyones life but WIBTA if I told my brother that I wanted to spend time with him, not him **and** his girlfriend?",

      "description": "My brother-in-law had a brief marriage before marrying my sister a few years later. They’ve now been married for 15+ years and have 4 kids together. He didn’t have any kids with his first wife and has had no communication or relationship with her since they divorced years ago. It was such a blip that it never has come up socially in the family. I had no idea that my sister and her husband had decided not to tell their kids about this. ..\n\nI was chatting with my OTHER sister’s kids (ages 9 and 17) who were asking me questions about dating and relationships and I casually mentioned, “Yeah, sometimes divorce is normal and okay. Uncle X is a great guy who just didn’t find Aunt Y until after his first marriage.” I immediately realized by the looks on their faces that this was news to them. My whole family is very conservative and religious. I told them to please keep this private as I wasn’t sure it was common knowledge.\n\nThinking I was doing the right thing, I reached out to my sister (the one married to the divorced husband) and told her what had happened. She blew up at me, told me how sad she was that I would take that liberty, and  how confused her kids would be if they found out. I profusely apologized but also explained that I had no clue that they weren’t sharing that with their kids. That didn’t seem to make any difference to her. She really ripped into me and made me feel terrible. I called my husband in tears and he reacted saying that she was being unfair to lay that burden all on me. Regardless, she is hurt and feels betrayed by me and I feel terrible but also perplexed.\n\nHonestly, I can’t believe they’ve decided not to tell their kids... seems much worse for her kids (ages 9-16) to find out so late in life than to just grow up aware of it? I KNOW I don’t get to decide that for her, but I also don’t feel like her anger is fair given she had NEVER  told anyone in the family that this was under wraps.  I told a close aunt and another sister what had happened, and they both reacted saying they had no idea it was under wraps and it could just have easily been one of them letting it slip. \n\nSo basically, I now live in fear my niece and nephew are going to tell their cousins that their dad was previously married, that it will shock them, and that it will be a terrible and somewhat traumatic way to find out. It’s too much to ask of a 9 and 17 year old to keep something like that a secret from their cousins IMO and I wish my sister would just tell her kids in a controlled, peaceful setting so they would ‘t have to risk finding out from their cousins!\n\nAITA??",

      "title": "AITA for asking my wife to surprise me with whenever she gets pregnant?",
      "description": "A little while after we got married, my wife wanted to know when we should start having children.  I told her I am ready for kids even now, but I am obviously willing to wait for her to be ready.  I asked her, however, to keep it a secret from me when she's ready for kids, as I like the idea of being surprised with the news.  At the time, she loved this idea and got very excited, and found it analogous to how I kept the idea of proposing very secret from her until I actually asked her to marry me.  She's always wanted children, but we knew that we wanted a few years to ourselves first.\n\nFast forward a few years, and several of our close friends and family members have started having children.  I've also noticed advertisements showing up on amazon and pinterest regarding baby announcements and nursery remodels.  Additionally, although my wife is on the pill, I haven't noticed her taking any of her pill medication in almost 6 months.  We always go grocery shopping together, and picking up her prescriptions is just one task that she always assigns to me at the pharmacy while she browses the rest of the grocery store.  Lastly, the amount of sex that we've been having has skyrocketed.  There have been weeks when we would have sex almost every day, and many days it would be about twice a day.\n\nHowever, she's not pregnant.  I know because she still goes through her periods, and usually right after she has started her period she's usually okay with going out for drinks with friends, while she normally avoids it during the rest of the month.\n\nI have this feeling that there is a possibility that she is trying to get pregnant, but is unsuccessful.  Because I asked her to surprise me, she doesn't have anyone to talk to about this.  I don't want to take away the potential for her to finally surprise me with something she's very excited to tell me, but I also want to be there for her in case she wants to talk about potential infertility issues.  I have no idea if it normally takes this long to get pregnant when she's actively trying.  My brother and his wife got pregnant literally two months after their wedding, and I often wonder if this weighs on her.\n\nAm I the asshole for letting her go through this on her own in her attempt to surprise me?  As a man, what can I do to help?  Should I take any types of pills or supplements to increase the chances from my end that she won't tell me about?",

      "title": "AITA - For trying to push my husband with Tourette Syndrome to use CBD Oil?",
      "description": "Throwaway account - My husband (31M) has Tourette Syndrome (TS) ([Link, in case you don't know what it is](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tourette-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350465)) and we’ve been together 12 years now, so I’ve seen how much it controls his life, and his is a mild case. Aside from his tic, he has OCD and can often have a major panic attack if he can’t grasp a concept or gets lost driving around, has to go somewhere unfamiliar, etc. (he gets very angry, where our son and I will have to avoid talking to him, etc. or he will blow up.) and it seems to be getting worse as we get older (not better as it tends to do). Over the last couple of years, he’s also stopped showing much emotion and due to emotional abuse from my parents, my brain convinces me he hates me (or maybe he does, idk.) He doesn’t get excited much anymore and, in a way, it’s killing me too. I feel like our relationship is suffering due to this and when I’ve asked him about it, he has said that if he gets too excited, etc. his TS acts up and he can start to tic uncontrollably. I’ve only witnessed this happen to him twice within and it’s very upsetting for anyone involved (his tic is a cough btw, so during one of these spells he literally cannot stop coughing. The only way he knows to “fix” this is to go to sleep. During the last spell, I tried to get him to smoke some of my oil, but he refused.) There are some treatments for TS, but while he was growing up there were essentially none and I think he still thinks that, during our 12 years together, he’s never taken any medication for his TS or had any treatment aside from what he does to try to control his tics on his own. Which includes chewing sugar free gum or sucking on sugar free cough drops constantly. He's been doing this so much that he has damaged the inside of his mouth from the cough drop being stored in his cheek- which is another major concern for me.\n\nI (31F) suffer from chronic intractable migraines, basically I have migraines nearly all of the time and medication tends to give me zero relief. I’ve tried so many treatments to no avail and last month I gave CBD oil a try since it’s now legal in both the state we work in and live in. Medical MJ was also just legalized in the state we live in but NOT the one we work in and it has been shown to help with both TS and migraines, but because it’s not legal in our employers' state neither of us are seriously considering that route. Also note that both migraines and TS are neurological conditions.\n\nSince I started taking CBD about a month ago, I’ve felt significantly better and instead of being in excruciating pain 24/7, I’ve only had about two really bad migraine days. I researched CBD oil a bit before taking it myself and looked into it for TS too and it’s looking good that it could help reduce him of some of his symptoms. \n\nI asked him in the past if he’d take CBD oil and he said no, I asked why, and he didn’t give much of a reason aside from  “Nothing will help.” I explained to him that there’d be no harm in trying it out, there are virtually no bad side effects. I let it go for about a month then last night, I asked him again and offered to prepare snacks for him so literally all he’d have to do it eat a snack once a day. Again, he said no, so I pushed and asked for a legitimate reason why. He listed off some opposition, “I just don’t want to, it’d cost money (it’s not that expensive), etc. There could be bad side effects.” I tried to explain that there are really no bad side effects, it could help him and worst case it’s another thing that doesn’t help. This didn’t sway him at all so I got snippy and told him that his cigarettes (while they help his tics) are a waste of money and doing far more harm than this ever would (I should have brought up how he's damaging his mouth with the cough drops too, but didn't). He agreed they’re a waste of money but nothing more (him needing to quit smoking is an argument for another day). I lost my cool ‘cuz I’m a woman-child and told him he was being ridiculous and reiterated that it wouldn’t hurt anything, and he was stubborn, blah blah (nothing spiteful) but I didn’t feel like talking to him for the rest of the night because when he has his mind set to a decision, he won’t change it. (Example: We had a similar fight about getting married (after being together 10 years) where it took me over 6 months to convince him it was important to me and he needed to learn to compromise.) \n\nTL;DR - Ultimately, am I being a see you next Tuesday because I’ve tried twice now to convince to my husband to give CBD oil a try for his Tourette Syndrome despite him saying no? His constant ticing (a cough), having cough drops in his mouth, and smoking cigarettes is damaging his body and when he's older he'll likely pay dearly.  I also need him to start feeling emotions again (because he has essentially shut down due to his Tourette Syndrome). He used to react to things and anymore I just feel like I’m in a relationship with a zombie. There’s SOME (not a ton yet, CBD oil is still being researched) proof that CBD oil could possibly help him and it has helped me with my migraines. I have a feeling that I AM being the asshole here, but judge away. ",

      "description": "First time posting here.\nMy friends (Kate, Anna, Kevin and Brad. Names changed) and I have started celebrating our birthdays together. \nSo two days ago was Kevin's bd. We had been thinking about his bd for about a month. We didn't really want to give him just money as it would look like we didnt even try but he also never shared any of his interests. So we decided to make a quest.We sat down all together and wrote a story, drew a map based on local geography. We memorized our lines as characters \"in-game\" and prepared a reward for him. It being a fairly sized box filled with his favourite snacks coupled with a matching present bag. Additionally we ordered a drawing of us from a friend of Brad's.We all loved it! We bought a frame that had a similar mint colouring (which is Kevin's favourite colour) and put the framed drawing in the bag too. We also found a notebook that had a funny pun on the cover. BD week rolls around and we're all ready to go. His bd was on Wednesday so we postponed the celebration until Saturday.On Friday Kate PMs him and tells him that he should come prepared as there's an amazing adventure awaiting him. He just texts \"No\".\nSo after him basically saying \"I dont like this, I'd rather just stay at home\", we manage to get him to come anyway so he can at least take the bag with the goodies. He comes, we give him the bag and shortly explain what the story was supposed to be. He just kind of looks at us and says \"Even before leaving home I knew that I wouldnt like what you'd give me\". We decide to let it go and try to make the day better by making jokes, walking around and taking photos. Throughout the whole day he whines about the present and says stuff like \"what even is this. Why would you get me this. Im just going to give my mom these\". We try to ignore the negativity.Then at one point he said \"You know guys, Im really glad you didn't decide to make me go through this on my actual birthday because I actually had fun on that day with some other guys.\" You could hear a pin drop in the silence afterwards. Anna just called an Uber and left quickly after that because she felt so uncomfortable. I called my mom to pick me and Kate up. Brad left on the bus and so did Kevin. I come home really mad but let it go soon after. So we leave it at that until Kevin texts in our group chat and starts whining about the notebook. So this was the final drop. I start cursing at him and telling him how it's really disrespectful and he really hurt us by talking like that. His reply was, and I quote, \"Ok\". I plan on deleting him from our group chat after telling the others. I don't want to include him in any future activities even though we've been friends for around 7 years now. He has acted a bit like this before, but never to such a degree. Im still very emotional and I really need an outsider's opinion since I cant think properly right now. Am I the asshole for cursing at him and telling him to f off after all his whining? ",

      "description": "My dad over obsesses over EVERYTHING. He remembers one detail of a story, focuses on that, and then ignores the details. I used to think it was his hearing and he missed certain parts of conversations, but now I think he just half listens and passes off information he doesn’t feel is relevant.  Example: I told him last week I was applying for jobs and told him the date of an interview I am excited about. Now he calls me EVERY day asking “how did the interview go” and I have to remind him, it’s not until next week. It sounds like he really cares, but he is making me stress too much about it!\n\nEvery time he calls I am filled with dread of an awkward conversation and sometimes I ignore his calls. He then gets weird and texts me five times “call me” “call me” “tried to call you” “why didn’t you answer” “guess you don’t want to talk”. Sometimes this happens when I’m in a movie and I didn’t even mean to miss his call and then I turn on my phone to texts of him freaking out.\n\nAfter my mother passed away he quickly got a new wife, and while I am fine with that situation he didn’t talk to me for some time after they got together and now tries to call me frequently as though it was something we always did… when in reality we NEVER talked that much. We don’t have much in common. He doesn’t even understand what my job is. I tried to explain my Marketing job to him one time and he just started to look off in the distance (not listening) and then finally said “you are so smart” and we changed topics.\n\nI have tried to express my feelings to him about him “not listening” or how I feel about his new wife and he just freaks out and says “I’m gonna live my life, you aren’t my mother” and then promptly changes the topic to the weather. Not kidding, the weather is a COMMON topic for us.\n\nAITA for not wanting him to be super clingy and to live my own life with minimal contact? Do I just sounds like a whiny teenager? He has this whole new family now with tons of grandkids that he talks about all the time and he is great with them. I just feel like he’s not so good with kids once they become actual adults.",

It costs money to store the pictures even if I don’t edit them. \n\nShe asked me to take pictures and what’s the price. \n\nI said I couldn’t take money off a friend but to buy the backdrop for the photos. \n\nWhich would cost 80% of the sitting fee    So I’d be out of pocket for 20%sitting fee and then I would edit all the photos and give high res. I wouldn’t do that for paying customers unless they paid well for it. \n\nAnyway she seems to be distant from me now. Did I do wrong to ask for the backdrop? I thought I was doing a favor but also helping me too. I don’t exactly have time to edit over 50 photos for free and I didn’t buy my camera and photoshop to do free shoots for everyone. \n\nShould I have done it for free? Or just said my full price. Am u the ass for suggesting the backdrop? \n\nTl:dr: friend asked me to take photos. Asked what the price is.

      "description": "Main Issue:\nThis week and last week we had overlapping travel plans. I traveled out of state to my parent's house for 6 days and he left town one day before I got back. While I was out of town he told his girlfriend that she could spend the night in his room when he was out of town. He didn't tell me about this until I got back. \n\nI asked for him for his GF's number which he gave to me. I then talked with her briefly and asked her why she needed to spend the night. After I learned that it wasn't necessary for her to be here, I told her that I was not comfortable with her being here without my roommate being with her. To me, she is his guest, not mine, so he should be here when she is.\n\nBack story:\nI recently got a new roommate. He started renting on the first of the new year and we haven't gotten a chance to know each other well. Already he has had a few different overnight guests, one of which had a dog and a 23 foot camper that she need to park on our street. He cleared it with me first, but I was annoyed that he was asking for something like that so soon into moving in.\n\nI have come to believe he has a different expectations for personal boundaries than I. For example, one night I was making dinner when he came home from yoga. He came into the kitchen and started taking off his pants while he told me how he went the whole yoga class without realizing that his pants were on backwards. My girlfriend also rents a room in the house so it is not a single sex household. Either way, his room is right next to the kitchen and it wasn't necessary for him to change in my view. I didn't say anything at the time but I was bothered. He will also belch at full volume when he is in the house. It's loud enough that I can hear it clearly upstairs. We have also asked him to knock before coming up stairs to my or my girlfriend's room. Our rooms are the only rooms upstairs except for the laundry closet.\n\nI am now thinking of asking him to find a different place to live.\n\nI haven't spoken with my roommate about this yet. What do you think reddit? AMITA for telling his gf not to stay here? WIBTA for asking him to move out because I don't feel like him? ",

      "description": "So for context, I have two friends that I love dearly, but they make stupid decisions, so this post might be long, so I'm sorry in advance.\n\nMy friends (husband and wife) recently adopted an 8 month old Belgain Malinois/Shepherd puppy. She's cute as heck and super sweet. BUT she causes problems. The wife kind of has the mentality of \"My way or the highway\" and she found this puppy on a shelter website and said \"I want it\" and they drove almost two hours to get her. Now, I've worked in a vet clinic for over four years, I've birthed and worked with puppies, I've worked with almost every single breed, etc. Belgain Malinois and Shepherds require A LOT OF SPACE AND A BIG YARD. They live in a tiny ass apartment, so this puppy has no room to roam. As a result, she gets bored and she gets destructive, and constantly pees in the apartment. This dog has had no ounce of discipline whatsoever, and my friends won't discipline her. She's chewed up and destroyed my friends work shoes, she chewed on my PS4 controller, she chewed up my friends laptop charger cord, she gets right up in your face while you eat, she steals food right off your lap and has stepped on my groin/uterus area to the point I was bruised and hurting for a day. We took her to a Pride event and she wouldn't stop jumping into peoples faces and barking at people and other dogs. \n\nI get that shes a puppy. Ive dealt with puppies. But I know they need to trained as early as possible, so I casually brought up that their dog needs better training and they went ballistic on me saying \"I'm nOt gOiNg tO bEaT mY dOg tO tRaIn HeR, sHe's JuSt a PuPpy\". Bruh, I never said to beat your dog. They won't even scold her when she does anything wrong. She almost destroyed my PS4 controller and they did nothing. She doesn't see either of my friends as the \"Alpha\" and she just does whatever she wants. They think disciplining her will make her scared of them and she really won't listen to them. \n\nI would also like to point out that my friends struggle financially. She works full time, and he works part time. They barely make their rent every month, and most of the time, it's late. They're always late on one of their car payments, and this time they're almost 3 weeks behind. They eat out/order pizza 2-3 nights a week. They go to our local gay bar and spend $50+ on drinks and tipping the local Drag Queens. All in all, they're just not responsible with their money, especially the wife. \n\nThe last thing that almost made me snap was a few nights ago. They ran out of dog food. So instead of getting her more, THEY FED HER LEFTOVER CAT FOOD THEY HAD BACK WHEN THEY HAD A CAT! I was livid. And what's even more messed up? The wife sent the husband to the store for, get this, fried chicken, cookies and soda. My fiancé had to beg me to not call animal services on them. \n\nBased on this, AITA for being upset over this?",

      "description": "Background: I'm an *extremely* paranoid person, and already had one dude break in while I was home. I met him at the door with a gun, but it scared the crap out of me and made me pretty jumpy for years. I have cameras everywhere, and when I bought my house I specifically and **repeatedly** told my family I didn't want ANYONE outside of extremely close family to know where I lived. I did this, because my father is very nice and attracts clinger ons like nobodies business, and is constantly having to deal with druggy employees that are good people . . .just crazy ones that are homeless, car less, alcoholics that are constantly in and out of jail etc. I'm sure you know the type\n\n\nAnyway, at about 1:15 A.M. this dude shows up BLOWING up my doorbell, he rang it like 60 times in a minute and a half period. I saw him on the camera, and he had a little dog with him, so I assumed he was a neighbor or something thinking the dog was mine after finding a stray. \n\nBefore I could get to the front door, he circled around the house and was at the back door. I grabbed a gun (kept  it concealed so he didn't know I had it) and met him at the back door to figure out WTF he was doing.  \n\nIt was some guy who worked for my father months and months ago, that I have only met ONCE. My father brought him by house one day for some stupid reason, so now the guy knows where I live. I was extremely leery when I met him the first time, he was pretty shifty, and of course, had to come in side for something and saw that I have big tv's everywhere and all kinds of fancy crap inside. \n\nHe apparently *just got out of jail* today, and was walking across town to \"the house he's working on building\" to sleep, but there's snow on the ground so he was cold and wanted to \"warm up\" in my glassed in porch. I'm not heartless, despite already being EXTREMELY uncomfortable, so I said he could sit there for a bit and warm up, but he needed to head on. He was rambling some **serious** red flag raising nonsense about having to \"pawn some stuff for groceries\" and how everyone he knew robbed him and wronged him,  and how several including his own mother apparently pulled guns on him, and he reeked of alcohol as soon I opened the door. \n\n\nAn hour and a half later I saw he still hadn't left, so I went out and he was out there watching TV using a space heater I kept out there. I told him again he was going to have to move on, and made him think my mother was in the house getting nervous about him being there and was going to call the cops. \n\n30 minutes later, I was about to go out and tell him to leave or I was calling the cops,  when I finally saw him leaving. This was at 3, so he was there almost 2 freaking hours. I live alone and don't want random homeless people showing up in the middle of the night. I feel bad for him and his puppy, but come on! This is precisely why I try so hard not to let anyone know where I live. Now I won't be able to sleep the rest of the night because I have to watch the cameras and make sure he's actually gone. I realized after I saw him, that he was the same guy I called the cops on a few months back, because I saw him on the cameras messing around in my yard. I went out last time too, to see who it was but he was already gone by the time I got outside, so I let the cops know a dude was acting funky in the neighborhood. That was already pretty weird, but after a few days I just assumed it was some vagrant passing through, or weird funky salesman or something. \n\nI feel terrible that I had to make him leave in the cold on a day with snow everywhere, AITA here? I feel like Scrooge. If it had been someone I knew like a friend or something, I would have let them sleep on the couch inside, or if it had even been some of my father's employees that I at least *know* I would have let them sleep in the glassed in porch with the heater. But he just raised *so* many red flags.",

      "description": "I'm sort of new here so apologies if this doesn't really fit the theme of the sub so please feel free to delete or downvote!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bit of context ... \n\nA few months ago I came out of a relationship and not long after my best friend asks out of the blue if we could have a casual sexual relationship. (I'll refer to them as BF for easy reference.) I have never been attracted to BF emotionally or physically and count them as one of my oldest and closest friends. I wouldn't feel comfortable committing to that kind of relationship with them because its not something I'd want. We share a very close group of friends which has been going on for years now, one member in particular was introduced to the group by BF some time ago. (I'll refer to this member as M for reference again.) So in the past BF has confided in me in that they often feel jealous when other people have gotten close to M because they *were originally M's friend*. I've always said its a natural response but some people just click better then others and they shouldn't let it bother them too much. BF has even accused me of being one of \"those people.\" Me and M were very close at one point but life got in the way and we drifted. \n\nFast forward to now me and M have started talking again and after one very drunk night, we slept together. It was completely consensual and we both had a bit of a laugh about it the next day but did discuss about potentially taking it further. Of course we also discussed what it could mean to the group and the complications that could happen in the future.\n\nNeither me or M are wanting a serious relationship at the moment but are more then happy to be together, unofficially. \n\nI feel as though I have just stabbed my best friend in the back because what they wanted from me I wouldn't give to them but am willing to give it to someone else. I have had relationships in the past where it has been fairly casual, so I can understand why BF would think I'd be happy to do that with them. However, I actually like M. I am attracted to them, I enjoy their company more then just as friends and they've told me they feel the same way. We even discussed not doing anything because it could jeopardise our friendship group. So what are your opinions?\n\nThanks! \n\nTLDR: AITA for not wanting to commit to a casual relationship with my best friend but instead committing to one with a close mutual friend of ours? ",

      "description": "I recently moved to CO and work in Denver. There's just something about this place that just makes me happy. Maybe it's working a better job than I've had before, maybe it's the sunshine, I don't really care what it is but I feel inspired to just BE better.\n\nSo, Denver has a pretty large homeless population and working downtown, I have met a few different drifters. For the most part, I like my \"regular\" homeless folk near me. After living in Chicago for a while, the random street people I encounter are more friendly and kind. Idk, they're people and deserve good things.\n\nAnyway. Last Friday was cold. Not quite Chicago cold, but cold enough to layer up. I noticed one of the local homeless women in the alley by my work wearing a sweatshirt and no shoes, shivering as she ate a sandwich. She regularly asks for \"help\" (usually money or cigarettes)but I never carry cash and don't like talking to strangers more than I have to. I had just finished spending time at the christkindl market, wearing a strong coat, alpaca socks, and sipping on warm spiced wine. Like, damn, my life is good but a few poor decisions and untreated mental illness means I could be where she is.\n\nSo, that night, I went out and bought some supplies to make little bags of stuff to give to the homeless people I run into. Strong socks, knit hats, fleece gloves, wet wipes, kleenex, hand warmers, femine products, granola bars, chapstick... I got enough to make 7 total kits but I kept that woman in my mind and also grabbed a fleece blanket and washed an old parka I haven't worn that's still amazing for this weather that even has the fleece lined pockets. \n\nI was ready for the next time she hung out in front of my work.\n\nSo, I see her today through my window at work and we're crazy busy. I dropped what I was doing and grabbed the coat and the bag I had made for her. \n\nShe took the bag and said \"uh cool... do you have any cigarettes?\" No. I did not have any cigarettes for her.\n\nI watched her root through the bag I gave her, then throw it in the trash outside my window, blanket and all. When I left work for the day, there was a nice puddle of urine and random wrappers and cigarettes around where she was sitting all day.\n\nI feel stupid for trying. I can't be mad because I'm a stranger and she didn't ask me for anything, but seeing that bag of stuff thrown away made me feel like I did something wrong. \n\nWas I being presumptuous by assuming that winter supplies would help her out? She's wearing the same stuff I saw her wearing in August. I wasn't wanting a thank you, I just wanted her to be warm, but seeing that bag of stuff thrown out hurt.\n\nWhat do I do with the rest of these kits I made? Giving them out individually now seems terrifying. I truly don't want to be the asshole, but maybe I am. Should I just give out the random coupons I keep getting for $3 packs of American Spirits instead of giving these hats/gloves/socks?\n\nSo, am I the asshole, even if I'm not trying to be?",

      "description": "Hi, I'll make a long story short. I broke up with my girlfriend of 1.5 years (I was her first boyfriend) a few weeks ago. A week later, I had sex with a girl. My ex was constantly asking me about it the week after I did, and I did not intend to lie to her, so I was honest and told her I did have sex with someone.  \n  \nShe gave me a lot of shit and has been getting angrier and angrier ever since. I never cheated and have always been honest, but she thinks I'm inconsiderate by moving on (at least physically) so fast. Saying I've changed and have become a terrible person, not the guy she loved. The works. Am I the asshole here?  \n  \nTLDR: Had sex a week after breaking up a relationship of 1.5 years, now my ex-gf who I still care about as a person thinks I'm literally hitler",

I live in a shard flat with a friend. Usually, I am the one who wakes up last in the morning while my friend goes already to work. One morning I wake up, go to the kitchen and see that he left a pot with soup on the stove - which is still on (on low). I was not completely sure how dangerous it is to leave the stove unattended, so I googled and called even a friend to get a second opinion. Short google search &amp; my friend both told me it is not very smart. Most cases nothing happens, but if something happens it is quite dangerous. So I write a message to my friend that I don't want to mess up his soup but I can not leave the house without turning off the oven. He was a bit mad, but did not really say anything. I thought that the case is closed and he will not do it again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne week later. I just came back from a weekend at friends and see - big surprise - the stove is back on and nobody is home. When he comes back, we have a quite big argument and don't really come to a solution. He does not see any danger on leaving the stove unattended and things I am an ass for turning off the stove all the time. ",

      "description": "Last week I went to a concert at a large arena venue. We were literally second to last row and these nosebleeds are so high that you're looking down at the stage. If someone in front of you stands up, you literally can't see anything but the rafters.\n\nFor some background, this was Fleetwood Mac. There were many age ranges. Mostly, however, there were older people (70s, seriously) and several of them I heard complaining about knees hurting and such. So the concert begins and literally nobody except those down in the general admission against the stage itself are standing because old people and you can't see shit and most people are being courteous.\n\nNow, let me say that I understand people want to stand at concerts and I am all for it given certain circumstances but you have to gauge your audience and the venue. Literally NO ONE in the upper bowl was standing.\n\nSo, about four songs into the concert these three young girls come late and don't sit down. I let it go for a moment, but they're directly in front of me and I can't see shit. So I gently tap the girl directly in front of me and say, \"Excuse me, but when you stand up like that, I can't see anything.\" She immediately gets aggressive. \"So, what?! I'm not allowed to stand up at all during the concert?!?!\" I said, \"Literally no one else around you is standing. There are older people here who can't stand this long, and nobody behind you can see.\" At this point she turns to the people around us and starts asking rudely, \"Can y'all see?!?! I think you can see!\" And after a moment, one older guy in the row behind me just goes, \"NO!\"\n\nSo she sits down. This happened during my all time favorite Fleetwood Mac song, so now I am pissed that the song is ruined. I'm trying to enjoy myself and let go of my anger. She obviously can't let it go, because almost a minute later she whirls around and goes, \"THERE ARE MUCH BETTER WAYS YOU COULD HAVE SAID THAT TO ME!!\" and I said, \"I'm not getting into this with you. Turn around!\"\n\nShe didn't take it any further. The next four songs, they were scoping out empty lower bowl seats and eventually left to go steal some.. which I was more than okay with. However, the more I thought about it, the more I wondered if I was being unreasonable asking her to sit down. I mean, it IS a concert. \n\nIf you're looking DOWN at the stage, I feel it's rude to stand and completely obscure the people behind you, especially when no one else is standing. I can understand standing if you're eye level to the stage or looking up at it, or if it's general admission. \n\nIDK. The older man agreeing that he couldn't see either made me feel a little validated, plus the fact that she immediately got aggressive which means she was expecting someone to say something.. but, maybe I should have just kept my mouth shut and stood up (thus obscuring more people's views) myself.",

In the last 2 years the small amount of friends she still had was going down to the point were until friday she had only one, wich she fought with saturday (I didn't understand the reason, but it had something to do with her thinking he was rude with a friend of his) at wich she came runing to me saying that she couldn't handle it anymore and that she didn't understand why people where runing away from her.\n\nObviusly I tried to be nice and herd her speaking for half an hour(keep in mind this was at 23:30)and then I sent her an audio that said \"Look you're sad and depressed i get it and I don't want to see you miserable like this, so im gonna tell you wath I tell you since we meet: you're toxic,manipulative and a giant liar and everytime I tell you this you block me and go cry to someone about it. But I don't hate you for it I want to help you get better and if-IF you don't block me I will help you\". She blocked me instantly.\n\nBUT NOW IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS: the bitch recorded the screen of her phone with our conversation WITH MY NAME AND PROFILE PICTURE(WICH WASN'T EVEN ME, IT WAS MY LITTLE COUSING) AND POSTED IT ON HER TWITTER FOR HER 15.000 FOLLOWERS TO SEE. Now my dumbass couldn't just say \"fuck it\" and enjoy the rest of my weekend, I STAYED UP UNTIL 3 IN THE FUCKING MORNING trying to talk to her to make sure she was ok, all this while she posted stuff in her twitter lie:\"I want to die\",\"I'm an horribel person\"and\"Don't be mad at him(me) he just said the truth\" all the while her followers were talking shit about me. Now one thing that she didn't do at least was to release my number(wich her followers asked for)\n\nSo when I saw that I just did what I should have done to begin with and said \"Fuck it\" and went to play some games with my buds. The next morning my friend was checking her account and found tweets talking shit about TONS of people from my school, including but not restricted too: me(obviusly), a guy who she dumped years ago, the only friend she still had and to put the cherry on top THE NEW STUDENTS WICH SHE HAD NEVER TALKED TO.\n\nSo Reddit I ask you guys do you think that if I had aborded this differently it could have gone better?AITA?",

      "description": "First off, I want to state I am expecting an everyone sucks, as what everyone did was a bit out there, but I was ruthless. Secondly, I am going to try and give as much as I know from her side too so as much from both sides I can give are on the table and can be better evaluated. Third, I do suffer from schizoeffective disorder so I am also not always in the right state in my life. This is going to be a long one.\n\nTo kind of get a hint of what kind of relationship we had, we had a long distance online relationship that started with us being friends for a couple years. When we started dating I was 18 and she was 16, her in California and me in Indiana, the Romeo and Juliet law in Indiana being within 4 years of the adults age the minor is allowed to be with them, but her its still the age of 18 so I knew there would be risk. We also kind of grew more towards each other as we shared similar traumas, we are both child abuse victims, and both rape victims and we kind of were able to help each other through our experiences as we knew what it was like.\n\nWe got together after I asked her out (not a catfish, we had video called before) in October of 2017. We kept things going until December of the same year, her getting into trouble and getting grounded from the internet, and I told her I would wait for her. I kind of kept in touch with her friend when she got back online and we didnt contact each other directly as her mom knew about me and didn't like me. Finally on my 19th birthday I had to get back in touch, and created a secondary account akd contacted her, and we reconnected and continued our relationship.\n\nWe kept a nice relationship going for a while, her having really picked up art in our time apart, her even offering to draw one of my characters (this comes up later). We kept talking and she eventually confessed that she suffered from depression and told me that she does edibles and takes hits from the weed vape thing ( I don't care to know what they are called) and she was scared to tell me as she knows I dont like it due to the connections of my abusive alcoholic parents also being drug dealers. I told her it was fine, she had a decent reason to use it, but one of my main goals is to get her happy enough that she doesn't need it anymore, and I succeeded eventually.\n\nAnother thing she suffered from was her mom's boyfriend, he was constantly when her mom wasnt home groping her and sneaking into her room at night and stripping her (he didn't rape her, that was about a year before we got together) and finally after he got arrested for paying for prostitution her mom finally decided to press charges as he was also found with stolen items and drugs. A detective came to her house and got her side of it, and asked if she told anyone and she mentioned me, in which turn they asked if I was willing to talk to them about what I know. I agreed to do it for her, even knowing I was at risk of legal trouble considering the ages, and I had also seen nudes of her. I luckily didn't get in any trouble and they never askes about that, but at home her mom accused her of seducing her boyfriend and that she wanted to fuck him and smack her around for it. I offered when she turned 18 I would go down there and pick her up, taking her to my place and she could be safe with me and she was happy too, so I spent some time saving up, asking her too as well to make things easier but she was addicted to buying art, which consisted mostly of my character and hers as a couple even though I asked her repeatedly not too.\n\nAfter sometime she grew a bit distant and then one day her mom called me talking about her and some other guys, one of which was her in a group chat with a bunch of gay guys who would send nudes to each other and stuff, I kind of let it slide. There was this other guy though, who in her contacts was known as E. I confronted her about it amd she confessed that when we were separated that she didnt know if I would wait for her, so she started looking and found him, apparently not telling him about me when I came back, not wanting to upset him. I also now regrettably let that slide as she came clean and stuff, sending me screen shots. I forgave her and we started to grow together a bit more. We had our 1 year anniversary, I bought her some gifts and stuff, and we spent the day together. Then we started to grow apart again and our relationship went on for another couple of months, of which we had a switch of me moving to her as she may have a job lined up at pixar with a friend she knows there, not that it mattered anymore.\n\nI tried my hardest to keep the relationship interesting as she said she was growing bored but everything I tried she shot down until eventually we split up and decided to be friends. She said I made her happy but she wasn't sure if I was something she wanted to spend there rest of her life with, I asked if there was any chance of us getting back together amd she said no, I later found out why.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks we were talking and she was upset at first, saying she finally worked up the courage to break things off with E, later turns out he was talking to other girls behind her back as she was talking to him behind my back. I talked her down until she wasnt sad and even happy. Then she randomly told me her parents weren't home, which confused me as she only told me that when she was horny and wanted to vid call or something, so I asked about it amd she said she had a secret to tell me and couldnt tell with her mom around and had to do it while actively deleting the post. What she told me was a fucking atomic bomb, but I wont say what it was until later.\n\nAnyway, she asked me if I would let her keep my character as she saw it as a power couple and wanted to keep them together. I told her no and that I was kind of hurt by her comment, then she continued to say she was sorry and that she was hoping I would say yes to make things easier. She planned on using them whatever my answer was so I got angry with her. The next day I said fuck it and that I didnt care but she could tell I was bitter and told me if I want him back that I would pay her the money she put into it without my permission and I got on her about blackmail and all that even though she argued it wasnt blackmail. Eventually I said fuck it and left it open and even more bitter.\n\nThen she had the dumbest idea in human fucking history. She wanted me to meet her new boyfriend, which I understood why we wouldnt get back together as she had moved on in less than a week. Me being upset and now depressed I didn't want to but she decided to put us in a group chat anyway. I tried being civil and kind of state stuff and when I mentioned being somewhat depressed he tried saying it was my fault that people treated me badly and yada yada. So I left the group chat and she got mad at me saying I am the asshole and I need to grow up and kept throwing me back in a group chat with him saying I needed to work out my problems with him as he kept actively calling me a pussy, bitch and that I wouldmt last a day where he was from typical tough guy shit. I kept leaving as they both attacked me and she told me I was being immature and I was attacking him and need to apologize yada yada.\n\nI finally asked her about him, she had KNOWN him for 3 weeks, he was the guy she went crying to about our relationship saying she wasnt happy without talking about it at all with me to try and help our relationship grow. He was the guy who said she should leave me and she got with him while still talking to E and before she left me. I also found out she was cheating on her old boyfriend with me before getting with me so she is in a vicious cycle. Then she told me he had the passwords to her accounts and hers to his (something she wouldnt do with me, now I get why) saying they dont lie to each other. I brought up the big secret she told me and she told me to not dare tell him so I already caught them in a lie. She had also already sent him nudes in the 3 weeks she known him, pretty much admitted to me that she cheated on me. I still decided to be the civil one but I refused to talk to him. I even tried telling her he was a fuck boy, I guess on Reddit it would be r/niceguy and she wouldnt have it.\n\nFor the next two days she kept throwing me in group chats that I kept ignoring, her pleading with me to make peace with him because I am one of the only two people in her life that truly make her happy, me and him, so at this point I knew she didn't give a fuck about me. So I told her no, and I suggest she stop because I am tired of her and her time with me she should know that what I have done to other people who crossed me I am not one to be fucked with.\n\nThey both kept fucking with me....and I snapped going to his direct message sending him a screenshot of her big secret without even saying a thing to her.\n\nShe had sex with her dog. I put on the screen shot saying when she cheated on me she had the decency to do it with another human.\n\nI followed up in her DM saying that I am not one to be fucked with and she gave a quick fuck you, then blocked me. He followed up messages to me saying she was crying, at this point I truly didn't care, I was on a warpath. I told that her future is in my hands, and that I still had the number of the detective I risked myself to talk to for her and he immediately broke down, telling me I win, don't tell him or her mother he said I hurt her enough and what else could I possibly want from her. I told him I don't really have a reason to not tell them, I didnt care anymore. He broke down, pleading with me, telling me I win, apologizing, asking me what I want to get this to stop. I said I want one thing, exactly that, I didn't even say what it was, nor did I really even think about what it was, but he had a hell of a guess. ",

Well my step mom, now no longer married to my father, was a huge role in my life and will forever be grateful for her. But she had a son who was my step brother in the sense who would abuse me, in more than one way and that includes the one I don't really like talking about. That happened for 5 years starting at the age of 7. So fast forward I probably have severe mental issues and I haven't been diagnosed yet which is terrifying, again this is just one part of my fucked up story, I ended up drowning myself in booze till my family told me I had to go to rehab and stay clean, which I did till I relapsed. My step mom found out about it and called me up and I was so frustrated and angry at everyone and everything and I let slip what happened and made her cry to which she talked to her son and he confirmed everything. So am I the asshole for telling her even after all these years have passed",

      "description": "The organ donation industry really bothers me. How it works is that the medical industry wants everyone to \"give\" them their organs when they die (and sometimes before). Then the hospitals make millions of dollars harvesting and selling the organs and tissues from each person and then a broker is paid to transport them and then other hospitals and doctors make millions of dollars implanting those organs and providing after care. \n\nThis is THEIR business and in the US they charge draconian amounts of money that far exceed the actual cost of those services and they think it is their right to charge whatever they want on the grounds that we have to have it. \n\nBut if an individual wants to do the same thing and charge for his or her organs then suddenly that's wrong. It's immoral to sell your organs because people need those organs. \n\nWhy is the capitalist model great when hospitals want to make a profit, but immoral if an individual wants to do the same thing? \n\nThey want capitalism for themselves and then they expect socialism when they think they can game the system. \n\nIf they want what is mine then they can pay me (or my heirs) for it. \n\nThe fact is that if organs had a monetary value then there would be more organs to help people who need them. Yes, it might be more expensive but more people would be saved. The cost would be more than justified if more people got organs. \n\nAt the least if they take my organs for free then they shouldn't be allowed to make a profit. They only get the expenses for the organ  removal and implantation. That way the whole process is a donation rather than hospitals being able to make money off of the kindness of others which I think is unethical and immoral.\n\nAnd before you make your decision on whether I'm the asshole then check this [LINK](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-07-14-9103190600-story.html)\n\nAlso, you have to pay to donate an organ. It costs about 5,000$ for a living donor transplant. [Here](http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/21/opinion/fry-revere-organ-transplant-donors/index.html)\n\nAt every stage hospitals expect to make money. They will charge the full amount for organ removal, transportation and implantation. They aren't doing ANYTHING for free and they are even charging donor's families for the harvesting of their dead children's organs and also for the failed life saving care. \n\nBut I'm the one who is supposed to be selfless? \n\nFuck that. This is the United States. If the powerful get to charge draconian amounts for health care then I should have the same right to sell my organs for whatever I can get. \n\nFair is fair. ",

      "description": "Hi everyone. So, I(24M) have been going through some drama with my girlfriend(23F) this week. It all started on Tuesday, but let me back up a little more for necessary background information.\n\nSo without going into too much detail to protect identities, I am in graduate school and recently one of the professors in my department at my school was accused of posting a sexist statement on social media. There was some social media backlash and outrage. I think at the moment, we do not know yet what the departments response will be. But I believe the professor is getting investigated or something. \n\nMy girlfriend and I have discussed this a lot and we are definitely on the same side. We both agree that what this professor shared was not OK at all. I told my girlfriend how I have discussed this with many of my colleagues and students, especially the female ones. I made sure to talk to my female students and make sure that they felt comfortable studying with me and that the professors statements do not reflect my beliefs or the departments. \n\nSo back to my story, on Monday evening my girlfriend shared an article about this situation. Since I am finishing my first graduate degree, and want to leave doors open with the faculty here in case I come back for the next degree, I hid article from my social media because I didn't want to burn any bridges with my professors. \n\nIn the morning she discovered I had deleted the article and she completely freaked out. She thinks I am being \"not a true ally\" because I didn't want to share the article. She thinks that I should be willing to throw my career under the bus to fight for what's right. I tried to tell her that I discuss this with all of my colleagues and students and I feel that that does more good than social media does. I tried to tell her I am on her side 100%. She was having none of it and blocked me everywhere. \n\nShe later sent me an email saying I have to post the article and send her a screenshot or she will never unblock me. I did do this, and she unblocked me. \n\nBut after about half an hour I felt weird that if my faculty saw the post, they may not let me come back for my terminal degree, and so I deleted it again. I felt like, after this professor had already been chewed apart on social media, me sharing it wasn't doing much good, especially when I was trying to do real good in person.  When she saw this she freaked out again and has had me blocked for the last four days. Apparently she's breaking up with me now because she doesn't believe that I'm truly on her side. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to share this article? My gf is very passionate about this and is choosing to die on this hill. But I really don't want to burn any bridges unnecessarily especially when this professor could already be getting fired. But I am confused and truly don't know if AITA. ",

Anyway I go up to the register, go through the normal transaction and then I see that there’s the 1 warranty added on, so I ask him to take it off. He says ok, but I could see that he was a little upset about this. I didn’t think anything of it and I just walked out. Later that evening, I remembered watching those GameStop employee stories on YouTube and remembered how they have a game warranty quota they have to reach. This made me feel kind of guilty as I easily could have just payed the extra dollar and he would have been able to meet his quota. So idk, AITA for not just leaving the warranty on the bill.",

      "description": "First time posting so sorry if this doesn't fit the format and if it reads weird etc, I just thought it would be better to do it from my perspective. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a precursor this is not a story about me but about one of my best friends, who I have known for 16+ years and so am intimately familiar with her family dynamics. She recounted this story to me and it has been ongoing for a couple of weeks now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to start things off my friend (21), upon finding a relatively lucrative job following leaving school has found herself in a position of some financial stability, though is by no means financially independent as she has to support her household a lot, and is presently one of two of the six of her dads children who can drive. If she wants something then she can buy it, and she lives at home with two of her siblings whilst contributing towards the upkeep for her home significantly. Her family are all either her age or older aside from her younger sister (16) and half have reasonable jobs which keep them afloat, the other half do not and get a lot from welfare. Since she has a well paying job her family use her as effectively their personal ATM, all of them constantly ask her if they can borrow money as well as effectively demanding lifts from her; if she refuses then they get pretty annoyed. They take her very much for granted, and expect her to do things for them without any consideration of her life or her feelings. One example of which for perspective, is one of her sisters asking her for a lift to the shops which are a 10 minute walk with her three children for a quick shopping trip, then leaving them in the car with my her to mind for **an hour** (which she didn't say she was going to do) whilst she went and did whatever shopping she needed to do. My friend then gave them all a lift to their dad's house which she didn't mind, but as soon as her sister wanted to leave she expected my friend to drop what she was doing and take her back without having even asked, no please and no thank you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this is not to say my friend won't do all these things, as they're her family she tries to help them all out as best she can but on the whole they are all very ungrateful for the things she does for them. It frustrates her when they take liberties and expect things from her without actually considering to ask. A couple of them will often get her to give them money by saying it's because they can't afford things for their children, even though she lends the money with that purpose which they then spend of doing things for themselves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow with that in mind, this Christmas as my friend was doing financially okay she wasn't particularly concerned about the gifts she received and so said to each of her family members that in lieu of buying everyone a present this year she would donate to a charity of their choice instead. She said she didn't need a present herself, and so if they wanted to do that as well they could. The previous year she had bought her brother a lamp as his present, so to her this made a lot more sense as someone else would get a lot more use out of it. What's more is that one of her nephews is critically ill with a heart defect, and so charity to their family is important as it's helping to fund research for the treatment he needs. It's worth noting here this is in England so other than travelling to different hospitals (which my friend has to do for her sister 99% of the time, missing work because the other drivers in the family won't do it), there are no costs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she announced that this is what she would be doing, **shit hit the fan**. She received tirades of abusive texts, all with the theme that she doesn't get to decide that their presents should be given to charity. Her parents argument was that she should have just left it at her presents from them being donated, not both ways. She maintains this is what she's going to do, but she will buy something for her dad, which I wholeheartedly support as he works hard to help her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally think that it's a fantastic idea and that with the amount that she does for them everyday is Christmas. Having said that, I would be very selfishly disappointed not to receive presents of Christmas from my siblings. Whatever she would have got them though with the amount she would have spent, they can all easily buy the same for themselves as through either work or benefits they do have enough money to cover the cost of her gift.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, is she the asshole for not buying her siblings tangible Christmas gifts? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr incredibly generous friend decided to donate to charity rather than buying her siblings presents and suggests they do the same, is effectively branded an asshole**",

      "description": "So my wife and I are good friends with a neighbor up the road. They have a 20 year old son who has had many issues with drug abuse, in and out of rehab, recently got out of jail, and has underlining mental health issues that sometimes reveals itself in aggressive behavior/outbursts. \n\nMy wife reached out to me via text message today about offering to pay him money two walk our two dogs. One is a 10 year old lab mix and the other a year old, full bred Weimaraner. I said “no” because I don’t trust him and would prefer not to possibly enable his drug habit.\n\nI offered instead to teach him everything I know about “flipping.” Flipping is buying things at yard sales, liquidators, etc and selling it for a profit. This would require him to spend time with me which I could use to give some life advice as well.\n\nIn short, I was deemed an asshole for saying “no” to the dog walking and “so full of myself” for thinking I could mentor him.

Previously in college I lived in various dorms so it's not like I have no experience with loud neighbors.\n\nSo, about three weeks ago, a family of five moved in above us (four children, a dog, and a single mother). Obviously the day they moved in it was understandable the noise being created but as the weeks have gone on it has never really gotten quieter. They live above us so we hear their running, stomping, and yelling all the time. Sometimes it sound alike someone is walking through my apartment and not the upstairs one. The kids play in the stairwell and the sound bleeds into my livingroom. It is honestly driving me crazy.\n\nThe loudest thing I do in my apartment is play electric guitar and bass. I know for a fact that our downstairs neighbor barely knows we are there half of the time. I don't want to be a dick and give this single mom a hard time, especially since I don't know what it's like having four children but I'm at a loss.\n\nSo reddit, will I be the asshole?",

I love them to bits, they aren't perfect and neither am I, but that's why we go together. \n\nSo, into the details here. My partner has slowly been hinting at wanting to find our own place someday, which, I find is great! Cool! But, whenever we have a discussion about the actual logistics about it all, and I discuss what I think is quite important in getting a place: money, steady work, etc they get incredibly upset and believe I'm putting barriers up in not wanting that? Which isn't the case entirely, I'm just trying to consider, well, what we need to consider? I am not afraid of the commitment here, I just want to make sure these things are discussed. I think it's a big thing? \n\nIt seems like we can never have a mature discussion about it and they just think that getting a place is simple. So, I was fully honest and mentioned I'm not at all comfortable moving in with them or getting a place until we have discussed things like rent and that whole process and.. Boy. Did they get upset. They were incredibly unfair and harsh in their wording with particular things and reacted in an incredibly immature way. Am I the asshole for being honest here? \n\nI was not harsh in my wording, I wasn't blunt or rude, I was being politely honest in how I felt about everything. I felt these are really important things to discuss and it felt like I wasn't heard or even understood. \n\nNow I'm sat in a coffee shop on my own at the moment trying to figure out what the hell to do here. I told them we need to talk about it again when we've cooled off, but I can't help but think that I wasn't listened to. \n\nIf more context is needed I'll be happy to try and help, thank you. \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to go to my MIL's 1 year AA Birthday?",
      "description": "I am mobile, so I apologize for formatting of it comes off incorrect. \n\nBrief Background:\n\nFor the past 3 years my MIL and I have had a tumultuous relationship. My husband and I married in 2014. My mother died in fall 2015. My son was born early 2016 and MIL \"moved in to help with household and chores\" 3 weeks later, a fact solidified by her the day my mother had died.  It was to be temporary, until she got \"on her feet\" in a new province, away from the rest of her family.\n\nWe knew she drank. We didn't realize how much. We didn't know to what extent her health (both physical and mental) had deteriorated, and how dire her financial situation actually was. This \"temporary\" arrangement looked more and more permanent as time went by, and I began to react very poorly to these circumstances. I would love to just type a list of all the complaints and issues that took place in the year and a half she was still drinking, but it would be dishonest to act as if I wasn't blameless many times as well. There are far too many times that I really was the asshole in all this, and my relationship with my husband suffered as he was pinned in the middle between wife and mother. \n\nA year and a half in, MIL went to treatment and began her recovery journey. However, despite apparent sobriety, a lot of the behaviours of issues did not stop and I watched her swap alcohol addiction with food addictions (being a diabetic) and shopping addictions. My anger and resentment continued to swell, and I continued to choose to react like a total asshole. I finally recognized that my choices could end my marriage and I went to counseling (who I have admittedly not seen now for a few months, as we ended in a natural place). Despite this, I still finally snapped in an asshole move, and kicked MIL out 1 week after my second child was born (2 weeks shy of her living with us 2 1/2 years, rent free most of it until the last 4 months or so). She was (finally, after several months of arguments to do so ultimately to this point) just securing housing when I snapped, though still without a secure place to live. I became angry at her continued behaviour and yelled at her to leave. She said I couldn't control people. I said no, but I could control what happened in my own home. She called me abusive, and that was it. She stayed away until her house was secured.\n\nAnd then we never talked about it. This happened in July and we just ignore it, like we always have. Neither of us have apologized, and quite honestly I am not sure I want to. I try to stay civil, and when she asks to see the kids I try my best to make arrangements. These are minimal, I realize, but I try not to be a totally petty bitch.\n\nJust before Christmas MIL told us about her upcoming AA 1 year birthday. I am dreading it. I don't want to go. A lot of it is the fact that she hasn't apologized over any of the crap from the past nearly 3 years. But neither have I. I just assumed that there would have been an AA step for reconciliation by now, and yet nothing has materialized. I just spent a week with her over the holiday back home (for them) and witnessed the continuing behaviours in which I became angry over in the summer, albeit with no alcohol.\n\nI am just so tired, and I want to engage as little as possible, and emotionally detach. I told my husband I didn't want to go, and he just said \"ok\". I think neither of us wants to argue any more.  I wouldn't stop him from going, not the kids (as she wants them there). \n\nWIBTA if I didn't go to my MIL's AA birthday? Or should I be trying to be a bigger person and put my pride and anger aside? I am not feeling in a supportive or healing place in our relationship.",

We’ve been living together for almost a year and I try my hardest to be supportive and understanding, but sometimes I just can’t. \n\n\nI came home from work around 10pm last night to find him feeling quite sad, he said he wasn’t feeling well(emotionally and physically) and that he had too much to drink. I could tell he was really sad so we laid down together and I told him to put his head on my chest so I could caress his hair and back. I wasn’t mad at him or upset at him in any way, I wanted to help him feel better and show him I love him. That is until he told me a “joke”. He said earlier at work him and a coworker were talking about substances they have tried in the past(acid and mushrooms) and about how messed up on them they’ve gotten. They were discussing ways that they have handled being with sober people while they themselves were f’d up on these substances. My SO said he told his coworker that he likes a challenge and that one of his favorite things to do is to try and trick people that he is sober while actually being f’d up. His coworker found this comment hilarious and apparently this comment was the joke. I didn’t find it funny at all, in fact, upon hearing this comment my entire feelings towards him changed and I became very angry and upset and hurt. \nMy first thought upon hearing what he said was “so this is just a game to you? You have fun doing this?” \nHe has told me in the past that he feels he is letting me down by drinking all the time, by being high and not productive and that he wants to change. I now feel that his comment implies that he really doesn’t care how much he drinks or that he is  always high and that he doesn’t care at all for trying to be sober. \n\nKeep in mind that he made this comment at work while he was pretty much sober(because work) and was re-telling it at night while drunk.\n\nDue to the intensity of my feelings I tend to ‘shut down’ as to not feel anything and I become mostly ‘numb’ in the way I act. He apologized immediately but I just didn’t want to be near him. I fell asleep on the couch instead. This morning he apologized for being drunk last night but my feelings haven’t changed. I’m still angry and I’m still acting indifferent towards him. He left to work and has messaged me “I’m sorry” and “I miss you” but I’ve just ignored them. \n\n\nSo am I an asshole for becoming very angry with him for what he said? Am I overreacting and blowing this comment out of proportion or do I have a reason to be upset?\n",

      "description": "This is a story from a few months ago that haven't been able to shake.\n\nRight between my college and the subway station there's a small bookstore. This one day I go to take the subway but it's closed due to an accident. It was announced that it would be back up and running an hour later, making me late for my job. My phone was dead and I was starting to freak out a little because I had to find a way to contact my boss to tell her I'd be late (I get nervous really easily). \n\nI go outside and see the bookstore. I head there, thinking I can politely ask to use their phone for just a minute. It was really cold outside so I got in the store in kind of a rush and since I was already nervous I walked up to the counter and asked for the phone without really paying attention to the salesman. Unfortunately, he was helping a customer and I interrupted him which is obviously my fault. I'm not claiming otherwise. \n\nAt that point I was really embarrassed and apologized for my interruption and tried to explain that I hadn't noticed he was speaking with a customer. He was obviously angry and I didn't blame him for that. It was pretty understandable given what I had done. He asked me what I wanted and I very quietly asked for the phone. I was so embarrassed by my mistake. I just wanted to make the call and get out as soon as possible. \n\nBut then the guy just started being really unnessessarely mean (in my opinion). He said: \"Of course. It's always the people who just want a service who are rude like this. MY customers are decent human beings.\"\n\nAt that point, with all the emotions I was already feeling (the embarrassement, the nervousness, the stress, the cold) I just started crying (I cry easily in situations like these). I mean obvisouly I made a mistake and it's ok to be mad about that but I apologized many times and so this just felt so unnessessary. \n\nSo I tried to hide my tears while I made the call and the guy just kept going. Saying things like: \"I swear, people are so inconsiderate sometimes.\" and \"Young people just don't know how to behave in society.\" \n\nI couldn't take it and ended up just putting the phone back on the counter and leaving in tears in the freezing cold. I ended up going to another small shop to make the call.\n",

For the last year I've been doing commissions to get money for things I'm potentially interested in buying,  nothing big maybe a headset or a new controller for my ps4.  Thing is..  My parents make me ask to use the money before I actually use it.  Today, I was feeling especially scandalous and since my mother makes me wait until my dad's home from work at 9 pm to ask for things because she \"doesn't know,\" I didn't feel like waiting.  The Sims 4™ was on sale for $6 which is a HUGE 88% discount for the Deluxe edition. The thing is my mother comes to me when I'm playing on the ps4 around 10 when my father got home and tells me that the password on the PayPal is being changed because I cannot control my financial urges. My issue being,  no other money is on the PayPal aside from my hard earned cash.  I sit idly by while my parents spend the money on Facebook games and such without a care given,  but the one time I spend $6/$23 in the account they've decided I'm no longer allowed to use my own money.  It's really frustrating and I really need to know. AITA for arguing the account should remain untouched? ",

      "description": "My wife and I have a 6 month old baby girl and a two year old boy. Wife hasn’t been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and I actually just got a new job. \n\nAt my old job I was working 45-50 hours a week. At my new job my hours fluctuate a lot — it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. I make a lot more though so there’s that. The pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. My wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a SAHM which is what she’s wanted. \n\nThe issue is that my wife and I aren’t on the same page about what this change would mean. Before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. We also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (Plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). \n\nI told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. These cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and I also think it’s practical.  She was mostly agreeable to that. But then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. \n\nI told her there was no way I was going to be taking on as many work hours as I am and then come home to cook or clean too. That would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. \n\nShe looked at me like I was some sort of Neanderthal but I think what I’m saying is completely fair. I’m not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. Just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. I recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce I would support her 100%. But I think it’s fair that if I’m the sole paycheck and working crazy hours I don’t come home to more stress and chaos. \n\nObviously my wife and I will have to work this out between ourselves. I’m mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base. ",

      "description": "My husband mentions the other day that my mother-in-law is planning a family reunion of sorts to coincide with her birthday in a beach town. Her plan would be for us to rent a beach house with them on the water which sounds great except it will be the middle of August and depending on dates we will have a 4-6 week old newborn.  The travel time to this destination is only 3 hours so I don’t have an issue with that so much as the other factors which are: this location is a small beach town and literally every activity on trip advisor etc is the outdoor/active type (aka no museums or indoor tourist spots to go if the weather is too hot), average temps in this area tend to hit 80s/90s during this time and newborns can’t wear sunscreen or regulate body temperature as well as adults can so there is a very good chance one of us will be stuck in the house with the baby and not able to join the group for long periods of time, if the baby is colicky (fingers crossed this is not the case) I don’t want the added stress of taking a trip with minimal sleep, and the birth will likely be a c-section so depending on healing I may not be able/cleared to swim yet.  My husband totally gets my reasoning so that’s not an issue, but my mother in law tends to be passive aggressive and get butthurt over things/situations like this (she was a nightmare during our first child’s birth) and it might not be worth the drama to skip the trip.

      "description": "I’ve had cats around me for my whole life. I volunteered at a cat shelter for awhile after college. I have done enough research to come to the conclusion that declawing a cat is tantamount to abuse of said cat. \nI was in a relationship with a man and he was talking about getting a cat, but wanted it to be declawed. I had been seeing him for about 3 months when this came up. I told him in no uncertain terms that I thought it was cruel and would not stay in a relationship with him if he did that to an animal. I further explained that if it was that big of a deal to him, there is a local shelter that at any given time has some number of declawed cats and I would support him adopting one of those so long as he had the knowledge to support one of these cats ( understood that they sometimes have litter box trouble, understanding the danger they’re in if they get outside and willing to make accommodations to deal with the issues)\nHe was livid and thought I was ridiculous for putting a relationship with a person who I might otherwise have been happy with on the line over such an issue. I think it speaks to the type of person he was and didn’t back down. It blew up and led to the deterioration and eventual end of our relationship\nAITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway. My parents have been very good to me for their entire lives. I am very lucky to be supported by them. But I cannot help but feel like they should have gotten a divorce a long time ago.\n\nIt is obvious that they have huge issues communicating, as they usually have shouting matches every other night. This has gotten to the point of being physical, and I threw Dad away from Mom around last year. Afterwards, things got \"better\" for a little while.\n\nDad does not know how to communicate his feelings properly, and Mom has a bit of a language barrier, so she cannot understand everything he says at times. The thing is, Dad knows this, and still does not have any patience whenever she doesn't get something. This is also vice versa, where she will try to communicate her feelings to Dad but he won't understand. \n\nThroughout my life, they would argue in front of me, threatening divorce and whatnot. It sucked a lot. Dad didn't have anyone else to talk to, so he unloaded all of his gripes about Mom to me for a long time, every day he took me to school, for years. It caused me to resent her for a while, after hearing all his one-sided stories. And I feel incredibly guilty about that, because I found out a lot of those times, she had every reason to be angry with him.\n\nIt didn't happen all the time. But I would always feel tense whenever they were together. There were \"good times\" before the arguing started again. It took a while before I learned that arguing each day with a partner was not normal, or having \"breaks\" from arguing was not normal.\n\nI have been advocating for them to get a relationship therapist or marriage counseling. I tried to communicate with my Dad to give Mom some more patience. That didn't work. Both refuse counseling, saying they can do it themselves, and I'm fed up. I gave up trying to fix it by myself, but I feel like I haven't tried hard enough. At the same time, I feel like no matter what I do, nothing will change. I also know I should not be their relationship therapist, or some kind of mediator. But it just fell on me many times.\n\nI don't want to be afraid to move out for something bad to happen to both of them. I don't want to be able to hear their shouting through earbuds blasting music. I don't want to feel anxious each time I hear their raised voices in case some physical crap happens again.\n\nIt hurts. It puts a lot of stress on me. I hate them for it, and I feel like an asshole for hating them for it. Am I?",

      "description": "I just wanted to know a more objective opinion, because I fell like everyone who knows any party in this situation is going to be biased. The story isn’t exactly very interesting or life changing, but I have been feeling wronged and like an ass simultaneously, and don’t know what to do. Should I apologize?\n\nSo basically, it all started as a normal conversation at the dinner table, there haven’t been any arguments recently or anything, and everyone seemed to be in a good mood. My parents were asking about my plans for the summer, so I said that I was going to try to get an internship at a psychiatric hospital for the two moths I will have off from uni (it is something that many med students do where I am from, not necessarily a psychiatric hospital, but in a hospital in general, because that helps with getting a job later), and didn’t want to add any other plans in advance in case I get it, so that there wouldn’t be any complications later.\nMy mother instantly seemed to be annoyed by what I said, and simply replied with:\n\nM: “If you want to work in a psychiatric hospital you should get of your medication first”\n\nI felt that this was really out of nowhere, because my medication is not exactly for a behavioural problem, or for a mood disorder, or anything. And even if it was, what does it have to do with anything? When dad saw where the mood was shifting, he instantly excused himself out of there (honestly, I wish I had done the same thing), and so there I was, left alone with my mum. I told her, that the medication I was on was prescribed by a professional, and that it really improves my general wellbeing (it is a SNRI, because I have insomnia, and it really helps me sleep).\nShe says, that I am too young to be on that kind of medication and therefore am not mentally stable enough for that kind of job. I got a bit irritated, not going to lie. She constantly tells me that I shouldn’t act like a know it all because I don’t have a degree yet, but sometimes the things she says are really ridiculous and she still won’t just accept that sometimes she’s wrong.\n\nSo, this is the part that I regret. I was tired of listening to that, so I interrupted her and said, that if she has no medical training at all, let alone a degree in any medical field, she shouldn’t think that she knows better than professionals and that she shouldn’t just throw her uninformed opinion around. She got angry about this, and said that she was just looking out for me, and that I supposedly never listen to her. I got up and tried left the room, because I didn’t see the conversation being beneficial in any way, because we were just both getting mad, and haven’t really addressed this to her since.\n\nI feel like I was wrong by telling her not to say what she thinks, because that’s just her opinion, and when I think back, she should be allowed to express it. But I also feel like it was wrong of her to call me out on a thing I have no control over.\n\nAITA for not wanting to hear her out, because I thought, that her opinion was uninformed?\n",

      "description": "Right, this is my first proper post on here so bear with me. \n\nIn 2017 my sister and her family went on holiday for 10 days, they came to me about 2 months before they went away and asked me if I could house sit and take care of their animals; a lab, two Labradoodles, two cats and their fish.\n\nI agreed, since I often do favours for people, largely her and her family, lifts, pick ups from nights out, emergency child care, babysitting etc etc, standard brother stuff. Not expecting compensation. Not because that sister is legendarily tight, which she is, but because that’s how I’ve been raised. A favour is exactly that. \n\nHowever, she “insisted” on paying me, no amount was agreed but she promised. Sure, I could do with the money. \nLooking after the animals turned out to be a right ball ache since it meant getting up at stupid o’clock before work, and spending my evenings there so RIP social life. \n\nPLOT TWIST she paid me. £120 from what I remember, which turned out to be a good deal for both of us, she saved about £300 in kennel fees and I made a little side money. Smashing. \n\nAfter that Things were going great in the family, she even upgraded her car to something new and I bought her old one from her at family rates, a shade under market value. (With a few moderate problems that needed fixing, new front shocks etc, but I fix them myself). \n\nHOWEVER, this recent summer rolled around and she came to me again a few months before her annual holiday, “Can you look after the animals again, 12 days this time, and; “I’ll sort you out with some money just like last time.””\n\nYeah sure! \n\nSame as last time, a ball ache but thinking “great, it’ll pay for my lads holiday” and the animals are genuinely lovely. \n\nThey get back, don’t hear from them in days. Meh, jet lag. \n\nThen finally I find out they swung round while I was at work with my payment... a £10 keg of Heineken...reduced on offer... \n\nEVEN NOW I have a strong ambivalence on this, because I feel ungrateful for being annoyed. But pissed I wasn’t properly compensated as promised. \n\nShe has since explained to others of an entirely fictional conversation with me where “she did me a favour in reducing the price of her car,” and therefore I was “repaying” her...of course forgetting that she promised compensation/payment... “after” I’d bought and refurbished the car... \n\nOur relationship was rocky for a long time. \n\nI’ve never seen the money. \n\nThe keg sits unopened in the garage. \n\nGenuinely... Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "The store I work (local chain) for recently closed a location in another town, and a couple managers transferred over to the location where I work. \n\nOne of these managers (lets call her \"Carrie\") was talking casually to another manager and a cashier (\"Jane\" and \"Riley\", respectively), and mentioned casually that she used a homophobic slur to jokingly insult her boyfriend. (The F one, if that's important to know.)\n\nNow, the location that I work at is a little different from the others, as many of the employees are LGBT. It's in a very liberal town, and the proportion of gay people here seems to be much higher than in other parts of the US. The other stores in the chain are in smaller towns, and the atmosphere is very different. \n\nThe two coworkers she told this story to are LGBT (not going to specify for anonymity), and they were very uncomfortable hearing this. I'm gay, and upon hearing this, was also uncomfortable. This store employs many LGBT people, and most managers do their best with pronouns and preferred names. People in same-gender couples feel comfortable talking about their partners openly. \n\nNeither Jane or Riley told our store manager (highest ranking employee at our location) about this. I feel it's important for her to know, as this has already affected how safe at least three employees feel (I'm not sure if they told anyone else about this). \n\nObviously it would be best for either Jane or Riley to speak to our store manager about this, and I'm going to talk to them and see what they want to do. I know it's not my story to tell, but neither of them seem like they want to tell our store manager.  WIBTA if i went to the store manager and told her about this?",

      "description": "Okay so to start this off, this issue really has been solved I just wanna see what everyone else things not to justify myself but I’m just genuinely curious.  \n\nSo a while back my friend group had some plans to drink my 2 roommates my girlfriend her best friend and her girlfriend.  We do this almost every Thursday as it’s kinda always an informal plan.  Anyways we make very loose plans for 8 i emphasis loose because that’ll come back later.  Anyways, in the meantime me and my roommate go to see her girlfriend at work and decide just on a split decision to go see a movie.  I tell my girlfriend we’re gonna do that and we might be a little late to the get together, but my other roommate was there to let everyone in.  My girlfriend said she’s fine with it.  Anyways I thought everything was fine, until apparently my girlfriend and her friend say to each other it was really fucked up.  But didn’t tell me and my roommate they thought it.  We arrived at like 9:30-10:00 and we just drank and watched stupid horror movies.  I just don’t get why they were upset it wasn’t very formal plans, and my girlfriends best friend the one that was most upset actually just spent most of her time speaking to her significant other in the kitchen not really even hanging out.  \n\nI’m only making this post now because I found out like a month later my girlfriend thought it was fucked up but didn’t tell me at the time.  When I tried to defend my logic she said “why are you so defensive why don’t you just apologize and say it won’t happen again.” But I don’t feel like I should have to?  I asked her permission to go at the time and she told the friend group where we went.  \n\nSo what do you guys thing?  Am I a oblivious ass? ",

A guy in my class was asking how Prof A is like in a class discussion. I mentioned briefly meeting him in the bookstore. The prof in charge of arranging this rotation (Prof B) was surprised and said profs rarely openly admit they are \"clueless\" when it comes to books in their fields. She later asked more questions and then smiled and said never mind. \n\nAnyway, I later mentioned his incident to my mum when we were talking about the possibility of male profs being nicer to female students. My mum was very upset I mentioned how Prof A asked for book recommendations to Prof B. She said I am in my 20s and even Prof B could sense he was flirting so surely I knew what was going on. My mum got really angry at me and she thinks I told Prof B what happened at the bookstore as I enjoy bragging about the attention I got from Prof A. She asked what was my agenda in doing that and reprimanded my actions as nothing good will come out of it (Prof B will either see me as gossiping about Prof A or Prof A being flirty with everyone). She said what I've said about Prof A in front of Prof B and my peers is \"extremely disrespectful\" to Prof A. I said I only mentioned it as I gave Prof A the benefit of doubt and only casually mentioned it as a small talk topic.\n\nSo am I the jerk? I am really upset at my mum as she seems to think I am being very disrespectful on purpose when that was not my intention. Tbh Prof A said even more borderline flirty stuff but I've skipped all of that - I only mentioned him asking for book recommendations as it is relevant to his field of interest. I've noticed how my parents often jump to the conclusion that I am the jerk when I discuss interpersonal \"conflicts\" outside of home with them and I am not sure what to do in these cases.",

      "description": "AITA- So my boyfriend and I have constant issues with who each other is talking to. In this particular case it’s someone I have known for almost three years now. We were friends for a year and a half and at about that time my friend and I started hooking up. We never considered it dating and it lasted for maybe about a month. Afterwards we agreed we were still friends and would still hang out. Flash forward a year my boyfriend and I have been dating for about six months and he has asked me not to talk to this guy anymore. I agreed because I know it upsets him. \nSo today, my friend messaged me a picture of myself he had on his phone from a year ago today. I kindly respond “hey, I’m sorry but I can’t chat because it causes problems in my relationship since we used to hook up. Please don’t think I’m ignoring you.” Immediately after I tell my boyfriend and he gets beyond mad because I had said previously that if my friend messaged me I wouldn’t respond. My boyfriend says i shouldn’t have said anything because last time my friend and i talked I briefly said i had to go because us talking had upset my boyfriend. I get called a liar, told I always go back on my word, etc.. I have expressed to him how upset it makes me that I can’t talk to people that are my friends (he’s made me stop talking to other guys that I’ve never slept with) but he doesn’t see this guy as my friend. \nSo basically, AITA for telling my friend instead of ignoring him like I had said I would?

He has a problem of not letting things go, if I said I’d do something and fell asleep early he gets mad and throws a bit of a fit and won’t text me all day or something. He’s kinda selfish and tends to always make things about him. Well yesterday it was around 8 am and he started getting sexual I told him I had a long day ahead of me and we could do stuff that night after I got off work and finished studying for my exam on Friday (I’m super stressed). Anyways he asked if I wanted to try something he’s been talking about wanting me to try for a while (I’m not opposed to it we just haven’t gotten around to it) And I said well I’ll see, it depends how tired I am, he then threw a hissy fit being like “you always say that, you never do anything for me” blah blah blah. He was mad at this point I got pissed. I didn’t say anything I responded calmly and firmly that we would try it eventually but I’m very stressed. And he then proceeded to ignore me for a good 8-10 hours. After I got home from work I was exhausted, he didn’t bring it up but he’s still acting bitchy even this morning, giving me one word answers etc. I just don’t know if I’m in the wrong here? ",

She was constantly picking fights with people, she was depressed, and so anxious she barely left the house. It looked like it just kept spiraling down and things kept getting worse. My parents are divorced, but they still get along well. I thought it would be helpful to get my mom, dad, and myself together and take her out to eat and let her know we love her and support her and talk to her about how we think she may need some help. Basically it was an “intervention” she wasn’t expecting. She was pretty mature about it while it was happening, there were some tears. My sister brings it up all the time that it was a crappy thing to do. I can imagine that it may have felt shitty that the first time the four of us were together again it was because of this reason, but I feel like it was a necessary wake up call. ",

      "description": "Mobile blah blah Stoopid format\n\nOkay, I know from the title that it sounds like I want to confess to this girl. I don't. I actually want to tell her that her actions make me a little angry.\n\nSo I met this girl about two years ago, but we never formally introduced ourselves until about a month ago. Ever since we've known of each other's existence, she has just been very rude, and not like obviously rude, under the radar kind of rude, you know what I mean? Like, what she says throws a ton of disrespect without actually strictly saying things, and it gets very much on my nerves.\n\nShe's called me gay multiple times for my hairstyle and my hobbies, I'm not gay and I've affirmed this multiple times and she continues to do it. She calls another one of my friends gay for the same thing minus the hair, but he doesn't seem to care.\n\nShe also has this weird habit of asking if my hair is greasy (it's not) and then telling me it is when I insist that it isn't. It gets very much to me as I take pride in my hair.\n\nAlso to mention, another one of my friends' friend dated her for a while and said she was a nightmare to deal with. They broke up after maybe a month. I don't know what \"nightmare\" strictly means, but that doesn't sound good.\n\nThe one main thing that conflicts me here is now that we've gotten to know each other, she doesn't do it to me as much, but she's still rude to other people. I only got to know her because we were forced to sit near each other in class, and despite the divisions, I try to be nice to everyone, so we learned a thing or two. As I was saying, I'm conflicted, because some mutual friends we have are closer to her, and I'm not sure they would like it if I told this girl about how I feel with her actions.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA?",

      "description": "In March of this year, I moved down to California to start living with my girlfriend, who became my bride-to-be very soon after. We’ve had our ups and downs, have generally been happy, but one thing has come up over and over again: I’ve always felt like a total servant boy. \n\nWhenever we have garbage, I’m always the only one to take it out. When we have dirty dishes, they’ll sit in a pile untouched until I do them. \n\nI’m almost always the one who cooks dinner; and when I cook, I do it alone while she relaxes in our room, but if she’s the one in the kitchen, she expects me to be there with her to help. If I work late, I’ll always come home to find her sleeping next to an emptied UberEats bag- she never seems to cook for herself. \n\nI’m always the only one who does the laundry, though she does have an excuse for that one- she tells me she’s afraid of secluded, closed-off, dirty places, and so our apartment building’s laundry room gives her the creeps. That’s fair enough, so I tell her she can make up for it by folding the clean laundry- but she always procrastinates on that for days. I’m currently sitting next to a pile of her clothes that was finished on Wednesday and she has still not put away, and that’s how it generally goes whenever I ask her to. Usually, I just don’t bother asking and put it away myself, but then she will complain that she can’t find where anything is and that I did it wrong. To her credit, she once told me she feels uncomfortable about folding my laundry because she thinks I’ll just end up complaining about how she did it, and that’s completely true- though I regret it and do my best not to repeat it, I have behaved like that in the past.\n\nAnd the one thing that bothers me the most is that, day in and day out, she is always telling me to get up and bring her things from the kitchen. The kitchen is only a room away, and I never ask the same of her - if I want something, I always get it myself - but if she feels like having a snack or a glass of water, the duty falls on my shoulders. I know it’s so petty, but when combined with everything else, I just always feel like she’s completely unwilling to lift a single finger and views me as a free butler.\n\nI’ve confronted her about my feelings over this matter several times in the past, and she has a typical answer: she works 40 hours a week, more work and harder work than my own job (so she puts it), and it always leaves her tired and stressed, so she shouldn’t be expected to do so many extra things. It’s true that I don’t work quite as often - at my retail job I usually work closer to 20-30 hours per week - but she works a steady 9-to-5 office job, Monday through Friday, leaving her with plenty of spare time to do her part, whereas I’m often working late nights or early mornings on any possible day of the week, and it always leaves me exhausted. It’s gotten even more aggravating in the past month, because I’ve gotten a second job for the holiday season that has resulted in my actually working closer to 40-50 hours a week, but she still hasn’t picked up any slack.\n\nBut, really, regardless of how hard we may or may not work, the fact is that it’s not actually too difficult to take out the trash, or wash dishes, or put your dirty clothes in the laundry hamper. It doesn’t *tire* me to do them, and I accept them as just the natural duty of anyone who lives in a home. It doesn’t bother me that I have to exert the energy. What bothers me isn’t the labor, it’s feeling like I’m being treated as an unequal partner in this relationship, who’s saddled with all the extra chores because I have less value. Sometimes, she will add the extra excuse that she is burdened by her anxiety, depression, and ADHD- which hurts, because I have all those conditions too, but I still find the energy to do what needs to be done. It feels like yet another way of saying that my feelings matter less even if they’re the same feelings as her own.\n\nThis problem has ended up starting fights more and more over the past few months. She’s now sometimes apologetic toward me when she asks me to do something, but hasn’t actually started doing more work herself. She grew up in an abusive home, and sometimes I see her shrink away or go silent when she sees I’m upset- it always makes me feel like a total jackass. Am I wrong for expecting more from her? Is her tougher work life enough for me to be reasonably expected to pick up all of the housework?",

I was already 21 at the time and moved out with my boyfriend so financially, his medical bills didn’t affect my living situation.\n\nMy mom and his old work friends helped put together two different benefits after his passing to help further continue to cover costs. I didn’t have too much to do with planning with those. I was just asked to show up and talk to people, give raffle tickets, show people my dads collection of cool stuff, whatever. I want to stress I didn’t have much involvement with the benefits. My fundraiser page didn’t get to what the bill total was, so I didn’t think much of the two benefits. Apparently there was also a donation basket at my dads funeral, I’m not sure if it was by request from people attending so they could keep helping or if it was my moms idea. \n\nThe hospital ended up covering a lot of the medical bills after insurance ran it through and my mom took it there to be looked at. The rest was covered by any money that was given for the cause. I don’t know how much was left after medical bills were paid, but I know they were completely paid and then some, since my mom made a donation to the hospice care place. \n\nI never asked about a will or any money before, and I don’t know if it would be bad if I did now. I ended up some medical debt recently. I had to have a root canal and a major cleaning on my teeth because my parents were never able to take me as a kid because of either no insurance, or it was just neglected. I also have a few hundred in psychiatry bills because I recently got officially diagnosed with five different mental illnesses, also something that we weren’t able to do when I was younger. Not only do I have the office bills, I now take medication. My insurance does not cover it all. \n\nThe debt is really scary, and I know it’s my *own* debt, but a lot of this I’m having to handle by myself as an adult because of the neglect I had for these issues as a kid. I don’t want anyone to think that I believe I’m entitled financial help or cash by my mom, I don’t want anyone to think I’m looking for validation. I’m just in a tough spot and want to know if I WBTA if I asked about a will or if there’s any way I could get help with my bills but I don’t want my mom to think I’m just trying to get some of the fundraiser money. \n\nTL;DR my dad passed away and many different fundraisers were given to my mom for medical bills even though the hospital covered quite a bit of it. I’ve since required medical debt dealing with issues that have gotten worse since my parents didn’t/couldn’t get these issues checked up when I was younger. WIBTA to ask for a will or any help *now*?",

My dad is retired and through his desicion (with the obvious push from me and my brother), he got two dogs who are both around 1-2yrs old. \n\nRecently, my younger brother has started a fulltime apprenticeship which takes up 40hrs of his week- as well as this he wants to go to the gym 4-5 times a week and quite a large amount of college work needs to be completed also.\n\nMy brother used to walk the dogs everyday but now a lot more of his time has been taken up and he can't do it. My dad has said he doesn't have time to walk them himself even though he spends max 4-5 hrs a day writing books/ cutting hair.\n\nMy younger brother suffers slightly with anxiety and I thought this was incredibly unfair of my dad to put the strain on him. We've both spoke to him seriously about the matter and try to agree on them taking turns but he still says he doesn't have time to walk them when he blatenly does and is down to laziness. I resulted in saying that I'm not going to visit again (which is normally every weekend or so) until I feel as though there isn't so much weight on my brothers shoulders to do something which should be shared(walking dogs). \n\nHave I dealt with this the best way? I love the dogs a lot and think it's very inconsiderate of my dad to not only put the strain on my 18yr old brother but having the dogs stay in all day(dog owners you know the feels). \n\n",

      "description": "(I’m on mobile, so I’m not sure how the formatting will be.)\n\nMy husband (28m) and I (27F) been married for three years and lived together for a few years prior to being married. We’ve always handled our finances the same way and he had never expressed any issues with our way of doing things prior to recently. \n\nOur finances are kept completely separate other than when we pay bills, which we split equally. Every month I add up what we owe for mortgage, electricity, gas, internet, etc., and divide it in half, then tell him how much his half is. He sends me his portion and I pay the bills. I prefer being in charge of this because I have anxiety and will worry constantly about whether or not he paid something on time, and I am also the more organized of the two of us. He’s never complained about this and I’ve even asked him if he minds me talking charge of the bills and he said he doesn’t. He’s happy to just send me the money and forget about it. He says he is still happy with this arrangement, as am I. \n\nOther than the bills, all of our finances are completely separate. We have separate bank accounts, we both work and both make close to the same amount, but recently I’ve begun making more than him. We could both support ourselves if we lived alone, with some left over. We aren’t rich, but it’s not like either of us is living paycheck to paycheck either. In the past, the only purchases we had to check with each other on were things that affected the other person, such as a new pet, new furniture for the main area of the house, etc., because that’s common courtesy. \n\nRecently he’s been wanting us to have a joint bank account where we put all our savings, and to talk with each other before making expensive purchases. When I ask him why he says he wants us to be better at saving money, and he wants to feel like we’re building a life together. He never used to care about what I spend my money on, but recently he’s begun getting annoyed when I make expensive purchases. We own our house and are not planning on having children so it’s not like there’s a joint expense we both want to save up for. \n\nI really don’t want to change the way we handle money. I’m better at saving than he is. He pretty much just blows his money on whatever after the bills are paid, and I put a good amount into my savings account each time I get paid. He doesn’t have any savings, I do. I don’t care what he spends his money on as long as the bills get paid, which they do, and I’m feeling annoyed that he doesn’t extend me the same courtesy anymore. It bothers me that he’s begun complaining about my expenses, even though they don’t negatively impact him at all, and I’m not comfortable with the idea of having a joint bank account since we have very different ways of handling our money. I’m happy with the way things are. He isn’t. AITA?",

      "description": "Couldn't find a better way to phrase it.\n\nI'm actually having this issue with two of my friends, but the one that bothers me more is the one with my best friend, so I'll go with that.\n\nI'll start by acknowledging my blame: I find it hard to say \"No\" when people ask for my help and I get upset when they don't show me the gratitude I think I deserve for helping them.\n\nMy best friend and I have a great friendship, we used to hang out a lot, either just the two of us, or in a group of friends, or just me, him and his girlfriend. We used to see each other at least every two weeks, but we have the kind of friendship where we could not see each other for months and still be best friends when we meet. \n\nA month and a half ago, he was in the middle of his exams, while I had finished mine (we go to the same university), so, naturally, I wanted to relax for a few days, use my days off from work to get some rest and visit my family. However, he asked me to help him study for his remaining exams and, reluctantly, I said I'd help him. I know I should have refused if I really didn't want to, but I couldn't bring myself to tell him no, so I spent my free time studying together with him for his exams. This went on for three days, admittedly not a long period of time, and he knew I had put aside my plans in order to help him.\n\nAaand that's the last time I've seen my friend. Ever since, I've initiated conversations with him, hoping that we'd hang out, but he was always dismissive or not answering my texts. In this time, he went out only with his girlfriend and her friends, never with our group of friends. Now, don't get me wrong, he has always spent more time with his girlfriend than us and that never bothered me, I would never intrude on his relationship. Plus, me and his girlfriend get on really well, so I'm not being petty.\n\nRecently, he has been trying to reconnect and this time I didn't feel like hanging out with him anymore because I still feel that I was discarded when no longer needed, so I was dismissive when texting him. He just sent me a message asking me if I'm upset with him and I thought I should ask your opinions before answering.\n\nP.S. I know I said I'd only talk about the situation with my best friend, but now I think I should mention my other friend for a better understanding of my almost pathological inability to say no. The other friend is my roommate, he is one year younger than me and goes to the same university as I, and he always asks me for help on exams and homework. He always showed gratitude for that, so that's not the issue. My problem is that, during the summer vacation, three months long, he always came up with an excuse to not hang out. I brought it up to him last night and he seemed to realize I was right, but was dismissive of the conversation and just kept saying I wasn't right, thinking I was joking even though I insisted I was serious. This just made me more upset.\n\nSorry for the long text, thanks for reading!",

      "description": "so first and foremost so i get the most accurate answer, i’m still in love with her. just having her text me lights my day up wether it’s bad or good just any interaction with her. about 2 weeks ago she messaged me and i had told her about a date i went on. things got carried away and she started saying things that someone in a relationship shouldn’t say. in the end she ended up sending nudes, saying things that made me think she loves me, and we never did anything in person, but we hung out after that. she started dating this dude right after we broke up, and we broke up bc she slept with my best friend. she tweeted today how he calls her some fucking stupid ass shit and how it melts her heart, but was just saying the other day how she wants to marry me and all this bullshit. would i be the asshole if i told him? i know she’s not going to, and i don’t want this to be some petty shit but i already know it seems as if bc i got triggered by a tweet. idk i wanna be a good guy, but i also realize i’m the bad guy here, and i don’t really see any good of this whole situation. \n\ni don’t say anything. she continues the relationship as if nothing happens and i gotta be sad as fuck and dwell\nor\ni say something and even if they break up or not, she’s gonna hate me and not want to talk to me. \n\nidk i’m confused as fuck and i’m so in love with this dumb bitch it hurts ",

      "title": "AITA For Canceling Weekly Plans",
      "description": "This post may have a bit of backstory Ill leave a TL:DR. \n\nMy boyfriend(22M) well call J and I(21F) had weekly dungeons and dragons plans with 3 other people S(23f), P(21M), and M(19M).  They had been at M's house as hes the DM (Dungeon Master aka person who runs the game for the uninitiated). \n\nOur problem lies with S and P being late constantly or canceling. They are a couple and one of them always has a reason for being late. My boyfriend and I work difficult, early morning, shifts. Mine starts at 4am and his 6am. Dnd should start at 5pm Because of their lateness we either have to end it early or my boyfriend and I go to work very tired. \n\nThey were made well aware of our schedule when they proposed d&amp;d to us and they agreed to accept it. S has no job but is in school, we changed the day of d&amp;d to fit her new schedule in an attempt to limit cancellations. \n\nNothing helped, she continued to plan things for the new d&amp;d day and expect us and the dm to move our schedules and accommodate. \n\nOne day it was going out to dinner with the parents she lives with, at 5pm and only telling us as we were pulling up to the Dms house. She didnt start heading over to his house untill 8:30 at which time we already had to leave because we only stick around till 10 or so at the latest and full sessions take longer than 2 hours. Other times her boyfriend was at the gym or she was doing ***extra*** credit for school.\n\n One time they left half way through to say goodbye to a friend that was graduating. We thought \"no big deal its right down the street itll take 5 minutes\" WRONG! They sat through an entire college graduation and hung out with their friend. They returned 3 hours later and we barely got anything done.\n\nWhen she is there, shes too busy talking on her phone, texting, being on facebook, taking selfies. She hardly roleplays and doesnt seem to get anything thats going on.\n\nWe tried talking to her personally about her time wasting and we tried talking to the DM and her boyfriend but they look at us like were assholes for suggesting maybe shes not really that into d&amp;d.\n\nAfter literally like 4 months of this my boyfriend and I had enough and I texted all of them. I told each person that I didnt think D&amp;D was working and we didnt want to continue I tried to remain as polite as possible stating my reasons. I told them it was no longer fun, it was becoming stressful and wearing on our sleep, we were tired of the constant cancellations ect. I made sure to relay that in no way did I mean anything mean by this and that we really wish to remain friends with them. Apparently that was a huge mistake.\n\nS went apeshit on me. She sent me a 5 paragraph essay on how hurt she was and how I was being such a bitch for \"rage quitting\" she called me a colossal hypocrite and said I canceled d&amp;d almost as much.\n\n Spoiler alert, I have never called it off ever. I have told her when it would be impossible for us to fit into her new schedule when she switches things around. I have told her when her actions will mean no d&amp;d but I have never cancled because of my own life, neither has my boyfriend who showed up even though he had a massively painful double ear infection. She then tried to claim I was ay fault for almost, but not actually, canceling D&amp;D because my 10 year old cat was deathly ill and I needed the first available appointment, which ended up being the next day and not even on D&amp;D day.\n\nShe said I must be on my phone as much as her because I used her charger once to chsrge my phone, I arrived with my phone on 10% and needed it to not die. Yes I do use my phone occasionally but the difference is, I am paying attention to the game.  She doesnt even know its her turn till you scream at her and she plays two characters.\n\nShe made it clear her first intention was to not even respond at all to my text, very mature, but that she had too many issues with me. \n\nAll in all it looks like we lost the DM, S and P as friends forever as they made sure to point out that their \"trust is broken\" and they \"are very dissappinted in me\"\n\nHonestly it feels like a relief to be done with it all but at the same time I cant help wondering if I was right so I leave myself at your mercy. \n\nTL:DR My \"friends\" were habitually late and had no real regard for my bf and I's schedule. We brought up our concerns and stated wed rather be friends than continue arguing about D&amp;D so we were pulling out of it. They intern ended our friendship and are \"very dissapointed\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Just to add context and cull any possible confusion, everybody in this story is a male university student, names are all made up. Sorry its so long.\n\nMy boyfriend, 'James', and his best friend, 'Phil', are both very outdoorsy naturists. I'm neither. Since before we met, they've been cycling somewhere remote in Dartmoor and camping, walking over a weekend, usually spending any time near the tent or near a body of water nude.\n\nIt’s widely known they do this together, and there’s a photo album that gets dragged out whenever people ask about it. Obviously those two don’t care, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t bother me so many people have seen my boyfriend naked. They’re both pretty hot guys and I feel like some people asking just want to see them for dirty reasons rather than actual curiosity. Its always straight women and gay guys asking.\n\nPhil is straight. I’m not worried Phil is trying to fuck my boyfriend. Obviously, that doesn't go for James though, and Phil is an attractive guy. James insists that he doesn't look at Phil that way, but I’ve always found that hard to believe.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I asked James if he would ever think about stopping going on the camping trips, or at least stop doing them naked, and explained why it made me uncomfortable. He told me I could come if I wanted to, which I turned down because as I said I’m not outdoorsy or a naturist. He told me that when I knew about the hobby when we got together, and it wasn’t negotiable. We talked for a little longer and decided to break up because I couldn’t get over it and he wasn’t willing to give it up, agreed to keep the reason why mostly between us except for close friends.\n\nJames understandably told Phil, but Phil told other people. James was upset with Phil for spreading it, apologised to me and had an argument with Phil, and now they’re not talking to each other. Now basically everybody except James is blaming me for the two best friends falling out. Phil and I had a huge argument, several mutual friends have made snippy comments.\n\nThe conclusion seems to have been reached that I’m somehow an asshole for ultimately not liking the concept of my boyfriend spending weekends with another guy naked, and for bringing it up ruining their friendship by no real fault of my own. Am I going insane or is this not my fault?\n\n**TLDR; my boyfriend and his best friend are known for going camping nude together. My boyfriend is gay, his friend is straight. I asked my boyfriend if they’d stop, he said no, and we broke up. The friend spread why we broke up, the two of them argued over it, and now they’ve fallen out. People are blaming me for the rift between them and I think its bullshit.**",

      "description": "I’m due anytime in the next month with my second daughter, my husbands first. My husbands mother is basically off her rocker. She was hospitalized for about 6 days a few months ago after she had what she called a seizure. Doctors did test after test &amp; couldn’t find one thing wrong with her and ended up referring her to a psychiatrist. I think she went maybe once or twice. We went to visit her a week or two after she left the hospital &amp; she was overly dramatic. Crying, rubbing my stomach, saying she would get better to watch the baby. Just over the top. \n\nFast forward, she’s out of work for about 10 weeks and is completely fine being home &amp; not working. The week she goes back to work she has another ‘seizure’ at her job.

Seemed like even he feels like she’s exaggerating things. \n\nIt’s been about two months since that &amp; she’s convinced she’s perfectly fine &amp; keeps insisting she’s watching our baby.

      "description": "Earlier in 2018, I went to my doctor - who once questioned my morals and why I wanted tattoos during a physical - for some help with a breathing issue.\n\nI was asked for any history of lung/airway issues. I told her that when I was 5 I had Restrictive Airway Disease (RAD), which was treated and had since disappeared with no trace and no issues. In fact, I hardly even remember having it; it kinda feels like a dream. I told her all of this, and she then proceeded to insist that it was asthma, and that I still have it. She didn't even look at my records or run any tests. I told her that I haven't had any issues or test results that would ever indicate that I did have asthma, and any suspicions were cleared when I got over RAD as a kid. I haven't touched an inhaler in 15 years at this point.\n\nShe pursued this and prescribed me an inhaler. I thought that the doctor would know best, and she might have noticed something that I haven't, but I was otherwise sure she was mistaken. I decided to try the inhaler as instructed, since I could disprove her if it didn't work, but potentially be helped if she happened to be right.\n\nSurprise, surprise! It didn't do anything. I come back two weeks later for my scheduled follow-up, telling her it didn't work. She then literally pulled up a Bing search of hyperventilation, and started *reading from the screen* about it, and proceeded to tell me to breathe into a bag. Gee, thanks. That didn't help either (big shock), and I decided it would be best to try and sort it out on my own.\n\nMonths later, I get a bill in the mail from my PCP. When I asked about it, they said it was because I got a consult without insurance coverage. The problem is: not only did she *not* help me whatsoever, but I was NEVER NOTIFIED THAT I HAD NO COVERAGE, and my insurance was through them, specifically. I would have never gone in if I knew about my insurance, and I would have gotten it sorted out immediately. Needless to say, I still got my insurance fixed as soon as I could.\n\nI've tried bringing this up to their main offices, and all they said was that they're \"nonprofit, so it won't go to collections; they'll just keep sending it\". Now, I'm living in a different state and haven't seen a bill from them for a few months...until now. I've gotten two this week.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Do I need to pay them, or should I call them and fight this?",

      "description": "My fiancé’s ex was found brain dead from a heroin overdose this past week. She’s been very sad, and I really do feel for her and his family, but at the same time I find myself some what emotionally distant from her. Not that I feel insecure that she had feelings for him, but that ultimately I hated this guy and can’t match her feelings. \n\nI never knew him personally. The first time I ever heard about him was early on in our relationship when my fiancé showed me messages he had sent her of him and his friend talking shit about me and trying to get her to hangout with them. I brushed it off as a jealous ex. Why wouldn’t he feel anything but dislike for me?  The feeling was mutual.\n\nI fell quickly for my fiancé and in the first year took her on a trip she had been wanting to go on for her birthday. In the middle of conversation at dinner, he calls and she answers. I felt extremely disrespected and we had a discussion about him. She told me all about how there were no feelings for him, that he used to hit her and pull her hair and threaten to come to her school and beat her up. I took her word and moved passed it, but not without new disdain for him. As time went by in our relationship, more details about him would come up here and there, none of them flattering.\n\nThen came the news of his OD. I’ve been trying to be as supportive as possible of my fiancé, but I also feel torn and guilty. Deep down, I felt like if it had to happen to someone, who better than the druggie who put hands on my fiancé. I’m not angry at her for feeling sad, but I do feel slightly confused and slightly distant. \n\nI never heard a single positive word from her or her family about him until his passing. She’s been telling me and her friends about how he was a good guy. I do understand he must have had some great pain in his life, as I don’t believe well adjusted people just casually get in to heroin, but I also feel a lack of sympathy and empathy from the way he’s been framed for me all these years. \n\nLast night she was telling me again about how good of a guy he was and randomly mentioned how he never tried to get between us. I had finally had enough, not in an angry way, but I calmly reminded her of how that wasn’t true and that this was the man who hit her and threatened her. She told me that wasn’t true and that he had only ever pulled her hair and started explaining that by saying she had made him angry. Lies of him hitting her aside, I still said that’s no excuse for him putting his hands on you. I told her I didn’t care for him and it made her even more upset. \n\nAITA for being distant and not feeling anything from his passing?",

I offered my friend to pay the gas (I always do) he refused, as always. When we finished up the doctor said I wouldn't need stitches but should get a shot so all was fine.\n\nI gave the idea of getting something to eat since I haven't had dinner, we go to a 24hour place since it was midnight. PA didn't want to eat, but the BF and Roommate did and I offered to pay, they accepted, but then said they'd pay me back. We sit to eat and  Roommate informs BF that the total was 35 bucks and they should pay me later. \n\nCut to a few weeks later we go out again and BF reminds me he has to pay me, which I reply I'll remind you when my credit card bill comes, he agrees. When my bill came I tell him I wouldn't be able to meet him so I'd just send him a bill with the amount him and his roommate had to pay, since my card app let's me do this. \n\nHe proceeds to call me ridiculous and that he took time out of his schedule to take me to the hospital which I should be thankful especially since I was being dramatic over a small cut (note when I called my friend's nurse mom I had just wanted to rub some salt or alcohol on it ) and that he didn't \"owe me shit\". I was pissed.\n\nI replied \" First I never called you, I called PA, I apologise for the miscommunication as since we weren't friends I didn't think you'd expect me to buy you dinner and that I was stupid to actually believe you'd pay me back after you had said so\". \nI don't have contact with the roommate, but luckily I wasn't hurting for cash so it didn't matter. I just felt his reply was exaggerated and he dates my best friend and he acts like haging out with our friend group is a chore.\n\nUnderstand this isn't about the cash, his reply really pissed me off. And for a while now I feel he's been taking advantage of PA (PA isn't rich but he's certainly has a better situation than most) and I learned recently that I wasn't the only one in our friend group thinking this.\n\nSo Reddit...am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Some background knowledge: I'm 21 years old, living in an attached apartment to my parents house. I pay my own bills, pay them rent, and occasionally lend money to them, run errands for them, and cook dinner for them as favors. My mom works part time, four hours a day, and I work full time, though I work in retail so I will sometimes have a weekday off rather than be off the weekend. Today was one of those days. The sisters in question are 8 and 15.\n\nToday my mom came home from work, and asked if I had made any food for her (often when I'm off on a weekday I spend it practicing recipes, and will save her the leftovers since she doesn't get a lunch at work.) Today I hadn't done any cooking, so I told her I didn't have any food for her. She then said, \"You should pick up both your sisters from school.\" I said, \"why?\" Her reply was, \"Because I don't feel like it and you didn't do anything all day.\"\n\nI felt like she was being a bit...bratty for lack of a better word, so I said no. She then got mad and said, \"So you won't do it?\" I replied with, \"Well what if I pick one of them up for you?\" She said that that wouldn't help out at all, of she was going to be out to get one kid she may as well just get the other too. I replied, \"Okay, so when you asked if I could get them, you weren't really asking then.\" She then went on a rant about how she had to grocery shop, pick my sisters up, cook dinner, and take a shower and she was just hinting at needing help. She stormed out to run her errands.\n\nI felt guilty after she left. I felt like I should have just ignored the attitude and agreed. So I texted her and offered to make dinner, so that she could still cross something off her list. She texted back to just forget about it. Just in case, I made enough dinner for my parents and sisters to eat. Instead she sent one of my sisters to borrow eggs from me, because she was cooking and wouldn't come in to face me. I gladly gave them the eggs, but it's been like 12 hours and my mom still won't talk to me.\n\n\nI'm stuck here. Had my mom flat out said that she had a lot of things to do, I of course would have offered to help. Because of how she asked me, simply saying she didn't want to, I thought I had an option to say no. My guilty little heart says to take the L and apologize, but my sister said my mom completely overreacted, didn't explain herself well, and that she owes ME an apology. Who's the asshole????\n",

      "description": "This happened a while ago.  I frequently jog around a park in which there is a large cement/stone drinking fountain that runs constantly (i.e., no button to press to make the water come out).  As I was running by one day, a lady was letting her large dog stand up on its hind legs and lap water from the fountain.  As I ran by, I yelled \"that is disgusting!  Now I will never be able to drink from that fountain again.  Thanks!\"  Dogs lick their butts/genitalia and those of other dogs.  I don't care whether or not it is true if dogs have \"sterile\" mouths, I don't want \"sterile\" fecal matter or other matter originating from animal genitalia/body fluids on any drinking fountain I am going to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should note that there was a spout at the bottom of the fountain that she could have turned on to let her dog drink from.  Also, although I haven't had a dog since leaving my parents home many years ago, I don't have anything against dogs and enjoy playing/interacting with them.  I just don't enjoy them enough to take on the added responsibility and work required to properly take care of one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo tell me, was I the ass?",

      "description": "A little backstory: my SD(sugar daddy) and I have been on and off for about three years. He knows I’m not interested in a emotional relationship.\n\nWe had just started an arrangement again, but this time he wanted to do weekly payments. I was ok with that as I have my own business and had been doing fine. Then the shit show started. \n\nI had a major client of my mine pull out of a deal, two flat tires, and a abnormally large electric bill. When we met, I told him and asked if we could just do the whole amount now as I really needed it. He made me pull up my bank account and show him I wasn’t lying. Basically after begging for his help(I’ve never done that before) he agreed to give me a weeks payment early.\n\nThe next week I’m at his house when I get a call from my brothers ex-wife’s dad. He told me they found my brother dead this morning. I fell to the floor crying. My SD kinda rubbed my back and told me we had to leave since he was going to work and put me in a Uber. \n\nI understand people don’t know how to act around death. So I wasn’t mad at his lack of emotion. Five days pass and I still haven’t heard from him. When our date night rolls around he finally texts and asks me to dinner so I go. \n\nWhen we show up he acts like nothing happens and asks why I am in a shit mood. I complain about how stressed I am, how I don’t have the money to fly back home, and how my dad wasn’t going to be at the funeral because he couldn’t afford the trip. \n\nHe starts complaining about how when his cousin died a couple years ago he didn’t get to do anything for his funeral because he felt like his family was using him for money and he has no interest in helping me. \n\nNow that left a sour taste in my mouth. We had gotten into fights in the past about stupid shit like shoes, but this was the first time in three years that I actually needed him. I ended up just going home, but per our agreement I did owe him another sleepover. \n\nI ended up pulling together what I needed to go to his funeral(my dad did not) and when I got back home I decided to do the final sleepover so he couldn’t say I scammed him. \n\nObviously I was not excited to see him. We got into a fight because I didn’t want to sleep in his bed (I was planning on sleeping on the couch) he said he had talked to his dad(his dad hates me) and his dad told him not to help me so he didn’t. He also said he wouldn’t have bought my dad a ticket because no grown man would accept help from his daughter. The fight ends with him telling me to sleep in the bed or leave, so I left. \n\nNow he’s blowing up my phone, calling me a sociopath and saying that I scammed him and I owe him. I told him that I tried to do what we agreed( yeah, world play “sleepover” but still) and if he couldn’t see where he was wrong I want nothing to do with him. \n\nAITA for expecting help even though I didn’t want a full relationship?

      "description": "Hello AITA, I am a 21 year old guy, using a throwaway (since this is a medical condition and talking about a confrontation I had this weekend with a guy who I thought was a good friend of mine. \n\nWhen I was 16 I was diagnosed with a condition called Ankylosing spondylitis which literally has the effect of the bones in my hips and spine fusing together over time. I have good days and I have bad days but I try to live life as best I can. The prognosis is not good and I'm almost certainly looking at joint replacements as a best case scenario, but even with that my spine will fuse and I will lose the ability to walk and probably die of heart failure very young. \n\nNow that that's out of the way, on Saturday night I went out with a friend of mine to a really chill bar. He ended up chatting up this very, very cute girl who just so happened to be there with a group of guys. She came over to our table and she noticed that I sort of winced when I moved because I was having a pretty bad flare up so she asked me if I was feeling ok. She was super cool, was in a masters of nursing program so she actually knew about my condition and we hit it off. I'm not really a \"hook up type\" dude but I ended up going back to her apartment. It was awesome and I have plans to see her tomorrow night. \n\nMy friend is furious with me. He says the girl was \"his\" because he made \"first contact\" with her and I should have known to keep my mouth shut. He also went much further saying I always talking about my \"stupid fucking disease.\" I tried to tell him that I didn't bring it up and she actually asked and because she was a nursing student it was a natural conversation. He told me I was a fucking prick who did it on purpose to screw him over. I told him at least he doesn't have to deal with the disease. He screamed at me this is exactly what he was talking about and hung up on me.  \n\nI don't know how to feel about what he said. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Welp here we bloody go. my first post literally EVER\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. a little backstory.  I went to the same elementary school for most of my childhood.  All the way from K-7  (In my country... elementary is grades from Kindergarten... to grade 8. high school is grade 9-12. no middle school bs.) \n\nThis school was like a home by the time I left... although from grades 4-6 I endured relentless bullying from both students and staff.... it felt like home because of the few friends I did have.  When I first started this school... I lived across the street with my mom in an apartment. by the end? After a clusterfuck of court battles between my father and mother... I ended up moving in with my father in like grade 3. all the way on the other side of the city.  my mom still wouldn't give up... and the court battles would continue for a number of foreseeable years. all this is stories for another time. now... after the move... my father was still working... and his works HQ was on the way to my school... so it worked out. he was making good money too. however.... he retired when I was in grade 6... and all of a sudden... we were on a fixed income. it was by no means impossible... but it was more difficult for my father to make the drive to my school and back... and he presented me with a dilemma that I would ask myself for the entirety of that following summer...  would I change schools  to help us in the long run... or would I like to graduate with my friends at this school? if I wanted to stay... he would let me... but for high school I would have to go to a school on our side of the city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow... I took a good long while to come up with my answer.... but it was obvious. I wanted to graduate there. I made it known... and after going with my choice for a couple days... he decided against my decision. when he made this known.... I BROKE DOWN. HARD. and... the following day at school.... it was the only day in my life I dreaded going home... I didn't want the day to end.  that day ended with hugs from my friends... tears from everyone... and the dreadful sound of that last bell ringing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know realize it was the best choice for my father to make.... for both of us. despite the hurt it caused. but occasionally... I still think about it... and I am still a little salty... despite my realization it was necessary. Am I In The Wrong Here? I Await your judgement.",

      "description": "A guy hit me up on Instagram and apparently took a liking to me. Basically it was just us complimenting each other back and forth. Both of us also have an interest in art, so we chatted over that. In the midst of our conversation, I told him this:\n\nMe: I'm gonna help my mum with some stuff. BRB.\n\nGuy: Oh okay, come back soon though.\n\n(Few minutes later)\n\nMe: I'm back.\n\nGuy: Wow, that was quick. \n\nMe: Yeah, was just bringing things into the car.\n\nGuy: You know, I was kinda sad that you had to go offline to help you mom.\n\nMe: What, why?\n\nGuy: Why you think?\n\nMe: I'm not quite sure.\n\nGuy: OMG nevermind 🙄\n\nAt that point, I was kind of weirded out. But continued chatting with him as he seemed interesting.\n\nFurther into our chat, he starts telling me how I'm cute and how he's never liked an Asian girl before (I'm Malaysian, he's American). \n\nAt one point, he wanted to call me baby girl. I felt that it was a little too fast for him to call me that yet, so I just told him that I rather him call me by my name rather than that. All of a sudden he starts getting mopey and dramatic, pretty much beating himself up for messing up a chance with me (which he pretty much did).\n\nThen I don't know why, I decided to give him a \"life lesson\" on the differences of culture, like what's socially normal to him may not be socially normal to me (considering we're both from very different parts of the world). Then he promised himself that he wouldn't do that again as long as I still like him (I never said I did. We were just flirting back and forth). \n\nI then decided that I he wasn't really interesting anymore because he seemed really weird and insecure to me and blocked him on Instagram. But kind of feel bad because he made a promise. So am I the asshole?\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for eating meat as a vegan?",
      "description": "Active lurker, inactive poster.So this happened a couple hours ago. \n\nYesterday, a friend of mine gave me a free meal to show her appreciation for something I did. \nI didn't know that she ordered for me, she just gave me the food and said it was to show her thanks. It was meat, she didn't know that I'm a vegan. \n\nI just became a vegan more or less 2 weeks ago, so not a lot of people know. I don't feel the need to tell everybody that I'm a vegan either. \n\nI told her that I'm a vegan in a casual manner, and she apologized. I told her that I wanted to make this an exemption since it was special. So I ate it anyway. \n\nNow earlier today, a close vegan friend of mine (let's call her Sarah), confronted me and told me \"you ate meat...?\" she didn't sound angry, rather disappointed. For starters, I asked her how she knew, and she told me that a mutual friend of ours that knows I'm vegan asked her if I was still vegan, she told me that our mutual friend saw me eating meat at the cafeteria yesterday. I explained to her that I didn't order it specifically, but it was given to me as a treat. She told me that I should have just gave it to somebody else. But for me, doing that seem really, really rude, and I found the gesture special. \n\nSarah's the one that influenced me to become vegan, we both really love animals. She's not the type that would scream at your face and yell \"Murderer!!!\". She generally doesn't care about meat eaters eating meat. Recently, I feel like eating meat again. I feel like veganism isn't for me, I can't take just eating vegetables (not a fan). The reason that I became vegan is because eating a living being as conscious as cows and pigs seem appalling. But now, I just feel like it's natural. Additionally, I can't deny that meat tastes good af to me. We both became a vegan practically at the same time. We've both never ate meat ever since we became vegan, prior to yesterday for me. \n\nWe didn't talk about it again, but she's still visibly upset the last time we talked. I'm wondering if I should apologize. So, AITA? \n\n \n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA if I told my GF I'm pro choice?",
      "description": "So we kinda got into an argument the other day about the whole pro life and pro choice. She told me that I'm the asshole because I'm trying to dictate who gets to live and who gets to die. Saying that I'm a horrible person because I want people to kill babies. She even knows about my life and where I come from as a foster child that was never adopted from birth to the day I became eighteen. \n\nI've been homeless and lived in the streets for months before because the foster system was so broken. I would be shipped from houses to houses only to get hit and abused by foster parents. In hindsight I could've easily told on them, but when they're threatening your life you don't really think about it. Anywho, in my point of view I tried explaining that going through life, especially at the teenage years (I'm 28 now) , I was not able to find any stability and heck, multiple times I thought about alternative solutions.\n\nI explained that if a parent was unfit to raise a child I would much rather not let that child grow up in a toxic environment. My view was molded by my real life experience and I wouldn't wish a child a life like my own, growing up knowing that they're unwanted by anyone. I told her that if a child isn't adopted, they're thrown into the foster system. Call me insensitive or whatever you want but I just want every child growing up in a loving environment. \n\nI told her, \"I respect your decision and agree with you that I do not have the rights to decided on who gets to live and who gets to die. You are right that nobody has that right to take away life from anyone, however, I also have a strong view in upraising our future generations of leaders and want them to grow up in an environment to thrive and become successful in. I'll draw it here and say that I'll agree to disagree.\" I didn't want to fight anymore with her on this topic, but then she starts flailing other topics at me saying, \"You're just defending the girls that goes out and sleeps with multiple men. You're enabling their lifestyle and it makes me sick. You're the worst kind of people out there. You're making the excuse of raising children to cover up for those types of girls.\" \n\nHowever much I tried to defend myself from what she was trying to pin against me she would talk over me and not let me explain my point. At this point my temper wasn't at it's greatest either and so I calmly but shakily said, \"That's fine if you think I'm that kind of person.\" I left the apartment and have been ghosting her for about a week now. I didn't think this fight would last this long. I'm crashing at a friends place in the meantime. \n\nSo, AITA for trying to explain to my GF why I'm pro choice? Am I just conceited or just oblivious to my some kind of thing that I'm missing? I'm not trying to paint myself as some angel and her as some demon, I have my hard views on things as well, but I just want to know if I'm approaching this at a wrong way. Am I not respecting her views or something?",

      "description": "I have small children and my husband and I both work. His hours prevent him from getting the kids on the bus in the morning or being home when they return from school.\n\n\nI put the kids on the bus every morning and have a family member come to get them off of the bus 2 days a week. The other 3 days they went to an after school program but they hated it, especially my oldest.\n\n\n\nThis year there’s a new after school program run by a different organization and we really can’t afford it. Plus, my kids begged not to have to go again so I was able to change my work schedule which is a BFD since I work at a small business. Now I take them to a before school program 3 days per week, start work early those days and leave early to be home when the bus arrives. Bus is due at 3:48 pm. I have about 50 minutes to get home and it takes about 35 so everything is fine for a few months.\n\n\n\nKids tell me their bus was the first to load last year but this year it’s the last to load and I think nothing of it. Gradually the bus starts coming earlier and earlier until it’s dropping them off at 3:30 now. I find out their bus is loading earlier until it’s loading first despite being scheduled to load last. For the last few weeks, I’ve been rushing home and having close calls daily. My husband had some days off and was miraculously home one day when a bad accident literally happened right in front of me so I was delayed. I still got home by 3:44 but my kids had been home for about 15 minutes by then.\n\n\nI’ve tried discussing this politely with the bus driver who seemed nice until now but he just says it depends on traffic. That’s not true because I picked the kids up a few weeks ago and saw their bus first in line. The driver intentionally gets there early to be first in line because that was last year’s schedule for this route and apparently he doesn’t like change.\n\n\n \nOther parents tell me the buses aren’t allowed to come early but when I talked to the school, they just keep saying they “will look into it” yet have no answers. My whole office changed things to accommodate my new schedule and I can’t leave earlier. My kids are small enough that they’re not allowed off of the bus if no adult is waiting. \n\n\n\nAITA if I complain to the school and demand their bus load last, as scheduled? I know everyone wants to get home/done earlier but my kid’s bus is the ONLY one showing up more than 5 minutes early and coming early on a regular basis. I’ve asked friends, family, mom groups on social media, etc. ",

      "description": "\nI have been seeing this girl (we’ll call her Alison) for about 2 weeks. It’s been absolutely great the whole time. We have not gotten to the point where I have asked her to be my girlfriend, but we have spent basically every day together on dates and it’s pretty much felt like a normal relationship.\n\nToday however, was a different story. I have been on a road trip with two friends and one of them is a mutual friend with Alison. She invited us over to have dinner with her family onthe way back.\n\n\nWhen we get there, we meet the family. Except there’s no introductions from Alison so it was a bit awkward. I took the initiative to introduce myself to everyone after it was clear they were not going to introduce themselves. \nThen Alison answers a call and it’s her guy friend from school. She takes the phone into the kitchen and starts talking loudly about an event that he wants her to compete in and rep his company. This entire time, we’re all silently sitting at the dinner table listening to the conversation. \n\nAfter the call, we eat dinner. Everyone in the family eats as fast as humanly possible and just kinda sits there. Me and my friends keep asking the mom, dad, and sister questions and they respond, but the conversation dies because they don’t further it. This goes on for almost 2 hours with plenty of intermittent awkward silence.  Alison is across the table texting for a lot of the dinner. Finally, the dinner ends and we get up and start cleaning up. I realized then that no one had asked me a single question. No one had asked any of us three a single question. I could’ve been from the fucking moon and they wouldn’t have known. It was a really uncomfortable 2 hours. \n\nOutside, she tells me she thought dinner was kinda awkward. She suggested maybe it was because everyone was tired. I was definitely tired, but I asked questions and was attentive and friendly as can be. I agreed for the sake of being polite, my friend and I got in the car and drove home\n\nIn the car, my friend agreed that it was incredibly weird.\n\nWhen I got home, i texted her saying i made it home alright. She asked how the night was and I was honest with her. I told her I felt it was uncomfortable for me to be there. I also said that I felt as though I was invisible, no one cared to ask anything; It was almost as if we were a burden to them but they offered the dinner. I asked if it was something to do with our dating status.\n\nShe responded saying that she was deeply hurt that I would disrespect her family like that and that my accusations were misguided. She also said neither her nor her family thought it was awkward, which was the exact opposite of what she said earlier and that also infers that she told her family about my text. She also said he had not told her family about me at all. Which is fine because we aren’t official.\n\n\n\nAm I the asshole for telling a girl that her family wasn’t welcoming and made me feel uncomfortable? \n",

I'm not planning on having a conveyor belt of people come in and out, but I'd like to be able to have someone back occasionally. \n\nI was meant to be going out for a drink with a guy I'd been out with before, but on the way home he told me he had to stay late at work and wouldn't get to the pub until about 8, which seemed quite late to head out to me (it was a weekday and I like to go to bed at an appropriate time 😅). Instead he suggested coming to mine and bringing some wine.\n\nI checked with my roommate when I got home if it would be ok and if not then I would go out to meet him. She said sure, but if I ever want the flat to myself then let her know and she can go to her mum's for the evening. I said thanks but I didn't want to kick her out of her home.\n\nHe came over and we were at the breakfast bar having some wine and chatting, while she had a shower and then went to her room. I thought that being in the communal area would be less weird than us going to my bedroom. It wasn't my initial intention, but it got late and he ended up staying over. \n\nThe next day after he leaves my flatmate says that she's annoyed that I had him over and that she couldn't sleep and felt uncomfortable having a stranger in the house. \n\nAITA for having him over?\n\nI don't want her being uncomfortable, but also I want to be comfortable in my home too and that includes having people over. And do girls count as strangers, or are they ok? What about if it's purely platonic?\n\nI felt like shit after and she didn't come home that evening, but I feel like it wasn't that big of a deal. ",

I don't really get to see her outside of school.\n\nWell, we'll be together for 2 years on the 23rd. For the past few weeks, i asked her a couple of times if she wanted to meet up the Saturday/Friday before our anniversary, because she's busy on Sunday (our actual anniversary). She kept telling me she'd check, but she never did. \n\nLast week I asked her to check if we can meet (her parents really need to know that stuff in advance and stuff), and she said that she doesn't know if she should check because her mom's birthday is on the 25th and they might do something for that. \n\nYesterday I asked her again because my family asked me if I wanted to go somewhere together on Saturday, so I needed to know if we were meeting up. She seemed to get kind of mad at me and annoyed, and said that she already told me that she probably can't meet.\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling like she doesn't care about our anniversary as much as I do? It might seem pretty dumb, but she means the world to me and I want to know if I did something wrong.\n\ntl;dr I got hurt that my girlfriend doesn't seem to care about our anniversary as much as I do.

      "description": "Keep in mind that I am younger than most people on reddit (in my teens) so this story might not be as relatable to you\n\nSo, around 2 weeks ago on Sunday my good friend (not the one mentioned above)  told me that one of their friends went to my best friends house that Saturday for his birthday and was wondeeing why I wasn’t there. Now, I was confused because I had heard nothing about this so I asked them who went and apparently it was all of his friends apart from me.\n\nI messaged my best friend who’s birthday it was calmly on Discord because I didn’t want to be angry at him if it was just a misunderstanding, but he never replied to me, so I messaged him and my other best friend who was also at the party on snapchat so I could see if they had opened it and were just ignoring me, and sure enough that was the case. \n\nSo the next day I was in school and confronted one of the people there and was asking them questions about it and it was abundantly clear that it was a party and that they were invited over and that I wasn’t supposed to know that it was happening. \n\nOf course that was my boiling point, and I messaged them angrily saying to them that I thought they were my friends and that what they did was a horrible thing to do to me, as we have been very very close friends for about 4 years now.\n\nMy friend who had their birthday responded and told me that they didn’t ask me to go because ‘they didn’t think that I liked two people who were going (which wasnt true) and that one of the people going didn’t like me either which really shouldn’t have mattered since I am closer to my friend than they are and if they were the one with the problem with me then they should have been told that it’s their choice to go or not as I was being invited regardless.\n\nIt doesn’t stop there!\n\nThe day after I messaged them, my other best friend who didn’t respond to my second message showed all my messages to all of the people that were at the party and more, probably to make fun of me and to gain the respect of his fellow party-goers who seem to be replacing me.\n\nIn order not to make drama, i invited the two gentlemen into my fine establishment for a night over to settle our differences and to make it up to each other (settle it in SMASH) and gave them a week time-frame of when they could come over, but they both said that they would have to see what they were doing even though we are all hermits with little social life outside of school so the chance of them being busy for a whole week when we don’t even have school is almost impossible, so I am thinking that they are both just making excuses so they don’t have to go, even though I much prefer honesty to deceit.\n\nThe main reason I don’t just cut them out is because we have been so close and it’s out of character to do something like this, and because we have a school trip abroad coming up, and I don’t have anybody else to do anything with that are going on it. I also can’t get my deposit back, so I am dreading it. After the trip I will tell them it’s up to them if they want to be friends with me or not because I have always put 100% into our friendship by organising every event and always including everybody by trying to get the best dates, etc, and they put the bare minimum into it which I was content with because I didn’t really have any other friends at the time (since I skipped a year in school and left them in the year behind me I have since gained many way better friends that actually care about me)\n\nAnd so far, that is pretty much it. The only thing since then that had happened is when I asked one of them if they were available to go again to which they didn’t reply, only furthering my suspicions. \n\nI don’t like being persistent, but it’s hard not to when they don’t communicate at all.\n\nSo AITA for being angry with them over all of this? I know the rules say not to ask for advice which isn’t what i’m doing, but feel free to leave any if you think it will help\n\nThanks for reading my text block rant! I’ll update this post if anything else happens.\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for asking my Mom for the college money that she saved for me?",
      "description": "As I was growing up, my parents saved money for me to go to college. As I was looking at colleges with my Mom, she told me that if I happened to have any money left over in my college account, it would be mine. I would be able to use it to help buy a house or a car or something once I've graduated college. My mom told me this about 1-2 years ago. I distinctly remember the conversation like it was last week, as I wasn't expecting her to give me the money that was leftover. I thought it was just for college expenses.\n\nFast forward to now. I've moved out of home, and into an apartment. I'm still receiving some financial help from my mom for my car, and we're pulling from my college fund to pay half of rent during the months that I'm taking classes full-time. My college is also significantly cheaper than we had originally planned, for other reasons outside the scope of this post.\n\nMy Mom and girlfriend recently went out to dinner, and my Mom mentioned how it would be nice to use my leftover college money for my sister. My sister is planning on attending a private college, and she's going for her doctorate. Her schooling is going to be significantly more expensive compared to mine, although this is completely my sister's choice. \n\nUpon hearing this, I was frustrated because my mom had promised that money to me, and I've held that idea in the back of my head for some time. When I was talking to my mom about it, she completely went off the rails and got super mad. First, she claims that she doesn't remember having the conversation when she promised the money to me. She also said that since she's the one that saved the money she can do what she wants with it, and she's trying to do everything she can to help my sister graduate without student loans, just like she did for me. She also says that she doesn't want to waste the money by using it on non-college expenses, as it will be taxed at an absurd rate.\n\nI have been incredibly grateful that my parents saved this money for me, and they even covered my community college costs out of pocket so that there would be more money left for university. At the last minute I had to switch schools, and the school that I'm going to is significantly cheaper, plus I received a small scholarship.\n\nAITA for asking for the leftover money still? We had a pretty big fight over it last night.",

      "description": "So. I’m a dude and a photographer (hobby. Not professionally) and I think I do alright and take some good pictures. And a bunch of my friends come to me for advice on pictures (usually girls wanting advice on selfies) which I’m happy to give. It’s usually little tweaks that make everything look better. Sometimes a little editing in photoshop or Lightroom. They get a better pic. I get a little mental exercise in my favorite hobby. Win win. The only thing I ask is that if the photo is a little explicit or lewd or anything. That they ask me permission before the send it for help. Because I have anxiety and random unexpected sexy pics set it off like a match in a gasoline refinery. A vast majority of my friends respect this. But one of my female friends really doesn’t. And she just sends them with no warning or prior conversation most of the time. And asks for help or just to get my opinion. And it makes me really really uncomfortable. Especially if I’m in public. Well this came to a head the other day when she sent six lewd photos rapid fire and asked for help on all of them. And I was just sick of it. I warned her every single time she did this before and explained that it made me uncomfortable but she didn’t care or forgot. I sent her a long paragraph telling her she needs to stop this immediately and she was making me very uncomfortable and making me not want to be her friend and just block her. And she got upset and accused me of being bigoted because she was on the heavier side and I “don’t care when I get photos like this from PRETTY AND THIN girls.” Which is a lie. I get uncomfortable if I’m not asked permission first. Because if I get a warning. I can ready myself and also get my phone to a safe place if I’m in public. But I really feel like a dick now that she’s mad at me. Was I wrong to get upset at her and kinda berate her over text about it? ",

      "description": "Throwaway because someone mentioned has reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: Me and this person (M) have been (best) friends for a really long time, starting early in elementary school. Fast forward and we're in High School now. M went to school in the town we lived in and I went to a small school in the larger town nearby. I love it and would never consider leaving. M's parents wouldn't let them come to my school because of conflicts with work schedules. A few months later, in November, a wildfire hit my town (M lived in the smaller town just up the main road.) My house was destroyed and most of the town with it. M's house made it. They got an apartment in The Larger town nearby, we went to a hotel over an hour away. This made it hard and we barely talked for about two to three months. Because M was now living in the same town as my school, their parents let them go. That was great. It'd be the first time we've been at the same school since 5th grade. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now: Our school has a \"homeroom\" like thing where you're with a group of people for all four years. It's pretty nice, and M was allowed to join my homeroom. Shortly after they admitted to having a crush on someone else, also a friends but nowhere near as lose as M and I. A week later they were dating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree weeks later they broke up and barely get along and call each other names behind their back. F (M's ex) and I still remained friends, and M and I did too. I don't think that M liked that I'm still friends with F, but they never said anything. Well, last week, F planned a party for our homeroom. I'm moving (finally) to a new house, after five months, and spent a lot of last week packing and preparing stuff to move. So M and I usually have a sleepover at their's or my house about every other weekend. I said to M, \"I'll be busy all week, I might go to F's party, but I still can't do anything else.\" Now sleepovers with M usually go from early the day someone comes over to late the day they leave. I needed to be home because my Dad works and my Mom has a bad injury which impairs her walking ability, so I need to be home to help, especially because we're moving. \n\nThe week goes by, I pack and do stuff, the day of the party comes, I go, it was fun, and I go home (got back around 11-11:20,) and the next day continue packing stuff.\n\nM really didn't like that I went to F's party because I said that I would be busy all week, and I think the state of M's relationship with F might have something to do with M's reaction. M sent me several long texts explaining how they felt that I lied to them and how I made them upset. M had some reasons that I would say are good and make me feel like TA, but they're very personal and I don't want to share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for saying I was busy all weekend?",

She saw some tapes in one car, and decided she'd steal them for me, because I had a tape deck in my car and she thought it would be romantic. When she got into the car, she realized that it was *my* car, and thought it was so funny and romantic that she was going to steal my tapes to give them to me.\n\nI wasn't at all enchanted. I was irritated that she broke into my car, and irritated that she apparently broke into cars on a somewhat regular basis.\n\nSome months later, she was riding in a mutual friend's truck, and she accidentally lost her purse under one of the seats. She was really worried about it because she'd lost her ID, her phone, and a fair amount of money.\n\nI told her that I'd take her to get her ID replaced and file a report about her stolen property, but that she should also consider her present sense of anxiety and aggravation the next time she felt like breaking into a car.\n\nShe was really irritated, and didn't speak to me for four days, during which time the friend found her purse under the truck seat.\n\nWas I an asshole?

I was joking about how our old school uniforms looked, and how they looked inappropriate on an 8 year old. I cracked a joke about Fr. S. \n\nMy friend got offended. I had forgotten that a long time ago she confessed to me that when she was in the 3rd grade she had gotten sexually abused everyday by her female cousin for 3 months straight. \n\nI’ve been feeling really guilty, but I didn’t realize why she was offended until the damage was done.

      "description": "So I am in college and currently live with 3 friends that I met freshman year, and I enjoy living with them. Next year I was planning on living with 3 of my best friends growing up who also attend the same college. A few weeks ago one of them backed out and it wasn’t a big deal we were just gonna look for a 3 person house instead of a 4 person. Today another one of them backed out due to financial reasons, and now the remaining friend wants to look for a  house with just me and him. I love this friend and I have known him forever but he has had a long time girlfriend and they have talked about getting married once they graduate. She is also a great person but the problem is I feel like I will be alone in the house a lot of the time and be bored , and now I feel like I would rather just stay with the 3 friends I’m living with now cause I think I will have more fun. I just feel bad because I don’t know if my friend has other options for next year and I feel like I would be leaving him out to dry. Would it be wrong if I stayed in my current living situation and didn’t look for a 2 person house with childhood best friend after two previous plans fell through?",

      "description": "So a week ago I took a cat in that was out in the cold. He was un-neutered and riddled with fighting scars (along with an infected wound about 2 inches long), but he was way too social to be a feral. Figured he may have been abandoned or lost, so I took him in for the night and posted a picture of him on the local lost pet group. Turns out he was a bit of a celebrity on the page having a post around the start of the month looking for an owner along with that same wound on his leg he still had, along with showing up on there a year ago. He seemed to be pretty well known along some the people in the group. Apparently when he was returned to his \"owners\" a year ago he was in similar condition, and many of the people who had helped him last time had tried to report them for neglect and abandonment. So I was on the assumption he was abandoned again considering the most recent post had no comments from his \"owners\". I was originally looking to keep him myself either long term or short term since the local shelter was full, but the vet visit meant I needed to change plans. Considering his body was covered in old scars not surprising he came back FIV+. While he could live a long happy life with my current cat he was a pretty big health risk while waiting to get him neutered and the two socialized. So I went forward in to looking for a new home for him since keeping him myself was a little more certain. He fortunately found his forever home that evening and he's doing quite well there. So bit of a whirlwind over four days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today, and the \"owner\" has come out of the wood work. I told them that with all the info I had, and how long his most recent posting had gone unanswered, I had assumed he was abandoned so I re-homed him. I told them I would pass the info on to the current owner, but there was nothing I can do since I don't own the cat. I also won't give them the name of the new owner since I've been getting nothing but harassment and an ever changing sob-story about how they need the cat back. How he'd tear the bandages off they put on him (He was perfectly fine with the bandage and the stitches he later got), how they took such good care of him (the vet on my visit and on the new owner's visit said he showed multiple signs of neglect), how its a new person I'm devastating by not returning the cat (gone from girlfriend, to son, to son and daughter). The new owner can see all of the old \"owner\" posts in the lost group, and I've sent them any messages I receive so I'm not leaving the new owner out of the loop. However its basically up to the new owner on whether or not the cat is returned now. The cat had no identification on them, and was not chipped when I took it to the vet so its mostly their word on ownership. I've seen older cats from feral colonies in better shape then this guy. I dunno, asshole or not, at least the cat is hopefully staying in a good home.",

      "description": "So I am in my final year engineering. Yesterday we(our project group) were supposed to meet our Head of Department who is our guide. We were supposed to meet at 10 AM. One of our project members, S lives really near college, within 1km. \n\nWe were all waiting for her to arrive as she was late (as usual). We waited till 10:20 and finally went in without her and met up with the guide, as he has a lecture in some other class at 10:30. As soon as we went in she arrived but had to stay out. When we got out of the cabin she was waiting for us. She said why couldn't you wait another 2 mins? I didn't say anything then. \n\nWhen she brought up the topic later, I told her we were already waiting for 20 mins. She said she had vehicle trouble, which I was alright with. I just told her that she's joining a company, she can't be late by 25 mins and then tell this to her superior. \n\nShe then exploded. She said really sarcastically that oh I didn't know we're working in a company. It's alright if I'm late by a few minutes for just the project. We should have waited for her. She also said, \"I didn't know you were so inhuman that you wouldn't even wait for a few minutes. I'm under a dictatorship.\" \n\nAt this point I explained that I'm not that mad that she's late. I'm mad that she's late and still is pointing the blame at us. She doesn't have leverage over the argument. She said okay fine and didn't say a word. At this point I just left for home. \n\nNow she's not talking to me at all. We're good friends by the way. Also, when I am late, I feel uneasy so naturally I expect others to be punctual as well. \n\nI really don't get why SHE is angry with me. AITA?",

      "description": "Im 27. Ive been practicing mixed martial arts since I was 24. Not to compete, but as a hobby and for exercise.\n\nBefore that, I wrestled in high school, I adapted well to it. I am known in my gym as mainly a wrestler/ground and pound type fighter. This works for me as im 6'4 and weigh 240 pounds. However even though im very good at maintaining dominant positions, when im on the ground my bjj is pretty minimal and im susceptible to all kinds of submissions.\n\nOne other practitioner is a 23 year old brown belt in bjj who is also fairly large at 6'2 and 220, so we end up as grappling partners usually.\n\nHe is very cocky and continually berates me about my lack of bjj skills, frequently getting me in submission holds and mocking me after the fact. He basically says that my wrestling is useless against his bjj. So I have less tolerance for him in general.\n\nOur gym has weekly \"king of the hill\" events where we grapple eachother to see who can attain dominance within 10 minutes or to the first submission. I usually win my matches by maintaining the dominant position.\n\nIts down to me and this kid, who is still talking trash, trying to get me down. \"You think you can handle me?\", \"Have you gotten better or no?\", \"Dont embarrass yourself again\".\n\nI finally had enough and grabbed him by the legs over my head and them dive bombed the floor. He landed on his shoulder and dislocated it. He also was pretty dazed after the fact. Needless to say I won but now hes pissy that I threw him down that hard.\n\nThere are no rules against throwing, this was not a bjj match but a grappling match, though i usually dont throw people. I wanted the win though to show that my wrestling is still very dangerous.\n\nHis friend asks if it would be ok if someone snapped my arm when they had me in an armbar but thats completely different imo as you know something is gonna snap in an armbar if you keep cranking but an over the head suplex isnt a guaranteed injury. Admittedly though I was rougher than usual.\n\nSo AITA for dislocating someones shoulder in a grappling match.",

You suck at everything.”\n\nI don’t know what actually made me get mad, but I just suddenly got ticked off by his comment. I said that he was being an asshole to me and that he should just stop saying I suck. I didn’t exactly yell, but I raised my voice significantly.

      "description": "This happens every week. My husband has a class at 10:30 twice a week, and he seems to always stay up late the night before and he doesn't wake up on time to catch the bus to get to his class. When this happens, he will usually ask me to drive him. I've already talked with him about how frustrating it is for me, because I feel like it shouldn't be my responsibility to get him to class on time. He can't drive himself on these days because we only have 2 hour parking, and he's going to be on campus for more than 2 hours.\n\nIn general, my husband has trouble waking up early in the morning. In the past I'd try to wake him up, but it would take up to 30 minutes to get him out of bed and he would usually get really pissed at me. I'd start my own morning stressed out because of this.\n\nSo, this morning, I didn't wake him up. I asked him what time he was planning on getting up, and he said 9:30. Well, 10:05 rolls around and here he comes sleepily asking me why I didn't wake him up. I told him it wasn't my responsibility to get him up in the mornings. Then, he asked me if I could drive him to class, and I said no. He mentioned that he drives me to class sometimes, but that's only if he has a class too and will be driving himself anyway. He picks me up sometimes from campus too, but I ask him at least an hour in advance. \n\nAnyway, I feel a little guilty for refusing to drive him. I knew it was going to make him late, and he does drive me sometimes. AITA?",

      "description": "First reddit post, so bear with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn New Year's I lost my dad. I was a wreck. 2 weeks later, I learn about the emotional spikes that come with grief when I suddenly get angry &amp; shout at a friend on Discord, which I quickly apologized. I still feel guilty &amp; don't want to snap at anyone again, so I leave all Discord groups &amp; keep to myself.\n\nA week later, a close friend (we'll call her H) demands to know what's going on. I tell her that I was avoiding Discord b/c I felt bad about my outburst &amp; didn't want to risk another one, &amp; that I felt like I was being somewhat attacked for it (even if I deserved it). H gets pissed, says that she'd done NOTHING but try to support me-- from being there for me while he was in the hospital &amp; when he passed. I explained that I only felt attacked that specific day &amp; I knew she was helping me. I apologized, but she goes off about how I'm manipulative &amp; a liar, I'm hiding my feelings, &amp; that I've broken her trust.\n\nI sit on her message for a few days then send her a big apology, thinking that the issue is me not being transparent about my feelings, saying, \"Hey, I'm new to grief, I don't know what to expect &amp; I'm sorry I made you feel bad. But I'm not ready to talk, please respect that.\" She responds about a week later, on the one month anniversary of my dad's death, to say, \"I can't believe you when you say it's emotional spikes b/c you said that before” &amp; that I should have been grateful that she even spent time away from her boyfriend, whom she sees only once a year (false but okay) to speak to me while my dad was in the hospital.\n\nI'm stunned but still want to fix things, so I apologize again. I say I'm sorry for making her feel bad but this has, literally, been the worst month of my life &amp; this back and forth hasn't helped &amp; that I need time/space.\n\nShe replies saying my apology was just a way to guilt trip her &amp; that it was inconsiderate to not give her a time frame to contact me. I was purely toxic &amp; this friendship was over. (screenshots: [https://imgur.com/a/IoSCOem](https://imgur.com/a/IoSCOem))\n\nMeanwhile, H is talking to our mutual friends about our exchange &amp; making sure everyone knows how terrible I am. A few friends decide to intervene &amp; message me their critiques, telling me that my grief is fake, that I need to seek professional help, or that my grief isn't a good enough excuse for my behavior. (examples: [https://imgur.com/a/nW9yt4u](https://imgur.com/a/nW9yt4u))\n\n2 months later &amp; H is still posting about how hard I made her life, &amp; (former) friends are still sending me messages calling out my alleged bad behavior. So many people have backed up H that I have to ask, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Said something rude to a friend 2 weeks after my dad passed away. Other friend told me I was manipulative &amp; a liar &amp; that I was using my grief as an excuse &amp; others agreed, calling it fake/wrong. Got told I needed professional help for not being over my dad a month after his passing",

      "description": "I definitely feel like a potential asshole for this, but I'm at a point where I can no longer see satisfying sex as an option with my boyfriend. \n\nA little background: My boyfriend (26) and I (20) started dating 7 months ago. My BF is only the second guy I've had sex with and in the beginning of our relationship I would get really nervous every time we'd have sex. I wouldn't be able to have sex for longer than ~5 minutes without becoming uncomfortably sore.\n\nMy boyfriend was very understanding towards me and eventually I became used to having sex for longer periods of time. I also gained a lot of confidence in myself, and for the first time in my life I've begun to enjoy sex as something more than just a way to please my partner.  \n\nHowever, within the last couple of months I've noticed that sex with my BF has become a lot less passionate and more one-sided. For example, our usual sex consists of him pressing his dick against my back and making little noises indicating he's in the mood. I have a pretty high sex drive these days so I'm almost always willing to oblige, but once we start it usually only lasts about a minute until he finishes. After that, he continues on with whatever he was doing before he got horny and I'm left lying there feeling 1) mildly used and 2) completely sexually frustrated. \n\nI've explained to him multiple times that I do not enjoy this type of sex, and that it makes me feel used and frustrated. He's always apologetic and says that he will do better next time, but the same thing happens again and again. \n\nNow whenever we have sex he asks for a blowjob first so that he can last longer when we have sex after, but that is almost never how things go. He lasts his usual 1-2 minutes, and afterwards I end up feeling twice as used. It honestly feels like he couldn't give 2 shits about my pleasure and only cares about his orgasms.\n\nRecently I've started thinking about mentioning an open relationship to him. I know it seems drastic but in all honesty I just want good, passionate sex. I would prefer to have that with my boyfriend, but even with all my pleading it seems like he just isn't interested in that anymore. \n\nAm I an asshole for considering this? And WIBTA if I brought it up to him? Any and all advice would really be appreciated here. I love my boyfriend, and I would love to have good sex with him again, but he just doesn't seem that interested in me anymore and I don't know what to do. \n\n",

      "description": "So, my friend introduced me to Reddit and this forum, first time posting on Reddit. Feel free to correct any mistakes that I make with this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this is not something big but it has been bugging me for the last couple of days. About one week ago I forgot to bring lunch money and asked my friend to lend me some. Some info: I rarely ask other people for money (by rarely I mean probably once or twice in 6 months), and always pay back in the agreed period of time, which is normally 3 days at most. Needless to say I feel like I have a good credit with money around my friends. Anyways my friend said yeah sure (it was like 10 dollars) and said just well pay me back okay? I was like yeah sure, I will pay you three days later at the latest. Now at this point I feel like he might've not heard me because he kinda started walking away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to tomorrow, I was gonna bring the cash but forgot again. So when I was at school I was like Oops, and made a note in my phone. When he saw me first thing he asked is do I have the money. I thought that was a bit strange as I said I will pay back in three days latest, but I apologised anyways and said I forgot, and I promised to pay back tomorrow. He was like okay now you gotta pay me one dollar extra because of interest. Now I am not poor by any means and could definitely afford to pay one dollar extra, but I thought it was a bit strange. I asked like why lol, as I have never heard about interests, and he said its customary for people around here to charge interests. Now I know for a fact thats not true because I've been in this school for 3 years and not once have I seen someone charge interest. Class was starting so I didn't bother him too much. I later texted him and said how come I've never been charged interests before, and he was like oh fucking forget it okay? and made me sound like a cheapskate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was wondering, am I in the wrong here for not paying up interests? BTW he didn't spread it around to tarnish my reputation so I am thankful for that, I still didn't pay up the interest though.",

      "description": "I'm M25, she's F26 and we've been together for 3.5 years now. I am brown and she's white to give more context. Since I moved out at 23, and into my own place I've been giving my parents around 1k-1.25k a month to help them out. They need the money and I make around 150k a year so I can afford it. Sometimes I give them more depending on situations etc. My gf hates this and always tells me to cut them off and that they're problems shouldn't be mine and how they're bleeding me dry. But my parents need the money for their mortgage, bills etc and they're in their late 50's to 60's now so they can't just supplement their income like that. I told her its a cultural thing and that I being a South Asian son have a duty to take care of my parents, which I truly believe I do. My parents raised me from nothing and I've always wanted to be where I am now in life to help them out and make their lives better. \n\nLast week my gf and I were talking about this again and about marriage etc, she brings up the fact that I need to stop helping out my parents so we can save more for a house and a wedding, vacations etc. I told her that I can't do that because my parents don't earn a lot and need the money. She got really mad and we argued about how they're \"toxic\" and how her parents never have and never would ask her for money and that I've been giving money to my parents since I was 16. I just told her white people are different and her parents are wealthy so they never knew and she doesn't know what the struggle is like. She basically ended the convo saying its either them or her and on Friday after a few days of hard thinking I broke up with her and told her why. \n\nShe was super mad/sad calling me all sorts of names and that no girl would sit by and watch me waste my money like that. Called me an asshole mama's boy etc etc and it was really sad for me too. I love her but I love my parents more and I can't stop supporting them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Two of my friends told me that I “announce” everything I say and told me I was an attention seeker. So this has happened to me a couple of times. The first time it happened was in class. We were talking and friend A, asked, “Why do you announce everything you say?  I mean seriously, I’m going to the bathroom, I’m going to get this drink, I have to sneeze. You’re such an attention seeker. Then, friend B chimes in and says “IKR? It’s like she wants people to notice her” Something like that. I felt embarrassed and a little mad but thought nothing of it. I still talked to both of them after that. A few weeks later we were in the cafeteria and I started laughing really hard at a funny comment. My other friends started laughing my laugh (not in a bad way) and friend A mumble,\n “...or maybe she just wants attention...”\nI brushed it off the first time, but this time I was upset. I got over it and continue to talk.\nThe third time it happened was today. We were at the cafeteria and friend B says, \n“I feel like &lt;my name&gt; would be the one to sacrifice everyone for herself in a horror movie.”\nFriend A agrees. Soon, we started talking about how we eat our burger. Friend A says \n“I feel like friend B would actually eat with a fork and a knife, (she does) but &lt;my name&gt; does it for attention.”\nLong story short. We didn’t talk for the rest of the day. (Today) Am I an attention seeker for announcing everything do?\n(Thanks for reading!)\n",

      "description": "So my girlfriend (22f) and I (22m) were talking early about some friends (both males) upcoming birthdays that take place the day before mine. She was talking about how they really wanted to go to a strip club to celebrate. The problem is that I will more than likely have to work that weekend in which case I would not be able to go. I told her this and told her that I would not be comfortable with her going to a strip club without me also being there. My reasoning is that this is a place of business designed for sexual arousal, whether you are into that same sex or not. She states that it is just something to do for fun and something that she had always wanted to experience. I told her that if she went without me I would be very upset with her to which she responded by saying that she is still planning to go, with or without me.\n\nTaking it to the next hypothetical level we started talking about bachelor and bachelorette parties. I stated that I would ask my fiancé not to have strippers and that I would consider it to be cheating if they disregarded my request, as they would be inviting men to come and get naked for them and their sexual pleasure, even if they don’t make any sexual contact. She thinks of it more as a tradition and believes it is not a big deal. \n\nSo am/would  I be the asshole in not allowing her to go with her friends and/or getting upset at her if she chooses to ignore my request?

I told him I’d be willing to try and see if it could work, and helped him with coming out to some other people and getting resources but after 2 weeks I just couldn’t, I said it then and still say it now: I’m straight, I’m just not attracted to women. I broke up with him, and told him I’d still support him, but he wouldn’t accept it.

      "description": "I'll try to keep this short. M22 and F19 if it matters.\n\nWe've been dating for nearly a year. When things started it went from zero to one hundred practically overnight, and things didn't slow down until about four months in. Our relationship hit a snag that lasted for about a month, but we worked through it and came out stronger for it imho. Throughout the entire relationship--until about two months ago--I've been unemployed. As you can imagine it has been a fairly big issue between us: her thinking I have no motivation in life, or that I'm going to be a bum forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast-forward to two weeks ago. I got two different interviews for two jobs that I really wanted. Both have the opportunity for a long-term career on-top of having excellent retirement options. One of the jobs is in the realm of LEO, and has the ability to go LEO very easily in the future. For the first time in a long time I felt happy, I felt hopeful, and I didn't feel the always-present depression that I had grown to expect every day. So I wanted to share these feelings with the GF. She was very excited for job A, and was immediately kind of a downer for job B. She stated right then and there that she didn't want me to do job B, and that job A would be great. I played it off and said something to the effect of, \"you're going to be disappointed.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkip to the day of the interview for job B. The day was perfect. I passed all the tests, had all the documents I needed, and everything looked good. I was extremely optimistic. While I was on my way home my GF called so I wanted to share the good news with her. She was immediately upset. Started jumping to worst-case scenario type situations, etc. Again I played it off. I attempted to reassure her, and told her that \"there was no reason to worry about anything yet.\" I still had to pass a polygraph and a psych test--both of which are easy to fail. We didn't talk too much after that. Later that night we got into it a bit, but ended up just falling asleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere we are today. I've wanted to be a LEO for a really long time; I've had the dream since I was 12, and I just always felt like it was unattainable. I understand why she is upset, and I can sympathize with it. I told her last night that I'd be an idiot not to be afraid of what could happen. I refuse to allow fear to dictate what I do in life. That being said, I am still a fairly long way to getting this job, let alone becoming a LEO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love my GF to death. I honestly don't want to imagine life without her. As corny as it sounds I do believe she is my soulmate. We click on every level, and get along so perfectly. I can count on one hand the number of things we disagree on. I plan on spending the rest of our lives together. That being said: if I get a job offer, and she makes me choose her or this job, and I choose the job, AITA?",

      "description": "And also WIBTA if I asked to see their text messages?\n\nI've been posting about this on different subs the last few days but haven't gotten many replies and have been in a tizzy since Christmas when all of this unfolded.\n\nLong story short, I am a female dating a female. She was openly bisexual when we met 3 years ago but still not comfortable being out and lied to her friends about who she was meeting off Tinder, she called me \"Michael\". We met, time passed, didn't work out and we were long distance friends as I'm from 5 hours away. She kept lying to them about me and referring to me as Michael and the whole time I had no idea. Eventually a year ago we started dating. The day we started dating she told me she hid hanging out with an ex from me, but wanted me to know. I felt upset but was glad she told me. More time passed and I got suspicious as to why she never wanted me to visit and that's when the hiding me came out. She promised to begin telling people, and then after months we had to have another conversation because she still hadn't and she finally started to tell her family and friends. I was really relieved and started to feel a little better.\n\nBut on top of this she was being weird about ex. Whenever the ex would text she'd hide her phone so I couldn't see, or she'd get tense and turn her phone over. One time she blatantly lied about who was texting her when we were laying and her phone was blowing up. She grabbed it and it was directly in my line of vision and I saw tons of messages from her ex. She apologized and said someone else was texting and let her respond real quick, so she sat up so I couldn't see, responded and that was it. I was upset and left the room but I figured she probably was still adjusting to being with me and thought I'd get jealous of them being friends.\n\nLots more time has passed and over Christmas I finally was about to meet 2 of her friends for the first time and an hour before she told me that she hadn't told them the whole truth about me. She told them she DID date Michael and we met through the fake dude. I was really fucking upset she hid more and was upset I now was going to have to meet people and be put in a position where I might have to lie. We talked for awhile and I told her I wasn't going to lie and she needed to stop doing this, and we moved on. I kept trying to explain to her she doesn't need to hide things from me, I'm not going to be mad and freak out and etc.\n\nThen on Christmas she told me, \"I told (ex) about you.\" And I said, \"Oh yeah? When?\" and she said, \"I dunno maybe a week ago, so if she's ever feeling real crazy and is hitting on me she knows now.\" Then we had to go downstairs to her family.\n\nI'm really fucking angry. I kept thinking, this girl didn't know about me and was hitting on her?? What was being said and what was my girlfriend saying back?? I had to leave right after Christmas and we haven't had a chance to talk as I want it to be in person. She's coming for New Years and I plan to then. I feel disrespected that her ex is hitting on her, that she lied those times, and that she's continuing to be friends with her. I should also mention this ex and her weren't exclusive, the girl lead her on and then told their friends girlfriend was \"obsessed\" with her.\n\nI plan on telling my girlfriend if she continues to be in contact with ex then I'm leaving. We're supposed to be working on trust because of the lying about me shit, and her being friends with an ex who hits on her is a huge boundary being crossed.\n\nBut it's not enough for me to see her not disrespecting me in the future. I want to know why she's hiding her phone and decide from there what to do. If my girlfriend's been enabling her ex hitting on her I'm leaving. I don't want to snoop, I want girlfriend to be there, but I need to know. If she refuses then I'll break up with her. If she refuses to distance herself from ex I'll break up with her.\n\nI'm sure you're asking why don't I just break up with her? Trust is gone, it's too dramatic, etc. The answer is we have been so close for 3 years. I can't wrap my head around the things that have happened, they don't match the person I've known and I really think she's just making immature mistakes to avoid conflicts. Which admittedly is not a great trait, but I don't think it represents who she is. I don't think she's cheated, but I feel like she's probably enabled. And I want to know the truth. If the relationship is salvageable I want to save it.\n\nSo. WIBTA? ",

      "description": "I'm very sorry if this is hard to read, english isn't my mother tongue\n\nI'm M23 my gf is 22, i'm sure of her love and love her a lot too\n\nAbout three months ago we both met someone nice at a party, he was friendly with me and her and it was all good.\n\nShe decided to add him on facebook, still all good, he was funny\n\nThe guy then ask her almost everyday when she has time to see him, that's getting suspicious, i tell her\n\nAbout two weeks later she accepts and they go climbing, they have fun and decide to climb together on a regular basis, still suspicious because of his initial attitude\n\n3 or 4 weeks after that, i'm joking about this with her telling her that he want her and all, and jokingly take her phone, randomly scroll and tell her \"let's see what you tell to your secret lover\", joking about it is my way to cope with the uneasy feeling their relationship gives me, i stop scrolling and see a message from her \" thank you for being there\"\n\nNow my look gets serious and she sees it, i read what it was about and the guy was asking her how her relationship with me was going (we had a bad phase at the time), she told him not really good and the guy was like \"that's really too bad\", not really supportive, at that time i felt bad, i asked myself if i was being cheated on, but didn't think it was the case\n\nOne week after that, they went to see a movie together and he told her, knowing i existed, that he liked her, she got angry against me with messages like \"hope you're happy, you were right\", she later confessed to me that she felt like he liked her but didn't tell me anything\n\nNow what bother me is that they're still friends and talk on a daily basis, see themselves multiples times a week, i told her that it made me feel like i wasn't important, or even a priority in her life when she is the top priority in mine\n\nWe had a lot of talks about this, and the outcome is mostly that she don't want to say goodbye to him, even more because she think it would mean she will have to say goodbye to her group of friend(she always dreamed of having a group of friend and she finally got one, only males and i wouldn't be surprised if they liked her too, she's very attractive)and if she will have to make a choice between me and that \"fake friend\" it won't be me\n\nI love her so much and would be devastated if our relationship were to end, but i don't see myself happy with someone who have friends who want to be more than that\n\nShe told me that if i really loved her i should be happy for her to have friends and \"get over it\", i feel like i could do everything for her but not if it's wrong for our common good, i feel like she should keep people that are interested in her far for us to be happy, and i'd do the same if a friend were to tell me he/she liked me\n\nAITA for wanting her to cut ties with guys who want to be more than friends ?",

      "title": "AITA for letting my friend’s girlfriend know that the IQ test she took online was phony? This is after years of her believing that she‘s a genius because of it...",
      "description": "Talking with some of my good friends, it came up in conversation that, “Did know know so &amp; so’s girlfriend is a genius? She says her IQ is above 140.”  This seemed a bit suspicious to me, since after years of knowing her, I would never have guessed she had even an above average IQ.  Not that people without higher education couldn’t have a high IQ, but just knowing she got her GED at age 19 or 20, and had not gone to college, both seemed a bit odd... but mainly after years of knowing her, I know she’s not super smart (which is totally ok! Not bashing her at all, she’s an awesome person, I’m just being honest.)\n\nSome background - my brother is a professional clinical psychologist, whose sole job is to test the IQ of children in the schools that hire him (you know, since IQ tests are actually made for children, not adults). Since we’re brothers and best friends, I have had years of correspondence with him throughout his schooling and career, and so I’ve become at least basically familiar with how legitimate IQ tests work.\n\nSo I asked my friends if they knew who tested her, what type /version of IQ test was it, etc. but no one really knew. So a little later, I got around to talking to her, and found a way to bring it up in conversation.  She told me it was an IQ test she found online, through a link on Facebook or something, but couldn’t remember the exact name of the website (but confirmed it wasn’t Mensa).  I asked her if they bombarded her with ads to subscribe to their “high IQ society” or whatever and she was like, “oh yeah they did! I signed up for a month and then cancelled...” \n\nAt this point, I realized this was one of those online phishing things, where they give you relatively easy IQ test-esque questions, flatter you with the results, and hope to coax you into giving them money.  I remember taking one of those tests back when I was a teenager surfing online, and even then it was immediately obvious to me that I probably shouldn’t conclude that I have a high IQ based on a sketchy web app.\n\nHere’s the thing, though - since taking this test, and absolutely believing the results, it has had a real impact on her life. Since “learning she’s a genius,” she got laid off from her desk job, but then went on to start her own self-employed business as an interior decorator, and is doing really well with it. Talking with her boyfriend, he said that she’s had so much more conviction and confidence since taking the test, and I’ve deduced that she may not have ever thought she was capable of starting her own business and following her dreams, had she not been lead to suddenly believe she was a genius.\n\nThe problem is, I didn’t put those pieces together while at my friends’ house.  I thought it would be better for her to know the truth... so I pulled up one of these type of IQ test websites on my phone, chock full of pop-up ads, redirected windows, etc.... all the telltale signs of a phony site. She confirmed that they looked like the test she took, so I was like, “Yeah that wasn’t a real IQ test...”\n\nI didn’t think it was a big deal in the moment, like so what you were fooled by a phony test, but she’s doing well in life and I couldn’t imagine that news having any affect on her outlook on life.  But now I’m pretty sure it was somewhat devastating to her... my friend who’s dated her for 10+ years asked me about what I said to her later that night, seemed a little pissed off, and since has been pretty much silent with me (ignoring my texts, but responding to everyone else in group texts, etc). So I’ve surmised that this is kind of a big deal to his girlfriend.  Haven’t heard anything from her about it since, but at least we did receive their save-the-date for their wedding this summer, so it’s not like they’re cutting me out of their lives completely...\n\nTLDR: AITA for breaking the news to my friends gf that the online IQ test that told her she’s a genius was phony, but later realized that it’s probably because of that IQ test that she’s made great positive changes in her life?",

      "description": "So my g/f (f25) and i (m32) have been together for a year and 6 months, i have no student loans, or debt to speak of, and a fairly well paying secure job. She on the other hand has an entry level job, and large student loan payments and has trouble just paying the interest on the loans. After a year of her and i being together i offered to pay the interest on her loans as long as she continued to make the her normal payments so she could actually put a dent into the overall debt amount. Also a stipulation was that she had to actively search for better employment that would further her career as she in a entry position for her field. I told her it didnt matter if she got the job or not, just that she was trying. \nOver the last 6 months she has made 1 attempt at applying for a new job. Whenever i ask her how the job hunt is going she balls up and crys, and gets put into a funk. its worth noting she has depression and anxiety. I have tried to help by searching career area for her, contacting friends who work in the field, and have provided some really good leads, but she wont make a move on any of them.\nRecently i have decided that i may quit paying the portion of the loans because of the lack of initiative she is showing toward getting a job. I feel extremely bad about doing this as it was never meant to be held over her, i was just hoping it would provide motivation. \nAITA if i quit paying portions of her student loans?\n",

      "description": "\nBest friend of 2 years, lived together for 10 months. We are both low income(we like stress free jobs) mid 20s. We even work(ed) in the same place. We both had a crush on this girl(lets call her Gaby) from work and one thing led to another i ended up dating her for 5 months. We never talked about the words bf/gf but we did talk about if we were seeing other people and both of us said no, and I was happy and she liked that too  Recently we even had talked about looking at new apartments when my lease was up so i thought it was ramping up to something serious.\n\n\n\nIdk if this is an asshole thing for bringing it up, but it was used as an excuse. Gaby is bipolar and sometimes acts rash or makes strange discisions but i can live with that. She goes to therapy twice a month. \n\n\n\nBetter part of a week ago Besty and I been drinking but I don't feel good and go to sleep early. Besty goes to hang out and drink more at a nearby friends house and Gaby is there too. You can probably guess what happens, they 'got too drunk' and smash. 3rd party friend immediatly tells me. Besty is blaming it on the alcohol and even her being bipolar comes up. After a short heated argument my besty tells me Gabys not my gf and hes been upset at me the whole time for not 'making her my girlfriend' because he had a crush on her too when we all first started hanging out.\n\n\n\nHaven't talked to Gaby, we didnt block eachother but I havent bothered talking to her and she hasn't made an attempt to contact me. We normally talk every day. Don't think I even care anymore.\n\n\n\nSo... We are already late on this month's rent and I tell the landlord he's not getting my rent anymore and I'm out, the whole Fuck off and everything. We have an eviction and at this point owe a LOT. Besty doesn't have ANY family and probably has less than a hundred bucks and doesn't drive. We have the same friends and I went pretty aggressive slandering his name and I know they're not helping him because... I'm staying with the only one that had room.\n\n\n\nHe's about to be homeless with an eviction on his record and I feel... Delighted, angry, sad, and like a monster because no one is perfect but I genuinely feel so hurt I just want him to suffer. \n\n\n\n\nI may have just ruined his life. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: He drunkingly slept with this girl ive been seeing for months and trying to make it serious. I know hes liked her. Out of spite i got us evicted and i know hes really bad off because hes asking around for help and he has no family or money to fall back on.\n\n",

      "description": "So I went on holiday with some close friends and friends of friends recently. Most of them are guys and the three in question live together. \n\nMy best friend has some bad habits that he seems to be unable to not do around me (or just thinks it's fine?) ie eating his own bogies and arranging his dick often and he seems to be encouraging his housemates.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I'm all about comfort. If ya balls twisted or itchy I'm not bothered about my close friends seeing to their needs, ya know, swiftly.\n\nBut I was suddenly in a house of three dudes and I would go from chatting to one to the next and each was just sitting there, with their hands deep in their pants, making eye contact with me and having a normal conversation for an extended amount of time, all the while lightly fiddling with their dicks and balls.\n\nI ended up bringing it up when I was a bit drunk, after making a joke asking if one of them was rubbing one out to which he replied by audibly slapping his dick which was hilarious and gross (my kind of humour). \n\nThey argued that they want to feel comfortable in their own home (which this wasn't technically) and it's comforting to just sit and hold your dick. I argued it would be unacceptable and way more noticeable if I sat there holding and tugging my labia. I know they're not doing it in a sexual way but all I see is dickhands touching shared food and I'm not super chill about it. \n\nThe debate went on for a while and as I was drunk I may have not been as tactful as usual but, is it just my problem? I have a separate group of male buddies and they don't do this. If my dad did it at home I'd be mortified. My brother used to constantly touch his winkle when he was very little but, like eating your bogies, I feel like this is something you should grow out of?",

He is very anti-sex-before-marriage and I am very pro-sex-before-marriage), but I ultimately dismiss these issues because we are happy and content. I'm a performer so I audition for a show nearby, as one does. Through this audition, I meet David. As it turns out, we're cast as lovers in this show, and for a while into the rehearsal process, everything goes smoothly. I'm able to balance being professionally intimate onstage with David while being personally intimate with Trevor in real life... until I start developing feelings for David. I deny deny deny that my feelings are anything more than just a showmance. I told myself my little crush would go away eventually.\n\nFast forward to MAY, 2017. I've been with Trevor for a year and a month. My little crush on David has not gone away. In fact, it turns into a big crush, and I discover that my feelings for him are mutual. I panic and realize that I'm in a lose-lose situation. I text my best friend Nicole everything and seek her advice. One day, Trevor comes over to hang out. I excuse myself to the bathroom, and when I come back, he's gone. Cue horrible sinking feeling in my stomach. I find him downstairs sobbing. He'd read my texts between Nicole and I regarding my dilemma in choosing between David and himself. We ultimately decide to take a break.\n\nA few days after, I hang out with David one-on-one. He and I didn't refer to it as a date, but it's definitely a date. I reveal to him that Trevor and I are on a break. Towards the end of the night, we finally let our feelings for each other out in the open. We kiss and we kiss and I see him the next day. We end up getting a bit more intimate with each other, but no sex.\n\nA few days pass. Trevor comes over to my house so we can discuss our relationship as it stands. I meet him there since I am coming from work. I don't tell him anything about my date with David. We end up breaking up. It is very emotional and very bittersweet but we feel it is for the best as there is no turning back. Two weeks later, David and I start dating.\n\nAbout a month after breaking up, Trevor admits to me he'd read my texts with Nicole a second time. Before I had arrived at my house the morning we broke up, he had knocked on the door to greet my mom. He used the invitation inside to sneak up to my room and read my text messages on my iPad while I wasn't home. He knew all the details from David and I's date as we were breaking up, but pretended he had no clue, and I had also pretended I did no such thing.\n\nOur break-up still haunts me. It's been a blemish on my conscience ever since. He was convinced I cheated on him and expressed no regret for invading my privacy. It horrifies me. I don't consider what I did to be cheating since we were on a break. What do you think, Reddit? AITA?",

He keeps telling my buddy and other people \"kys\" and is overall very toxic and later he claims he is just sarcastic and joking. So I wanted to really really annoy him and later say \"just jk lol\". He is very nationalistic and since I live in neighboring country with long history with his country (Serbia) I know a lot of weak points that annoy them to the core.\nSome of their weak points are their history under Turks, losing wars and NATO.\nBasically I called told him \"That I can't understand why he is so nationalistic since real Serbs don't really exist anymore since they were forcefully mixed with Turks\" (not something I believe but know it would annoy him to core). Then I told him \"You are the reason why NATO should reconsider using depleted uranium in it's bombs and that Serbian bombings should have happened 8 years earlier and should have lasted longer\". (Kinda proud of myself for uranium joke, but kinda agree with second point, because if this happened earlier peace in region would occur sooner).

      "description": "I am a server in a restaurant. I like my job okay and I do pretty well as far as money goes. I never call out, except for two other times for a family emergency and for strep throat. Spread out far apart and the last time was 2 months ago when my 90 y/o grandmother fell and broke her leg. My managers are usually very chill and understanding, but we've been unusually busy for weekday nights. There aren't enough servers staffed atm so we're stretched thin during the week, and being busy like this is making for some long nights. Well Sunday I worked my 3rd shift in a row that was over 12 hours long and I was exhausted. I had developed a cough throughout the day that was really deep in my chest and painful. My throat was beginning to be sore too. Over Sunday night I was kept awake violently coughing so hard I'd throw up. I went to the doctor on Monday morning and she diagnosed me with bronchitis and told me to sleep and drink a bunch of water. She prescribed me cough medication and gave me a note to cover through Thursday in case I needed the days. So last night I called in sick. Management was very upset. Telling me that I had to find a replacement and I was going to cause them to have a tough night. Basically making me feel guilty for getting sick. I spent all day in bed drinking water and hacking my lungs up. This morning, I'm still hacking. Like every few breaths I take I start coughing hard. And my voice is suffering as well. Both of those things make the job of serving tables very difficult. It's hard to take orders when you're coughing over the customer every few seconds. Who wants to order from a waiter that coughed and gagged the whole time anyway? Not to mention acute bronchitis is contagious and I'm serving food. I called this morning and my manager went in about how inconvenient this is and how they're gonna be screwed tonight. \"You know a couple weeks ago I was at work while i had the flu. It sucked but sometimes adults have to deal with feeling shitty and come to work.\" That's what my GM said. I told him that I have my note, it's not my fault that they're understaffed, and I wouldn't be making it to work. I'm also tempted to just lay out the whole note even if I feel better tomorrow just because. But the guilt trip from my managers make me feel like an ass hole. Like I'm hurting my coworkers, who I really care about, because I'm sick. So AITAH for not just sucking it up and dealing with it?",

      "description": " This might sound like a lame high school drama, but all this has had such a negative affect in my life that I need ousiders opinions. For context me and my best friend here are now both 18.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and my friend, let’s say Maria have been best friends for over 11 years. We’re both eighteen now, navigating between relationships and school stress. We are somewhat the opposites, I’m an introvert and semi-nerdy, Maria is an extrovert partygirl. But we do have the similar tastes of humor and our past unites us very well, and I love her a lot.  \n\nLast autumn me, Maria and her parents visited Maria’s father’s home country together. We were both 17 at the time. It was an amazing trip, something that I’ll never forget. Unfortunately I had to leave earlier due to school, and Maria spent an extra week there with her family.  \n\n During this holiday of ours we had basically just hanged out with each other. But just a few days after I had left Maria went all in. Somewhere there, she met an American, 19-year old boy, let’s call him Jared now. First, I thought Jared was going to be one of those Maria’s casual flings, that she used to do back home also. They had sex a couple times, and ofc I was happy for her that she got some. Then, Jared wanted to be Marias boyfriend “just for a day”. Before Maria left home, the decided to try on a long distance open-relationship, because Maria didn’t feel like she was mature enough for a “real relationship”.  \n\nBasically their rules at first were that they could have other sex partners, but they would have to be open about it. In a short time, Jared got jealous of the other boys Maria had, she quit telling about her encounters, and they had the fight number one.  \n\nNow, even though Jared lived far away, he suddenly was everywhere around us. The worst thing was the fact that he demanded to have access to Maria’s snapchat. The “traded accounts” and I could never know which one would be answering my snaps, so all her former friends including me stopped talking to her online because of that. She claims that it is okay, and says after what she had done it’s completely reasonable. I didn’t say anything, but I do not agree with that. \n\nThen came the fight number 2. Maria had cheated on him again, for some reason. She came to school crying, constantly on her phone. After a lesson she dragged me into an empty classroom, crying that Jared was about to kill himself because of this. \n\nIt was the moment that I absolutely lost all my faith into Jared. I felt terrible seeing my best friend crying her eyes out, promising repeatedly to this man that she would never leave him. I could not do anything. \n\nAfterwards I sent a ton of angry messages to Jared, saying that he should change his ways and never ever threaten Maria with suicide. He said that he understood, and even though the seemed to get their relationship better quickly, nothing really seemed to change. \n\nNow Maria is on her phone every minute of the day. She texts in class, spend all breaks talking to Jared and leaved home with headphones on as fast as possible. I haven’t hanged out with her in ages, mostly because she is booked with Jared and I don’t want to be the third wheel. Her grades got a lot worse, too, and I’m not just sad but worried about her. Maria has asked me multiple times if I like Jared. I never give straight answer, I don’t know how to say that I hate this man, and she is always super upset, says that “Jared really wants you to like him”.  \n\nAm I the asshole for hating Jared? \n\nTL,DR: My best friend got herself a long distance boyfriends, who over time got more and more jealous and even controlling, which seem almost abusive. her grades have dropped and I never see her anymore. I really don't like her boyfriend and she sort of makes me feel like an aashole for it. Am I?",

      "description": "Some quick context: I am a homosexual 17 year old guy. I came out of the closet about two years ago in a pretty liberal country. Virtually everyone in my area accepted it.\n\nWhen I told my classmates that I like men, noone really had a problem with it except this one guy, who was really shocked. It was the prankster of the classroom and was into football, which made him behave a tad macho. He told me that he had difficulties with me being gay, but liked me as a person so he would try to get over it. I said I respected that, we made a lot of jokes about it, we talked to eachother sometimes and untill he changed class, we had regular contact.\n\nThis valentine there was an event at our school that made it possible to buy roses for people you liked. You could send them and write a little card attached to it that said who it was from and a reason why you sent it. I send some to a few friends and decided to send one to that guy too as a prank. I wrote my name on it and a little heart.\n\nI always used to joke with it a tad, but have told him many times that I could never be into him, so I thought it would be a good prank. He apparently didnt think so.\n\nWhen I was walking past them that day, his entire friend group was staring at me. I asked (already laughing on the inside): \"Did you like the rose?\"\nHe exclaimed \"So it was really you?!\" And I laughed loudly and walked away, signaling that it was a joke. I didnt see him again that day (school was ending at that time) and went home. The next day everybody in that clique was staring at me again. When I went away I heard someone whispering \"dirty faggot\". Some friends (who thought it was a hillarious joke) also said they heard them insulting me loudly in frond of a lot of pupils.\n\nI honestly don't care about the insults. I have heard worse and have quite a thick skin, but it made me realise that maybe I crossed a line.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "My company enrolls clients into government health insurance plans such as Medicaid and subsidized health plans aka Obama Care.  My company is contracted by my state to do this work plus we receive federal grant money to do this work.  That means we have to follow strict HIPAA rules so we dont get in trouble.\n\nMy company has expanded to other states and we won a contract with another state to do the same work.  Instead of opening other offices, we contracted another company in October to help us do this work.  So a supervisor at this company, who only has a few weeks of experience using our software, decided she is competent enough to train people on her own.  Let's call the supervisor Karen. Karen emailed me explaining that she trained this person on her own.  Let's call the new employee Stephanie. Karen said the Stephanie is ready for an account and is ready to sign people up for health insurance.\n\nThe problem is, each new employee has to go through our process.  When I told Karen that Stephanie has to go through this process, Karen told me it's not necessary.  Karen explained that Stephanie has been using her account to sign people up.  Karen even said Stephanie has already signed 25 people up for insurance during the past week.  For those of you who dont know, that's a big no no.  There are many HIPAA regulations that prohibit that so we can get hit with large fines.  Not to mention, its against our company policy.\n\nSo I report this to my supervisor, we will call him Jim.  Jim says he will email our president for more guidance.  Here's where things go wrong, Jim emails our president about the situation and even copied me in the email.  However, Jim only mentioned that Karen trained Stephanie by herself.  Jim then asked if its okay to set the new employee with a new account.  Jim completely neglected to mention how Karen violated HIPAA regulations by sharing accounts.\n\nGiven the fact that Karen told me straight up that she shared her account, I believe that Karen sincerely didn't know that it was against the law.  I was very frustrated that my bosses did not take action and that we are letting the other company do whatever.  I also wanted to cover my ass in case this comes back to haunt us.  So I sent Karen an email explaining that account sharing isn't allowed and explained why it's not allowed.  I was very polite and I gave Karen my personal cell phone number.  I gave it to her and offered fast services.  I told Karen if she has an employee who needs to get started right away, I can host a training webinar during the same day and I can expedite the whole process for her.\n\nJim found out and needless to say he's pissed.  Jim thinks I went over his head and claims I need to know my place.  He also told me he's offended that I did this.  Jim threatened to write me up if I ever do his job again and I could get fired.  I personally believe I did nothing wrong.  This person violated HIPAA regulations and my boss is completely ignoring this.  Like I mentioned, he didn't even ask our president about the account sharing; he didn't even mention it.  I want to cover my ass in case something bad happens.\n\nAlso, Jim is treating me with contempt right now.  He's ignoring my emails, he doesnt even look me in the eye anymore, and he ignores me in general.  If we walk by each other in the hallway, he'll ignore me when I greet him.  Jim makes backhanded remarks about me in meetings and making jokes at my expense.  Jim is making me feel like shit and as if I did something wrong.",

      "description": "My brother is nearly 24 and he never washes his hands even though our parents taught us to always do so. I’ve had OCD since I was four and I washed my hands to the point where they cracked and bled, I never touched doorknobs and used my foot or put my shirt over my hand and when going up or down stairs in our old house, I would use the side railing to hang upside down and move up or down from there so I didn’t have to touch the staircase (I was four, it didn’t make sense) and it’s gotten much better, but I still hate the idea of certain germs. I’ve broken down crying and had panic attacks about it, especially when I know my family, mostly this particular brother, doesn’t wash his hands after either kind of... bathroom break. He gets offended and upset when I ask him to and tells me that OCD for me isn’t real. He doesn’t even think of cleanliness and honestly only showers because our mother tells him to. My parents have tried explaining how bad it is not to wash your hands, but after a few hours, he goes back to this behavior. I’m honestly wondering if I’m being a bitch for bothering so much now. If he doesn’t get it by now, why would he ever. ",

      "description": "A bit of a backstory with this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy little brother is about two years younger than me. Growing up, we were pretty close, and during summer breaks, weekends, etc, we would play video games, have fun, that sort of thing together. He always seemed to look up to me, and whenever I was doing something, he seemed to want to be involved. However, ever since I started high school, I started drifting from him, but not intentionally really. I got more friends in high school who I would spend more time with instead. My family is rather antisocial, and we just never talked about much with relevancy, sticking to topics like entertainment and board games than anything like what's going on in my life. My family is super conservative too which doesn't help. They're super strict on drugs and alcohol and have told us to never do it, no questions asked. It's a weird mess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to my senior year, and I'm working constantly at my job, going to school, and hanging out with friends on weekends, leaving myself little to no time for bonding with my little brother, who is currently a sophomore now. My family is pretty conservative, and so when he heard I started getting involved with alcohol and weed and illegal stuff, I think it messed him up a bit, and now he's trying to get involved in that scene too. The thing is, I really didn't touch any of this stuff until my senior year. Sophomore year and junior year, I never did it. Now I'm doing it, but it's something almost every high school senior does, so it's not too big of a deal in my opinion. I also ration myself - I never do it at school, only at weekends at friend's houses, and stay safe always. My brother, however, is a sophomore and struggling with school, but is hanging out with the wrong group of people and is getting high at school. I'm a firm believer that people should do what they want, and while I'm not happy with my brother going down that path, it's not really my choice to make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, the issue lies when I'm working and not home. Last week, I got a can of beer for myself, but when I went home, it was missing. As it turns out, my brother stole it and brought it to school to brag about it. I got mad, but I wanted to confront him about it. He got scared when he heard I was gonna confront him, and put the alcohol back in my room. I also noticed he's been stealing my lighters and other stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, I finally confronted him about it, and just told him to not to go through my room. He seemed scared, and was basically speechless. But I felt awful just telling him, and I feel like there's more to say too about that stuff. Since we're so isolated from each other, I just don't even know where to begin. I feel sorry I wasn't there for him most of high school, but I just wish he knew he could create his own path and not live in my own shadow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure if any of this even made much sense, but any help is appreciated.",

      "title": "AITA for causing my roommate to lock herself in her room over my embarrassment at her telling a herpes fact to a stranger?",
      "description": "(Long post, scroll for a TLDR)\n\nThis story requires a bit of context, but my [19F] roommate, M [19F], has currently locked herself in her room after an argument with me and I don’t know what to do.\n\nTonight, M and I made brownies, and I decided we’d go bring a brownie to our mutual friend, V [21M], who lives on our floor. V wasn’t there, so we gave a brownie to his roommate to give to him later. Before the roommate closed the door, M asked “Did you know herpes has the same letters as sphere?” We figured that fun fact out when she was playing that word scramble game and it was kinda funny but I was mortified that she’s just say that to some guy we don’t even know.\n\nWe went back to our place, and for more context my other roommate B [20F] and I share a room while M has the other to herself. We go into my room to give B a brownie and M and I tell her what happened with V’s roommate.\n\nB couldn’t believe M would say that and she understood why I was embarrassed. M didn’t, and she demanded why I was embarrassed because I “wasn’t even there” (I was a few feet down the hallway when she said it.) I told her he’d just seen me so I know I was there and would probably think of herpes whenever he saw either of us around the building.\n\nM said “Oh, so you’re embarrassed to be associated with me?” This entire time I thought it was just lighthearted joking about the awkward conversation, and I responded jokingly “Only when you talk about herpes to guys we don’t even know!”\n\nThis set M over the edge, and she yelled something I can’t remember at me and B and stormed out of our room and into hers, slamming both doors. This is where we’re at right now. I put a couple brownies on a napkin and set them in front of her door and knocked before going back to my room, but she didn’t open her door and they’re still sitting out there.\n\nI understand I overreacted. I was kind of irrationally embarrassed by the whole thing, and I didn’t realize she was upset by B and I jokingly exaggerating it like she’d done something awful. But she gave no sign that she was upset before running off and slamming our door.\n\nI also have an anxiety disorder and often get nervous talking to strangers, which M knows. She said she was going to ask V if he knew that herpes and sphere are spelled with the same letters, and I thought she was probably kidding but still told her not to, although I know V better than she does and he’d probably just laugh, so I wouldn’t have really minded. I had no reason to suspect she’d say it to his roommate, we don’t even know the guy’s name.\n\nTLDR: My roommate asked a guy on our floor who neither of us knew if he knew that herpes and sphere are spelled with the same letters, I told her afterward I was embarrassed because I was there too. She took this to mean I was embarrassed to be associated with her, even though I said it was just her talking about herpes, and now she’s locked herself in her room. AITA?",

      "description": "In 2013 I agreed to add my Dad on to my cell phone plan because he had bad credit. The additional cost of the line was about $30 dollars so we agreed that at the beginning of each year he would pay me $360 for the year. In January of 2018, I told him that I no longer wanted him on my plan but he said he was too busy to deal with getting his own plan so I agreed to do it for one more year. Over the course of 2018, we had a falling out and our communication became limited to a few emails related to family matters (health of older relatives).\n\nIn December of 2018, I got a letter from the Social Security Administration saying that I owed them money. After some digging, I learned that SS payments had been made to him fraudulently on my behalf when I was very young (please don't consider this in the judgment of the phone issue). I was able to resolve the issue but I decided that I did not want to be connected to him on any accounts.\n\nOn Jan 1, 2019, I sent him an email saying that I wanted him to transfer his phone line to his own account and that I would give him until Jan 31 to do it. I called the phone company to give him all the permissions to go into any store and transfer the number.\n\nA few days after Jan 31 he called me and was very angry that I had canceled his number. I referred him to the email and he said he never saw it.\n\nIn order to recover the number, I needed to reinstate it on my account and then give him permission to transfer it again. I agreed to do this and he agreed to move the number by the end of February.\n\nAfter the number was reinstated my Dad had some medical issues. He was also traveling and he wanted to transfer the number to a different carrier that was only available where he lives and not where he currently was. So the end of February deadline turned into whenever he gets back home.\n\nI just sent him an email saying that I will cancel the line on Mar 31 and if he wants the number he needs to transfer it before then. There is no negotiation.\n\nI feel like a pushover at the same time that I feel like I should be considerate of his situation with his health. AITA?\n\nAlso, I did not grow up with him and he did ever support me financially.",

      "description": "I’ve travelled with my parents since I was like 12 (I’m 22 now), we have been to some pretty cool places like Europe, cruises, resorts etc and while it sounds like a great time, when you’re that young it’s not the kind of fun you really want so this has lead to many family arguments on trips just because they have completely different needs than me and my brother did. For example they love to do touristy things like museums and sightseeing but when you’re 15 you just want to do something fun and this lead to a lot conflict to the point where I don’t even enjoy going on trips with them or got excited when they planned them. I’m 22 now and I’ve been an 2 trips myself with my friends which I obviously enjoy a lot more. My moms been saying we should go on another family trip soon because now that we’re older it’ll be more fun. I mean it could be fun, but my family and  I just don’t click together we all have a different personality and as much as my mom loves family things I just don’t see this as being fun for now at least. I just feel bad because she’s a very affectionate mom and the rest of us aren’t really so being together on vacation just doesn’t workout even tho she thinks it’ll be different this time. AITA for not wanting to go on vacation with her? ",

      "description": "My best friend's girlfriend (27F) has a medical condition (Lupus) which affects her quite a lot. She gets tired really easily, has joint pains and gets fevers and headaches a lot. She has a decently paying job in an office, although can only work part time, and lives with her parents who are quite well-off so she doesn't pay rent or utilities or anything. She only recently became part of my friend group when she started dating my best friend, she is great and everyone really likes her. Whenever we do anything with her she isn't expected to pay, either her boyfriend pays or the rest of us just split the cost. I don't really agree with it since she has a job and lives rent/utilities free, but I go along with it since it's usually just like splitting her meal between 4 or 5 of us or something. We are planning a trip around Europe for 5 of us, including this girl. Her boyfriend wants us to split the cost for her to come, including flights, accomodation, food, etc. I don't see why we have to pay for her. She must have plenty money to spend since she lives with her parents and I don't think she really needs us to pay. I haven't spoken to anyone about this and am worried I am being an asshole because of her condition.\n\nAITA for not wanting to pay for her to come?",

I have seen her almost everyday and haven't asked her if she wants a ride. I feel horrible for not asking her. \nI do not ask her cause first off they smell like cat pee so bad it makes me gag. When they open its like being smacked with a wall of cat pee it almost knocks you backward. The second reason is cause they have bed bugs. I know they have bed bugs from using the laundry room after them. Dead bed bugs all over the floor when they pull their laundry out the dryer. I am afraid of the bed bugs more than the cat pee!\nAm I the asshole for not giving her and her son a ride? I feel horrible but I'm afraid for my mental health after I give her a ride. ",

We are both people of staying home and not going out so much, and I basically havent had a weekend at my city in at least 8 months, because she always wants to come here to see her friends.\nHer best friends are 2 girls that studied with me in highschool, but not with my girlfriend, and used to bully everyone - so I didnt really like them, but we have grown, etc, but still I dont want them to be my only friends.\nIn that proccess, I have grown further and further from my older friends, because I always end up hanging around with these people I just mentioned.\nSo for a while now, everytime she comes to see me I have to argue to not come to my parents town, and to not see her friends, and to not go the places they want to go, but I always lose, end up going, then I get frustrated we argue and she says she will pay more attention to it - then we fight again over the same thing the other time.\n\nThats the context. I know its pretty standard, but we are now in the middle of a huge fight because yesterday, instead of going as always, I refused and stayed alone with some other common friends, while she went to a party in a remote location, very far away, with dirt road on the way, music I know she hates, all because one of the two bully friends wanted to go to hook up with a crush of hers. \nThis girl was the only one determined to go, and since we just got back from a 15 day trip, my GF says \"she really wanted to see them\", but kinda took their side on deciding where to go, while I tried to put other options on the table - it's a small town, so it was pretty much the old \"go to trash party\" or \"drink on the street\", I was arguing for the second. \n\nNow, I'm very frustrated because I feel like everytime these friends get involved, they become priority, and I always say that and my GF just says stuff like \"thats not true, im with you everyday, etc\", and I do understand that, but at the same time I feel like she is forcing me into some toxic friendships and siding with them at every opportunity, even though she knows how I feel about it.\n\nIm really worried about becoming a control freak on our relationship ou sexist even, so I wanted outside opinions.\nAm I the asshole here? Anyone have any clue what I should do?\n\nSorry for the possibly bad english, not a native speaker.",

      "description": " \n\nSome background info: I (F/23) moved out of my childhood home nearly ten years ago due to my stepfather being abusive and my mother (49) refusing to believe this despite me trying to convince her over and over. We’ve had little to no contact during these years and the times we’ve spoken it’s only ended in quarreling (she still insists I’m lying; and I’m obviously fed up from being told it’s all bullshit). I’ve since also changed my legal name in an attempt to distance myself from this abusive past.\n\nAnyway, I met my mom for the first time in two years a week or so ago, and it seems she’s changed her mind on my story being all lies. She told me for the first time that she believes me, but it’s only after me prying for that answer, so I’m not quite sure she actually does and it's not her pulling at straws.\n\nThen today. I had a panic attack for the first time in a while, after re-starting medication for anxiety and other things, and since my mother has a history of panic disorder I thought I’d bury our battle axe and try reaching out to her for mother-daughter advice. So I call and tell her what's up. She gives me some advice but then tells me it hurts hearing I’m hurting. I apologize and say I didn’t mean to make her sad with me; in which she just becomes more agitated. I realize we’re heading for another fight so I thank her for the advice and hang up.\n\nShe then immediately messages me going on about how she's against me taking pills, and I (fed up by now) tell her they're the only thing that kept me from taking my life back when I was a teenager, in which she says me mentioning suic\\*de was a low blow and on top of that, bullshit.\n\nI respond saying it was a mistake asking her for help, and she agrees.\n\nTHEN, a while later after me not replying, she messages me again calling me by my birth name. I ask what she means by that (she knows I dislike it) and she says it's what I was named, and it will always be my name.\n\nI blocked her after that, because it’s clearly to spite me. And now I’ve given up. It’s been nearly a decade, she still lives with my abuser, and I can’t get through to her. So I’m planning to cut ties once and for all. I sort of feel bad about it, because she’s obviously not mentally healthy either. She tells me she’s afraid to go outside her house, she has no job, yet refuses every sort of help from the government etc., and I’m tired of trying to encourage her to take it. She tells me I'm her only \"happiness\" in life, but I feel she loves the kid I used to be back when we lived together, not the adult I am now.\n\nSo, AITA for giving up on her? Or is it my duty as her daughter to try to help her out of that place, or should I for her sake simply pretend I DID lie about the abuse, since she's apparently too weak mentally to ever handle the truth? I honestly don't know.",

      "description": "I drive a 1988 Trans Am and I was going to get my oil changed one day since it had been about five or six months since I got my last one. I pull in to the mechanic’s shop I go to since I know him pretty good and he gives me a good deal. We’re just a couple good ol boys. I pull up and one of the guys working up there, Bruce, tells me that there’s a two hour wait since they’re really busy. Now normally, I’m not one to fuss, but me and the shop owner Jeremy have a gentleman’s agreement where I’ve been going to him and his shop for about 25 years now, he’ll usually put me ahead of the line and save me some time. But two hours was too long for me today since I had a few appointments coming up and I told the first guy Bruce as much. I guess Bruce doesn’t know or doesn’t care about the arrangement me and Jeremy has and tells me if I want it done any faster I would have to change it myself. \n\n\n\nNow I’m no dummy and I know my way around the car I’ve had for 30 years. So I make a run over to the auto parts store and pick up a few quarts of oil and a filter. I return to the parking lot of Jeremy’s shop and begin doing exactly what Bruce suggested I do, and I change my oil right there in the parking lot. It ends up making a much larger mess than I figured it would, but I’m able to clean up most of it before I go on my way. Jeremy calls me later and asks about what happened and I tell him, he thought it was pretty funny but just not to do it again and to try calling ahead when I needed another change so they could schedule better. That Bruce guy still won’t look me in the eye, though. ",

      "description": "My husband's ex wife is not good with money. They were married for 19 years, and in the divorce he discovered the last half of their marriage she stole/ racked up over $300k in credit card debt. She's currently maxed out on her credit cards and has a loan or two out. These charges are largely to retail places, like the $300k was. She has a decent paying job for our area, so..... I don't know, feel however you want on that one. \n\nSo anyway, she remarried and is getting a divorce. They had some problems, so it's not a surprise, but that's not really the point. During one of their spats she confessed she spent the $20k she got from her divorce with my husband on debt her current (soon to be ex) husband's debt and a $3k gold chain. She has a decent paying job for our area, but she continues to make poor financial decisions. She bought a newer car, admittedly for a good price, but at a time she couldn't really afford it. So, you see the pattern. Anyway, she asked my husband for $1k for rent, and I told him I'm not comfortable with that. I think he's just enabling her, like he did during their marriage. She's gotten money from him before and it's always \"the last time\". She came to him before she went to her own family or even talked to the friend she's renting from. She said in the divorce she only cared about his money, and I don't care to have that continue. I agreed to letting him give her $200 to buy food with, which is probably already spent on something else. Who knows...\n\nThere's some other stuff, but I don't really know how relevant. AITA for saying \"no\" to giving her money?",

      "description": "(Long set up. Scroll to the end to just see the TLDR) \n\nMy family has gone through a lot. Especially my mom. She was abused by the man she loved since she was 14. (Our dad). He left. \n\nIn result I went through a really rough spell that took a toll on my mom. Seven years later, I’m now on medication and coping. \n\nMy sister (only 10 years old) has severe OCD. She won’t brush her hair because she’s afraid it will fall out. She won’t change clothes. She has nightly rituals that go on for hours. She won’t flush the toilet etc. When my mom try’s to help my sister will get manipulative and scream that she (my mom) doesn’t love her and that she hates her. Which breaks my mom. Minutes later she will say “I’m so sorry mommy, I don’t mean it.” \n\n(TLDR) And now it’s my brother. He has been skipping school. He’s on anti-depression medication and is smoking cigarettes, and weed. He’s only 16. \nWhenever I talk to him about it he says that it’s not a big deal and if he wasn’t 16 it is technically a legal activity. (We live in Canada.) he’s broke windows, drawers and doors in our house (on “accident”) and takes money from our Nana (who lives on her own, and already struggles with money) to feed his drug habit. (Ex. My nana gives him money for lunch and he spends it on weed.)  I found his cigarettes in his school bag (more, he got them confiscated before, but he gets them for free from his friends) and told my mom. He won’t talk to me. Hasn’t for weeks now. And when he does he calls me a rat. It breaks my heart. \n\nI’m broken and upset that our family can never be okay. And I hate how he doesn’t think that this should affect us at all. He doesn’t think about me or my mom. He says he wants to move out and never see us again. \n\nAITA? Is it really not that big of a deal to do cigarettes and weed on medication/at 16? Am I overreacting? Should I not tell my mom? Is it just a phase?? ",

      "description": "So, I've met him briefly only oncr. But her family has more experience with him, and they've told me seriously troubling things. From all accounts, he is emotionally abusive. I mean, I have all the evidence except her side. And if you know anything about emotionally abusive relationships, you know that her side isn't going to be very reliable anyway. My friend refuses to talk about it with me. I think she thinks I'm going to yell at her. I'm totally not planning on it, but at this point I really dislike him, and I won't be able to suppress that unless I talk to her about it. \n\nWe don't live close, but I'm going home for spring break. In the past, I've tried to make plans with her (she's always been a flake, so that's difficult). The most recent time, we made plans. She didn't show up, and then over an hour later she told me her boyfriend was picking her up in 30 minutes and they were going to go to lunch and she wanted me to come with. I flat out said \"no\". First, this was totally rude, to just not show up and then change the plans to include a new activity AND a new person. She also knows I hate spontaneity, changes of plans, surprises (anxiety, woo!).  And she didn't even ask. It's like he hijacked the day. And finally, I don't like him. Everything I've been told about him... I would be the rudest person ever at that lunch. Nothing but passive aggressiveness. I want to be there for her if things are bad, but I don't think I need to want to be around him to do that.\n\nSo my issue is... If this happens again, if he shows up or tries to hijack the hangout, I just don't want to be a part of it. I would either leave or straight up confront him. I would consider it if my friend would actually hang out with me alone and talk to me first. So those would be my terms. We made plans for the two of us. If he tries to show up, I'm out. If she can't talk to me about it, I'm out. I just can't be around him knowing the side of the facts I know without confronting them both. Does that make me an asshole?\n\n(Oh. Important to know about me is that I'm a therapist. I work with abused kids. So yeah, really not interested in meeting this guy ATM)\n\n(Also important to understand is that abusers often present well in public. So even though he may seem okay if I met him, that would probably not do anything to steer me away from my conclusion. The bad stuff I've heard about him came with proof.)",

At the beginning of the last month i quickly learned that she's going to be working on different position in this company so they're looking for someone to replace her. Fine by me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe end of previous month was... frustrating because she'd come to me almost everyday asking \"hey, can you replace me because X and Y?\". I started to feel like she's asking me to replace her whenever she didn't feel like sitting on her position and working. She could easily ask the driver for things she needs to have but instead, she'd ask me to replace her and go by herself. It honestly didn't feel like it's necessarybut instead she'd pull me from my other duties. Not nice at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week i learned from HR that i will be replacing the receptionist completely due to inabilty to find anyone else to replace her. The HR lady was surprised that my supervisor didn't tell me a word about it. He (supervisor) told her that he talked to me! No, he didn't at all and suddenly i'm learning all of this a few days in advance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add more, whole company has big financial problems. It's so bad that we're mentioned in the media (of course not in a good way) which influences the inabilty to find the replacement for the receptionist but also it's so bad that other services that provide, for example: shipping mails, buying coffe and office assortment are cutting the services completely for us. It feels like it's a matter of time that other companies will cut servies for us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently in trial contract till the end of the month and thinking about not extending that. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to quit? Are the things i listed above, legitmate reasons to quit?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHalp  \n ",

      "description": "I'll preface this by saying my S.O (25f) and I (25m) had an excellent start to Valentine's day. We both got home from work around the same time. I had a bouquet of flowers and a bottle of wine waiting for her. I cleaned up the kitchen/dining room very nicely and I picked up the ingredients for one of her favorite meals (chicken tacos) and cooked dinner for her. She also surprised me with a beautiful box full of all my fav snacks, and a pair of boxers with her face printed all over them (LOL a gag gift, they're my \"going out to the bar with the boys\" boxers). It was adorable. We had an excellent dinner and got a nice wine buzz. Next we cancelled drinking plans with some friends of ours and decided to just watch movies in bed all night together and spend some \"quality time\" together if you know what I mean (perfect night).\n\n SO while were choosing a movie I suggest a few and she suggests a few and we haven't come to a compromise yet. At this point she turns over, pouting, and calls me an \"asshole\" for not wanting to watch a Romantic comedy because its valentines day. I hate rom coms and she knows that and at this point I'm thinking were going to bounce movie ideas off each other until we agree on something like we always do. Then she turns over and refuses to speak to me, I suggest a few more movies, make a few lighthearted jokes, try to brush her hair affectionately, no response. At this point I say \"Okay then, I'll choose\" so I put on the cheesiest action film I can find in hopes to arouse her sense of humor. She then leaves the room and proceeds to text me saying we should break up because I \"make all the rules\" and \"dont care about her feelings\" etc. \n\nIts now the following day and she's still talking about breaking up and I'm completely taken aback. I care about/love this girl A LOT and I go out of my way to be a sensitive/understanding and responsive boyfriend to her and breaking up is never a thought that has crossed my mind. I'm extremely confused right now and i need outside advice. AM I THE ASSHOLE HERE? If so i am absolutely willing to do anything i can to fix this problem, but I'm going crazy over here.

      "description": "I'm just making this account to ask this after seeing a few videos about this subreddit, \nI struggle quite severely with depression, on top of that i have quite a busy life, I'm a student, I work, I have a sister I sometimes have to care for as I live in a single parent household. I want to preface this by saying that I love my girlfriend, she's not a bad person but she does suffer from borderline personality disorder. Basically, she reacts to things very extremely and she has abandonment issues, so sometimes it can be hard to tell if what I've done is my fault or simply her overreacting. I've missed a lot of plans with her due to things coming up and needing to take care of my sister which though it upsets her a lot she is understanding and tries her best not to get upset at me because she knows i couldn't do anything about it. So, when I do have time for her she really, really looks forward to it, I have missed a lot more plans with her due to my depression, whether it's being unable to get out of bed that day or falling asleep. Once I missed five plans all right after the other with her  and i felt terrible because she had a sort of episode and was convinced i hate her, she cried, said she hates me and that I'm horrible to her, when she calmed down she said to me she can understand it happening occasionally but how frequently i do it is a problem as she can't trust me or rely on me for anything and i should make more of an effort for her or at least try to tell her more often. once something came up and I'd be showing up late, I didn't tell her that I'd be getting there late and eventually after stopping at home before making my way to her i fell asleep, she was enraged by it, she cried, called me a cunt and an asshole and ignored my texts for the next day. Am I being an asshole to her and using depression as an excuse or is she overreacting?",

      "description": "I work a very stressful job. One that I enjoy, but one thats also grating. I am my own boss, but its a small outfit and I still put in hours every day of every week.\n\nI also dislike people in general. I just find them so annoying and I basically see nothing good in them 90% of the time. Despite this in my capacity as head of my company I have to play the role of a social butterfly. I do this well but everyone has a breaking point.\n\nA \"colleague\" (not exactly an enemy since we work together sometimes but we are competitors in different companies in the same field) has been pestering me to work on a project with him that will severly limit my ability to be creative and productive.\n\nI also think hes trying to slowly \"annex\" me and my people through collaborative projects that would all but enslave us to a larger company who we sell too. I hate him now. \n\nAs I was leaving a clients office he was there, imo to ambush me, and started giving me an elevator pitch as I walked to my car. I have told him no in a thousand different ways, including just \"no.\"\n\nMy car is far away in a parking garage so this goes on and on with him yapping and me gently letting him down.\n\nFinally I snap and just tell him, \"If you dont stop speaking to me, I'm going to tell you to fuck off as loud as I can, right in your face.\" \n\nI didnt stay to see his reaction and just went to my car. I was so angry I threw my table against my wall when I got home. Tables fine but theres a dent in my drywall.\n\nTold employee who thinks I went overboard.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "We live in California, and my boyfriend and I recently had an argument over the use of my car. He invited me to seek popular opinion to see whether my demands are unreasonable or not.  We share my car; I own it outright and am listed on the insurance as a primary driver, with my boyfriend also included on my insurance policy.  We were running errands, and he agreed to drive (we alternate frequently). He pulled out a pipe filled with weed from his pocket and began smoking during the drive. I asked him not to, citing safety and legal concerns. I smoke weed, but would never smoke outside of the legal parameters allotted by our state. He was upset, as he feels he is entitled to smoking while driving my vehicle, and that the general public would not share my concern. He has approved this post and would like to know what others have to say.  Thank you!",

      "description": "To start, I live with 3 other people. \n\nOur landlord requires us to shovel snow and rake the leaves or we get fined. The last time it snowed one of my roommates  (we'll say roommate A) woke up early and did part of the work, then my other roommate (roommate B) helped her. Roommate B approached me and said she couldn't finish and asked if I could do it. I couldn't because I was leaving for class right as she asked, but my last roommate (roommate C) did it since she had the time to. Just to note, I wasn't awake when they were shoveling. I woke up late that day and had to rush to class once I got up. This was a couple weeks ago.\n\nFast forward to today and the snow has melted. There are leaves that now need to be raked. Roommate A &amp; B raked what they could and have now said I have to finish it by tomorrow. If it's not done by then we risk getting fined. \n\nMy issue is not with helping but being told on short notice that if I don't do something in 24 hours, we risk being fined. I told them that I'll do my best to get it done tomorrow but I work and have class. I will be gone for the majority of the day &amp; do not know when I will have the time to do it. Again, I don't mind contributing but had I known this was something I needed to do today, I would have done it today vs. tomorrow. The same thing applies to the snow shoveling, if I had known everyone was chipping in that day, I would have also done it (but I had overslept that day, so maybe the same thing would have happened). I have to be at work in the morning &amp; will try to wake up extra early to get it done, but am I the asshole here??\n\nIf I'm being an ass, call me out but I just wanna know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "OK backstory: \nI have a severely disabled child. \nI met my current bf roughly 5months ago through a dating site. At that time he worked overnights had a little apartment and a car leased through one of those \"buy here pay here\" places. \nWe dated about a month mostly spending time at my home, dinners, movie night, ect.. \nWe seemed really great together and would often just hang around and play video games. He is very good with my child and didn't seem scared off by some of our daily life difficulties. At this point (about 5wks in) he had been staying over and going to work in the evening for about two weeks. I was all swept up in emotion and suggested he move in since we were both paying steep rent/utilities. He moved in the next week and all was well. After living together about 2 weeks he quit his overnight job and look a daylight position closer to my home. He was about a month behind on his car payment upon moving in and was deciding how to handle it. We decided since I have a vehicle that is paid off and since i work from home we could both use my car and save even more money! He returned his car to the lot and all was well. \n\nThe turning point: \nWithin a month of starting his new job he was very unhappy. He would often complain for hrs each day after working very long shifts and we started to butt heads a bit. I knew that I could afford the bills on my own if I needed to so I told him if he absolutely hated the place to quit and work on finding somewhere else so, two weeks before Christmas he quit. Now we were home together all of the time and after about a month of unemployment we started to argue often. I was becoming financially strapped caring for now three ppl. He did help me with things like housework and my child's care. (Which can be quite draining) now it has been over 2 months that he's been out of work. Im struggling financially. There's no sex happening. We bicker and argue daily. He plays video games for hrs and hrs even when I'm basically begging him to spend time with me. \n\nThe dilemma:\nI am simply not happy and would like to split but when I bring it up he always says \"I got rid of my house, car, job for you\" so I feel guilty. He does help with housework and he didn't bail due to my special kiddo so I feel like I should be great full but I'm not happy and feel like I should be able to end this if it's not working. So AITA for wanting him to move out? ",

While we were setting it up, we both acknowledged how unstable the tv was, and how the slightest of bumps would cause it to fall over; I even said jokingly “when this falls over, I’m not replacing it” . Later on, I ended up bumping into the TV, knocking it over and breaking it. I immediately apologized and said “Don’t worry I’ll get you a new one ASAP, a tv like that is only like 80 bucks on Kijiji”. My friend was taken aback by this, and told me to buy him a brand new one, saying “if you break something that doesn’t belong to you, you replace it with a brand new version, period”. I feel like buying him a used TV that has a stand is already fair enough compensation, considering the condition his TV was already in. Am I the asshole?",

My dog is afraid of him so we've kept them separated for the time being. Well this morning my mom found out about the puppy and completely lost her mind. She said we were extremely immature and did not think things through and demanded we get rid of the puppy this week as she doesn't want a Pitbull around my son. She even said that if it was a different type of dog she wouldn't mind but since he is a pit she is not interested. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my sister and I pay all of our own bills, our own rent and live in our own home.

The place was packed with tons of tourists who had also seen the bar on social media. Unfortunately, most of them were thirsty men.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend made a bad joke about cocaine, and a french guy overheard and decided that he was going to use this opportunity to slide into our group of three girls, placing a hand on my friend's shoulder and pushing into our closed circle. The first words out of his mouth were \"Oh, cocaine? I'm new to Japan, I just moved here, perhaps you could show me where to get some good stuff.\" Cocaine is EXTREMELY illegal in Japan. If you got caught with it, you'd be deported for life (after a stint of imprisonment). Going up to a group of girls you don't know and asking them where to find cocaine is stupid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe told him we were from Hokkaido and going home early tomorrow (a lie but whatever), so we had no idea where to get drugs in Tokyo since we're just as new as him, and walked away. He followed us to our table. He sort of sneered and went \"Hokkaido? What's that? Where is that anyway?\" My friends just turned away and decided to ignore him, but I was irritated. I can't stand people who MOVE to a new country and know nothing about it. So I spent the next ten minutes lecturing him. Japan is a small country. I asked him why he would move ANYWHERE without knowing shit about the most basic geography. You don't have to know every prefecture, but Hokkaido is a huge and popular island that anyone living in Japan should know of. I also told him that if the only way he could think to hit on girls was to insert himself uninvited into their conversation, follow them when they walk away, and ask them to walk him through the process of obtaining drugs, he has no game. He asked me \"what should I do then? How should I talk to women?\" I told him he could try growing a personality instead of using \"I'm new here\" to make people empathize with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was pissed. He asked me \"How many countries have you even traveled to? Did you study their geography before going there?\" I told him that YES, I do have the ability to do a basic google search and learn a bit about the place I'm going to. But this is a different level. He's not there for a week on vacation, he's MOVING there, and should definitely know more. He called me a bitch, told me I was unwelcoming, and said I probably hate other foreigners. He told me I was gatekeeping by not welcoming other expats with open arms. He extended his hand for a handshake, wishing me good luck with my bitchy attitude. I shook his hand, and wished him good luck finding a map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I the asshole for \"gatekeeping\" and even bothering to engage with this guy? I know it was probably a waste of my time, but someone nearby commented that I really went in too hard on him",

I mean she goes to Starbucks every single day, eats out atleast one meal a day, etc.\nLately I’ve been blessed and have made ~$5000 this month. This information, I chose to share with GF. \nSince some time has passed, my GF has been wanting to go out and eat and do things, without realizing that I myself have things to pay for. So this lead to her wanting to go to a restaurant last night and I said I wanted to save some money before going out again.\nI’ve spent $200 in the past 3 days and she has spent $30.\n\nWhenever I say no to her she’ll say something like “u don’t hesitate to spend money and go get food with ur friends but when it comes to me you say no”... I’ve gone from feeling 100% validated, to talking to her and feeling 100% in the wrong. AITA here?",

      "description": "So this woman and I moved to this area around the same time six months ago. We met at a meetup where people in our age range gather to play games. At first, she just had this guy that she was seeing back where she moved from, but it wasn’t official yet. I could tell that to her, it was, so I didn’t make a move. Then a couple of months ago, he made it official and asked her not to hang out with guys one on one anymore. \n\n\nThey travel to visit each other every so often. He seems to make her very happy, so I’m happy for her. I encourage her to keep things strong with him and have never badmouthed him to her. I’ve even gone so far as to suggest she move up her plans to move closer to him if she can. \n\n\nThat all sounds innocent enough, so here’s the AITA part. At first I tried to honor her boyfriend’s wish and only planned hangouts where it wasn’t just the two of us, however it usually boiled down to us being the last two there. I also have a very giving personality type, so I do things such as make her dinner and if I find a little trinket or doodad that reminds me of her and it’s cheap, I might pick it up for her. There have even been a couple of instances of giving her foot and leg massages after some long runs she went on, to help reduce the soreness (it’s a skill I picked up with my ex). My hands never wandered and most of the time, there was zero eye contact. I kept it as professional and non-intimate as possible. I don’t even hug her “hello” or “goodbye”, so the leg massages are the only touching and only because they serve a functional purpose. \n\n\nI know that I would never do anything to hurt that relationship since he makes her happy and I just want her to be happy, but I am also doing these things, knowing that if he found out about them without knowing that doing these types of things for friends is just who I am, he might feel betrayed. The only reason why I continue to do these things is because she’s the best friend I have out in this new city, and I’m hers. I just don’t want to lose that friendship. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This happened a while ago but it still bugs me to no end. So I met those two girls on my first day at university and as we had all of our classes together at the time we kind of stuck together. Things started kinda well, nothing bad. But then I felt some distance from them until the day they told me they couldn't stand being near my presence anymore.\n\nNow, when they very politely had the talk with me, I asked them what did I do that made them get so angry at me, and the first thing they said (and thus what I assume is the most important for it to  be the very first thing they thought) was \"the dog thing\". What was the dog thing? Well, we were talking about animal testing and we were agreeing that it was a necessary evil especially in the science stuff, but then I asked what really happened with the cosmetic industry and animal testing because I honestly thought that they just put cream on the animal and that was it, and one of them said that they use a substance beagles produce to test things. My response was \"ohhh, I see\".\nThere were also some other instances I remember that they didn't really like what I said, and those include saying that everyone should be able to use dreads (don't see this argument being brought up a lot in the US but here it is a big flag to the anti-cultural appropriation movement), saying while waiting for one of the girls to arrive when asked what do we do if the train arrives and she's not here \"the worst thing that could happen is we taking the train without her\", sarcastically saying that I was a bastard bourgeois (a self depreciating slang we have for middle class citizens) when I knew they were from a poorer background than mine, casually saying the things I did on the weekend (some of them were bastard bourgeois stuff) and maybe some others I don't really remember.\nOh, and one detail I think I should mention: we had a project to do with other five people and those two fought and couldn't stand each and everyone of them by the end of the thing, that's the only piece of evidence that doesn't make me think I'm a complete asshole.\nBut yeah, in the end I properly apologized to them after a few days (one took it well and the other said \"I can't deal with this\" and went away and asked a guy for a cigarette when I said I wanted to talk), and my biased friends obviously say I had no fault. But I still feel bad about it, and what better way to see if I was or not an asshole than asking strangers on the internet? And sorry if this post is too long and biased, but I tried my best to be as truthful as I could here.",

      "description": "(Tldr at the end. Will be long and will be filled with spelling mistakes. Sorry in advance)\nSo basically it's as the title says but I should I explain.\n\nFirst thing first, I love my uncle. But in recent events i learned some stuff about him that has made me see him in a new light and i dont think he deserves to be at my wedding (which is in 10 months)\n\nIt started around a year ago and I found out that he got married to his long time girlfriend (who I dont like for many reasons but thats a different story) and didnt invite any of his family. I understand if he wanted to keep it small but he is always invited to big life event and my father and aunt (his siblings) would have really wanted to be there for him. My dad had no clue they where even engaged until they announced that they where married on Facebook. Not even a courthouse wedding, it was like a 50 people event. My dad never said anything about it but I could tell he was hurt a little. \n\nThen I visited my parents a week ago and while drinking with my mum (we do that, shes like my best friend) she informed me that when my Nana passed away (my uncle and dads mom) 8 years ago my dad wanted to have a nice dinner with all his siblings to pass out the inheritance cheques. My dad was going to pay for all the meals and wanted to spend time with his siblings. Keep in mind shortly after my Nana passed away my dads oldest sister died due to complications with MS. When he invited my uncle to the dinner he said to just send it in the mail. Again my dad was really hurt.\n\nFinally today I find out that this past weekend he had a retirement party and again didnt invite any of his family. My dad didn't even know he retired! I'm kind of angry at him for again not including my dad and aunt in another huge life event! \n\nSo that brings me to now. I've been contemplating this since I found out about the cheque thing but now I really dont want him there. I know my dad will want to invite him anyway but I really dont want him to be hurt again when he doesn't come. \n\nAnd before anyone says anything my uncle is invited to everything, he often chooses not to come. We tried to visit regularly before my nana passes away but after that my uncle started distancing himself so my dad feels unwelcomed to go to his house. \n\nI just feel bad for not wanting him there. Its ultimately up to my dad if he want him to be invited (dad is paying for most of the wedding) but I dont want him to get hurt again. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTldr : my uncle has intentionally not involved my family in major life events and not come to our life events even when invited, causing my dad to feel upset. I dont want him at my wedding because of this. Am I the asshole.",

Hours before my shift my heart rate will be high, I’ll shake, feel nauseous, overthink everything and struggle to breathe as well as suffer with IBS symptoms. The anticipation for the day ahead is so frightening that often I will just call in sick and eventually quit due to the overwhelming feelings.\n\nMy family say I need to grow up and take some responsibility earning my own money etc, but I am finding it really hard to hold down a job. They are angry and frustrated with me and they get very disappointed when I tell them I’ve quit, saying I ‘give up too easily’. Reddit AITA?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I make money together. At the moment, we're saving for a trip and all of our earnings go into a joint account. We pay for everything out of that account and rarely use individual accounts. We have a different view when it comes to finances; I believe you should still treat yourself with something, whether it be a pedicure, a new blouse or even a trip to the cinema. He, on the other hand is a religious money hoarder and will live like a hermit in the name of saving money for said trip. \n\nI had a job up until September that was very damaging to my mental and physical health. Everyday, he would beg me to quit it and go into business with him full-time. Eventually, I did and I told him that if I leave that job, all of my pre-existing debts and future expenses would have to come out of our joint account, to which he agreed to. \n\nOver a period of 3 years, I've probably spent about $1000 on personal items for myself, whereas he's spent about $200. However, that's because he will live like a homeless person with stretched out boxers that are falling off his ass to call himself a \"saver\". He also has this thing where if I buy something, he has to buy something of equal value. For example, if I buy an iPhone because that's what I genuinely want, he also has to get one too because I can't have anything that's worth more than his. The thing is, he may genuinely want a cheaper phone but he still would take the full $800 because we have to be equal and I can never have more than him. \n\nAnyways, I still live at home and recently, my mom brought up that I help out with the Cable bill which would be $100. I don't pay any other bills, so this was a pretty reasonable request to me. I told him about it and he freaked out and he doesn't think that I should contribute to my mom's bills with money out of money that he owns too. I got upset and told him that I'd go back to making money aside of him because he literally polices every purchase that I make. He lives with his father and even though his dad doesn't require him to pay bills, he would still take $100 because I'm helping my mom out. If I knew that he was going to act this way when it comes to money, I wouldn't have even quit my job. I know you may say all of this can be rectified if we allot allowances to each other, but because of this trip, it's kind of difficult, so we just take from one big pool. Plus, he doesn't want me to make money aside for myself. \n\nAm I the asshole for spending money from our joint account to help my mom out with the bill? I understand where he's coming from because he believes in equality and he has nothing to do with my mom but at the same time, it is a JOINT account. Also, why would he force himself to spend the same amount as me if he genuinely doesn't need/want to?\n\nTL;DR - I want to help my mom with a bill from our joint account and boyfriend thinks it's unfair to him.",

      "title": "AITA for no longer allowing my sister's mental health be the crutch that allows her to getaway with being an asshole to me?",
      "description": "Here's the long version, you are warned.\n\nMy sister has been diagnosed with DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) and it is speckled with other fun things like psychosis, anxiety, depression, etc. It's a real hoot. Her condition appeared about 10 years ago. It was never fully diagnosed until recently but we had a whole comorbidity diagnosis for a very long time. She is considered untreatable but has a cocktail of meds to treat some of the other issues like anxiety, sleep, depression, etc. At one point she underwent ECT treatments but it caused more pain and memory issues than it did at treating the illness. She now lives independently (which is a BIG step) and she has a very patient and caring boyfriend who doesn't seem to mind her issues and actually serves as the person she feels most comfortable with and will take the most direction from during her episodes. He lives with her and she has been for the most part very happy with her new independent life with him. This came to great relief for most of us because, to be honest, we have all taken a beating emotionally and mentally for years. After a while it becomes exhausting and we all find ourselves dealing with our own mental health issues as a result of our interactions with her. Nonetheless, we love her and try very hard to be supportive.\n\nOut of everyone in the family, myself and my husband and children, we have gone through some major bullshit with her episodes in the past. To the point of where we had to go through trauma therapy with our kids for a specific experience. In the last 10 years we have all been verbally assaulted by her. She has major hallucinations and disillusions that make her think horrible things about people and she believes it is real and there is no convincing her otherwise. She has also been a very loving and sweet person who cares dearly about us and those around her. You just never know what person you are dealing with and when.\n\nWe have made great attempts to being understanding and supportive, even in light of past transgression. My husband began to see some correlation recently that indicated she had some control over her actions but was selective of when she wanted to control herself. I did not see this but my husband saw her illness before I did and so I think I am just blind to a lot of it and how she works.\n\nOver the weekend I chose to have her, her boyfriend, my father and his wife all over for a Christmas dinner. It is not our entire family because my sister does not take to that very well and she is recently very close to our father (which she wasn't about a year ago) so I thought that would be the most comfortable for her. I anticipated some stress and issues but was not prepared for what was coming at me. Most of the night was okay. She had some minor disruptions and asked me why I had an attitude. I didn't but it is common for her to imagine things like this and convince herself of such. So our night continued and then came the sudden halt to the evening's festivities.\n\nMy sister, who as far as I know has no interest, care or political leaning, has been apparently immersing herself in TV, specifically FOX news. My father, pro-Trump and proud Republican, immediately begins steering us into the topic of politics for the after dinner chat. I personally don't mind discussing politics because my family is pretty open and non-hating in regards to everyone's politics. My sister however took off in a direction that she made sure I was aware she directed her outrage regarding the topic towards me. My father, Mr. Instigator, knew he fucked up and I don't blame him but I certainly feel like he knew more than me in regards to her politics. \n\nMy sister starts her tear by declaring she was raised \"in little Mexico with THOSE people\". First off, she was raised in a nice suburban to a middle to high income family and went to school with a few Hispanic individuals whom she was friends with growing up. Her entire life is basically the epitome of white privilege. She has never experienced anything, not homelessness, hunger, thirst, cold, or a lack of health insurance. She has had everything her heart desires. She is WELL taken care of and her family supports her even when they sometimes should really walk away. \n\nMy sister, in her moment of declaring herself a victim of Hispanics (which pissed me off), hissed and sneered at me for my support of rapists and murderers. I was shocked because 1) my sister has never expressed racism before 2) my sister would normally feel very protective of people who are victims of bias because she herself is a victim with her mental health problems. I was so pissed because she had the nerve to come into my home, once again, and be a total asshole to me and call me evil and rude, and claimed I had an attitude even before the conversation that erupted into her shit storm. Ultimately she lashed out and then informed everyone she was going home. My dingbat father had her drive them because she was DD since she can't drink at all on her meds. So him and his wife have to go, at least in order to not upset her more or as I was informed direct her rage at them for not coming with her, so the evening comes to its abrupt end.  \n\nUltimately I was hurt and angry. I worked my ass off to make sure the night was perfect. I spent a TON of money on food and presents and tried to make my sister feel at home. I was just done. I have officially had enough of it. I love her and as much as I want to support her I don't think I can because her ability to knock me down has been getting better and better. I have even taken her side when it came to health of my family and I think my priorities just need to be me and my own family. She is happy where she is in life and I am happy where she is as well. My husband really feels she is using her illness as a crutch when it best serves her and I really hope not but I did get that feeling at my house the other night. She purposely attempted to ruin the night and I do think her motivations were something outside of her illness and more in line with the fact that she didn't like that my father and I had something we enjoyed conversing about. She seem annoyed when he would get into a topic with me and we would start going back and forth. She would find the opportunity to cut me off and start almost showing off with her ideas on the topic. I didn't take it personally and actually did think to excuse it because \"she doesn't know better\", but my husband saw it as something else as if she was vying for our father's attention.\n\nIn the end, we ended up continuing the shit storm on text where she laid into me about my non-use of text to have relationship with her and my insistence to call her when she hates talking on the phone. She called me evil and untrustworthy and that because I told her she gave me anxiety that I was somehow stealing her thunder and trying to make my mental health more dire than hers. She said she was done with rude people and my f-ing attitude. My response was snide and I told her that I wasn't the one coming into someone else's house and basically shitting all over them while they cooked me dinner, cleaned up after me and made sure I was safe, healthy, happy, and fed. She deleted me from her only social media account told me to never contact her again. A part of me felt relief. Like I exited the hostage scenario I've been locked inside of for 10 years. I felt a sense of freedom and honestly I felt good about being an asshole back to her and not letting her mental health be the reason I should relent and be all apologies. I know she may never speak to me again, honestly. I know she may very well go into a psychosis and this comes back to haunt us as she devises her weird plot of revenge (she has done that to others). I just want to be separated from it and her now. I also want to hold her accountable instead of just letting her use her crutch for everything when it is obvious she knows better. If she can live independent and be self-efficient, she can also own up to her own bullshit like the rest us. ",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nMy former best friend and I have been friends since college, about 9 years now. I have also been friends with her husband since then as well, as I met them both at the same time. I've been through a lot with the both of them; I was MOH at their wedding, she was MOH at my wedding, I've been their through my friend's DUI and legal troubles, etc. \n\nSince my friend got married to her husband in 2013 she has been pretty flaky, and it's only gotten worse with time. She doesn't answer my texts or calls, sometimes for weeks on end now these days. However, I have always made myself available to her, no matter what time of day, for her phone calls or texts; I always answered right away because I loved and cherished her. She's done some pretty awful things in the past that I've forgiven her for. For example, at my wedding she had to come stag because her husband could not afford to fly in along with her, and she was pretty upset at the idea of 'being alone' during the reception. So, after the dinner at my reception was over she invited some man I've never met to my wedding to hang out with him as her date (she was in an open marriage). That is just one example.\n\nHer life has been on a big downward spiral since 2014-2015. She was an alcholic, got three DUIs and went to jail, has jumped from job to job, and is now going through a separation/divorce with her husband, who I am still good friends with. Not only that, she's had some physical health issues, and has struggled with depression. She recently went to rehab for her alcoholism, for a whopping 45k, which her parents paid for, as they have for nearly everything in her life.\n\nMy breaking point was when she ghosted me on a text after she told me she'd gotten into an argument with her mother, whom she and her husband have lived with multiple times throughout their marriage, and she was going to sell all of her things to get a plane ticket to fly back to the state I currently live in. I told her politely that I thought she was acting rash, and that she ought to take a step back before doing something like that. She never texted me again after that. I had to text her husband to find out that she ended up getting the ticket and flying halfway across the US to my state, and that she had already landed safely and had somewhere to stay. Then after all that, two days later and still no text from her, I get an email that she had logged into my hulu account. I was livid. I booted all the devices from my acct and changed my password. \n\nSince then she has texted me twice; two weeks ago with a Rob Lowe meme, and then a few days ago to brag about a kitchenaid she got for her bday. I ignored her texts. My mom says I should at least be cordial because friend knows she fucked up, but I'm through. My friend hasn't asked me about myself or how I am doing for the majority of our phone calls/texts for the past year. \n\nAITA?",

(Remember, Z and Y are exes) He asked me to keep that a secret and I obliged...And that was the end of the conversation. Here’s what I know about the letter: Nothing other than he said it was a “love letter” and Z said he felt bad for X. \n\nI decide it’s best to say nothing.

J immediately wants to tell X, but I asked him not to. Especially since I told Z I would keep it private. \n\nfast forward again to this previous weekend (a month or so later). J was in a conversation with X and told him about the letter Y sent Z. Shit def hit the fan, but I wasn’t around for it. I still don’t know what the fallout is/was.\n\nThat’s the story stripped of everyone’s (me included), emotions/arguments/POV/etc, just the facts. \n\n———\n\nI feel like I’m in a bit of a lose/lose situation. \n\nAm I the asshole for withholding the “love letter” info on X’s relationship with Y?

And I put \"Arthur Morgan\" for the return name as a subtle reference to RDR2 because my friend had been playing it and raving about it recently.  The package showed up about 3 days later than what it was originally predicted to arrive, and everything had been stolen out of the package. The bottom had been cut open carefully with a knife and then retaped very neatly after the goods were extracted. \n\nWe both knew there was a chance of this happening, so we both agree that using AM for the return name wasn't the only thing that could have led to this happening, but I'm not convinced using that name significantly increased the odds of it getting ripped off. My unfortunate friend and a few other people have instantly said I shouldn't have used that name when they heard the story. AITA?",

      "description": "My boyfriend (25) and I (21) have been together for 3.5 years now. We met in university, he was my university tour guide and I was a potential applicant. Long story short we got together and lived together all throughout my university years up to present day. We have had our ups and downs like most couples, but I because I was so young when we started dating (he is my first ever relationship) some of our downs have been because of my immaturity. I have struggled and made great efforts to mature and put myself in his shoes, and we both have made a lot of improvements in our relationship and no longer fight over stupid little things, but I still feel like there we have a long way to go to perfect the relationship. One of our biggest differences is the difference in our temperament. I am an on-top-of-things, no procrastinating, blunt, let-talk-about-it-now sort of girl, and he's mellow, mull-it-over, take-his-time sort of guy. It is often frustrating because he would sometimes become really gloomy or sad, and I would have no idea why because he showed no indication before whatsoever and doesn't want to talk about what is plaguing him when I do ask.\n\nYesterday he picked me up from work and said we were going to dinner, and that he brought a formal dress for me to change into. I was very surprised, but assumed it was just a spontaneous nice little date arranged by him. After dinner we went for a walk in a nearby park, and he popped the question in a quiet corner of the park with a ring and some balloons. I was very happy and it showed, but I gently told him no, not yet, because of the above reasons and also because neither he nor I have a stable job or settled place to live yet (we still rent and dont plan on living here for the long term), and I feel like we should talk about marriage only when we both have stable jobs and income. He tried to argue that we can figure all of that out after becoming husband and wives, but I respectfully disagreed and said I don't want to rush into things. He seemed understanding at the time, and we went home and knowing that he might be bottling his emotions, prepared a bath for him and gave him a massage before we went to sleep.\n\nHe was very moody and sad when we woke up this morning, and asked me constantly if I still liked him and if I plan on having a future with him. I keep reassuring him that I do, but he didnt seem convinced and is still very emotionally unstable when we both left for work. I'm starting to think maybe I shouldn't have said no or the way I said it is too blunt/insensitive. Am I an asshole for saying no?",

I had my headphones on and was looking ahead when an old lady started pushing behind me. I quickly assumed that she wanted to get in line so I squeezed myself as close as I could to the guy in front of me. The lady looked angry and pushed past me and fell over. I suddenly realized that she didn’t want to get in the line, but past it. Before I could reach down to help her, her son shoves me back and starts yelling at me that she was asking me to move, and then some racist things at me. I was listening to music on my headphones so I didn’t hear her. Another man stopped her son from trying to hit me and tried to calm him down while helping his mother up. Eventually he and his mother left. I know the son was out of hand but I feel really bad for the old lady and feel like I should of moved for her anyways. AITA?",

      "description": "My birthday is around Christmastime and as long as I can remember, family members have always given me \"combined\" presents. This means that my brother and I basically get the same thing for Christmas and my brother gets another present for his birthday as it is in the summertime. As I am not struggling financially nor am I entitled to anything from my family, this has always been more than okay with me. \n\nHowever, my SO recently did the same thing and it has been bothering me more than I'd like to admit. When we exchanged Christmas presents this year, my SO wrote \"Merry Christmas and Happy Birthday!\" on the card. Note that I spent significantly more than my SO for the Christmas present, and my SO's present was an \"experience\" which both of us would enjoy, not just me. A few weeks later on my birthday celebrations, my SO took me out to dinner but didn't get me another gift. For my SO's birthday, I took my SO out to dinner and got a thoughtful gift. It's not that they have financial problems since I recently hooked them up with a well-paying job through family connections. \n\nCombining the two \"gift-giving occasions\" while not spending more money than they otherwise would just seems....I don't know. Slightly like a copout? Am I selfish to feel this way? I haven't said anything to my SO but I'm considering asking them not to combine the two next year...\n\nHonestly I'm pretty sure I know which side reddit will take and I already kind of feel like a spoiled/entitled brat even writing out this post, so please call me out if IATA!",

      "title": "AITA for calling out red flags with men as I see them based on my past experiences?",
      "description": "Hi y'all, I made a throwaway for this. I'm a 29F, and I would like to know am I the asshole for having high expectations and trying to communicate that before things get serious? Am I the asshole for being super sensitive to red flags that have consistently popped up from my own experience?\n\nI have been single now for three years, and boy has shit changed since I got out of my long term relationship of 7 years. Instagram and facebook were already a huge problem in my life when it came to men because my past boyfriend was a serial physical and emotional cheater, a narcissist, and a pathological liar, so he did a number on my level of trust for men.\n\nFFW to my first few \"close to a relationship\" experiences off of tinder and in person. The first guy I dated I met off of tinder, and he had basically immediately confessed that he just got out of a really toxic relationship and probably wasn't looking for anything serious. I told him that I am in a different place in my life being out of my toxic relationship for a while and I am probably looking for a relationship, so his stance affected the level of effort I was going to put into anything, especially sexually. I was as honest about this as he was with me. A couple weeks in it became very apparent that his idea of \"casual\" was a lot more like my experience of either actually being in a relationship or being friends with benefits. He was extremely confusing, he would insist on paying for my meals, going on several dates, trying to kindle a sexual relationship, be my therapist almost every day of the week, and then seemingly disappear for a week after being super consistent. He would also seemingly talk about his exes emotional instability a little too often. We eventually did have sex after a few dates, and it wasn't as though I had expected the relationship to immediately change, but he began again with the disappearing act after I had confided in him that I had a really stressful and rough week coming up. At the end of the week he finally asked me how I was doing, and I told him \"Okay, but I'm not really too jazzed about having not heard from you for a week after we had sex\" to which I got a long defensive speech about how he's been sooooo busy, and that's really unfair, and the phone goes both ways and he expected a \"modicum of reciprocity\" from me in communication...After that comment and another couple of condescending statements I couldn't help but say he was being douchey, to which he insinuated I had emotional issues, similarly to how I heard him disparaging his ex. I knew right then in my gut I had nothing to lose and said, \"Sure (insert generic white male name here), every girl you date is emotionally unstable it can't possibly be you\" which I knew would surely end it. He blocked me on everything.\n\nThe next guy I actually started to dig came from bumble. He was pretty good with the consistency of communication, I never caught wind of him liking millions of thirst posts. He bought me tacos when I was drunk, made me breakfast in the morning, and was seeming to really wax poetic about how amazing he thought I was. I really thought this might turn into a relationship so naturally, until I invited him to a party. A hot girl brushed up against me that was a roommate of my friend, and I, being the sass monster I am told her she could brush up against me any time after she apologized. Of course I was joking, but my date whispered to me \"Well, she IS attractive\" with a sheepish smile. Two minutes later he was across the table so obviously flirting with her I almost just walked out. He hadn't even complimented me yet that evening, so I jumped on that red flag and ran with it. I took him outside and recounted the exact situation to him, to which he responded \"I didn't know that was the same girl!\" as if he was shocked. There were a total of five girls at that party, and she was the only redhead. I told him he was gaslighting me, asked him if he'd ever cheated on anyone before and he said yes. I told him it was probably best we don't see eachother anymore, he seemed pretty gutted but I felt I made the right choice. Now a year later he appears to be in a happy relationship, and despite my forcibly removing him from my social media and having had nothing but a sexual relationship with him, he is now again all up in my business. Why while he has a girlfriend? I can only think of one reason, that I was correct in my lack of trust.\n\nMost recently I was pursued by a guy that I met during a summer geology course in the mountains. I thought this guy was very cute but I hadn't said a word to him the whole night at the party we had both attended. He then found me on facebook and instagram and began flooding my messages and lovebombing my photos and stories. He lived about six hours away in my hometown that I visit often, and at this time I started to notice that he had pictures of a girlfriend that did not seem to fit any sort of \"break up\" timeline, and kept note of this red flag. Although I could liken some of his flirtatious memes and messages to emotional cheating, I became certain that they broke up when he sent me some super suggestive content, which then eventually escalated to trying to solicit a nude sharing relationship. I am not exactly a prude in this regard and entertained him because a vast 95% of our conversations before and afterwords were still real conversations. He was mindblowingly consistent, hitting me up every day like a boyfriend, saying \"Goodnight Sweetie\" and \"Bisoux\" which means kisses and french when I would go to bed. He would send me cute memes of animals to brighten my day, and ask lots of questions about my life. IT got closer to a holiday that I would be coming home, and he had stated he wanted to take me out. I agreed that we should date, but as it got closer and closer to the holiday I heard nothing of planning. He was practically silent just up until I was about to leave to come home, of course he'd known he'd have to resume communication to actually see me...\n\nI noticed that during this time I was being ignored, the vast majority of his friends on instagram were girls. I noticed that during this time where I was receiving inconsistent attention and assuming he was busy, he was actively liking and commenting on suggestive photos of girls frequently, reminding me of how he pursued me. I chose not to mention this out of fear of sounding jealous and crazy, we weren't in a relationship, but I couldn't help but get the feeling that there were also girls he was messaging just like me when I was getting silence. After he expressed little interest in actually planning a meetup in town, we did actually get together to watch a movie, kiss and cuddle. Mild sexual favors were involved but nothing super serious, however I was a little annoyed because I had mentioned beforehand I just wanted to cuddle and he still tried for it anyway. He acted completely smitten, talking constantly about how good I smelled, telling me he smelled me for days after. He kept up the attention for a couple of days and then again to my surprise suddenly started to taper off, and I would see that he wasn't liking any of my things but still actively liking the stuff of plenty of other women. Childish I know but this set off fucking alarm bells to me that for my own mental health I needed to get out of there, something was telling me to look in the first place so I needed to trust that feeling. A whole day went by without a message, and then I saw him comment on and like a photo of a girl he's liked a lot of photos of before and had it. I felt crazy already, but I messaged him and I politely stated, \"Hey, I hope you're well. I just wanted to keep you updated on whats going on with me. I think it's best we don't see each other when I come into town again. I've been getting this strange feeling you're splitting your attention with me and other girls when you're not contacting me, and I've had that feeling since before we met up. I know there's no expectation of exclusivity but to me it just kind of makes me feel like maybe you like those girls more and for my own mental health I think I should stay away from that\"\n\nWell he immediately got defensive, saying \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" which isn't an apology, it's a stereotype. He then demanded that I prove to him that he had actually liked and left a thirsty comment on another girls photo (he had done it 8 minutes before -\\_-) to which I said \"Oh okay, so you're an actual asshole\" because I'm so tired of being gaslit about things boys know they did. When I sent him the photo I had seen 8 minutes earlier, he responded, \"That's just my ex.\" I don't know who in their right mind would think that its better that they frequently like sexy selfies of their ex, but neglect to like any of their work accomplishments or non-sexual posts. He spent the latter portion of the conversation trying to convince me there was no one else, he was a good guy and I was 'mischaracterizing' him, that he believed in honest and open communication and I should have told him I felt this way sooner. He kept saying because there was no expectations it didn't make sense that I would want a heads up that he liked someone better because transparency to him that meant \"exclusivity.\" He kept saying how much he liked me when we met and now, as if it wasn't red flaggy at all that he had a girlfriend when we met. By the end of the convo he all but had be saying \"Okay okay I believe you I must be crazy and PMSing or something\" because I knew I hadn't exactly been civil. When I woke up in the morning, he messaged me and regurgitated almost my exact words. \"I think we have different expectations and it's best we don't see eachother anymore\" and blocked me on everything.\n\nGranted I'm usually the one doing the blocking in these situa",

      "description": "So a bit of a backstory. My brother attempted suicide this past summer. He is battling depression and at the time drug and alcohol addiction. He went to a mental health facility and then rehab to get cleaned up and get his life back on track. This affected all of us as a family and that if something like this happens again we would keep each other posted.\n\nCut to tonight:\n\nI was at work when my brother started to message me saying that he started to cut himself again (during he addiction period he started to cut himself alot) and that he was doing it for endurance and wanted to see how much he could take. I'm starting to worry and ask him what's going and he responded with he is fucking around etc etc and the proceeds to call me laughing and as he talking there is a bit of slurring in his voice so I can tell right off the bat he was drunk( I know it's common for people to relapse) and I'm worried and pissed at the same time. He tells me that he cut his shoulder pretty deep and sent me a picture and yes it was pretty deep from the looks of it. I tell him to go to the hospital and he won't listen to me to which he says dont worry and dont tell anyone in the family because he'll \"Beat the shit\" out of me. At this point I really didnt see a choice as of everything that has happened so I called my mother and explained the situation to her and she said I did the right thing by telling her and that she will find a way to talk to him. She did talk to him and he is now pissed for what I did.\n\nSo AITA for quote on quote telling on my brother about his current situation because I personally feel an asshole for it.",

      "description": "I dated this girl in the color guard. Her and i had a pretty decent relationship but then she randomly broke up with me. I was sad for a little bit but I healed fast because the relationship didn’t last long. Then a couple weeks ago when I offered her my percussion books and a pair of drum sticks since she was thinking about doing indoor, she said she wanted to try again with me and that she was sorry for breaking up with me, and I accepted her apology and said that we could try again so long as we become better friends \n\nBut then a couple days later she completely retconned what she said by saying “I hope you realize I don’t want a relationship with you and we’re only going to be friends.” Weird flex but fine. \n\nAnd then she removed me off Snapchat and by that point i was like “whatever” so I just moved on with my life \n\nWell early this morning she requested to follow me on Instagram and I accepted because I thought she wanted to be friends again, and i was willing to forgive her. So I requested to follow her back and she accepted as well \n\nSo i was liking her posts when I came across something. The post description said “don’t you just love it when your ex is trying to get with your best friend” i was furious for several reasons. 1) I wasn’t trying to get with her best friend, in fact I NEVER hit her up first, she’s always the one to text me first. 2) it wasn’t posted long before she followed me(only by a few hours) so obviously she was still thinking this. So I posted on my story that what she was saying wasn’t true and that I couldn’t believe she was gonna act like that when I just want to be on good terms with her.\n\nSo later today i got a message from one of her friends responding to my story saying I need to shut the fuck up and that she’s gonna beat my ass because I talked shit about my ex. At that point I had enough, so I decided it was time to confront my ex about the situation \n\n\nShe said that she had a right to say that stuff on her instagram because I talk shit about her all the time(which isn’t true. Like I said I’ve pretty much moved on and only made some comments about her when she got brought up by my friends which is rarely) and that i was basically doing the same thing. So I explained that I didn’t really say shit about her aside from a few times and that I only posted about her on my instagram story today so I could defend myself. So she said don’t ever talk to or about me again and blocked me afterwards\n\nI feel kinda bad because I still cared about her a lot and I didn’t want to hurt her. So what do you guys think, AITA?",

      "description": "Backstory: My friend was diagnosed with an immune-system cancer about a year ago and had been through all the standard cancer treatment stuff. Just before the new year, he finished his chemo and radiation and was back to getting in shape and regrowing hair and what not. In the past, he would interject in conversations that have nothing to do with his health and talk about his cancer, mentioning it very casually and often killing the mood. We'll be talking about how hard/tough something is and he'll be like \"not as tough as chemo\". Most recently (besides what just happened) when another friend and I were talking about our career growth, he randomly mentioned how we should just live stream from a hospital and reap donations for being sick. It's been silently agreed upon with other friends that while it gets annoying, we'd be assholes to call him out on it since he was dealing with cancer/chemo/radiation/etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnter yesterday night. We were playing some video games when I ask him a question about where he wants to work next, in state or out. He answers by saying something along the lines of \"well I have to worry about surviving first and then we'll see\". For some reason I react (usually I just ignore it), and I don't say anything for the duration of the game. When I tell him I don't want to play anymore, he calls me out, knowing what he said, and questioned my friendship with him, mainly because he doesn't know if we're friends and that friends should realize that cancer is forever going to be a part of his life. I told him that he killed the mood and I didn't want to \"deal with it\". He answers with \"well I don't want to deal with cancer, but it's the reality\". I really didn't know how to answer him at that point and it just became awkward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've since apologized to him about my behavior and my lack of understanding and general ignorance of his ordeal. I figured it was for the best to just admit fault, even when I don't really think I was out of line to be upset about what happened. He's now told me he's just not going to bring it up when I'm around, but that's not really the resolution I'd hoped for. As a potentially last update to his health, he told me that there's still cancer cells apparently and that he'll likely need surgery and more chemo soon. I obviously had no idea, I figured that the cancer was in the backseat since the new year and so now I feel guilty and even worse than yesterday. So AITA?",

      "description": "My 16-years-old brother goes to school by a motorbike and it has been broken from last saturday, suddenly, it worked again on sunday early morning but i still told him to go fix it. He had the whole sunday yesterday( i got some places to be then so i told him to find a garage to fix it). I'm sure i gave him enough money to replace any part of his bike, it was even enough to replace half that bike but when he got home by sunday noon :\nMe: -yo, how is your bike now?\nHe: -I'm not sure, it wasn't fixed\nMe: -what, what wasn't fixed? \nHe: -mmmm, i went, i went but they said it may have just a futile problem and as you see, it still works, i rode it the whole morning\nMe: - rode where? \nHe: -mmmm, i was hanging out with friends\nMe:- yeah, cool, you stupid ass, what did i tell you, it's broken meaning it's broken and cannot fix itself, you can ride it now but it can be broken back at any time. Again, i'm telling you, go right this afternoon and fix it anyway or don't you dare ask my help when it is broken back. \nHe:- ok\nThen he was outside till i went to bed and go to school today morning, i didn't know if his bike was fixed and today he just texted me: \n-help me, the bike is broken again \nMe: - what, wasn't it fixed?\nHe: - actually, no, i......\nMe: - shut the hell up, you didn't listen to me, go fuck your self.\nHe: - i know, but it's raining right now and i didn't bring a raincoat, come get me home i promise i'll go fix it later\nMe: -fuck no, i don't care you stupid ass.\n So i let him walk his bike home a 6km way or if he's not stupid that much he can stop by a garage somewhere but i guess not, i don't even bring a raincoat just because he didn't see a raindrop in the morning. \nIf you wonder, in my country, 16years old kids are still at 10th grade and they go to school 6 days a week, 4 hours a day so my brother leaves school at 11am, he hasn't got home yet.\n",

But it makes me very uncomfortable when my brother is constantly screaming, swearing, banging on things, saying things like \"go fuck your mom\" or worse in the family room, sometimes even at night. You have to walk through there to basically go anywhere in the house. If anyone tries to talk to him while he's playing a game he will get angry and yell or cuss them out. He says it's rude to look over his shoulder when he is on the computer but when his screen faces out toward the room you can't really help it. He has a laptop but he always plays downstairs because he likes to use the Ethernet plug. He says the internet is too slow in his room. The wifi in my room is like 80mbps. I don't know how it could possibly be very much slower in his room based on where the routers are. I've brought this up to him and he just told me to fuck off because I don't understand games. My parents encourage his behavior because if he played in his room he would never come out of it and tell me to just ignore the yelling and don't talk to him when he plays a game. AITA for thinking if he wants to yell and scream at all hours of the day and night he should do it in his room?",

I told her that I hadn't listened to any music at all that today.  I checked my history and figured out another friend (D) was listening to music on my account.  I told K about it and said that since I was better friends with K, I would just remove account access from D's device so K could use it without getting booted off.  I then removed access to my account for D's device.\n\nFast forward to this afternoon when I woke up (I work overnights.) and I have a text from D being mad at me that I didn't just text her and ask her to stop listening to music so K could listen.  I expect K told D about this situation as they are good friends.  I didn't reply to the text message.\n\nAITA?  I used to be good friends with both K and D, but ever since D moved (still in the same town) she hasn't made much of an effort to hang out with me as much as K has.

      "description": "\nSome family drama for context. My father has ‘abandoned’ me twice. Once when I was three after an argument with my mother (they had broken up long before I was even born), and a second time when I was 14 after being in contact with him for a year (he suddenly stopped calling or texting me). \n\nMy mother happens to be dead and the last piece of contact I ever had with him was when she died. He messaged me on Facebook with a kind of generic I’m sorry for your loss that I had been receiving a lot since the loss of my mother. At the time I was only nineteen and I blocked him after these messages due to a lot of pain. He knew where I lived and I was angry that he didn’t seem to want to help me above sending a message. \n\nI still have a fairly decent relationship with a lot of my fathers family. I’m close with an aunt and I speak with some other family members through text or I give them a call now and then. \n\nSadly my father passed away recently and I only got the news the other day. To be completely honest I didn’t really feel anything (it makes me feel like a monster kind of) at hearing his passing. \n\nMy fathers wife got my number, I’m assuming from my aunt, and gave me the news. They live in the same country as me but in completely different sides. I don’t really want to travel such a long way for a funeral of someone I really didn’t know. I asked when the funeral was mostly out of politeness and my dads wife gave me the location and the date. I told her I wouldn’t be able to attend. While it’s loosely true I made the excuse that I wouldn’t be able to go because I have a child and couldn’t find someone to babysit. Along with not being completely able to afford paying for a hotel and travel. \n\nMy dads wife seemed obviously a little annoyed at this and just kind of hung up the phone quickly after I said I wouldn’t be able to come. She was polite but there was definitely resentment there. \n\nTL;DR: my father died and I don’t really want to attend his funeral as it is incredibly far from where I live and I never really knew the man anyway due to multiple instances where I was abandoned.

      "description": "Genuinely asking because I'm really not sure.\n\n\nMy husband entered a home brewing contest a year ago, and won in a category with his rendition of a smoked beer. Local commercial brewers were in attendance as judges, and one approached him to tell him how awesome his beer/recipe was, and told him he'd like to brew it with him at his Small-town Brewery and sell it. My husband was excited to try his hand at a full brewing system so he accepted.\n\n\nHe spent several days at the brewery, monitoring every step and working with the brewer to make sure the larger scale version matched the winning home brew.\n\n\nHe got invited to the brewery the day it was released, so we all drove an hour there to celebrate. It was listed on the draft list with no mention of his name, which I was a little sad about but I guess understood - their equipment, their brewery, etc.\n\n\nHusband had messaged brewer asking if he could get a single use small keg of the beer to bring home, and he said absolutely! The brewer was not there yesterday however, and when husband asked the brewer's wife about it she said no such keg had been set aside.\n\n\nSo instead she fills up the growler my husband brought with him, and charges him full-price.\n\n\nNote - I realize that it's their brewery, their rules. But the more I think about it the more I get annoyed about it. They wanted to brew his beer because it was a quality recipe, and I think maybe just one gesture of good-will like a free growler would have been nice, since they were making money off the recipe and not mentioning his name as creator and co-brewer at all.\n\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n",

      "description": "My gf recently had a huge blowout with her boss which led to her getting fired on the spot. They argued on and off for probably 6+ hours and from the sounds of it it was a very uncomfortable conversation where her boss did a lot of ranting and she felt that she couldn't get her point across. The argument was over a pretty minor communication issue at first, but it sounds like her boss brought up old issues and that overall it was a very unpleasant argument.\n\nShe had another job lined up before this fight took place so this wasn't going to mess up life plans or anything major. \n\nAfter she told me about this blowout, she kept saying that she was traumatized by this argument. Something about that wording really bothered me and I made a face when she said that and told her that a single uncomfortable argument is not traumatizing. She said that she really was traumatized and didn't know why I was downplaying her trauma. I moved passed it because she was still upset in general and I love her and didn't want to make her day worse, but it really bothered me that she said that this traumatized her. It just really rubbed me the wrong way, it's as if any unpleasant experience counts as trauma to her. I hesitate to say that my sister's death traumatized me, and she says that one fight is traumatizing? Came across as privileged.\nAITA?",

      "description": "I know, the title looks bad, and this sentence as well. For a while I didn't think I was but I am warming up to the fact that I may be an asshole. Here's the breakdown.  \n\n\n\\*Girl in relationship for two years with Ex  \n\\*Girl breaks up with Ex because he's a prick, still lives with him  \n\\*A couple months later I invite Girl over for a date  \n\\*We make some food, it's fucking awesome  \n\\*Buy a couple drinks, drink them  \n\\*It's night now, we've been watching some stuff on Netflix for a bit  \n\\*I look at her, she looks at me, we kiss  \n\\*She talks about how she can't believe I am kissing her, she's been waiting for this moment for a long time (even when her and Ex were together, but she didn't act on it because she was in a relationship)  \n\\*Things escalate, I ask if I can grab her breasts, she says that's fine, we take off bra after a funny exchange  \n\\*I ask to go down on her and she's like naa  \n\\*I don't  \n\\*We sleep, wake up, kiss some, all rad  \n\\*Hang out all day, make out a good bit  \n\\*Night comes, ask to go down on her, I explain that I'm not gonna try to have sex with her until we talk about it  \n\\*She says yes  \n\\*Next day she leaves  \n\n\nUh, so basically for the next two weekends she'd come over, always talking about how she can't wait till the weekend, she comes over, lots of going down and making food and watching Netflix. There was a time she reached her hand into my pants and I was like woah na, we need to be careful. I still haven't gotten to the store to get any protection. She understands.  \n\n\nSomething happens and it creates a situation where her and I would be around her ex. She explains that we can't act like we've been spending time together around him because he could ruin her life.  \n\n\nMakes sense, but it threw me off so I kind of just told her that I'm not willing to be played with like that, so she gets REALLY angry.  \n\n\nTold my friends that we had only kissed. She also said that I offered to go down on her the first weekend but she refused. Got angry at me for trying to make things move too fast.  \n\n\nMy friends get angry at me for advancing things so fast while knowing she had recently exited a long relationship.  \n\n\nI can understand the whole moving fast thing for sure. And I initially felt justified because I asked if she wanted anything I'd done and she'd tell me yes, when she said no I didn't, I didn't continually ask her. (I guess I did the next night, is that too much? I don't know). The fact that she was in my apartment without a way to drive herself out could possibly have been a concern, keep in mind we are in a place we are both very familiar with. It also bothers me that she came over two more times after that and was totally comfortable around me, talking to me about the future or our relationship and how things would progress.  \n\n\nHowever, I am mostly just wondering if I'm in the wrong here with the consent. IF she did feel that I was trying to move things too fast, then she would have said no on the second night, surely? Or if she was afraid to do that, maybe just tell me, or even another option, just not come over next time.   \n\n\nAny help here would be insanely helpful, I'm starting to lose sleep now and it's a real issue.

She’s adorable but still young so she can get distracted easily but I am owner training her with the help of a professional. Now she is for both psychiatric and internal health reasons but when I first got her I would tell people her name. I didn’t see the harm in it and she was working on socialization something that is really important for service doggos. \n\nNow that she is older the fun socialization part ended and I am working on the hard part with her. The training. But I have people when I am taking her to class (am in college) or the grocery store (in my state SDiT has the same rights as SDs) and call her name. She is really good at refocusing her attention back on me but I have had medical episodes in that she hasn’t caught because some idiot kept whistling and calling her name. \n\nNow I have began to sort of call her a nickname. For example say her name is Lola (not her actual name) I say her name is Lucy or Lily, something close to her actual name but not her actual name. \n\nPeople actually get upset at me saying they have a right to either pet her or call her by her name because they miss their dog at home. Or they were having a bad day. Or I don’t have to be such a bitch about it. Or i even had one guy call me a retard when he found out it was for psychiatric purposes. \n\nAnyways AITA because I change my dog’s name slightly to avoid people distracting her when she’s working?

      "description": "I was at a KFC/Taco Bell and it was exceptionally busy, there was a line out the door. While I was waiting in line apparently an elderly man grabbed an order that was not his and left. Around the same time that it was my turn to order the elderly man's order came to the counter. A guy grabbed it and took maybe two steps away from the counter, looked into the bag, and brought it back to the counter. He then very loudly and a bit aggressive threw it down and said \"That old man took my order.\" I thought he was being unreasonable since the worker's didn't do anything wrong and I am sure they would just make the guys order again. Anyway, in the very small verbal spat one of the employees took the old mans food and threw it in the trash behind the counter. This trash can was admittedly very gross, it was overflowing and had sauce, and who knows what else caked all over it. However, the food was in a paperboard box and that box was in a plastic bag.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo while placing my order I say \"I'll take that food that was just thrown out\". The cashier turns and looks at what I am pointing at and she gives me a look of pure discuss, and says \"That is in the trash.\" I reply telling her it is fine, it is in a bag. We go back and forth a little, so I turn to the line behind me which can clearly hear the discussion, for a little backup. I look at the general crowd and say \"It's in a bag, there is nothing wrong with it, right?\". The people in the line looked completely mortified. One person actually said \"nasty!\". To keep it short, I went back and forth a little until this guy in the crowed said \"Just fucking order and move over\". I gave up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile standing to the side waiting for my food everyone was looking at me with pure hate. I couldn't believe it, I think it is crazy to completely waste perfectly good food. AITAH?    ",

      "description": "Hi, I made a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I'm a girl, I'm 19 years old. And there's this other girl...she's just fantastic. She's so much fun to be around, she's cute, she's funny, we have so much in common. And I think she might like me back a little. The only problem is...she's fifteen. Well, she's about to turn sixteen in just a month or two, whereas I just turned nineteen, so it's only a three year difference, but...I'm still worried to ask her out. I've heard so much about older people manipulating younger people and I don't want to be like that. So would I be the asshole if I asked her out knowing we have a bit of an age difference?",

      "description": "I'm off work for a week and thought it would be a great chance to go and visit some family. I hopped on the charter bus and as soon as I did, I heard an eruption of laughter coming from the back of the bus. I look up only to find the girl who used to bully me in high school, staring directly at me, and laughing to her friend. I haven't seen this person in 5 years, I've made no contact, I've blocked her on all social media platforms. This was a bit jarring but I took my seat and put my earphones in. \n\nI made a post on social media about the incident, along the lines of \"I havent seen you in 5 years, why are you carrying on with the same shit\". \nI thought my friends would find the situation funny. \n\nOne of the other girls she used to bully had commented, asking who she was. I reminded her and we had a laugh at the bullies expense. I made a remark about her not changing since High school.\n\nThis girl, was horrible, inside and out. I had a month of school because my Uncle, who I was very close to, passed away and I didn't know how to deal with it. It was around that time I was diagnosed with GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder). I went back to school somewhat confident that I could manage my emotions. I was wrong. I walked into class, got my stuff out and was ready to get back into it. The bully knew of my  situation because her family knew my family. She kept asking me how my holiday was, she kept making fun of me for being weak, I removed myself from the sitaution, and subsequently had a panic attack in the bathroom. \n\nLong story short: I hopped on a bus on my way to visit family. A girl who used to bully me, laughed right in my face and talked shit about me to her friend. I made a facebook post about \"people not changing\" to which one of the other people this girl bullied commented on the post. We made fun of her and how she used to treat people. \nAm I the Asshole?",

My old lady had to have a few vertebrae fused, and is still having issues.  On top of that, she has MS so everything is exponentially worse.  Regardless, she won a settlement for a good deal of money.  She did good things with the money, i.e. paid some of the mortgage, paid off bills.  But she kept extra money to have fun with.  When those things were taken care of, she started spending the extra coin on frivolous crap, and would always ask if I wanted anything or where I wanted to eat.  I always told her I didn't want anything and we should hold on to the money until we needed it.  Surely I could've used a drone, a new gaming PC, a different vehicle, and a vacation, but I never asked for anything.  \n\nHere we are, years later, living paycheck to paycheck as I transition careers because I didn't give any input on \"her money.\"  I  want to tell her, \"I told you so.\"  But I realise that the money was extra and we shouldn't have relied on it anyway.   I really want to rub it in her face for not being responsible, while she has a hot tub, a new motorcycle and car, amongst other things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My wife got a lot of money, I wanted to save it, she spent it.

      "description": "So this happened last night. For starters, I (18 f) have never went on a date. I had pretty strict parents in high school and do to cultural reasons I wasn’t allowed to date until college. So I meet this guy on a dating app who seems super nice. We texted for a while and then he ends up asked me out on a date for valentine’s day. Again, HE made the move to ask me on that specific day. I was super excited and happily said yes. \n\nWe go to the same college so we decided on him coming over to watch a movie. Naturally I assumed that that might progress to other things so my roommate agreed to leave to a friend’s dorm (I’ve done this for many times).  I told him my roommate would be leaving at a certain time, but she leaves about 30 mins earlier. I text him saying he can come over. 30 mins pass, then an hour passes, and he never replies. Finally, I get frustrated and tell him to please let me know if he’s even coming and then he says that he’s so sorry that but he’s got this assignment due that night that he has to submit and he’ll let me know because tonight might not work. I was pissed to say the least. I just feel like he didn’t even think about the time I had to put in. My roommate and I deep cleaned my room, she had to leave, and obviously I had to shave, do my hair, and other things to prepare. He couldn’t have met me know earlier that it might not work?\n\n My first ever date on Valentine’s day never bothers to tell me he probably is too busy beforehand until I’m literally sitting there waiting for him and texting him. I responded pretty shortly with an “okay” and he texted back that he’s sorry. I don’t think he thinks that he’s in the wrong here and I’m pretty sure that he wants to reschedule. But am I the asshole for not wanting to give him another chance?",

Literally every single time since my niece has been born, I make a point to go visit them. Whether its sticking around for the weekend or just popping by. I've never missed them on a single visit. \n\nThis last time I went, I was only in town for 48 hours. I spent most of my time working and catching up with co-workers...the day I was flying out, I stopped by my sisters to say hi to everybody and played with the baby for about an hour before leaving to catch my flight.\n\nAbout an hour later I got a long winded text from my sister saying that they felt like I flaked on them, and that I never prioritize hanging out with them. She seemed to be mad that I only spent an hour with them even though I was only in town for 2 days and working most of the time. I said I do prioritize them and honestly had no clue wtf she was talking about. \n\nThen she brought up a story about how my brother-in-laws brother (who also lives in Seattle) will spend all day with them, help take care of the baby, and is a better uncle yada-yada. I said sorry but honestly I don't live in the same city and I literally see them every time. Maybe she was offended that I only spent an hour with them on this last trip and that I didn't cancel work-related events to or stay in town longer or something. But honestly I always find time for them when I'm in town. I don't have kids of my own so I have no idea how I could help with a baby. \n\n\n ",

      "description": "So a few months ago it was my birthday and I've never fancied big parties, instead we went on a bit of a pub crawl around my hometown.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBit of context; when my girlfriend and I go out, she normally gets drunk first, and it's become a bit of a running joke among our friends that I never get drunk because I tend to sober up when looking after her (she doesn't get dangerously drunk or anything, we're not hardcore drinkers, more socially).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, we're at a pub for my birthday, about 3-4 pints in and the joke comes up again. One of my friends states she's going to try to get me drunk for my birthday and places an order. Few minutes later a barman brings over a tray of the following:\n\n\\- 20x shots of Sourz (a very sickly spirit of around 15%ABV)\n\n\\- 3x Jaegerbombs\n\n\\- 4x pint-size vodka/Red Bulls\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea was to have a drink for every year of my life, and while it wasn't an expensive pub at all, I'd imagine it probably came to around £30/$45. For more context the friend barely drinks; on very rare occasions will she have a pint and seems to be rather unaware of how much the average person can actually drink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a bit shocked by this, but it seemed like a nice birthday surprise at first so I give it a go. I get through around 12-13 of the shots, one of the Jaegers and 2 of the vodkas before I give up and say I've had too much, considering as we were moving onto a couple of pubs afterwards and meeting others, I wanted to space the drinks out a bit. \n\nI thought it'd be rather rude to just leave the rest so I offered them around, see if anyone wants any, to which she took a fair bit of offense. I said that there's only 3 outcomes; I drink it all and get dangerously drunk - I leave the rest and it gets thrown away - I offer it around and everyone enjoys it. She still took offense and said it was only for me and not for anyone else, and while an argument didn't flare up it brought a bit of a downer on the rest of the evening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I wouldn't normally worry too much, but a couple of weeks ago she brought it up again. We had all gone for a pint after work and I think I made a comment on the price of beer in London, to which point she said something like \"at least it's not as expensive as those drinks I bought you that you couldn't finish\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the arsehole for sharing it out rather than leaving it to just get thrown down the sink? Common sense says no, but this seems to be something she hasn't let go, and I'm struggling to find a way to convey to her that I appreciate the gesture but it was a dangerous amount of booze. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Backstory- My mom was a single mother and she worked a lot. I have a brother with Downs Syndrome who is 4 years older than me. I grew up being forced to take care of him, feeding him, changing his diapers from when I was 7 years old, watching him all day at the expense of me having a life. My mom also showed very little affection, belittled me and physically and verbally abused me at home and in front of people. In high school, I of course turned to drugs and got in a lot of trouble with the purpose being I wanted to get sent away. I didn’t care if it was the psych ward or juvie I just didn’t want to take care of my brother any more. \n\nFast forward- I have 4 year old twins. Whenever we spend time with her she constantly tries to gain their favor and undermine me. Always has tons of candy and when I say ok that’s enough candy. She will make a face at them and say things like, “your mommy is not fun, grandma will let you have candy, tell mommy to leave.” So of course I never leave them alone with her because I’m afraid of what she will say or do to them when I’m not around. My twins are a handful and I’m very gentle with them and their feelings (4 is a big testing the limits age). \nAt this point they’ve picked up my feelings for her even though she puts on the sweet grandma mask really well and most of the time they ignore her and basically use her for her candy. I tell them to answer her questions and greet her but they won’t until she has something to give them. \nSo now we rarely visit her (she also has a lot of pets and my son is allergic) but also I am\nAlways angry around her and it affects my kids. So basically I’ve ruined their relationship with her. They have another set of grandparents that they adore and have a healthy relationship with so I feel like their not deprived but I also feel bad because I know she knows I choose to keep them away and she feels guilty about my childhood. So AITA here?",

I’ve played video games my whole life, and playing them with friends is the best way I consider to experience them.\n\nI’ve had a friend group since leaving HS of about 8 people, and we play Smash very frequently, which is probably my best game as I’ve sunk many hours into it.\n\nTo be realistic, no one in this group is at my skill level, and this results in maybe one game in a few hours going to one of my other friends while I’m playing.\n\nDuring play, I try to push the wins off as either luck or downplay the win entirely. I don’t try to be cocky, and look towards what my friends do right when they play me instead of what they do wrong.\n\nRecently, my friends have been getting more frustrated when playing me, making snide comments about why I’m allowed to play, and even an extreme situation of feeling unsafe at the anger one of my best friends in that group has shown when losing certain matchups.\n\nI can understand that it’s frustrating to lose, but when I’ve tried to sandbag in the past, it either doesn’t work or I get called out for it. I’m getting really bitter about the situation that I might consider not playing smash with them when the time comes.\n\nI’ve recently tried to think about it from their point of view, that maybe me downplaying my wins might make me look like I’m bragging.

      "description": "I'm a man in my early 30s and I live in a duplex. I have the top portion and my landlord lives in the bottom portion. We each have a roommate since our portions of the duplex have two bedrooms. Plus, my landlord is in the process of paying off this duplex so it's his to own.\n\nMy roommate is rarely here because he works 6 days a week and his girlfriend lives closer to his place of employment. I've mentioned to him that he doesn't need to stay and pay rent for my sake, but he said he has his reasons for keeping his spot at the duplex...but I digress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy landlord has an 18 year old son who goes to college in another state. At the end of December (last year) he asked if it was okay if his son stayed in my roommate's room while he was on Winter break. I said it was fine because I knew the other option was for his son to sleep on his old, crusty couch. \n\nBy the end of Winter break, I regretted my decision but we made it through without any issues. Mostly because I bit my tongue while his son used my place as his own; bringing friends over, eating my food, leaving lights on, not locking the door when he leaves, etc.\n\nFast forward to today when I was reminded that his son's Spring semester is ending in May. My landlord just acted as if it was fine to let me know when he'd be back in our state to live with me for the 3 months of Summer break. \n\nI can't do that! I'm introverted and picky about my roommates as it is, but throw in all the issues I mentioned above and it's a big problem for me. Especially since it's my landlord's 18-year-old son! That alone should be enough of a reason that I'm not okay with this arrangement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue is that the rent is cheaper than anywhere else around me (by a significant amount) and I lucked out with my current roommate never being here. So it's almost like I pay half the rent for an apartment all to myself.\n\nI certainly don't know how to approach this situation since my landlord basically owns the place and it's his son, but I feel like it's stepping over so many of my personal boundaries. I stress out too much while the kid is staying here. I stress out too much just *thinking* about him staying here in a little over a month.\n\nBy the way, the son doesn't contribute to rent or bills while staying here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA if I tell my landlord that his son can't live with me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We have 2 kids, 8yo &amp; 4yo. \n\nIn the marriage I have always been the breadwinner &amp; financially supported the family. We’ve faced many challenges over the years including him cheating on me before we were married, and then me feeling as though he’s not doing enough to help me support our family. He’s been in and out of work &amp; has been a weed smoker which he sees nothing wrong with but I’ve felt he’s used as a crux not to face issues in our marriage. In response to my needing support from him he feels I am nagging him and being impatient &amp; treating him poorly by not recognizing his contributions to the relationship. I had an emotional affair which ended but I have been unable to really shake the feeling of actually have someone who made me feel cared about even just emotionally because I I get so little of it in the marriage. My husband &amp; I talked about it a lot and it usually ends on him yelling at me calling me a cheater. He has involved our families both of whom are religious and made it clear that they don’t want us to end the marriage. He threw me under the bus revealing to our parents that I had an affair after which my mother said a prayer to seek forgiveness for my sins. I revealed to my mom that there was an incident between my husband and I where he had sex with me while I was unconscious &amp; drunk, which made me feel completely violated. It hasn’t changed her mind and the most hurtful thing she said to me is that she hopes my husband gets the kids because that’s what I deserve. She is furious with me that she feels I am not open to her advice about staying in the marriage but I am frustrated that nobody is listening to me &amp; I am feeling attacked by everybody that is close to me, especially my husband who I feel is using my parents to guilt trip me into staying married while refusing to acknowledge any of his issues, only mine. We went to couples counseling &amp; the therapist said we were beyond repair. He refused to go complaining about cost. I pay for his health insurance and he doesn’t go consistently. I have gone alone to therapy for about 6 months now to try and address my own issues. It’s helped but it’s still a difficult situation.\n\nI have a lawyer &amp; I’ve filed the initial divorce paperwork. He has been difficult and is threatening to demand alimony and custody of the kids. He is living in the house which I am paying for the mortgage and bills for in full. I am in a hotel at the moment while my kids are with my sister for spring break as I don’t want the conflict because I am just spent &amp; tired. I am just tired. I often catch myself thinking, am I the crazy one? I’m hurting my children. My parents are so upset with me. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "To keep things vague because there's a high change some of you here may recognize me if you live in my county, but I've worked part-time as a high school track &amp; field coach (esp with the women's teams). I've worked there for about 7 years now and have a great record of bringing the girls teams to regionals and even state every year. I'm essentially the only competent coach left in the school system due to budget cuts in the past 5 years. My wife and I retired roughly 10 years ago and we've got a good nest egg so salary has never been a big deal for me with this job. I'm just happy to coach and see new kids win awards, scholarships, college acceptances based on what I've helped them accomplish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, a few months ago a big scandal broke out. One of the girls I coached (15 at the time) accused me of hitting on her. Basically what had happened was that she had her high school boyfriend saved in her phone under my name (first and last) because her parents were strict about dating. She somehow thought it would be better if they saw MY name texting her instead of some boy. Well, the parents obviously saw explicit messages at one point and put two and two together. I was suddenly under investigation and that's when the rumors started spreading like wildfire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole thing only took about a week to clear up in the end (the phone numbers didn't match after all) and the girl came clean pretty quickly too once the police started interviewing her. However by this time all of the parents had coalesced to have me \"investigated\" because in their words they couldn't take any risks and I had to understand being a father of 3 myself. I was heartbroken and humiliated. My wife was outraged and she's still angry now just thinking about it. We considered selling our house and moving cities. Even though my name was cleared several times over, the humiliation, the rumors, everything, still affects me I can't lie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now the parents are back and they're begging me to stay. They said I'm the only coach with enough experience to bring their girls to championships and they've apologized nonstop. However, my wife and I are leaning towards moving for peace of mind. My wife is more resolute and she thinks good riddance, but honestly I feel torn up inside. I know I am doing a huge disservice to the school and the teams by leaving and I know the program has a high chance of being cut within the next 3 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other girls (not the one that accused me) have been on my side this entire time. They've helped the police and gave useful tips and even told their parents to hold their tongue when facts were still coming out. I am eaten up by guilt with the thought of leaving them, but I don't know how I could stay and work like I used to after this whole ordeal. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm 31 (F), and in the past I've had several very serious relationships, a few of them involved people on the spectrum with Aspergers.\n\nTo make several very long stories short, none of these relationships worked out. In the beginning they felt like a perfect fitting puzzle piece, only to have it become emotionally parasitic or completely disconnected after a few months to a year. Friendships with people with Aspergers or on the spectrum fell apart as well. There was constantly a lack of communication and understanding of my emotions towards a situation and why I felt a certain way (upset, sad, etc) because of something they did (verbally abusing me, taking advantage, ignoring me or snapping at me, refusing to talk about problems, etc).\n\nAs an emotionally vulnerable/sensitive person who needs those lines of communication open and understood to be happy in any kind of relationship (romantic or not), AITA for now refusing to date anyone (and hesitant to even befriend) someone on the spectrum? I realize these handful of people don't act for those on the spectrum as a whole, but I'd like to avoid any future pain or repeats of those awful experiences considering main characteristics of it are things I cannot stand or want to be subjected to.",

I only have two neighbors since I am on a corner lot, and neither have fences for their dogs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth of them tie out their dogs four \\*hours\\* at a time, right next to my fence. And when I say right next to my fence, I mean their dogs can literally stick their nose on my fence. One of my neighbors I have a good relationship with, and she doesn't mind the barking. I don't either, but my back neighbors do. For the first two years, every time I heard my dogs bark, I would call them right back inside (they only stay out for up to ten minutes at a time without me, just long enough to go to the bathroom) and let them back out once their dog was up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I am tired of constantly checking to see if their dog is out and waiting for hours for them to let him back in. Or standing guard at that corner to make sure they don't bark. They could tie him up far enough away that he wouldn't bark at my dogs, or get on my fence, but they choose not to. It just seems ridiculous that I have spent so much money so that I wouldn't have to go outside when it is cold/wet/raining/snowing and now I can't because they leave their dog tied up so much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't talk to them because they are violent, and it is a drug house.

I could mostly take the weight comments and never retailate even if it did overwhelm me at times to the point where I had to go home crying.\n\nAnyways. So one day she made fun of me, calling me the standard fat insults like \"Ms Piggy\" and \"fat fucking cow\" which was normal at the time. But then she went my mom, calling my mother a fat whore and that she's a prostitute. Now I love my mom to death so I just snapped.\n\n\"Maybe you should look in the fucking mirror then you little dirty bitch, that's why your mother is an ugly ass crackhead.\" Is what I said to her.\n\nShe stared at me shocked for a few seconds and ran away crying. A few other kids heard what I said and told the teacher on me, then I got sent to the office.\n\nInfo: The principal never let me tell her what the girl said to me, I got suspended while the girl got off Scott free, I tried telling the teachers about her before this happened *multiple times* and nothing was ever done, I was also 11 at the time and the girl was 12\n\nTl;dr: AITA for retailiating at a girl for insulting my mom?",

But because of work we didn't really speak for 2 years now, because we didn't have time at all. And roughly around that timespan, I and my girlfriend found each other. We both never really had anyone except the one friend who really shined. Te problem now, she lived in a little town, where her chances in getting work were little to zero. So she moved in with me. We were there for each other, while no one else would. Now I finally got the courage, after thinking \"its been too long, he doesn't care about me anymore\", to message him. I work on retail, so saturdays off are gods gift. This week is such a case, and this morning I messaged him, after a little smalltalk I asked him if he had time this weekend, so I finally could see him again. But now I needed to tell her, and she got sad, because she looked forward to a weekend with me, without me being away. To make matters worse, she began crying because she doesn't have any friends, and she will be alone saturday and half of sunday, only my father and my little sister are there to keep her company. I feel miserable for going to a friend, reminding her she has none who aren't 4 hours away. Please help...I'm lost\n(And sorry for the long text.)",

      "description": "Hi,\n\nDue to a short-notice relocation I recently rented a storage unit at a local storage business.\n\nBefore I rented the unit I called the hotline and asked about storing motorcycles in an indoor unit. I was given the OK, but I figured this was bogus so I went ahead and visited in person. Turns out you cannot store motorcycles in an indoor unit (due to gas and other fluids) as I expected so I explained to the employee that I will be storing ~6 bikes in said unit for a short amount of time as I am expecting to relocate within 2-4 weeks. She said no problem, you just need an outside unit.\n\nI paid my fees, paid for locks and insurance, and went on my day. I rode one motorcycle to the storage unit, placed it inside, and locked up.\n\nYesterday I had some free time so I rode bike #2 to the storage unit. I live in IL so the weather is pretty cold at the moment (27-31 degrees yesterday,) but the roads were clear enough to make the short trek.\n\nI arrive at the unit and find that the main parking lot is plowed, as expected in illinois, but 20 feet from the gate leading to the outdoor units and the ENTIRE ground of the area housing area has a 1\"+ thick layer of solid ice on it. Not snow - actual ICE. I put my feet down and slowly eased the bike over to the ice to confirm - yep ice. It was so slippery that I got stuck because my feet would just slip when I tried to push so I spent ~5 minutes rocking my bike back and forth to inch it off of the ice.\n\nI took a picture of the ice on the ground, just to have it, went home and called the storage company. I explained to them that I cannot store my things and that I cannot remove my motorcycle so I would like a refund as well as ideas and maybe help removing my bike from their facility since it isn't well-maintained. I was told that they cannot give me a refund and they won't help me remove my bike - so they are essentially holding it hostage. I explained to them that if I attempt to move the bike out that the ice would potentially cause a spill causing damage to my bike or an injury to me. \n\nAm I the asshole for expecting some sort of help for being mislead? I feel as if they should do a better job of maintaining the facility and that I've been sold a service I cannot use. If I were an employee there I would explain to customers that the rear area is NOT plowed - especially considering that I specifically spoke to them about storing motorcycles there. I asked the employee about it and even she agreed that they sold me a service that they're not providing, yet still refused a refund or any sort of help what-so-ever.\n\nNow I'm just hoping once the snow dies down I'll be able to find a way to get there and remove my bike. If the ice on the ground were just snow I would be fine.",

      "title": "AITA for taking on private lesson students?",
      "description": "Ok so this story is about figure skating, the most overcomplicated sport of all time, so bear with me.\n\nI’ve coached at this ice rink for 2.5 years, but I’ve been helping teach since I was 12, and have been a fully licenced coach since I was 16. All in all about 11 years experience. I’m 22, this is relevant to the story.\n\nFigure skating has a program for new skaters called Learn to Skate, which has detailed levels from standing on skates up to preparation for an axle (the hardest single jump). I usually teach the middle-ish levels (Forward and backward crossovers, the first jump you learn, ect.) and I’m generally well liked. Most of the students I have compliment me, or at least are happy to have me as their teacher in a new session. I’m described as “high energy, enthusiastic, and positive.”\n\nI’m also pretty damn good at it. My students show steady improvement, I’m knowledgeable enough that I can answer parent questions, and I’m cited quite a bit as the reason families join the figure skating club (a big cash gain for the rink).\n\nNow more complicated garbage. At my rink, a request for private lessons should go directly to the figure skating director, my boss, and they’ll be doled out across all the coaches. That rule is ignored if the requester asks for a specific coach. I got requested quite a bit and had a full private lesson docket long before most of the other coaches. This made people mad.\n\nEnter Mary. Mary has been at the rink for much longer than me. She teaches higher level private lesson students, but also does Learn to Skate (LTS) because, ya kno, money. She really doesn’t care about it, it’s just a way for her to possibly recruit private lessons. A few of her students swear by her, and have been with her for 10+ years. She skated at a higher level than me, and basically started the Learn to Skate. While I don’t like her, she has managed to coach for a long time.\n\nMary is also mean. So mean. Parents ask for refunds because she made their kids cry. Cause she’s MEAN. Our boss thinks she drove away more that 25 people single handedly. She complains about the way we teach her granddaughter (who is getting free lessons by the by). She complains to the president of the rink about petty things. She says that I’m inexperienced, lazy, and don’t deserve any of the business I have. While I’ll be the first to say I 100% have flaws as a coach (I’m a little too nice, parents walk all over me, I’m not good at disciplining an unruly class, I’m too liberal with complements, ect.), I work hard and am really professional.\n\nMy boss has been cutting back on Mary’s LTS lessons, instead giving the time to me and a 2 other coaches, age 24 and 26. She responded with “This is my livelihood, how could you give my time to kids who still get money from their parents?” (For the record, my parents pay my tuition and that’s it. The other two coaches haven’t gotten money from their parents for years.) The other young coaches and I work hard to make the program run smoothly, do setup and takedown, tie skates, talk to parents, the stuff the director doesn’t have time to do.\n\nBack to private lessons. Mary is angry I have so many students. She tried to stealthily scalp one of the kids, but my boss nipped that in the bud. She said that I have less experience and that the lessons should be given out equally, regardless of request. Any parent that asked me about private lessons got the same exact script (“I think \\[KID\\] would really benefit from private lessons! Check with \\[Director\\] and she’ll set you up with a coach. You can request any coach and we’ll do our best to pair you up”). I don’t want someone to feel obligated to have me as their coach, some kids don’t like my style and that’s totally fair!\n\nShe is constantly snide and dismissive of my tequiqies. She minimizes the work I do, and just makes me feel like garbage. I’m already a twitchy ball of stress (I have another part time job + full time student) and feeling like my coworkers hate me sucks. Plus I’m a little worried she’ll do actual damage to my reputation, seeing as she’s telling other people what a bad coach I am.\n\nMaybe she deserves more lessons than me? She’s more experienced and has more medals to her name, but I never see any of her students improve. I don’t know it’s hard to gauge stuff like that. I am the lowest on the totem pole, maybe I should be last in line for lessons?\n\nTL;DR: Other coach is mad I make more money than her because I have more students. I’m really hurt and want to know it it’s justified.",

      "description": "Thank you for any and all advice! I’ve felt guilty about this for years and wanted to know if my feelings are justified or not. \n\nFor background, my mother passed away when I was eight years old and my siblings and I were raised by my dad alone until I was in college, when he married again. Everything is great with my immediate family, we all get along well and I love spending time with them. That being said, a few times a year, we still make the long trip out to see my mother’s side of the family, who I’ve always had a hard time being around. \n\nTo start with, they are very religious and not very tolerant of any other beliefs outside their own. They’re also quite vocal about every opinion they have, even the ones that make a few people in my immediate family, including myself, feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. \n\nI try to chalk a lot of that up to the fact that they aren’t very educated and most of the older generation didn’t have the opportunities that people of my generation have, but all my aunts, uncles, and cousins seem to be the same way and for the most part, have squandered any opportunities given to them. That being said, my grandparents make constant excuses for them and enable them to keep making poor choices and blaming everyone but themselves. \n\nDespite graduating college and having a fairly successful career my early 20s, they talk about me behind my back as if I were some kind of cautionary tale. I’m not too interested in having kids and I don’t plan on getting married any time soon, and those are the only two things they ask me about in terms of my life. I live with my partner of over three years, and although he’s as kind as can be towards them, he also feels uncomfortable being around them for many of the same reasons.\n\nDespite the fact that my brother and I are the only ones related to them, my whole family makes the 12 hour journey twice a year to see them, and no one has a good time. I live all the way across the country and have to give up much needed money in order to take time off at work. It doesn’t make sense to me to use the few weeks of time I have with any of my family on the side that makes me feel uncomfortable out of a misplaced sense of guilt. \n\n Am I the Asshole? \n",

She’s gone AWOL since then, we’ve met up about 5 times over the last year which is very different to how often we used to see each other. On a frequent basis she said she was too busy to meet up but then got upset when me and 3rd friend (I’ll call her Tina) met up without her. \nOver the last few months I’ve messaged suggesting things to do a few times and she’s not responded. Correction, she responded to other parts of the message but ignored the bits about meeting up. I admit I got fed up and have been feeling lonely recently and stressed with work so I privately messaged Tina and asked if she wanted to go to dinner. We went and had a lovely time. Tina and Sally were talking about something when Tina mentioned meeting me. Sally has gone off on one saying we’re having secret meetings without her and then messaged me asking why am I purposefully excluding her.  \nShe’s now turned around saying she already feels isolated and she thought we’d stick by her as she starts a family (Sally is not pregnant), and force her to hang round with us not just abandon her and meet up without her.\nMy opinion is friendship is a 2 way street, she says she feels isolated but ignores messages and isn’t available to meet.

      "description": "Around the middle of last year, my brother proposed to his girlfriend of 3 years. She said yes and they’re getting married this summer (yay I’m excited for them :D). Over the holidays I went to visit them (they live in a different state than I do) and we went bridesmaid dress shopping. Naturally, we were talking about the wedding and the topic of hair and makeup for me and his fiancée’s two sisters came up. \n\nHere’s the background for why I want to dye my hair. I have dyed my hair before when I was in middle school but once I got to high school, I joined an activity in which dying our hair is prohibited. You can think of it as a sort of dance group but we are all meant to look natural so that one person does not distract from the effect of the group. Anyways, it is my last year of high school, so after my last performance I can finally dye my hair again. I made plans with a few friends of mine to get our hair dyed the day we graduate. We have literally been talking about this and anticipating it for years. I planned to have my hair dyed a bluish silver but keeping my black roots. \n\nWhen I brought up that I was going to have my hair dyed to my brother and his fiancée they immediately shut it down. They told me absolutely not and if I wanted to do it I had to wait until after. They didn’t even allow me to explain my reasoning and each time I bring it up they ignore me. I am especially annoyed because one of his fiancée’s sisters has continually dyed her hair since before I met her and they have not told her that she needed to stop dying her hair for their wedding. Even if they did I doubt she would stop. My choice of hair color also does not conflict with my dress as it is a pastel blue. \n\nCurrently, I have decided that I will just keep my natural hair color as per their wishes because it is a once in a lifetime event that I don’t want to ruin. I just wonder if I’m in the wrong here for wanting to get my hair dyed with my friends :(",

I was kinda into him but wanted to play out being friends before i ruined it by trying to date him. \n\nFlash forward about three months. I tell Andrew I like him and he tells me it’s bad timing as he just started seeing someone\nI say that’s okay we can still be friends, we talk it out he says that sounds great, and that he values my friendship too much to want to end it over this minor thing. I take his word for it and feel relieved. \n\nA couple weeks go by and he’s not really responding to my texts very often. He’s never been great at this so i don’t think much of it, but then I ask him to hang out and it turns into a “ next week” back and forth because he’s busy and I’m busy. But I start to get the feeling that it’s more that he is blowing me off.  \nI think the last text i sent was about a month ago and he never responded.  Specifically, i joked that i thought he may have died, as it took him four days to respond to some funny video or tweet or something. subconsciously i think it was a little passive aggressive. \n\nI  was really hurt as i wanted to be friends, and I made a few jokes about him being a “dud” to my best friend who introduced us, and  expressed that I was really annoyed.  I probably said somethings that were a little too far about him being boring or having poor taste, mostly from my own hurt ego, Anyway, in all of this and asking my best friend if It would be silly to text Andrew and tell him that i was somewhat hurt, said best friend accused me of being a jerk and “bashing” his other friend, telling me that he doesn’t owe me anything and that I’m being an ass. \n\nAITA for thinking i deserve an apology or explanation for ending our friendship / AITA for talking about him that way to my best friend who is also his good friend?

      "description": "To clarify, it's my house and she hasn't signed any form of lease agreement. \nA couple weeks ago I confronted her, saying I had been getting the vibe that she doesn't like me anymore. She admitted she had been feeling that way. I was hurt but didn't press her further, telling myself she must have just felt like that for a while and gotten over it, or she would have moved out. \nLast night she told me over Facebook messenger, while we were both home in our separate bedrooms, that she was moving out. I told her to take as long as she needed. Then I took the opportunity to ask her to clarify what she meant when she said she didn't like me. Her response was that she had felt like that since she moved in which was the beginning of January. \nI thought about that all night and then I told her this morning that I wanted her to leave immediately. I said she could take as long as she needed to get her stuff out but I don't want to share my house with someone who doesn't like me for one second longer. I feel betrayed by this whole experience and it's been really affecting me. \nI just got out of an abusive relationship and I'm grieving cos my brother died in December. I'm upset that she stayed in my space this whole time, making me feel awful and uncomfortable, not being upfront about issues and letting them fester. \nShe's now trying to say she only meant she didn't like living with me. But that's not how she put it the three other times we spoke about it. I think she's just trying to back out of it. She is calling me unreasonable for not letting her stay tonight, even as I'm telling her this is testing my mental health. I have been hospitalised 7 times in the last 6 years and am now stable and this is jeopardizing that. To which she responded, this is stressing me too and it's not all about you. She has no mental health issues. \nSo am I the asshole for demanding that she leave my space immediately? ",

      "description": "Ive been with my (24m) current partner (23f) for close to 6 years now and I love her to pieces, shes extremely sweet and bubbly. Kindest person Ive ever met.  \n  \nTo get to the point, one drawback she has is she loves spending time with me, all the time, and never gets bored or tired of it. Which Ive always found very sweet and endearing. However Ive always been quite introverted and I really need my space to myself from time to time to recharge.  \n  \nRecently she moved in with me, I was hesitant but the living situations for both her and my other flatmate lined up so I figured we'd give it a shot, and now she has her own room in the house.  \n  \nHowever, she never uses her room she pays rent for, so shes always in my room on my bed wanting to chat or watching netflix on her laptop which causes constant noise of Vampire Diaries and the like. If I leave the room to go to the kitchen she follows me, if Im typing on my computer she asks me what im typing about. Just constantly shes in my space and wanting to be involved with what im doing, and I appreciate and love the place where thats coming from. But the constant state of having someone In my space was starting to really drive me mad and I was growing resentful and agitated more and more.  \n  \nSo I told her one day when she asked me why I seemed grumpy with her. I explained in as gentle terms as I could that every now and then I need my own room to myself and need space from others. That it isnt to do with her, its to do with me and how I am as a person. I need me time. She didn't take it very well as this concept is very foreign to her, shes very extroverted and loves my company 24/7.  \n  \nShes taken it personally, and despite my telling her that she could be anyone and Id still need my time to myself shes insisting that im getting sick of HER as apposed to getting sick of not having MY OWN SPACE.  \n  \nAITA?",

      "description": "Im 22, he's 25. My boyfriend is a porn ADDICT. Last time we had internet I paid the $100 every month and he hardly left the bathroom, it began to affect his mood (made him depressed, angry, withdrawn and extremely draining to be around) affect his job and he hardly touched me for about 6 months. It fully destroyed our relationship. I tried to leave him, he admitted that he needs help and we had to get rid of the internet. I had to pay $400 to cancel it and I hardly ever used it. Before anyone asks, we had sex every day, sometimes twice, that was never the problem (until he got on the porn) \n\nSo, 5 months later and I'm planning to enroll for some online courses to further my education. I need internet. My boyfriend says he can not be around internet because he will go right back to it and I'll leave him (which is true).\n\nWould I be an asshole if I got internet and hid the password from him? It seems wrong and controlling, and it feels like I would be treating him like a child. I know that he would agree to this immediately but I still feel like I would be a huge asshole for essentially acting like his mom. Especially since he works full time like me and pays equal rent.\n\nI feel like I'm choosing between ruining my relationship or sacrificing my future. \n\nGive it to me straight, am I an asshole?\n\nTldr: porn addict bf doesn't want internet but I need it for school. Should I keep the password from him? ",

      "title": "AITA for telling my mum, that I don't care about my brothers coma?",
      "description": "(I'm on mobile so sorry in advance)\n\nI must add a bit of an backstory so you might understand my reason:\nMe and my older brother are 1 1/2 years apart, He was 18 back then, I was 17.\nWe had a good relationship as kids but as time passed, we grew apart. He turned out to be - what I consider - bad. He smoked, he took marihuana regulary and dealed some. He finished a lower class school with mediocre grades (in germany we have different kind of schools, some for smart kids, others for regular kids etc.).\nHe didnt have any hobbies and basically was nothing but a financial burden for our mum who can't work full time due to a illness. \nThe only thing he has going is that he is one of the most caring people out there. I've tried concincing him to do a social job with children but he refused (payment too bad).\n\nMe on the other hand:\nI was in 12th grade, with above average grades, I was in the last year of school and was planning on going to university to study and become a teacher. I was working part time to support my mum and our little sister (my parents are divorced) financially. I was/still am also doing work with a youth group that works with children that have problems (aggression, bullying ect.) and teach them things about religion and teamwork. \nI however had lost my girlfriend to suicide in 2017, which my brother just joked about. I told him plenty of times to stop it, which he didnt. \"what are you gonna do, fight me?\" sound familiar?\nHowever one of my bad traits is that I don't tell people when something annoys me, until I get reeeeally fed up and just burst out (it happens in the story)\n\nWe had this mutual agreement not to interfere with each other. He often broke it, asking me for money, which I always had, because I didnt spend it, I instead kept it on my bank account. whenever I said no, our mum would tell me I'm being selfish, then give my brother money from her own pocket. I always put the same amount of money back into her pocket from my own money, as I didnt want her to have no money. (as I'm typing this he literally asked \"mum, you got money?\"...ironic...)\nHe once even convinced my mum to tell her my bank account code, which she did. He took 300€ out of my account ,which I never saw again. \nAll these things oviously made me angry and I told my mum. she said it'll be okay. she always said that.\n\nNow to the story:\n\nI had final exams during this time and everyone in my family knew it. I studied a lot and felt fairly confident. I hadn't seen my brother in two days, not that that was something unusual, I never knew/cared where he was. it was the night before my first exam when my mum called me and showed me a picture of my brother jn the hospital. Wires everywhere, plugged to a maschine, huge scar across his skull (his hair was cut away as well). She told me that he was in a coma and that his chances are bad, 30 at max, and even if, he's gonna be handicapped afterwards. I sat down in my room and prayed to god (this was during the time I was converting to Christianity), crying he should save him. I didnt sleep that night and the exam went as expected. I fucked it up as I couldn't concentrate. during this time, my mum used all her money to go see my brother as he was in a hospital very far away. I always prepared food for her for when she came back around 1 am and asked how he's doing. Always prepared with bad news. with this family situation I went into the other two exams, which ended up pretty good. One week later my brother woke up from the coma all well, not handicapped.  However during his coma I was unable to visit him, as I had a lot going on and work as well. My family called me names \"betrayer\" and \"asshole\" for not visiting him. I told them I don't see the point in seeing what is basically a living corpse. Yes that was an asshole move not gonna lie. \nI never had a good relationship with my family. They tease me a lot, calling me a loner for staying in my room \"all day\" amongst other things as well. I always laughed it off. \nOne day, my brother was fresh out of rehab, we were kn the family table, the whole family. The usual conversations started. I didn't participate as I am the \"black sheep\" in the family. I just sat there and ate, sometimes people made jokes about me and I just smiled it off as usual. My brother was appearantly still a master at these jokes. I was fed up. I got up and put my food in the trash and walked out. My mother followed me and asked whats wrong. We got into an arguement.\n\"They're only jokes, [name].\"\nI didnt care if they were just jokes. I thought my mother understood as she had to take care od 4 siblings as a kid and didnt have much of a childhood herself (I had a great one, don't get me wrong, I love my mum more than anyone else).\nI told her that I regret, praying to god that night. That I wouldn't have cared if he died, as he was only a burden to us and especially me. She god angry (of course) and slapped me and told me to never say those things anymore. \nI should add that during those two weeks, our family had no financial problem and I had enough money to buy some clothes for my little sister and me after a long time (from my own money).\nAs soon as my brother was back, a lot of money went missing from my mums pocket (~50€)\nNext week 200€ went missing from my bank account. We all knew who it was. \nMy brother often didnt go to appointments with the doctors, regarding his head/coma. He simply \"didn't want to\". He always found excuses to not go to work.  I understood for the first half year. The doctors said everything was alright after 3 months. he kept skipping however. He's now back in line and got his life sort of sorted out, still smoking/taking drugs however. I haven't seen my money nor rent he pays to our mum (he works part time now). I've talked about him having to pay rent (or at least help somehow) to my mum recently and she got angry immediately, saying I'm selfish and I just want his room. (for contect: I've had to share a room all my life. I now took the backroom with no windows. it's big enough and I'm more than happy.)\nI told her that I just find it unfair how he's being treated lightly, whilst I'm supposed to take all the hits. after she called me selfish again I was done and said that I still haven't changed my mind, that I would still be happy, if god or whatever hadn't saved him. I voluntarily left my own house and am sleeping at a friends house right now.\n\nAITA for saying that I wouldn't care if he had died or now\nNote: I did not say \"I wish he died\", just that we would've been better off.\n\nI don't blame anyone for thinking I'm the asshole, ngl.",

      "description": "This past Valentine's Day, I was conversing with my boyfriend, and we ended up on the topic of this super gross old stalker that I had. (Super romantic, right?) I detailed how this person threatened me, stalked me and a friend, and hit me. After telling this story, my boyfriend went very quiet and I asked him what was wrong. He said, \"I was just wondering what kind of stories you're going to tell people about me after we break up...\"\n\nI asked him to elaborate and asked if he thought that I was just making up this experience to trash talk some random guy, and if he thought the same when I shared personal details about my past abusive relationships, and he didn't feel comfortable continuing.\n\nWe walked home in silence.\n\nFinally, today, I confronted him about it and told him how much it hurt me that he didn't believe and trust me, and for insinuating that I would slander him. He sent me this:\n\n\"I admitted a vulnerable fear to you on Valentine's day, and you are responding to that in exactly how I feared you would, but side stepping my feelings and making it about \"my opinion of you\". My fear is valid. Not sorry.\nI'm both surprised and not.\"\n\nI feel extremely hurt, and already told him that he's allowed to feel his emotions, but projecting this insecurity onto me (when I've never given him any reason to) is completely unfair and that I'm also allowed to be upset by it. I feel like he owes me an apology, but I'd really like another view on the matter!\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So, this is not exactly about me, is about my best friend.\nShe, let's call her May, has been in a relationship with a guy (let's call him Josh) for over a year. The first few months went pretty well, they seemed pretty happy and everything went cool. After the third month, he started behaving really strange. Josh started not caring about her feelings and ignoring her when May had depressive episode.\nMay told him that she went through a lot of shit and needed him to help her out, bc she wouldn't be able to go through this without anyone (she moved from his hometown, so she didn't had any friends there). And there is went shit went wild.\nJosh started saying that her depressive episodes wasn't his fault, and that was something she had to deal with. Josh told her that he was also in love with his ex, who died a year before they started, and talking a lot of shit about May. She didn't like that too much, but she was still in love with him.\nThis had gone for over 10 months, and they broke up and went together again like 9 times. So, as time went by, May realized that he was a dick, and started hitting back. She told John that he could go fuck his ex, that maybe his favourite movie was Corpse Bride, telling him to shut the fuck up when he started complaining about her crying bc of stress.\nAs today, they are still together, bc she isn't able to let him go, as she is still in love with him.\nAlso, it seems like Josh cheated on May, several times. One day, he started making out with his bestfriend, a 6,1 guy. They both are straight... Or that's what they say.\nAnyways, the question is:\nIs she the asshole for fucking around with him, making the death of his ex into a joke, telling him that he's not a musician bc he only can play indie (that's more like an inside joke, so he still doesn't get it yet) and telling him that he's a fucking weeb bc he says that his favourite serie is Evangelion (understandable) and that serie had done more for him than anyone in this world (fucking weeb).\nOr\nIs he the asshole for playing with her feelings, not caring enough about her having depressive episodes, trying to make her jealous with his death ex, and manipulating her constantly?",

      "description": "So we've been married for just shy of 3 years now and my husband is really getting on my case to have a baby. To give you readers a sense of \"getting on my case\" I mean like asking for a deadline on when to start trying and questinioning me on going back to school because that means that babies might be delayed.\n\nI've stated that I do want to have kids but not right this second. My main concern is that there is A LOT in instability and uncertainty in our lives right now. His job has taken us to live in Europe for 3 years and in a year we will be moving again, but we don't know where to yet. I want to wait until there's a little more certainty in life and to know that I'm going to have a good support system in place because he travels for work for long periods of time. His response to all of that is \"I don't want to wait anymore\" and \"people do this all the time\" and \"it's not fair to him\" \n\nNow I understand that there is no perfect time to have babies however I'm a firm believer that if your gut is telling you that it's not a good time, then it's not a good time\n\nSo am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Using a throw away account.\n\nMy friend and I, let’s name him Mike, have been friends for roughly 6 years. I consider him a best friend, and vice versa. He’s been like a brother to me. He’s had a persistent crush on this girl, we’ll call her Aleena, and has gone above and beyond for her and has done things such as drive 45 minutes a few cities over just to drop off some food for her, drove her everywhere, spent nearly thousands of dollars on her- the list goes on. The only problem was, she made it clear that she wasn’t interested in a serious relationship, yet continued to take advantage of Mike’s kindness. Fast forward to today, they decided to give a relationship a try, which I was not very fond of. I decided to give Aleena another try despite her taking advantage of Mike, but recently Mike reached out to me for help. Mike looked through her phone and found out she was still in contact with many other men, whose messages she was deleting to hide from Mike. He had also told me their daily arguments have escalated into physical arguments, with things being thrown and minor  scratches and bruises here and there from Aleena during these arguments. Aleena also does this thing where she constantly asks Mike to “pay her back” for things Mike does not even recall ever asking for- but he pays her back anyways. She’s even gone as far as asking for $200 which Mike willfully gave. The list goes on for Aleena’s abusive behavior. I’ve told Mike countless times to leave the relationship and seek help through therapy. Mike insists he’s not happy yet can’t let go. Mike has now been constantly coming to me to talk, but asks for no advice and only an ear to listen. Although I want to help mike, he refuses to listen to me or even allow me to help him. It’s gotten to the point where I want to completely cut him off from my life because he has absolutely no respect for himself to leave. WIBTA?",

      "description": "Throwaway account for the usual reasons.\n\nMy friend is having a big birthday party at the end of the month. We go to the same university, but she's an undergrad, and I'm a law student. Because of that difference, my finals start a week before hers do. Her party is before her finals, but during mine.\n\nShe changed the date of the party at one point, and it was initially going to be a week earlier, so before my finals would start. I told her I could go to her party then. After the change, which she reminded us about in a group chat, I texted her outside the chat to tell her that I wasn't sure if I could make it with the change in date. I didn't outright cancel, but said that I needed to focus more on my studying, so I'd try to stop by her house when everyone is there, but I can't go to the other end of the city for the second part of her party.\n\nShe tried to use the fact that I went out with some friends from class after our first final, but that was because that was the hardest (and first ever in law school) final of the semester, and we had almost a full week until our next exam (they pity the 1Ls at my school). I only stayed out for maybe half an hour (didn't even drink) before I went home to study more. \n\nShe's also mad because I'm going to another mutual friend's birthday party tonight. I have homework, but I've already told my friend I was leaving super early (after arriving late) to do it. Basically a \"hi, happy birthday, here's your present, bye\" situation.\n\nShe told me other people my age (she's a few years older than me) didn't have the same problem, and got mad when I pointed out that the other people my age either graduated and weren't in grad school (therefore no finals) or were undergrads (therefore a later start to their finals). She hasn't talked to me since that conversation.\n\nI can understand where she's coming from and to an extent why she's upset, but I really think studying for finals is way more important than a birthday party.

      "description": "I work/run a pub in a small town. I was working a Saturday night when four guys in their 20’s came in and ordered 4 pints of red stripe. They went out for a cigarette then I saw them walking to the train station, which is opposite the pub with their glasses. Usually I might not have bothered because it was busy, but we only had 8 of the branded glasses which my regulars love. So I headed over with plastic(compostable) glasses for them to put their pints in. However as I was asking them, nicely, they hopped on the train and proceed to taunt me. I asked more sternly and one of them necked their drink and handed me the glass but another one threw their pint on me. This pissed me off quite a bit so I held the door open, preventing the train from leaving and called the conductor over to ask for help. He told me to stop holding the train up and let them stay on the train while they all continued to give me the finger. \n\nI think the conductor was a spineless person that easily could have kicked them off the train as I’m certain they didn’t have tickets.

I dress how I want, usually jeans and a edgy jumper with one of the bands I like, nothing that would outwardly tell people I identify as a woman.\n\nThis was mainly due to the fact that I was really nervous to be out in public and show who I truly am, but I wanted to change that recently so I got some more feminine clothing - a bra, female shaped shirts, etc. Just to try and make myself more comfortable in public and prove to myself that no one actually cares what someone wears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yesterday, after one of my Computer Science classes, I was walking back to my dorm with a friend and he just blatently told me that 'I didn't look good with the feminine clothing and it makes him uncomfortable', I got kinda angry at this point and snapped at him, saying something along the lines of \"It doesn't affect you directly\" and \"I just wanted to be more comfortable with myself\". Now he's pissed at me, and not talking to me at all. Some of my other friends have heard what happened and have opted to his side, probably because he altered what I said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like IATA just because I could have settled the matter better than instantly getting pissy at him, and just talked to him civilly about why I wanted to wear things like this.",

She is a single mum and could very well lose her job because of this, but on the other hand is an utter thunderc\\*nt.  \n\n\nAITA for not telling her the CEO has given the green light?",

My GF also has some issues with dyslexia and ADD. \n\nMy GF works in customer service, is a high school graduate, and deals with numbers daily. Lately we have been having an increasing amount of arguments stemming apparently from me nit picking her about several things.\n\nThough I see these things as something she should know, she feels different, and usually responds in an aggressive way (yelling at me).\n\nOne of the biggest issues is that she can’t seem to do simple math without a calculator or hand counting. And by simple math I mean adding and subtracting numbers UNDER TEN!\n\nWhen I told her this is defiantly something she should be able to do, she called me an A$$ and said she “just can’t learn it!”\n\nThere is a lot more to this but the jist of it is here.\n\nSo AITA?",

Well we beat it once on normal and towards the end he kept complaining that I was getting more drops than him. We decided it must be because I was P2 and we switched to do my storyline as P1 in hard mode till we maxed our characters. I still get more drops and at this point he thinks that I get rarer drops more often than he does. He is also pissed that my attack is at 434k and his is at 320k and wants his attack to match mine. He told me he hated it when I attacked too many things so I stopped killing as many things as I was (I have been using a continuous beam to kill things while he has a sword with limited distance) and purposefully aimed by beams away from him to cover his back. At one point he kept complaining that I was getting better drops because I killed do much so I just set the controller down so he kills everything (and by his guestimation gets more drops). Now hes upset that I am not playing and still getting better drops while just letting my character follow his. Am I the asshole?",

Long story short is they really wanted to hold and pet my lizard. And I get it, shes cute and kids like lizards, but I say no because shes skittish and small. They look disappointed and carry on going to the basement with my sister, I carry on doing things in my room where the lizard is. Almost 10 minutes later my sister comes up to me and demands I give her my lizard to play with her friends. My sister is many years younger than me and not careful at all, so I said no, because I didn't want anything to happen to her. She immediately gets super angry and tries to take the lizard, but I scoop her up and put her safely inside my hoodie, telling my sister to back off. \n\nLess than an hour later the friends leave, and my sister comes back emotionally crying and screaming at me for ruining her and her friends day by not letting them play with the lizard.\n\nAITA for not letting some kids play with my small lizard?",

This is my first post on here and I’m on mobile.\n\nA bit of background: Me and my friends have recently talked about “being ourselves” meaning we stop trying to appeal to each other and just do you. I’m actually cool with that idea, except “myself” is a hollow shell with depression who can barely string together a coherent sentence.\n\nI have been suffering from depression for a long time, at this point the time doesn’t really matter. I’ve tried everything to stop it but nothing works so I’ve just lived with it. Since I was depressed, I’ve thought negatively about myself, which caused me to avoid having friends for most of my life. And because of that, I haven’t really been able to work on my language skills so my performance in a real conversation is not the greatest (even though I was born in America, so English is my first language). I’ve had trust issues as the rare occasions I have had friends they all double-crossed me to humiliate me. Anyways, back to the more pressing issue.\n\nMy current friends are great people. I enjoy spending time with them and even though I don’t say a whole lot, I know they enjoy my company. I usually am able to suppress my depression while hanging out with them, and am doing better with handling it ever since I met them. Anyways, we have recently talked about being more true to ourselves when it comes to how we act and to just be you with each other. I know, it’s pretty dumb, but I’m actually interested. But the only problem is that I’m worried that by being myself, everyone else will be miserable with my fragile mind and unstable emotions.\n\nSo, I’ve taken to the great strangers on the internet to ask this: WIBTA if I followed through and was myself around my friends, even if it made them all miserable around me?",

My Fiance was out of work for a while and so I covered their part of groceries and utilities while they found another job. Not a big deal, that's what you do for love.  They've recently got a new job, and used their first paycheck (only spanning three days) to pay for the water bill. \n \nOur college puts on a yearly drag show to benefit local LGBT shelters, and we go every year. I can't attend this year because of work. I hear through the grapevine that they got 50 dollars worth of one's out from savings to tip the performers (and therefore the charity) with. I'm a little upset by this, as they've skipped out on the last three or four grocery runs, and I feel that they could put their money to better use on our tight budget. I try to bring this up to them, and even suggest that they only bring 20.\n\nThey told me that it's for a good cause, only a once year event, and they already had the money out of savings, so they didn't know what I wanted them to do. I responded by telling them that they're an adult and I can't control how they spend their money, but I feel that it could be better used. They said they didn't see how the conversation could have a positive outcome and that's how it ended. \n\nOverall it just left a sour taste in my mouth. I love them with all my heart. Am I the asshole here? \n\nTL;DR: My fiance who was recently unemployed and unable to help pay for groceries pulled money out of savings to donate to a charity show. ",

      "description": "I worked part time at a fun center (local arcade sorta thing) and the things I've seen there are honestly worrying to me. I have since been fired because I have been repeatedly \"tired\" from football. This was a few months ago and I have since been job searching.\n\nThe problems arose on the 3rd day of the job. I was training with another co worker (who got fired 2 weeks later) and we were tasked with cleaning the womans rest room. I shit you not there was blood smeared and caked across the stall walls. The box where they disposed of tampons looked as if it had never been cleaned. \n\nNo big deal. We just cleaned it and moved on, horrified. \n\n2nd issue was the dog. The owner has a dog. The dog just roams around the property and does what she pleases. The dog has repeatedly bitten my hands when cleaning and just petting her. But the kicker here is that the dog would walk into the kitchen. I feel like animals in the kitchen besides the dead one that we cook would be a health code violation. This dog was crazy.\n\n3rd problem with his business is there was mold in the hot fudge and on the walls. I get on the walls. It was moist. It's fine to clean it. But in the hot fudge?!!! He just scooped it out and said keep working!\n\n4th and final problem. Whilst gathering the golfballs in the back of the fun center I noticed a neat under the metal cover. After further investigation I say a little mouse chilling and hiding from me. I didnt say anything. I just assumed he knew.\n\nOther info\nI was the longest employee working\nI had to deal with  uncles perverting daughter's\nI didnt get any breaks\nI got a raise but then got my hours cut back\nI only worked with my boss, even when days were busy.\n\nSo I ask you reddit.

      "description": "Sorry for formatting, on mobile. First and foremost, my brother (20) is on the autism spectrum. He doesn’t understand boundaries, societal customs, or (significantly here) monetary value (meaning that just because our dad can afford to get him a 99 cent song doesn’t mean it’s affordable to spend $60 on a video game). He also has been cross dressing since I was a teenager and he was a preteen. He likes to wear women’s clothing alone in his bedroom, and women’s underwear whenever he feels like it. I (23) have no issue with this. I’d take him to a store if he wanted, help him try stuff on. I thought he was done stealing my belongings like he had for years when I told him I’d give him anything I wasn’t using and anything that wasn’t underwear he could try on if he wanted to, as long as I was with him. Cultures all around the world fascinate me and I love their traditional clothing. A few years ago, before moving out, I saved up $400 to buy a kimono I’d been wanting. I worked for it for months, and had a professional show me how to wear it properly. It’s silk, and it’s gorgeous. I left it in my closet at my dad’s so it wouldn’t get damaged when I moved out. I visited recently and knocked on his bedroom door to greet him. Now his cat lives in his room and he never cleans. It reeks of pee and poop and has litter all over the floor. And there was my kimono, lying on the floor. The obi (sash) was by the litter box. I almost screamed from horror. I asked for it back, completely freaked out, my voice higher than normal and told him it was unacceptable, and my dad helped me stash it in my room. My brother was upset I was upset and I wanted to scream at him. My dad insisted he didn’t understand any of it. I know he doesn’t and he can’t help that. But my kimono reeks of cat pee and poop. It’s covered in litter. It’s stained. I want him to use his first paycheck whenever he gets a job to pay for it to be dry cleaned. My dad said that was fine. AITA for that and for my reaction? ",

      "description": "For the peeps who use imperial: the person was doing 31-37mph in a 55mph zone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome context: I live in Australia and was night driving down a rural-ish road, where there is only one lane each way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I do understand the 90km/h is a speed *limit*. However, when someone does 30-40, it becomes a bit of a danger. Hear me out.; If I'm driving behind this person, and another person is approaching from behind, they can't really see that I'm not going the speed limit, let alone 30-40 below. They will start off slowing approaching me, but as they start getting nearer (say 100m, around 330ft) they'll realise they're actually approaching quite rapidly, and slam on they breaks. But what if the person behind me wasn't paying attention? Or anyone in the line that started to build up behind us? Remember, it's night time, the road isn't lit, and there's not much room for distance perception.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the the person was not a learning or an inexperienced driver as they didn't have L or P plates (learner/provisional for non-aussies. L plates for first 1 year of driving P's for the second). Maybe they were just a timid driver. But why not take an alternate route? There's another road that heads in the same direction and ends up in the same place, but has a lower speed limit (80km/h, 50mph), and much less traffic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey did eventually pull over (after about 4km, 2.5 miles) and the long line behind them could overtake.  Aside from the fact that it took me a whole extra 10 minutes to get home, what they did was also unsafe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, I do understand that what I did was probably illegal and I was being a bully, but all I wanted to do was get home after a long day. I just wanted to eat, shower, and sleep. So, am I an asshole, given the circumstance?",

      "description": " First, I’d like to apologize for any mistakes, English is not my first language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground information: I’m a transgender man. I met some LGBT-friendly people I got close with during my first year of university and everything was going pretty well between us. I introduced them to a guy in our course I befriended later on. They all liked him and he was a really cool guy, inviting us to his place to study and play D&amp;D, supporting when some of us came out of the closet… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn September, we were all chatting on our group chat about random stuff until the guy started posting memes and making transphobic jokes I did not like at all. I called him out, reminding him that was not okay. He apologized and everyone acted like nothing happened. Two days later, same problem. I called him out again, and he apologized again. I was starting to get annoyed with him as he continued to do that every week.\n\nAt some point in mid-October I got really mad and told him to shut up when he was making another “joke” (irl this time), then stopped talking to him at all. I left the group chat but kept talking to the others during class and by messages, but they seemed to grow distant, to the point they stopped talking to me.\n\nNow we’re in February and no one from the group had talked to me since. They act like I have the plague or something, not saying hello or responding when I try to interact for homework and avoiding sitting next to me during class. The only interaction we had since happened yesterday, when a girl from the group throw to my face the signing sheet during class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one hand, my relatives told me it was my fault for not being tolerant and that I only got what I deserved. On the other, two close friends agreed they acted like children and that it’s good riddance.\n\nI’m now wondering, am I the asshole here? Was I really intolerant by telling him to shut up? Did I really get what I deserved?",

      "description": "In 7th grade there was this kid (let's call him G) that I had two periods with every semester (3 if you count recess, but I don't since I spent the majority of 7th grade recess in the library playing computer games). G and I made a couple jokes together, occasionally talked if we were next to each other or worked on a group project, etc. He has his friend group, I have mine. We only saw each other at school, and I didn't have access to a phone or social media, so we never texted or messaged each other. \n\nFast forward to 8th grade, and we talked even less because 1. we only had two periods together the entire year(again, 3 if you count recess, but that year I actually went outside) and 2. I made friends with other people, and I preferred to talk/ hang out with them more at school. On the last semester, I had G in my 3rd period class where a group of students created booklets showing off our favorite moments of the year. G said something along the lines of \"PenultimateKetechup, we're best buds, right?\" and I responded by saying \"Sorry, I actually don't consider you a friend.\" He proceeded by sarcastically saying \"Wow PenultimateKetechup, I can't believe you'd do something like this\". I thought that would be the end, but of course it wasn't. He'd tell other people in the class how we were super close last year, and then this year I ended up ditching him, phrasing it like we had a full fledged friendship, only for me to end up ignoring him. He did that for the remainder of the school year, and then it was summer vacation. This year, I don't have any classes with him, but everytime I see him in the hallways, he stares straight at me like I did something terrible. Did I actually do something wrong, and who's the asshole?",

      "description": "I’m am a 20 year old student who also works part time. My grandma on my Dad’s side is divorced and lives alone, but seems to have a pretty good social life (Bowls, language classes ect). I don’t have this problem with the other grandparents, but they’re all married. \n\nBasically every time I talk to her, she will ask for me to come over, go to a movie ect, and most the time I don’t have the backbone to say no (From my calendar, I’ve gone out with her every break since starting university, although she also asks during the semester). When I do have the guts to say I’m busy or just don’t feel like it, I’ll usually get responses like “Don’t you want to spend time with me”, “I thought we were close” or even “Don’t you love me anymore”. \n\nThe thing is, it’s not really an enjoyable experience for either of us. I’m admittedly not the most socially savvy person, but I feel we don’t have anything in common, and last time I tried to bring up something that she would be interested in (a friend of hers who I didn’t know she had fallen out with - My dad told me later), she asked why I was asking... So we’re meant to be “close” but can’t even have a normal conversation or be honest with each other?\n\nHonestly, I’d just prefer to see her with the whole family, as I feel it gets too intense when one-on-one. Does this make me a bad person? Or should I just suck it up and continue to go out with her every university break due to family obligation? (Which to be fair is twice a year, however I’ve already gone out with her when the break started mid Nov and now she’s asking again).",

      "description": "Our granddaughter’s Birthday is this weekend and my stepdaughter is planning a big party. We received invitations a month ago and confirmed we were coming. We usually stay with them or our other daughter. We got a call last night that we would need to find other arrangements because our son-in-law’s parents are staying with them and their mother is staying with the other daughter. Immediately I feel like the ugly step child. We at perfectly capable of getting our own place which is what my husband did for 3 days (2 nights). I don’t want to hang out that long with his ex. (We don’t get along after we took custody of the kids because her bf was abusing them). Anyway my husband says we either go the entire weekend or stay home. ",

Am I being an unreasonable asshole?\n\nHere is the text exchange:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Hi M, Please drive up and down our driveway more slowly.  The girls are regularly going up and down.  H saw them just now have to run to get out of the way and it made her very uncomfortable.  Thanks. P. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM: Hi P.  I'm happy to drive slower but I did review the video from my dashcam and saying that the kids had to run to get out of the way is not accurate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Thanks, M.  Re the dash cam - I did not see what happened.  R felt scared enough to run up the driveway away from the car.  What you did not acknowledge was that the girls felt scared and H too.  The dash cam may tell you that they did not HAVE to run to get out of the way, but it does not tell you the emotional impact of your car coming up the drive faster than we drive and they felt scared enough to run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM: Of course my text didn't acknowledge that because I cannot acknowledge what I don't know.  You did not say that they were scared.  Instead, your text was unnecessarily accusatory and you've admitted that you don't know what happened.  That is why I responded the way that I did.  I request that in the future you refrain from making accusations when you don't know the facts.  To get me to drive slower just needs a request.  Indeed, I already drive slower on your driveway that I do elsewhere and now I know that you would like me to go even slower, which I will do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Which text had accusations?  My first or second?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM: When you say that they 'had to run to get out of the way'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: What am I accusing you of?  The presence of your car made R feel scared and run.  To get out of the way.  That's what H saw.  If I had said you were driving at dangerous speed or put them in danger I would consider either of those an accusation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Very Long, TLDR at bottom \n\nLast week I (26) took my son (3) to the library with my girlfriend. Everything was fine at first, dropped off the books and toys and headed to the kids section. However as we are looking for books my son decided he would rather run around the library and be chased by me. This is cute normally but I have anxiety and him being loud in the library was killing me and I tried to redirect him back to the books so we could pick some. He was having none of this. He starts screaming bloody murder.\n\nAt this point I decide I'll try and calm him down, but doesn't work, so I took him out of the library kicking and screaming, I was telling him he needed to use his inside voice the whole time. But he kept screening for \"Froggy\" the toy we were gonna get before the meltdown. \nI set him in the car so he can scream it out and me and my girlfriend stand by the car hoping he will calm down. No luck. So we instead wait for him to relax and then go to the park instead where him being loud is okay.\nWe get to the park and have a great time for an hour and a half, but when I get back to the car my mother (who I live with) has been calling me non-stop. She's saying the cops are there and looking for me. \n\nSo we get home and talk to the cop who is nice enough but says that someone reported my car cause they believed I was kidnapping my son. They heard him calling for \"mommy\" (see aforementioned \"Froggy\". ) And that my girlfriend who was with me didn't seem like his mom, which... Fine but she has dark hair just like me and my son so idk. \n\nAfter explaining things to the cops I go inside. Only to be greeted by my Mother yelling at me that I must have done something to cause all this and that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree (talking about my father). My girlfriend backs me up on nothing happened other then me trying to remove screaming son from public. \n\nThis was all a week ago and I thought it was done with.\nBut tonight my mother brought it up again, and told me that \"every time the cops are called here your stepfather has to report it to his work\". Now I took offense to this, naturally as I felt I was being blamed for the actions of someone else. I explained again how my Gf was there and had also said there was nothing we did wrong. But this just set her off more, she started yelling about how I can't allow the cops to get involved cause I'm putting my stepdad's job at risk. This naturally devolved into a good fashioned family shit fest. And now I'm being told I need to move out. \n\nTLDR: I was accused of kidnapping my son for not letting him throw a fit in the library. I explain to police and try to explain to my mother (who I live with) but instead I am getting blamed for having police involved and told I'm endangering my step dad's job. Now I have to move out.",

      "description": "Bit of backstory: \n\nI am 19F, ex is 20M. We went to the same university last year after having started dating senior year of HS. I had decided to go to [school A] before my ex did. At the time, yes, we were crazy about each other. By the end of the year we were broken up, he had withdrawn from school A and so had I. He moved away with his parents, and I moved back in with mine but about 5 hours away. Up until then we had been in the same city pretty much nonstop. \n\nI have been considering going to a baking school near me for about 6 months, after I finish this school year. It’s a great baking school and an equally great culinary school [school B], and my ex’s passion is cooking. He asked me a few months ago if I was still considering going to the baking school and I told him I was just focused on my current classes and getting my associates. You could say my interest in baking is as of pretty recently, but I’ve been working in a bakery and loving it. I’m pretty unsure of what I want to do long term and I think I’d enjoy baking so I want to go to this school, but now I hear that he has enrolled for the semester before me. \n\nHe’s told me that he isn’t following me to this school (but it wouldn’t be the first time) and that he is really excited and interested in the program, but I can’t commit to going if I know he will be there. It’s tough to explain but I don’t think I’ll be able to focus at all. He also said that the baking and culinary classes are totally separate, so we wouldn’t have any classes together, but it’s a really small school in the first place. There are also some times when certain groups are off campus for internships, so we’d only be on campus with one another for about 10 months total over 2 years. He said I can’t call dibs on a school, which I know, but shouldn’t he care more about how his decision would fuck my plans over?\n\nI told him that he’s being very insensitive to my needs, and while I care about him, I told him up front that he would lose me if he enrolled. I’m pretty confident he still has feelings for me even though he says he doesn’t. He said he wanted me not to change my decision to go to this school because of him, but how can I? I blocked him on everything. I just can’t believe he would pull this shit after telling me how many times he wanted me to be happy. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n",

My friend thought it was a good idea to post a picture of him and his friend H (who is incidentally my girlfriend, but I know he has no ill intentions) with a cheesy romantic caption (a joke, according to him), on the day of his 2 year anniversary with his girlfriend, M. According to him, M had agreed to the picture being posted, but I'm assuming he said nothing about the caption he would use, or the picture just being H and him awkwardly staring at each other, a picture that would definitely look wrong to a fourth person not in our friends group. Now he wonders why M won't talk properly to him, and believes she's being childish. So does my girlfriend H.\n \nBut I side with M.

We were having a couple drinks last night when she asked me if she looked any different, I asked her if she wanted an honest answer and she replied yes. I proceeded to tell her she had gained a couple pounds but that it was no big deal and she still looks great.\n     This was quickly followed by a very hurt response, and her asking me why I would say that to her. I know this is probably an age old case of 'Why the fuck would you say that?', but I am curious to know, AITA? Sorry for formatting, am on phone.",

      "title": "AITA for ending a friendship I believed was bad for me?",
      "description": "I (22F) met a girl, we’ll call her Kate two years ago at my old workplace. Kate is 27, and due to spending a lot of time in hospital as a child, did not have many friends throughout school. I enjoyed that she was a bit of a weirdo like me. I became friendly with her, until she started saying some pretty awful shit to me, she said she believes my brother (who is gay) shouldn’t be allowed to marry and he’s making a bad life choice being gay. She has said to me that I’m a slut, and a bad person for doing drugs and has called me a criminal and an alcoholic (I only smoke weed and occasionally take stimulants on special occasions, but nothing crazy). She’s also racist (instantly gets attitude to anyone who isn’t white), rude to wait staff, and will happily start arguments with strangers in public. Over the past two years I’ve tried explaining that the way she speaks to me and a lot of people isn’t okay, but I also understand that she may have missed out on certain social lessons from being in hospital during her formative years and I liked her, I wanted to be her friend. I started pulling away from the friendship when she started texting me up to 15-20 times per day, despite me asking her to understand that during work and class I can’t text her back, and that I’d rather meet up with her over the weekend instead of trying to keep up with all the texts as I don’t like being on my phone when I’m finally home from work during the week. She never acknowledged my feelings and continued to message me constantly, as well as my partner if I didn’t respond to her within an hour. I became really frustrated and told her that I need a few weeks where I won’t be able to speak to her because I’d be on teaching placement. She continued messaging my partner asking why I wasn’t replying. I had had enough, between her insulting every part of my life, insulting my family, and never understanding that I need space, I told her that I believed she should get involved in a church youth program to meet people with similar interests (as we have nothing in common) who would love to do the things she enjoys with her, because I didn’t want her feeling unwanted, I just needed some time to get through my uni semester and deal with my declining mental health. She wouldn’t let up, and I snapped. I told her I don’t want to be her friend anymore and I blocked her on everything. I feel awful, but I also feel angry that it got to this point. I’m angry at her for thinking she could be a bitch to me and expect me to take it, and I’m angry at myself for not sticking by her. It’s too far gone in my eyes though, I held onto resentment over things she would say so that I didn’t hurt her feelings, but she never once thought about my feelings. ",

      "description": "AITA?\n\nBasically my folks raised me to treat people right.  Give everyone the benefit of the doubt.  And to share.  Was born in 85 and my family owned and lived in a trailer park.  My mother also babysat full time.  I was basically in a herd of kids all of my childhood and learned to get along with everyone.\n\nI'm 33 now and a small town redneck.  We all know each other.  My favorite hobby is just trading shit around over beers with friends.  Guns, car parts, antiques, machinery, etc...  It's very common to just offer someone $400 for a gun and give them $20 a week until it's paid for.  Things like that.\n\nBut I've never been paid.  Not 1 time in my life do i remember getting paid what i was owed.  In the last 6 months alone a childhood best friend left a messy rental owing me well over $1,500.  I sold a buddy a new in the box $90 grease gun i ended up not being able to use.  And sold a log splitter that i REALLY wanted to keep.  \n\nI did it to myself.  I know this.  And I don't ever ask anyone to pay me.  I just figure a descent human being would at least offer 5 bucks in a month where they bought a new 4 wheeler and built a $6,000 big block.  \n\nI'm well on my way to making A LOT of money.  As far as beggers go I've descided to just tell most of them that my money is tied up in investments.  Which will mostly be true.\n\nBut for the last few days i have been highly considering just living life as i have and giving people a chance.  I'll list everyone and everything i am owed and from now on keep a list.  I'll write the date, who it was, and a detailed description of the deal.\n\nThe front cover will be a list of people to never loan or sell anything to again and the page number for reference.  And the back cover (should it ever happen) will be the people that paid on time.  These people will get handholding out of wageslavery and likely become future business partners i can trust.\n\nIs this a dick move?  \n\nNobody but my wife and me will ever see it or even know it exists.\n\nI don't want to be an asshole, but I'm tired of being taken advantage of.\n\nNot counting investments i still make near double  the salary my peers do and live the same lifestyle and budget or less.  So it's not like I can't buy groceries if i let someone fuck me over.  I've been broke before and i understange how much it sucks.  But ffs in 5 years you cant pay $0.01? The fuck?\n\nEdit: Had to repost.  Got deleted for wrong title.  Saw i had 2 responses but couldn't read them.  Sorry.",

      "description": "It happened today and I am still fuming. \n\nBasically, we were supposed to meet yesterday for dinner but my bf had some work to clear so we decided to meet the next day (today). However, halfway through yesterday, when he went to meet his friend even though he had work to do because he wanted to get some news about his friend and his date. They went out till 12 midnight and he came home and told me through text that he will wake up early at 9am to do his work and come over at 12pm to find me. I told him he will have a hard time waking up early as he is a heavy heavy sleeper but ok, I trust him. \n\nFast forward to today, he woke up late, just as I predicted and told me that he has no mood to meet me and wasn’t in the right state of mind to drive to my place. My bf suffers from depression and so, ok i try to understand but I am honestly quite pissed at this moment because: \n\n1. we planned this already? \n2. he has the mood to meet his friend yesterday but doesn’t have any to meet me the next day? \n3. i hate it when plans change. like abhor it and i understand this is something that i have to work on. \n\nSo we had a bit of a fight and then he said he needed some time alone. so he went off to drive somewhere and i found out he went to find his friend instead. I was seriously pissed at this point but i held it in. I asked him if he is able to meet for dinner instead. But he said no as he has dinner with his family. Ok, i won’t touch any family plans. \n\nTurns out, he wasn’t going for dinner with his family but instead with that friend of his. At this point, I was seriously pissed off and went full-on crazy. like really crazy, calling him names etc. As his friend was a girl, I even told him to go and date her instead (she is attached) since he would rather find her instead of me. \n\nI was raging so badly, I wasn’t functioning straight. I’m ashamed to say that I was trembling with anger and I even punched the wall. \n\nMy reasoning for getting so angry was because he would rather find someone else to meet and ask for advice rather than finding ME to talking about it. And the fact that he has mood to find his friend yesterday when he was supposed to be doing work but doesn’t have the mood to meet me. \n\nHe just told me he was very “off” that day, most probably due to him not taking his medications for a period of time. \n\n\nAITA for not considering my bf’s feeling and his mood given his depression and that I over-reacted?

Unfortunately, some of those friends couldn't be here with us this semester, so we were looking for people to replace them so we could have a reasonable number of people for the campaign.\n\nSo me and my two remaining players are in recruitment mode. We'll call one of these players A.\n\nMyself, A, and the other friend all manage to find one person each to join the campaign; that's a little more than I was hoping for (I just wanted enough regular players that it did not feel like I had to cancel if one person didn't show), but it'll work.\n\nSo, it turns out the person that A invited is a furry, and, I'm not gonna lie, it's makes me really uncomfortable. They wear cat ears and stuff all the time (from what I can tell), have some sort of sona thing on their lanyard, and unironically type and say things like \"owo\".\n\nI recognize that this is me just being a bit prejudiced because they're not hurting anyone, it just makes me feel weird, and I have no doubt that I would be an asshole if I were to ask them not to be in the campaign just because of a lifestyle choice I'm not used to, but I feel like A should have at least asked us if we would be comfortable with someone like this in the game, you know?\n\nNot only that but A seems to be a inconsiderate in general these days. He was late to both sessions so far, he invited his girlfriend (who I have met before, she's not a player) to spectate the game (which was in my apartment) without even asking. He has even asked twice now about extra people being added to the campaign after I initially said now (5 players is enough, thank you).\n\nI don't know I feel like this could just be me overreacting and A just being a bit rude, or maybe neither of us are assholes and I'm just worried too much. Either way I have no idea what to think, so I thought I'd leave it to you guys to decide.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my boyfriends dog living with us?",
      "description": "Hello - throwaway because my boyfriend is an active redditor. Also, apologies in advance because this will be long.\n\nSome background relevant to the story:\n\nMy boyfriend and I are both 20, still living with our parents.\n\nMy boyfriend was gifted a puppy by his mother almost a year and a half ago. He loves this dog **to death** . His dog is amazing! He’s a half German Shepherd, half husky. A very sweet but crazy dog.\n\nThe problem is, is that his mom set up training sessions once a week for this puppy, and my boyfriend brought the puppy to maybe 2 of these sessions, and then stopped going. He’s potty trained but that’s pretty much it.\n\nHe doesn’t know basic commands like “sit” or “stay”. He jumps and is very nippy. He’s almost 2 years old. He almost never calms down, is always running, jumping, and just has so much energy. Every time you come in the door he jumps and nips and (unintentionally) scratches. Now I know all dogs get excited when you come home, but this dog just **doesn’t calm down**. He jumps on you when you’re walking anywhere, when you’re sitting to eat, when you’re on the couch, when you’re going up/down the stairs, when you get in bed, etc. He doesn’t let you do anything without biting or jumping on you, and If you try to ignore him, he has an incredibly high pitched bark/yelp to get your attention. This dog is a very happy, loving boy. But after a while of being jumped on and scratched it gets annoying.\n\nCurrently, the dog is living with my boyfriends mom. A big house, lots of space, a spacious yard, etc. It’s good because his breed is very energetic and requires a lot of exercise. She lives about an hour away so my boyfriend doesn’t get to see his dog as much as he would like to. He lives with his dad and his dad doesn’t want a dog living with them.\n\nI’d also like to mention that when there is company at my boyfriends moms, no matter if it’s adults or kids, the dog is either put outside or put in his crate because it is well known that he is just too crazy to be around people. No one wants a crazy dog jumping all over them and scratching them.\n\nAnyway, this dog, who I love very very very much, is just crazy. His breed is very energetic in general, he wasn’t trained properly, and I like to think he’s still in his “puppy phase”. \n\nSo:\n\nMy boyfriend and I want to get an apartment. Apartments are known to be pretty small, and we also have a cat. The cat and the dog have met before, and it’s safe to say they didn’t get along. His dog was just so rambunctious and the cat would rather just watch from a distance.\n\nThe apartment we have looked at is, well small. Big enough for us and a cat, but not big enough for a large dog who needs a lot of exercise and a lot of space.\n\nMy boyfriend **refuses** to get an apartment with me unless the dog can come. I want the dog to come too, but I just feel like he won’t have enough space to let out his energy, especially if there isn’t time to walk him. (My boyfriend swears he will walk him everyday, but how can I know that when he wouldn’t bring him to the training sessions?) \n\nI feel like his dog has a pretty good quality of life living with my boyfriends mom right now, and I think it will go down moving into a cramped apartment. I’m also worried about the change for my cat. \n\nI told my boyfriend I don’t want his dog living with us. He refuses to get an apartment now. Without the dog, we can’t live together. End of story, period. No compromising.\n\nIf his dog had been trained properly and was more calm, I would definitely want him to live with us. My boyfriend “likes him just the way he is”. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for not wanting my boyfriends crazy dog to live with us?\n\n\n",

It was tough, but at 31 I decided to finally go back to school. I'm what they call a \"mature student\".  Everyone is a lot younger, but it wasn't a big deal. I could always find people to talk to in class. I have a few good friends and a girlfriend outside of school, who graduated a long time ago. My girlfriend and I are currently in a LDR for her work. I miss her a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always been a very social person so I started to get really lonely. It was affecting me and I wasn't really into any of the clubs. I thought it would be a good idea to go to some parties and meet some people. Whenever I would go, I didn't know any of the music and the energy just seemed off. People were polite, never rude, but didn't I could tell they wanted to leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was feeling lonely again last night and thought I'd get up and take myself to one of the frats. I would try one more time. When I got to the door, there was a guy who let people in. He just brought me to the side and said \"hey man, you seem really cool and all. But it's kinda weird when you come to the parties. No one has anything against you, but you get it\". He gave me a beer and a pat on the back. I told him not to worry about it, but I was absolutely crushed. He could tell I was hurt and told me not to worry, because \"there's some students around your age you can party with\". I just smiled and went home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got home, I called my SO to tell her what happened. She was telling me not to worry but said that I have to understand why they might not want to party with me. It has nothing to do with me as a person, but it's weird if I want to party with them. She told me I shouldn't try again and to just go to bars with a buddy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was really hurt that she said something like that. It's not cool to exclude anyone, especially for something as dumb as being a little older. We're all students. She knew how big of a decision it was for me to go back. I had to really swallow my pride.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into an argument and by the end of it she told me to act my age. But I am acting my age. It's not unreasonable to want to be included by my peers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Now, technically according to store policy, we aren’t supposed to accept tips from customers, but our manager is extremely lax on that rule, seeing as how the majority of my coworkers are high school/ college age.\n\nThat being said, tonight I took out an order, and found that the customer had an obvious intellectual disability. Of course, I treated them with as much respect as I would any customer, but when the time came to give him his receipt, he asks if tipping was the norm. I replied that it wasn’t, but before I even finished my sentence, he thrust out a $50 bill from his window and thanked me. I tried refusing it twice, citing store policy and even offering him two $20 bills for change, but he was insistent on giving me the $50.\n\nIt makes me wonder if he didn’t realize that his order was processed through his credit card online, and that he gave me the money thinking he was paying for his order. I’m feeling kind of shitty, like I definitely could have done more to refuse the money, but at the same time, i’m trying to save up for college next year and $50 is a lot of money.\n\nAITA? ",

Next year rolls around and we don’t talk as much but still friends. It was all good till a few weeks ago. He just started being a jerk to me. I don’t know why I didn’t do anything to him. So English class starts and we are doing an activity to review a book, the usual but the thing is we use laptops for notes, and everything. We work with in rows and I sit next to him. So he is saying the usual “Shut Up”, “No one wants care.”, “No one wants to hear from you.”, etc. But then out of no where he tries to shut my laptop off so I get mad and push his hand off it. Then the person in front of me restarts my laptop. I get mad so I tell the teacher that people are trying to shut off my laptop and I make it obvious it is person in front of me and somewhat the person next to me. But the teacher pushes all the blame on the person next to me but I don’t really care because the person in front of me is already in trouble with the teacher. But I could here the person next to me swearing at me under his breath. So he moved seats. But after class he needed to get his stuff which was next to me. I just start hearing “You’re a d***”, “You’re a a******” and I sit next to him in the next class. This continues on to the next class. I did not know what to do at that point so I wanted to go to the bathroom and think so I ask the teacher. The teacher said after class but I didn’t care because I just wanted to think so I go back to my seat to here him begging to not tell anyone. (He thought I was going to the office.) He then says if I do he won’t be able to go to the school he got accepted into. (With this School even when you are accepted they can kick you off of the list if your grades or behavior changes.) He already had enough stuff in the list that a few more small things could get him off. Then I realized if I tell on him there is actually a chance I may ruin his chance of getting a job he wants, and he would also be in big trouble with his parents. \n\nSo WIBTA if I tell?",

      "description": "Hello AITA, I am using a throwaway because I feel like this isn't going to go very well from me but my life is falling apart and I feel like no one will be honest with me because they feel like I'm on the edge. I am, but please give it to me strait. As such, I will be very honest about what I've done. \n\n5 weeks ago I broke up with my boyfriend. I actually love him very much but we have been together for almost 4 years now (we are 21 now) and he's the only boyfriend I ever had, only guy I've ever had sex with. He was ready to get engaged but I wanted to experience more of everything before I get married to anyone. He was devastated, it actually hurt me much more than I thought it would but I stuck to my guns and didn't get back together with him. \n\nLast week my dad finally went into the emergency room after not feeling well for many weeks. After all the standards tests it turns out he has very late stage pancreatic cancer and has a very short time to live. a year at the absolute most. \n\nI didn't know what to do so I called my ex, he offered to have me come over and we basically ended up hugging, then cuddling and then having sex. He asked me when it was over with if that meant we were getting back together. I wasn't sure what to say so I basically said yes. \n\nHe's ecstatic that we are back together, I am content but I feel like it's just to find some comfort. News from my dad gets worse and worse by the day and I find it just easier to be with my boyfriend than deal with reality. I don't know what the future is going to bring so I told my boyfriend (ex, not even sure now) that no matter what I need to slow down in my life and can't talk about things like engagement or long term commitments. He said he's fine with that but I'm not sure if I fully believe him--which makes me feel even more like I'm taking advantage of him. \n\nAm I the asshole for what I'm doing?",

      "description": "This is probably a dumb question but I thought I'd get some feedback for it anyway. \n\nI recently quit my God awful job as a dishwasher at a chain restaurant. I had only been there for a month, and I was already despising every day I had to be there. In the time I was there, two people had started and immediately quit, and another guy was fired because he just stopped showing up completely. I soon knew why. Management was a mess, and the dishwashers were treated like dirt. I referred a good friend of mine, and even he hated it when he was only a few weeks in. They were profiling him a lot, saying that since hes a big, tall dude, he can do everything without issue. Not true. We were both pretty out of shape and being on our feet for so long (without a break mind you) was destroying our bodies.\n\nI called in on a Friday telling them that I mentally and physically couldn't do the job anymore. There was no way I'd survive for another 2 weeks, and I sure as hell wouldnt ever work for them again. But they managed to convince the both of us to come in that day, then stuck us in the dish room alone on a packed Friday evening. Now, we knew how to do our job, but we weren't experts, and you need at least 4 people on the weekends so that things dont get backed up...they knew we were the only ones back there and didnt even give us a heads up. We decided that enough was enough. We had been treated like such shit that day by both the cooks and servers. They constantly told us to do our best but then kept saying we still weren't good enough. I couldn't bare to work somewhere that continued to zap the life out of me, and make my depression worse than it already was. So...we walked out. \n\nI'm sure since only one other person was going to work in there that night, so some of the managers would have to join them in order to try and make sure they had enough dishes...I'm still stuck thinking about it now. And I've already been having so much trouble finding another job, that sometimes I wonder if I just should have bottled my issues up and just kept working...",

I told the professor it was on the group. Turns out this sheet is actually pretty classified and the board of education had made it clear that it is to be used in front of professors and NO pictures were to be taken. I DID NOT KNOW THIS but my classmate did and she still took a picture in secret. When the professor found this out, she suspended my classmate. \n\n\nFor the record, if I had known that my classmate took this picture without permission, I would'nt have used it in front of the professor cause I didnt mean to snitch.\n\n\nI feel bad for being the reason this got out.

      "description": "I've lived with my roommate (who is also family) for 2 years. I've asked him over and over again, stop using my pans if you are going to leave them in the sink for days. I have specific sized pans for the things I want to cook, and he continuously leaves them in the sink for me to wash when I need to use them. He won't even soak them, so I've always got to scrub a ton of shit off of them. (He's also not once cleaned the apartment, but that's a different story. We have multiple issues)\n\nI asked him one more time last week, please, wash my pans when you are done using them. Every time I go to use them they are filthy.  He just says \"hmmm\" and changes the subject. After that conversation he uses them again immediately and leaves them in the sink, and then he goes on a week long trip out of town.\n\nThe day before he got back I washed all of them and put them in my room so he can not use them anymore.\n\nHe came home yesterday and didn't notice, but he called me at work this morning looking for them and got really pissed when I told him I put them away. He told me if I leave them out he's definitely going to keep using them, and I can't keep them from him. Which I thought was weird to say.\n\nThe thing is, HE HAS HIS VERY OWN SET. It's a brand new set, barely touched because HE ONLY WANTS TO USE MINE. And mine are like 20 years old, I really don't understand what his issue is. I am just sick of him using my stuff and leaving it filthy in the sink for a week. I haven't left him without any cookware; he just doesn't want to use his own. He has two really nice skillets and three different-sized pots. I do not use his cookware at all, because I fry a lot of steak and his skillets are not big enough. All he cooks is scrambled eggs, and sausages, and for some reason insists on using my pans for that. I'm almost 26 years old, him as well, and I can't believe I'm still dealing with this stupid shit. I'm moving out soon, but until then,\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "Before stopping the sale, I called my brother early in the morning to angrily ask him what was going on. \n\nHere is why I did it. I had been trying to sell the house for several months for my mom (my dad had died several years earlier). My mom &amp; dad had lived in this house &amp; had good memories of it from visits and from my kid's birthday parties.\n\nAfter going to the work of getting it listed, my brother got this brainstorm to offer to sell the house to a boyhood friend for $25,000 under the asking price. He and my mom got this rolling without telling me. Problem is, the friend and I had had a brief relationship that ended very (very, very) badly, and when I found out what my brother and my mother were planning, I felt betrayed. \n\nAnd, as a practical matter, we had had the property on the market for two months, and I didn't find out about this plan of my mothers and my brothers until the day before we were about to get multiple over-asking-price offers.\n\nAlso, my mother wanted to delist the property, &amp; not pay our realtor. But I would have had to be the person handling the negotiations, because my mother doesn't know how, which would have been extremely uncomfortable; I would have become the sellers agent in a transaction where an ex-lover was the buyer.\n\nI stopped the deal. My brother hasn't talked to me for a year, because, he says, I chose anger at his old friend over my relationship with him (my brother). My mother says she is \"hurt\". Am I the asshole? Or are all my family members crazy people?",

      "description": "I had a concussion a few months back. it was a moderate one, and even though I had a hard time processing information and got headaches when in bright light or reading, I was expected to keep up in my classes. I got to turn in things a little late, but there were some things my AP english teacher said I *had* to turn in by a certain date or I wouldn’t get credit— but I couldn’t read the book for the assignment in time. I was also expected to write timed essays and take tests (my teachers let me do things on paper, which still took longer than normal but I could do them). \n\nNow, my friend recently lost a brother through self-ending means about two weeks ago. He’s acting pretty normal and making jokes (he said “why did he have to inconvenience me by dying” jokingly) but of course some people cope differently and he could be keeping it inside. But he wants to use someone else’s work to finish an ongoing assignment from a few months before because “she always get As on it”. We have the same AP English teacher, and she let him skip a whole essay entirely “because everyone did bad anyways”. He’s allowed to do things days later as well. I was frustrated bc our AP english teacher let him skip the essay while she expected things to be on time and I couldn’t skip when my brain couldn’t process things normally. \n\nI also went through a trauma where my dad was in the hospital for a few weeks a few years ago, and I never asked for handouts, but that’s just me personally. He’s the type to always ask for rides home if you have a car, and he took photos of my essay from our last essay and copied my thoughts (I let him look at it but I didn’t know he was photographing it). \n\nAITA for being angry that he’s cheating/getting free passes? I feel like ITA. He’s going through a trauma and just because he’s acting normal doesn’t mean that he’s suffering. And of course a concussion isn’t the same as a loss of a loved one. I just don’t think it’s fair he’s kind of using the death as a means to get passes, and my teachers are acting like he’s unable to do any work whatsoever.",

      "description": "First time poster. When my (26F) boyfriend (24M) and I first met (before we started dating) I knew he was a smoker. My biggest line in the sand with dating was always \"I will never date a smoker\". Well, wouldn't I be damned that I fell in love with that guy. When we started dating I made it really well known that this is a big deal for me and that I wouldn't be able to continue with it. \n\nI am a singer (professional opera singer) and an asthmatic. I also find smoking to be just the grossest thing ever, it is just a complete turn off. To add insult to injury, not only is he smoking cigarettes, he also mixes cigarettes and pot together (smoking batch). And if anyone knows about that is smells even worse. He smokes a lot of pot. I don't even have huge issues with it, but he's outside multiple times a day smoking and is spending a lot of money on it. \n\nHe comes inside and even when he brushes his teeth I can still smell it coming from his lungs and I can't help myself, I start coughing.\n\nI understand it's a habitual addiction mixed with a physical addiction. He tried going on stop smoking aids but it doesn't stop the pot smoking. My therapist (who I was seeing for another issue) says that making peoples with addictions feel shame only makes their addictions worse. Every time I try to bring it up nicely he just gets all upset and calls himself a failure and does nothing about it. People say that quitting smoking is a ridiculously hard thing to do and that I am asking him too much, but in reality I think my health and my needs matter too, and I'm not blowing away my money and health.\n\nAITA for being a stickler and making him quit smoking?

      "description": "Throwaway (Can you believe there's already a \"nudebeachthrowaway\"?)\n\nMy husband (38) and I (37)have been married 12 years and we have 4 kids. There's this mom from my kids school that was texting my husband over the spring, they were chatting and having play dates with our kids. (I had been acquaintances with her for many years before, our kids are in the same school and mommy group) Then, one day while his phone was on the kitchen counter, I saw a few texts coming in with her asking him if he is talking about the nude beach in town.  I got a real suspicious feeling and looked at his last few texts, they went like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer: Invites him to the beach for a play date, Asks if there's a beach he likes.\n\nHusband: Suggests beach that is famous for being a nude beach \n\nHer: Isn't that a nude beach?\n\nHusband: Well, technically the nude beach is around the corner, there's an area for families too\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't snoop any farther than this and I confronted my husband. While that's true about the family section, I don't think it's appropriate to invite someone there. This place is famous for being a nude beach in my area, and we aren't in a small town it's a Canadian capital city.  If you ask anyone what's at \\_\\_\\_\\_ beach they will say nude beach. The nude area is maybe 100 meters from the public area. He doesn't seem to understand how this was inappropriate.  I say bringing up a nude beach, and inviting a person to a nude beach is totally inappropriate, it can send the wrong signals about a relationship , it's also rather forward bringing up sex like this.  He says he was just answering her question honestly (What beach he likes) and there's a family section that we have been to with our kids before and it was lovely.  I have heard him talk about this beach with other people before (With people that are close, not some mom that seems to have a sudden attraction to him) and they are always surprised to learn there is a non nude section. I believe he thinks I am being over cautious. He cheated on me 10 years ago and again  2 years ago I was in an emotionally abusive situation that he enabled and gaslighted me about.

      "description": "My friend and I have know each other for several years and he is now in his early thirties. Years ago, he decided not to finish his university education, which has unfortunately accumulated a lot of student loan debt for the classes he did take. He has since then been trapped in a low-paying job with bad prospects, which he despises. I really care about him as a friend and have always tried to help him out any way I can including job hunting and financial advice. \n\nSince last year, he has been caught up in a multi-level marketing scheme. His “uplines” have charged him over $3000 for the “opportunity” to sell water ionizer machines that cost thousands of dollars to people on social media. He has not been able to recoup a single dollar after many months and his total loss out of pocket due to involvement with them is probably $5000.\n\nDespite this, he continues to be invested in this scheme, which would be due to charge him the same amount again this year. I have, in my attempt to stop him from continuing in this scheme, suggested to him many times to look for a higher paying opportunity or even have his employer help with getting better certifications. I sent him a lot of job postings, and he would respond that he never wants to work for a boss again, and that people who work for companies are obtuse conformists who can’t think out of the box. \n\nIt came to a head yesterday when he told me his debt repayment had been hiked up by the lender which makes it hard for him to pay his bills on his current salary. When he told me this, I said: “if you don’t want to get a better paying job right now, why not look into Uber? It can help you make a plan because the earnings are not huge but pretty stable (we live in a big city where earnings are more predictable) and you can earn around your hours.” \n\nHe replied: “Uber is just a dead end job, I would not make any job where I had to answer to someone else my priority. I need to focus on (the mlm scheme) until I can pay my debt off at once.” \n\nAt this point I felt a bit angry and said : “no, you need a budget plan, because you’ll never get rich off this, it’s a total scam, you know that right? They are looking to scam you and you are brainwashed into trying to scam other people.”\n\nHe was very upset by this and responded that I am being unsupportive of his entrepreneurial-ship. I said being a distributor for an MLM was not being an entrepreneur because the business doesn’t belong to him, and that his focus should be to pay off debt instead of get rich quick schemes with con artists. \n\nHis response was that I was being a terrible unsupportive friend, and that I am acting this way because I can’t stand to see him “woke” and knowing what he wants in life and that I am trying to ruin what he believes in. He has since blocked me on text. \n\nWas I an asshole for this exchange? Am I a bad friend for causing hurt because I feel that he’s wrecking his life? \n\nIf so, what should I have done? \n\nThanks for reading all this.",

      "description": "Ok so I’m gonna lay some ground work, so even before my parents got divorced I was always the kid who ended up helping clean the kitchen after dinner the most but since my parents have been separated since September 2017 my dad sorta treats me like a housewife and not a newly 14 year old girl. For background, I live with 4 other people, my dad my 2 sisters (18, and 20) and my younger brother (12) and no one cleans up after themselves and I will admit I can be guilty of that as well sometimes but even though I have 3 perfectly capable siblings he only ever asks me to clean the kitchen, or cook dinner and the weirdest one, put my brother to bed, and he is basically the worst and won’t go to bed unless someone is there making him, like he will just sit on his phone (duh) if no one is there letting him talk himself to sleep and obviously my dad doesn’t want to do that but he needs my brother up at 6:30 so he asks me for some reason, and then with dinner either I help him make it or I just have to make it by myself (like my mom would do) and then after dinner I have to clean up or sometimes if I say something to him about how I don’t like being the only one who cleans he will sorta ask my sister but then she’ll say something about homework and she’ll get out of it. So basically no matter what I always end up having to clean the entire kitchen by myself so about an hour ago I went off on my dad a bit, I had a lot of pent up emotion about this and I just let it all out in a very angry way in all honesty and now I hear him sadly doing dishes and he hasn’t spoken to me and I feel bad and I don’t know if an asshole for it. Maybe he was just doesn’t know what to do now that my moms gone but Idk ",

      "description": "I recently moved into a new apartment. The housemate I was subletting from was apparently involved in an ongoing court case with our landlord due to not having paid rent in *several months*. He didn't tell me or our other housemates this, and a week after I got here an eviction notice was posted on our apartment. To make a long story short, we called the cops to report that he'd stolen our money, and the landlord, who didn't know we existed, eventually agreed to let us rent from him while evicting only the asshole.\n\nThe place is in terrible condition because the asshole seemed almost dead set on destroying it- the carpets are horribly stained, he bolted wood platforms into the floor of the living room because he was planning to rent it out as another bedroom, there are huge cracks in most of the doors that I could not possibly explain, nothing works and everything is filthy- but the part that I now have is gigantic. I have an entire spare bedroom, and the rent is way cheaper than most places around here. \n\nI'm working on cleaning it up and making it livable, and have been thinking of subletting that extra bedroom. My mother, whom I normally don't speak to, thinks I should charge whoever rents from me the entire $750 of rent that I currently pay. She's repeatedly told me I'm a moron and an asshole for wanting to just split the rent down the middle.\n\nI don't think I'm being an asshole. I think an even split is the only fair way to do this, and I'm not sure where I would get off demanding that someone else cover the entirety of my rent, since I don't own the place and the only service I'm providing them is letting them know there's a room available. What do you guys think?\n\n",

      "description": "Ok here goes. My sister has two children. Each time she had a baby she caused a huge commotion in the family. Creating stringent rules for being near her children, expecting availability for full day babysitting only on her terms, stipulating specific presents to be purchased for her children and downright punishing anyone who made any misstep (usually by cutting off contact for 2-4 months). Her behavior has largely made me feel uncomfortable being around her and her children, as I never know when I'm going to inadvertedly do something wrong. \n\nIn the meantime, my husband and I have struggled with infertility. It has been a four year journey involving countless medical tests, two rounds of IVF, the birth of a stillborn daughter last year, and finally the birth of our son, 10 weeks premature, 3 months ago. After 75 days in the NICU, our little boy came home chunky and healthy 3 weeks ago. \n\nWhile we were in the NICU, my sister got upset at us for asking her to text us rather than call while we were in the hospital setting. She visited us only twice, and during those visits she was domineering and tried to tell us how to talk to hopsital staff, how to take care of ourselves and how to redefine our relationship as husband and wife now that we have a child (yea.. I don't know what that was about either).\n\nShe just let me know that she is 16 weeks pregnant with her third child,  and will be announcing the pregnancy at the Christmas family gathering.  This is where I think I became the asshole. While a new baby should be nothing but joy, all I can feel is that her announcement will distract away from my little one's first Christmas, and that my sister's baby circus is about to start all over again. I feel bitterness and dread, and I might skip out on the Christmas gathering. I known she didn't get pregnant to spite me or one up me, but I know that she will act like an attention seeking blackhole.\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way?\n\nTL;DR Just had a baby after 4 years of infertility, now finding out sister is 16 weeks pregnant with her third child and going to announce it at Christmas family gathering.

I keep telling them I’m diabetic but everyone insists “just one *tiny* thing” won’t hurt &amp; some even get extremely pushy about it. \n\nI already make some exceptions; if someone makes some homemade treat, I’ll try a bite to be polite. But for some people, that’s not enough and they get offended I took “so little”. Everyone seems to believe their treat is totally worth risking my baby’s life over. \n\nSome will buy/cook meals for me. As well-intentioned as it is, I’m too scared to accept any dish they offer, just because even the savoury dishes cause my blood sugar level to spike above 7.0 mmol/l even 2h after eating. The recommended range is 5.5-6.6mmol/l &amp; when I’m eating my own meals, my blood sugar level never even reaches 5.5mmol/l. I have no idea how much sugar is in their food, but it has to be a scary amount. \n\nMy GD is mild enough that I can actually eat 2 servings of dessert a day without my blood sugar going above the recommended limits, but I’ve made sure to keep this a secret from my in-laws. One of my big pregnancy craving is fruits, but they make my blood sugar spike like crazy so I have to carefully ration these treats. Unfortunately, my in-laws don’t see fruits as desserts, so they’ll always push me to have a dessert on top of fruits. \n\nThey believe every meal needs to end with at least 1 dessert. Meals with the family get very annoying, because I have to keep politely refusing as they push the 4th dessert at me, going, “But this isn’t even *that* sweet!”\n\nThe worst is when they give me a drink they insist is unsweetened, but it’s actually a sugar bomb. I’d like to believe it’s always an accident, but it has happened so often, a paranoid part of me wonders if it’s deliberate. I do believe in assuming it’s usually stupidity instead of malice, but surely people can’t be *this* stupid, right? \n\nI hide in my room most of the time to avoid them now, and they’ve noticed. My husband &amp; I also decided to move out much earlier —a week before my expected due date. I guess that sent a statement about how much we hate living with them and they think I’m an asshole now. Are we ungrateful assholes?",

      "description": "They've been together for a few of years and during that time they've had some nasty fights (they fight often, but their nasty ones are maybe once every 1-2 months). Like nasty to the point where me and our other close friends are shocked that he hasn't beaten the shit out of her yet. He's nasty, violent, rude, an asshole, and totally disrespects her. She does so much for him, but he rarely does anything for her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey had a fight the other day that ended with her boyfriend in the hospital with a broken hand/lower arm from hitting a car window. He basically said some disrespectful stuff to her and she told him she thinks she needs a break, so he did that out of anger. We went to lunch today and she told me about their recent fight, and at the end I asked her why she's still with him. She told me it's because he's a good guy most of the time and that she still loves him. So I asked how she could love someone that she cheats on (she's cheated countless times over the few years) and she got angry that I asked that. I didn't mean for it to come off as rude, I just don't understand how you can love someone (especially a guy like this) so much but fuck other people behind their backs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Best friends relationship with her boyfriend is unhealthy. He's a raging maniac. She cheats on him often (he doesn't know). After their most recent fight, I asked how she can love someone that is 1) totally disrespectful and 2) that she cheats on carefree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

On this holiday LTF's GF didn't want to do much and wanted to stay in so I spent both evenings with my sister and NF. \n\nI thought that everything had gone well with the holiday, but when we got back, LTF says that I clearly like NF better because I 'looked jealous' when LTF and NF were talking to each other (I was in a bad mood at the time, as the restaurant brought everyone's food but mine). She seems to be wanting to cut off the friendship because of this transgression that I have apparently committed. Am I the Arsehole?\n\nFor context, LTF finds maintaining friendships easy and maintains a large social group that I am expected to socialise with as well on nights out. ",

(Doki Doki Literature Club, a visual novel from 2017, you should play it, it's good) I've always been fond of Germany and it's history, and I create videos combining the two when I have the time.\n\nRecently I made a video animation of Panzerlied, a tanker's song from WW2.  In a promotional post before I released the video, I created an image depicting the characters (the community calls them Dokis) in front of a tank wearing the uniform cap that was used historically by some Panzer units.\n\nI got a comment asking why I used Nazi uniforms, and well... [this happened.](https://imgur.com/a/vskhekN)  The first image in that album is the picture that started it.  The rest are the ensuing conversation.  I edited in the images I referenced and clarified some terms I used that may be unfamiliar to people.\n\nBoth of us have made our points in the comments and you can see them in the image, so I won't say much more here.  I don't think anyone's going to say he went about arguing the right way, but is he correct?  Am I in the wrong for using the uniform?\n\nAlso, I shouldn't have to address this, but just in case:  **I am not a Nazi.**  I just have a deep respect for Germany in general, particularly back when they were an empire.",

      "title": "AITA for interacting with niece/nephew in authoritative manner?",
      "description": "Context: Husband and I (34) live with his parents, as do his brother's family (brother (27), wife (28), daughter (3) son (1)). Parents and BIL family on main floor, husband and I in basement. Busy, cramped household.\n\nArgument from brother and his wife: I have no right to interact with my niece and nephew in an authoritative manner, in a \"parenting\" manner, no matter what the circumstances.\n\nArgument from me: I've never treated their children even half as harshly as they themselves do, and remaining silent in the face of bad behavior/actions is to be complicit and send the kids the wrong message about socially acceptable behavior.\n\nWe have been living together like this since summer of last year (2017). My BIL and his wife had trepidation about moving in but the rest of us were looking forward to it, like a 'Full House’ situation where we could see our niece and nephew every day and have fun.\n\nI became pregnant in late October and morning sickness showed up in early December and stayed my entire pregnancy. I didn't change emotionally, but physically I was overwhelmingly nauseous every single day ALL day for 7.5 months, some days debilitatingly so, and my interactions with everyone was massively reduced. There was the rare time I felt well enough to sit and play or color with my niece and nephew, but it was rare. Overall, I really enjoyed having them around and found joy in the simple things I could do that their parents weren't interested in, such as sitting at the door on a rainy day and listening to and identifying birds in the backyard, or discussing differences in animals and food, or whatever. I found I really enjoyed interacting with them in a teaching aspect.\n\nNow my BIL and wife are very strict in some areas with their kids while surprisingly lax in others. The lax areas include how much noise their kids make, which isn't polite when living with 2 other families. I suffered my entire pregnancy due to their indifference of this fact. Being in the basement, every dropped item on the wooden floor upstairs sounds like a little cannonball exploding, while running in the hallway sounds like a stampede of rhinos. Due to the nature of the house build and duct system, voices carry very well too so raised voices/yelling sounds like it's 5 feet from my head in bed. It's honestly crazy loud and my husband and I have told everyone repeatedly. Simple requests such as having the kids play in the living room instead of stomping around above our head before 9 a.m. on the weekends have gone ignored.\n\nMy nephew was just shy of a year old when they moved in and nearly every night of his life, up until June of this year, he would whine and cry for up to an hour after being put to bed, and would wake up whining and crying loud enough you could probably hear it outside - multiple times a night. I was an absolute wreck my whole pregnancy because of it. I got no sleep for months and they never bothered to resolve this behavior. Whenever he is distressed during the day he makes the same noise - a siren-like droning wail that they utterly ignore, even though he persists for minutes and minutes. It's terrible and bothers everyone in the house except for them apparently. \n\nThis noise is what started a 4 hour argument in July that I'm still reeling from.\n\nI was 38 weeks pregnant watching a movie in the living room with my husband (we had no TV of our own). My husband's parents were gone for the weekend and my BIL's family was finishing up after dinner - dishes and getting ready for bed. Something upset my nephew and he started his wailing cry and after 20 seconds or so, when it was clear his parents weren't going to address it, I did what everyone always does and asked him a question to interrupt him and get him to stop and clarify why he's upset. I called out, “What's going on Bruce?” to get his attention, and my sister-in-law snapped back, “I've got it, thanks!” in the same tone she reserves for yelling at her husband and kids. I was shocked she would speak to me like that, and particularly for something as trivial as talking to her kid in an effort to get him to stop carrying on. I was pretty upset but didn't say anything, just went back to my bedroom.\n\nThe next evening, my husband's parents came home and were playing and talking with my niece and nephew while my BIL stood there. My BIL and wife have a strict 'no food after 7 rule’ for the kids which we all know. My mother-in-law was giving the kids some chocolate and it was 6:58 and she commented playfully, “Uh oh, hurry up and eat it or I'll get in trouble!” to which I seriously replied, “Yep, you better be careful” (because my SIL has been upset with them before for giving snacks so close to 7), at which my BIL turned towards me, gave me a hard stare and said, “Hey, no, we're not doing that right now” as if I was out of line. My husband heard, called out “What did you just say to my wife?” and that started an argument that lasted until after midnight - 5 hours of surprising accusations.\n\nAccording to my BIL and wife:\n\nIt is extremely inappropriate to correct their children - ever.\n\nThis made no sense to my husband or myself and we brought up many instances where we had done so and they promptly told us we were wrong.  Things like:\n\n The backyard party when my nephew was getting ready to throw a croquet ball onto a glass top table? I was wrong to tell him not to do it, even though my BIL's wife stood there talking to another parent and didn't do or say anything.\n\n The time my niece kicked my nephew in the back and their parents didn't see? I was wrong to tell her that wasn't okay and to apologize to her brother and tell her parents what she'd done. BIL and wife absolutely heard all of this, but utterly ignored me.\n\n Interrupting wailing/shouting to get to the root cause and help them work through emotions? Wrong.\n\n Comforting crying niece and nephew? Turns out they'd just been punished so cuddling them and asking what was the matter was wrong.\n\nLiterally every interaction that isn't a watered down, “Hey, cool toy!” is 100% unwelcome.\n\nTo reiterate, no one else is as harsh with the kids as their own parents. We don't use sarcasm, we don't swear at them, we don't physically reprimand them (except to keep from doing something dangerous), and we don't ratchet up the intensity - in fact we've never actually shouted or yelled at the kids, whereas all of these tactics are employed by them both.\n\nI know this is long, but months down the road we still have a shattered relationship. They insisted that once I had my kid I would know what they're talking about and agree with them, but I still think they're crazy, it still breaks my heart that I'm not 'allowed’ to have a normal relationship with my niece and nephew, one that includes love and fun and discipline where required. Since having my son they ignored his existence the first few weeks of his life - in fact my BIL's wife still utterly ignores him, while BIL will look at him and talk to him sometimes. \n\nIt's hard to distill complex situations and relationships into some paragraphs, but what do you think? Am I an asshole for interacting with their kids in an authoritative manner? \n\n",

I want to see your face while you are speaking.\" She said \"It's better that you come.\" So I lay next to her. Then things got intense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day after that I texted her and called his brother to see her for the last time before she leaves town. We met with brother first then went where the girl and her friends are. I sit next to her other but not much communication happened. Then we leave. I texted her while she was on the road and haven't spoke since. AITA?  \n\n\nTL;DR I slept with my friend's sister. Didn't tell a word about it. AITA?",

      "description": "First post here and this might be kind of stupid and minute but my wife and I were coming back from a trip across the border. We live in California and were in Tijuana to get regular dental work done and possibly get an updated prescription for her glasses. The eyeglass place closes at 8pm and I drop her off at the place at 7:40pm and I go into a parking garage to park. 5 minutes later, she tells me the place won't service her since it is close to closing time so I pay the parking garage 10 pesos (\\~50 cents) for the 5 minutes I parked there. I would have thought anything under 10 minutes would be free but I don't really care because it is so cheap. We decide to go to the movies because we thought Avengers came out today but nope, we were wrong. We parked in another parking garage and decided to leave. We were in there less than 5 minutes so I figured again, maybe free or something cheap. This time, you have to go to a stall and pay your ticket before you get into your car so it is 15 pesos for anything under an hour or 10 pesos if you get your ticket stamped at the movies. My wife says lets go back to the movies and get it stamped which we are right next to the elevator and the movies is directly on the 3rd floor. I said, no, lets just pay the price and leave. In my head, it is only a 25 cent difference and then once we are in the car, my wife starts going off on me how it is only 1 minute and that she could have gone to the bathroom at the movie theatre. I thought to myself, we were just up there and next to the bathroom so her argument was invalid but I just said it isn't worth my time. I am not from Mexico but she is and we both grew up in our respective countries without much money. I make a good salary and we live in a high cost of living area but we are  usually frugal. If I had to replay the scenario again, I still don't think I would have gone up there to get my ticket stamped. ",

      "description": "My family tends to go to dinner to celebrate family accomplishments, birthdays, anniversaries, etc. When we go, my parents pay. My sister (24) has been bringing her boyfriend to these dinners for 8 years. I (21) want my boyfriend (22) to come to these dinners as well, but... he refuses to come sometimes, citing a lack of money.\n\nMy mom is the one that has invited him (and my sister’s boyfriend) to come with us. And she insists on paying for us. (and has been paying for my sister’s boyfriend for, again, eight years). It’s not as if I’m just bringing my SO to dinner and expecting my mom to pay for us both.\n\nMy boyfriend, though, won’t come because he doesn’t want someone paying for him. He insists on paying for himself, and when he cannot, he won’t come. When he DOES come, he always tries to give money to my mom, and she refuses to take it. When that doesn’t work, he gives it to ME and expects me to give it to her. I’m not comfortable with this either.\n\nWe’ve gotten into a ton of arguments over this, because I want him there to celebrate important milestones like my birthday, my college graduation, my winning an award, and similar occasions that he should be there for, while he doesn’t want to go if he doesn’t have money, and my parents don’t want to make him pay for things that they’re inviting him to.\n\nWho’s the asshole(s) here?",

      "description": "So, my girlfriend works at a small restaurant. There are 3 employees there, plus two owner/managers. \n\nOne of the two employees is a friend of mine, he actually got my girlfriend the job there. We'll call him Travis, because his name is Travis. The other employee, we'll call Todd, because his name is not Todd.\n\nFor as long as Travis has worked there, Todd has been a dick to him. As a matter of fact, Todd has been a dick to all of their (male) employees since Travis has worked there, going on 2 years now. Todd doesn't do dishes, Todd doesn't scrub floors, Todd doesn't help new people, and Todd talks back to managers. Todd has been there for six years and is related to the owners, so Todd is allowed to do pretty much whatever he wants. Todd, however, is kind to female employees. All of the things he doesn't do, he offers to do so that female employees don't have to.\n\nTodd is extremely kind to my girlfriend, chatty even, but has nothing for anyone that has a penis. There have been a few times where I've been a few minutes early to pick her up from work, gone inside, only for him to tell me that I'm not allowed to sit there and wait for her to get off work.\n\nWhere she works, the parking lot is very small. Besides employee parking, there are only two parking spots for customers. There would be only one spot in my girlfriend drove her own vehicle. This is mostly a delivery business, but sometimes people eat in. I digress, the last three nights I've gone to pick her up, Todd has been parked diagonally across two parking spaces. The past two nights, she said that he was probably just in a rush to get inside the store as they had been busy. Tonight, Todd had apparently pulled into the parking lot not long before me because I witnessed him deliberately (at least it looked deliberate, he definitely kept turning to be more outside of the lines) park poorly. I rolled my window down and told him to fix his parking. He flipped me off as he was walking in the store. I revved my engine.\n\nTonight I complained to my girlfriend about having to park in the middle of the parking lot because he was parked poorly. Her response was \"We're you revving your engine in the parking lot? You're going to get me in trouble.\"\n\nShe sees him as a nice coworker, she doesn't see him as anything but kind at helpful. She says that he is \"reserved\" with males. It's been an argument or an \"I'm not doing this right now\" conversation every time he comes up.\n\nI'm sure I'm being insecure, but Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Before the 4th dog, we had 3 dogs, dogs 1 and 2 are both old and on their last lag. I take care and love all of these dogs. They had been my dogs for my childhood and teenage years. I groomed them, played with them, fed them, they slept in my bed. But dog 1 eventually died, I had cared for him during his last days and was the one who carried him into the vet. But my sister who never cared for these dogs the way I did wanted to be the only one in the room for his euthanizing. \n\nNone of these dogs were supposed to be mine, dog 1 was supposed to be my sisters. Dog 2 was supposed to be my mother's. Dog 3 was my older sisters. But somehow they all fell into my hands at around 16, I'm 21 now. \n\nThe day after dog 1 died my sister and mom got a new dog. Dog 4. I was surprised by the dog and didn't know how to react. It was clear she just wanted to replace dog 1. And I knew immediately I had a new dog to care for. Surprisingly enough she cared for him for about a month and a half. I never had to clean his stuff, she almost even taught him how to not piss in the house. But she grew tired and stopped cleaning up after him, and he became my responsibility because she would neglect his needs. \n\nI eventually took dog 2 to be euthanized and dog 3 is now on his last leg. This is where the problem lies. I'm tired of caring for dog 4. I didn't ask for him, he wasn't my responsibility, when asked who the dog belongs to my sister claims him.\n\nI'm finally moving out in a few months. My schedule has been tight and I've had a lot less time for the dogs. So my parents said if I can't take care of them they would take dog 4 to the shelter. And I just wasn't phased by it. I didn't care. I knew I wouldn't have time for another dog. I didn't ask for him and I didn't want the dog.\n\nSo AITA for not caring anymore?",

      "description": "Will keep this very short but can add INFO if needed. Wife and I came into some nice inheritance in mid 2018. We decided that we are going to use the money to see the world and live in exotic places while trying to get our dream careers going (me: writer, she: clothing designer). We also wanted to live in underserved communities where we could be around real people instead of the Dallas suburbs we grew up in or in gentrified SoHo where we moved from.\n\n\nWe decided on South Tucson, AZ. It is 90% Hispanic, historic and gorgeous. We were able to buy a house for a song and we eagerly moved in 2 weeks ago. However the reception has not been good. At first we figured that maybe we were the first open lesbian couple they had seen so we went around and introduced ourself last week and people were either not friendly and our 65 year old neighbor told us that white people like us only bring problems to the neighborhood. We asked her to explain, she said if she has to explain then we truly don’t get it. \n\nI don’t think we are assholes but I sure felt like it  after speaking with our neighbor. We are just trying to experience a different culture...I thought that was a good thing.\n",

      "description": "So: I live in New England right now because bullshit and I'm now living with my mom and it fucking sucks. We pay 900 for a 2 bedroom apartment and I pay 400 except I have to sleep in the living room. On an air mattress. To give context most rooms in this city to rent are roughly the 300-600 range.  \n\nMy Mom and I are constantly arguing because she makes these huge messes, never cleans up after herself (like in the morning she leaves out food and poured out coffee rounds all over the counter) and will constantly say it's my responsibility to pick up after her. Even if I don't eat what she makes (which is often because I don't eat seafood) I'm still expected to clean up after her. I think that's fucking garbage. She expects me to clean up after myself in the morning (I never eat breakfast to avoid making a mess because I take the bus and it used to take me close to 2 hours to get to work, it takes her 20 minutes and she has a car). Also if there's any inspections or maintenance done on the apartment she expects me to hide all evidence of me living there even though there's 3 people on the lease so I definitely can be there. I have all my stuff stacked up in a corner because I don't even have my own closet and she constantly berates me because it doesn't look \"neat enough\" to her. \n\nShe also doesn't want me to put my stuff on or lay down on the couches and is upset that I sometimes sit in her room while she's at work (she has a set schedule I've never had one). I don't feel like I'm treated as an equal member of the house even though I'm paying like I am one.  And when I try to assert myself she belittles me and tells me that I'm making myself out to be \"Cinderella except [I] don't actually work\" or if I get mad she says,\"I'm your mother and you still have to respect me\". On top of that she constantly criticizes my appearance and things about me. \n\nBefore some shitty things happened I was living on my own for a couple of years and struggling but still getting by. Now I just feel completely defeated. On top of that she gets my grandmother to gang up on me and tell me I'm not contributing enough and that I need to pay more and do more chores and I fucking hate it. \n\nI just lost my job and am working on getting a new one (which will give me full time hours and is a lot closer) I'm really hoping to be able to move out I just wanna know I'm not fucking crazy.",

He told me he never wanted to talk to me again and he said i was being rude by telling him and i hurt him. ( i doubt that i hurt him) he blocked me on everything and so did his sister. Did i do something wrong?  I guess my intentions by telling him about what i did, were to get him to be jelaous and tell me he wants to actually be with me.

      "description": "Preface this with: I live in Canada, weed is legal. I do smoke on rare occasion, for example when on a night out with a bunch of friends or other social events. Max once or twice a month. I'm not anti-weed.\n\nI live with my boyfriend, we have lived together for a year and are in our mid-twenties. I work as a biologist, he works at a family business. Other than this problem we get along well. \n\nMy boyfriend claims he does not smoke often but in actuality seems to smoke every day. He says because he has just half a joint it barely even counts and he's not actually high. \n\nI disagree because when he smokes (usually after work or before bed, sometimes I don't know when since I've been at the gym most of the evening) I find he behaves as most high people do. I.e. he is a bit spaced out, can't really understand if I say anything complex, giggles at odd times, etc. Has that general glazed look in the eyes. I find it very hard to talk to him as it feels like I am talking to a stoned teenager. I don't have a beer or smoke on weekdays ever since I have to work in the morning and do a lot of sports and generally don't enjoy it as an everyday thing. \n\nAnd I just don't find it attractive at all when he's high. On a few occasions he has laughed right before or while we're having sex and it was a horrible turn off. I have mentioned before my problem with the weed and sex. He is very stressed at work and the weed is the only way he can relax so that's why he smokes. I have asked him to smoke a bit less but he does not think he smokes much to begin with. Maybe I'm wrong and just very sensitive to high people or something.  \n\nHe does get annoyed sometimes about frequency of sex since I will turn him down a lot of the time during the week since in the evening he has pretty much always smoked. I do explain its because he was smoking. I just really can't get in the mood if I've been trying to talk with a space cadet all evening before we go to bed. He doesn't understand since he claims he's \"not even high since he only had half a joint\".\n\nI knew he smoked weed when we started dating, just he did not smoke as much then (or maybe since we didn't live together I didn't notice).\n\nSo, I am the asshole? \n\n",

      "description": "AITA: Okay y’all, this will be a long one, but there’s a lot of pieces to the puzzle. I’ll include a TLDR at the end for the folks that need it.\n\nSo, I moved in with my best friend (22M) about a year ago. Upon moving in, we agreed that we were going to keep the house clean, as I am a clean person, and my roommate knows he is not the cleanest. Now I’m not talking ABSOLUTELY spotless, I’m talking clean as in grime. Food, dishes, countertops, stuff that will bring in roaches or dirty boots through the house or whatever. I don’t care if things get a little cluttered, but I do care about sticky countertops, grimy floors, stuff along the lines of that.\n\nSo about 3 months in, after we’ve both fully moved in, I started noticing little things, such as I would always have to do his dishes, clean the counter tops, etc. I would go downstairs, make dinner, do ALL of the dishes, clean the sinks, clean the countertops, and after dinner is done for me, the kitchen is cleaner than when I went down to start making dinner. As soon as I’m done, I hear him go down to make dinner, no big deal... I wake up to get ready for work, make my coffee etc. the kitchen is a fucking mess. Countertops have spices and oil and salt and are all sticky, none of the dishes are done (mind you, all he had to do was rinse them off and put them in the dishwasher and run it as I had already put all of the clean dishes away) the microwave is disgusting, smears of gunk on all the cabinets,  there’s wrappers on the countertop, even the nozzle to the kitchen sink has dried food all over it. Just filthy. I take the hit, and deep clean everything, and let him know he needs to clean up his mess better when he cooks. Now, this is a cycle for months. I clean, he makes a mess, I clean and remind him, he makes a mess and round and round. I tried talking to him, i tried not cleaning up his messes so he’d take initiative and clean, but nothing works. So there’s that. \n\nNow on to a more troubling topic. He has a dog, she’s a bully breed, about 2.5 years old, and he doesn’t take care of her. She sits in her cage 16-22 hours a day, her nails are so long that the tips of her pads on her paws barely touch the ground, she’s under weight, and she’s a fucking tornado. When she does let the dog out for the day, MY shit gets chewed up (mainly shoes). I have a very well behaved dog who roams freely throughout the day, as he knows how to behave and I spent copious amounts of time training my dog. So naturally, I feel bad for this poor dog being in its cage, and I’m sick of seeing it look all sad and occasionally the dog will pee/poop in its cage and sit in it for hours and hours. The dog is not fixed, so when I let her out, she bleeds everywhere and I’m sitting here cleaning up someone else’s dogs period blood. No bueno. So I talk to my roommate, tell him it’s not right and give him the rundown of how he needs to spend more time with his dog and that he needs to take some responsibility for her. He snaps at me saying “I’m getting to it, I’m just super stressed and busy and don’t feel like talking about this.” Okay... I do my part and pick up the slack. For about 3 months, I’m taking this dog to the dog park, bathing her weekly, cutting her nails weekly, getting her back up to weight, I’m investing a LOT of time into this animal, when I work quite a bit more than my room mate. I’ll be downstairs playing with his dog trying to keep her busy, while he comes home, goes straight upstairs, and smokes a bowl and stays up there. I’ve asked him numerous times to get her fixed to which his reply is “I don’t have the money”. The last time he told me he didn’t have the money to get her fixed, he came home with a $150 bong, and a brand new memory foam bed and bedframe. So I tell him that I can’t keep caring for his dog, because I’m starting to get attached and when we move out, I would like to take the dog with me. I know I don’t want two dogs though. So I ask him, “would you want me to help you get rid of your dog?” To which he replies “if I got rid of my dog, I’d have a new one within a week because I get lonely”    .....? Even though she sits in her cage 18-22 hours a day if I’m not taking care of her??? \n\nHe doesn’t see anything wrong with his actions and when I confront him about them he just says “you aren’t home all the time so you don’t see me take care of things around the house” \n\nThere’s a ton more shit that happens, but I know this is getting lengthy and becoming more of a rant. So am I the asshole for telling my roommate that I plan on moving out in April?\n\nTLDR I have a roommate that doesn’t clean, neglects his dog, and all of the responsibilities of the household fall on to me and I’m sick of it and want to move out by April.",

      "description": "I game online often, it's one of the hobbies I'm most passionate about. I have a lot of fun, but I'm also serious about it and I try to move up the ranks competitively primarily in fighting games. My boyfriend isn't a gamer, I tried to get him into it early in our relationship but he said I took it too seriously, so most of the time he just watches and cheers me on now which I'm fine with.\n\nI've been trying my luck playing Mortal Kombat competitively recently, and I've been having a hard time adjusting. I was venting to my boyfriend who tried to cheer me up and came to sit and watch me. I hit my stride and started doing much better and I was talking myself up for confidence, and \"trash talking\" my opponents but not actually to them, just in the privacy of my living room. I guess this got on my boyfriend's nerves, because he got up and left the room. I called him back and asked him to watch how good I was doing now and was playing around by talking smack to him about how easily I'd win. So he comes over and I end up losing both rounds badly, as in completely lop-sided to the point I might as well not have even been playing.\n\nMy boyfriend started laughing hysterically. The hardest I've ever heard him laugh, to the point where his eyes were running and his face got red. I felt incredibly humiliated. I get the comedy, it was karma, but the fact he knew I was serious about wanting to do better and started laughing instead of trying to make me feel better really hurt my feelings. I got upset with him and told him he was hurting my feelings, but he couldn't stop laughing. When he finally stopped I confronted him and asked him why he was being an asshole about it and rubbing it in, which I guess pissed him off because he said that if I can't see why it's funny that I lost that way after talking shit then it's not his problem and that he's sick of the immaturity and how I suck the joy out of things by taking it too seriously and he's tired of the negativity every time he's home and I'm gaming. I got upset and went into the bedroom. He didn't follow me and about 30 seconds later started to laugh again from the living room.\n\nI feel like this is completely out of left field and I'm embarrassed and angry. I take it seriously because it's a big part of my life, everyone has their hobbies and passions and this is one of mine. I spend hours practicing and trying to succeed and it's my way to let off steam. I feel like he completely trivialized how important it is to me, but he's so insistent that I'm being unreasonable and petty that I decided to post here.\n\nTL;DR boyfriend laughed at me after an embarrassing loss on a video game and we can't decide who was wrong",

      "description": "The title explains most of it already but i'm a little torn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright so this happened in November of 2018, at the time we were in a relationship for about 2 months (doesn't seem like a lot but i have severe abandonment issues and get clingy fast (tryna fix that one) ) at this time i haven't seen her for about two weeks because she was too busy with school (we're both in college) meanwhile she would get increasingly annoyed if i suggested that we do anything together. So I started bracing for impact which evidentally a couple days before december I got the message over discord: \"wanna drop it\" she wanted to put our relationship on hold until july when our summer break starts. Now for a quick look into myself, i have already had a similar experience to this which drove me to a very unstable state therefore I said i couldnt. She started sending me links to articles on why it sometimes is better for a relationship to go on hold, me getting increasingly frustrated said that \"putting a relationship on hold is beating around the bush for a breakup\" she didn't take kind to that\n\nA minor fight happened but it ended in breaking up. \n\nI feel like i could've been more understanding but i still stand by the decision i have made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow my question is: Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: my then girlfriend had a rough time with her studies and didn't have time for a relationship during this and wanted to go 'on hold' for about half a year i said that i emotianally can't do that and that's where we agreed to break up",

      "description": "My roommate’s sister is staying with us during the weekends in January for work. Originally it was supposed to just be one weekend, but it turned into every weekend, and my roommate never asked me if it was okay or even told me the plan until I asked him. They are really loud together, and his sister sleeps all day in the living room, making it hard for me to do normal things without waking her up like cook, watch TV, clean, etc. Because she sleeps all day, she is constantly loud at night or in the early morning which is annoying because the weekends are my only days to sleep in. \n\nHis sister is bringing her 6-month old baby with her next weekend, and again, I was never asked if this was okay. They are planning on staying for 4 days instead of just Saturday and Sunday. \n\nMy roommate and I adopted a kitten last week (mutually agreed upon decision, he does not belong to just me or just my roommate) and he has been saying that the cat needs to be kept in the bathroom or my bedroom while the baby is here. We live in a small, 2BR apartment and the bathroom is TINY. We kept him in there for the first few days that we had him so we could litter train him, but now he’s a free-roamer because we know he won’t have accidents or scratch our stuff. He is still a kitten though, so he has a TON of energy and is still doing things like pouncing on feet and swatting at hands. \n\nUnderstandably they don’t want the kitten to scratch the baby, but I feel like it’s unfair to my cat (and to me) to confine him to one area. I would need to either move his litter box into my bedroom (gross) or lock him in the bathroom  (cruel), and I don’t plan on doing either of these things. I’m fine with HELPING to control the cat, but ultimately I feel it is their responsibility to keep the baby away from the cat. AITA? \n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway. I am 21F and graduated from college last fall. My sister is 24 and also graduated last fall from a more prestigious university on a full scholarship. I busted my ass to graduate early and reduce the cost of my education. I went to college out of state, in school I had multiple internships and a campus job. One of those internships led to a job.\n\nNow I have a job that I absolutely love and am financially independent from my parents. I now have a lot more responsibilities and bills between rent, student loans, car loan/insurance, etc. I spend my days working, at home I workout, eat dinner, then time for bed. My weekends are doing chores and catching up on sleep.\n\nWhen I see what my friends are up to I find myself judging. They are incredibly immature to me like their priorities haven’t changed since high school. I feel like are concerned with being pretty/skinny or getting the right selfie and keeping up with drama rather than being financially independent. I worry about their ability to find a job if an employer saw their social media.\n\nMy biggest issue is with my older sister. I should preface this by saying that we are extremely close. Honestly her taking a scholarship enabled my parents to help me attend university out of state. Even though I had to take loans, I would owe way more if it weren’t for her so I appreciate that deeply.\n\nAs I mentioned she graduated when I did from an honors college with zero debt. She never worked during school, only summers. After 4 months she is still living with my parents and made no progress finding a job. She spends her days smoking and going on tinder dates. She still expects an allowance even though she lives in dads house rent free and eats his food, they have recently been fighting about giving her money until she gets a job. I bought a flight home to visit. My sister texted and said “Hey can’t wait to see you! Did you purchase the tickets yourself?” It was clearly supposed to be a gotcha moment trying to catch my parents giving me money when they said they don’t want to give her any. \n\nAt times I got the feeling that my sister and friends think everything I have now was handed to me or came easily. They dont respect the work I’ve done as they did not witness any of the blood/sweat/tears that went into my degree or landing my job. When they complain to me I struggle to feel sympathy and feel about by their frivolous BS. I am now dreading my upcoming trip home. I haven’t said it to them and don’t intend to, yet I feel like a terribly shitty person for silently judging the people I care about instead encouraging them to achieve what I know they are capable of.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole for thinking less of my sister/friends because we have different priorities? Should I just get my head out of my ass or do I have the right to be annoyed?\n\nTLDR - I am transitioning into adulthood and my friends are stuck in their ways. I’ve become bitter. AITA?",

      "description": "We live in a moderately affluent school district where there are some families that are well off.  The High school is good- good academics, great arts programs.  I make a good amount, but due to poor decisions in the past, am living paycheck to paycheck.  Almost the standard in the US I think these days- a couple thousand in medical bills that I am paying fine, several more in credit cards- I am not behind but have little in the way of savings.  \nEnter the once every 4 year super mega band trip.  HAWAII!  We live in the Midwest.  Cost for the trip BEFORE airfare is $2700.  Airfare expected to be at least another grand. that works out to a $300/mo payment each on the handy payment plan.  I have 1 kid that never asks for anything, and is the saver who is all F this trip- lets save money and go somewhere else. I have the spender who is an incoming freshman who is all \"I want to go and i will save money and work even though i have never done it before\"  I think it is irresponsible for the directors of the band to plan out such an extravagant trip- it isn't like the rose bowl or anything- the kids will be using rented instruments to play a concert in a park.  I feel like this is really a haves vs the have nots- and I hate that feeling.  Am I the asshole for not wanting my kid(s) to go on this and questioning \"when is enough enough?\n\nfwiw- yes there are opportunities for fundraising, but we have alienated a pool of people seeing as we lean blue in a red state, and we already raise $1000 a year for the normal band fees and another $1000 for Show Choir.

We aren’t allowed to touch it until we are 25/graduate as is set out in her will. \n\nSince then, My mom remarried and had another son (my half brother) who is the biggest spoilt brat you’d ever meet (and also my new stepdad had a previous son from another marriage aged 18).

      "description": "My daughter, who is 19, is trying to get a restraining order against her ex. The whole situation is a mess, but basically the ex has challenged it so they have to have an actual hearing. He has hired a lawyer that sent her a list of questions to answer. These questions basically all centered around her consenting to be attacked/stalked/harassed my him because she initiated communication. Basically, she’s the victim but they’re trying to make her out to be a willing participant so the restraining order isn’t granted. Anyways, we paid for a lawyer for what was supposed to be the final court date due to the nature of these questions, and our concern for her safety. My husband told her flatly that we couldn’t afford to pay anything further. Long story short, his lawyer asked for a continuation because she didn’t provide some info prior to us hiring the lawyer, and it was granted. It’s $400 for an additional court appearance. My husband is adamant that we can’t afford it, but I think we should just charge it/set up a payment plan/take out a loan or something. Literally anything. He’s brought up that she’s his daughter, not biologically mine, and that we don’t need to go into further debt when her maternal family should cover it. Which is a nice idea, but not realistic. He’s also brought up that it’s her issue as she did not return the info to his lawyer. Which yes, but I can only imagine how stressful and confusing this all is for her. I don’t want to go behind his back, but I feel like it’s necessary. He loves our daughter dearly, but we are financially in a pretty tight spot. WIBTA if I disregarded his financial concerns and paid for it anyways? ",

      "description": "Throwaway because I have family who know my Reddit account.\n\nSo for some backstory, my father was incredibly emotionally abusive to me as a child. He hit me on occasion, often as \"punishment\" but usually for very minor things you probably shouldn't hit your kid over. The primary abuse however was constantly attacking me verbally, calling me useless and stupid, saying everything I liked and cared about was shit, etc. He put intense pressure on me to succeed academically and made me feel like I was a complete waste of oxygen if I so much as got an 80 on a test. Whenever I asked for help, he would agree then just berate me for not knowing what I'm doing. Basically, he made me hate myself, gave me extreme anxiety about school and people, and I made several attempts at ending my own life due to his treatment. My mother did nothing.\n\nI'm 19 now, living with a family friend because being at the house I was raised in gives me extreme levels of anxiety. My parents are in the process of divorce because my father cheated, and what a surprise he tried to make all of us feel like it was somehow our fault he did so. Regardless, in general for the past couple of years he's \"seen the error of his ways\" and made attempts at being nicer. Although he still barely paid any attention to me, he at least wasn't calling me a fucking waste. I am attending therapy for the first time in years for my anxiety, depression, and agoraphobia, although finding medication is difficult and I have extreme panic attacks. My father lives with his gf, and the only time I've seen or spoken to him in the past 2 months is when he took me to a therapy session one time (which he only did after me and my mother basically begged him for a week).\n\nMy therapist suggested me adopting a dog to help with my panic attacks in public places. There is very little specific training necessary for this, so the cost is really just the dog and what a standard dog needs. I have the money for the dog itself, but not enough saved (had to leave job due to the panic attacks), however the family friend I'm with offered to help me since they already have a dog of their own. \n\nI asked my father to take me to the animal shelter to adopt a dog, my mom is injured and can't drive, and initially he agreed. However the next day he was berating me in texts, saying that my mental health would make me abusive to the dog, that he could not condone me having a pet because I don't have a job. I basically told him he has no right to tell me what to do with my life, since he never cared before and has treated me like shit. For the first time I actually told him that he is the primary reason I'm so fucked up, and that I no longer want him in my life in any capacity. He didn't reply, and still hasn't.\n\nI told my mom and she called me entitled, said I was disregarding all of his \"effort to change\", and that it was petty of me to do this over a dog. I really think I'm in the right and my dad's a dick. So, AITA?",

      "description": "TLDR: guy hit me while I was parked, does a lot of damage, leaves his name and number. I ask 4 times for his license plate number, get a different excuse every time. Report incident to HR. Guy gets fired the next day. AITA for reporting it?\n\nSo I’m working at a large construction site, and the parking situation is not ideal. I usually park in the far back, away from all the contractors. One day I was running late, and had to park near the front (where it’s packed) to get to a meeting on time.\n\nAt lunch I find a GIANT ding on my front bumper. It’s torn half-off. The guy who did it left his number. Not great but so far he seems honest and reasonable.\n\nI call, and he claims that we should spilt the cost 50/50.... even though he hit me while I was parked. Where I live, the person who hits a parked vehicle is 100% responsible. I said that, and he basically said “well I don’t have time to argue, we’ll talk after work”\n\nSo I agree, and we set a time\n\nI go out at the appointed time, and text him asking him to call me when he’s free. Nothing for 17 minutes. Text again. Call. Finally get in touch - apparently he “was waiting for me for 30 mins” and is back at work now. Sooo... didn’t see my text then I guess?\n\nI ask for his plate number, he says he doesn’t have it and will send it later. Ok.\n\nThree days and two text message reminders later, still nothing. He even pulled the “Who is this and why are you texting me” thing. \n\nSo, the next day I report the whole thing to HR. I hoped he would get a warning, and be forced to send his info. I’ll admit part of me wanted him to get a talking to for being a jerk.\n\nWell, today he messaged me saying he got fired. He also had a recent loss in the family and is going through a lot of stuff personally. Obviously I had no way of knowing that, but I still feel bad. Reasonably I should have known that firing was a possible outcome of reporting.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Okay I know this sounds shitty but hear me out. This guy pulls into the parking lot, I'm behind him, there's FOUR cars behind me. The parking lot is L shaped. We pulled in at the top of the L then this guy, as the FOURTH person is barely able to pull in, starts reversing. That put us about 2/3 of the way to the meeting point if that makes sense? \n\nNow I'm only about a car length behind him and there's a car parked directly across so he couldn't have even backed up and pulled forward. He gets half way to the spot he's trying to get into and waves me to back up. So I do the universal symbol for \"what?\" With my arms up and wave him to pull out and further ahead. Instead of being a normal person and accepting this he rolls down his window and yells \"what's wrong with you lady? I'm just trying to park!\" So I back up a bit rather than having a stand off and he then CONTINUES TO YELL AT ME INSTEAD OF MOVING AND HOLDING UP THE NOW SIX OTHER PEOPLE WAITING. \n\nNaturally I flip him off and he starts moving then stops and again yells \"what is wrong with you?! What is your problem? I'm just trying to park!\" He finishes parking then I flip him off again and hollar \"you're holding up everyone for the sake of being a dick!\" and drive past him.\n\nIn case anyone wonders, this particular parking lot only has a drug store, credit union, and liquor store and is never full. There is always parking directly in front of the stores. It's never a hassle. So this guy could have easily parked somewhere closer to where he was going and not held up 7 cars. \n\nI know it wasn't a nice thing for me to be hollering at him but I feel like since he started it, he deserved it.

      "description": "Okay so this may seem like a really small issue, but it’s caused a lot of tension between my girlfriend and me.\n\nI always tend to double check places before I leave them to make sure I didn’t lose anything, and the movie theatre being dark and all makes it a significant place for anxiety. My girlfriend and I went to the theatre and once the movie ended, I got up and did my usual routine: search under the chair and around for a couple seconds to make sure we didn’t drop anything.\n\nHere is where the problem is. In the process of searching around, I was holding up people from leaving their aisle and the theatre. In my mind, it was easier for me to take a few seconds to search around instead of have them awkwardly squeeze by us.\n\nMy girlfriend has begun to use this as evidence for how unaware I am of my surroundings and how I can be immature, as it was rude and inconsiderate of me to have held those people up. She says that I took too much of their time while I was searching around (it couldn’t have been more than 4-5 seconds, and she agrees on this) and that if I was more considerate, I would have let them go first. I find this unfair, because I thought it might’ve just been easier to quickly search and then head out instead of causing an awkward scene where people had to pass by me. They also could’ve gone the other way if it was that much of an inconvenience. \n\nAITA for checking around for a brief amount of time to make sure I didn’t leave anything instead of letting people go ahead of me right away?

      "description": "My girlfriend and I recently moved in together. Before moving in with my gf I was a frequent pot smoker. However I had to give it up when I moved because our apartment is no smoking.\n\nLast night I smoked a blunt at a friends place.  Afterwards on my way home my nose started to really bother me. It hurt badly and by the time I got home my nose was also stuffy and runny. (bad reaction was caused by a nasal spray I’m on)\n\nMy girlfriend got really mad at me because I sometimes snore and because she was sure i’d be snoring tonight bc of my nose. She was already going to be getting less sleep that night because in addition to her normal 9-5 at work she also had to work from midnight to one remotely over the Internet.\n\nI apologized and told her that this has never happened to me before. I then offered to sleep on the couch and she told me no. However my girlfriend continued to complain about my future snoring. So I said screw it and grabbed my pillow from the bedroom and layed down to sleep on the couch. \n\nWhen my girlfriend noticed she started in on me again and told me to sleep in the bedroom with her. I told her I really didn’t mind the couch, and I actually had a doctors appointment the next day so I didn’t even have to be up warly for work so it didn’t bother me if I didn’t sleep that great. My girlfriend would not let me relax, told me she would get lonely in the bedroom all by herself, that I would ruin the couch by sleeping on it, and insisted I move back to the bedroom.\n\nSince she wouldn’t give me any peace I said fine but made her promise that if she came to bed and I was snoring she’d wake me and let me go to the couch. Well when she came to bed she immediately woke me up by yelling at me that I was snoring, she yanked the comforter off me and took her pillows off the bed, and said she was going to sleep on the couch.\n\nI started arguing and tried to insist that I take the couch, but my girlfriend would not be denied and refused to let me take the couch. I woke up this morning to an angry and cranky girlfriend. She was nasty before she left in the morning and didn’t even say goodbye when I said it to her. I tried texting her after my appointment and she continued to tell me how angry she was and how I shouldn’t have smoked and I shouldn’t have forced her to sleep on the couch.\n\nNow I do feel bad for her because she slept badly. And I feel bad that I had that bad reaction to the blunt because I obviously don’t want to snore. So i’m being nice to her and apologetic. However I take exception to her saying I “forced her onto the couch” and i’m the reason she got so little sleep. I repeatedly tried to sleep on the couch. I told her at least 15 times that it didn’t bother me. And when I decided to just do it she wouldn’t leave me alone and let me sleep. I feel like in this situation my girlfriend made her own bed (bad pun intended)and she shouldn’t be angry at me for sleeping on the couch. AITA?",

      "description": "So I live in the PNW and we’ve recently been hit with a lot of snow and icy roads. I was hanging out with my bf and was really hesitant about being on the roads for any longer than we had to be. He insisted he’s a great driver in these conditions but that didn’t help my worrying go away. While we were driving he intentionally was speeding and I told him to stop because it was really scaring me. \nHe stopped for a while but then he started to INTENTIONALLY skid around on the ice. The first time I asked if he’d PLEASE stop because I was on the verge of an actual panic attack and I was seriously freaking out. So he stopped and apologized. \n\nLater that night we had to go get some food and he forced me to come with him even though I really didn’t want to be in the car with him after what had happened earlier. He decided it’d be a good idea to drive dangerously on purpose again and I freaked and screamed at him to stop the car. It looked like he was really hurt and I know he’s really sad I screamed at him. He told me that wasn’t necessary, but personally I think it was. I feel bad that I had to yell at him but he was making me feel upset. He’s currently ignoring me until I apologize for yelling. \n\nSo AITA for yelling at him in this situation? Do I owe him an apology? ",

However i'm shocked to discover that not only is he racist, but he also takes this to the next level by tampering with the meat.\n\nA brown person ordered beef sausages from the counter which prompted the colleague to begin sniggering as if there was a joke i was missing out on. He proceeds to tell me that the beef sausages actually contain pork and made underhanded racist remarks about the brown customer, most likely not even a Muslim. He then interpreted my look of shock as amusement and proceeded to tell me how he also lies about whether meat is halal or not.\n\nHe gives me a lift to work every morning and if he was fired i would have to give up the well paid job as i would not be able to make it there (it's a 1hour walk). My father also has supported him financially in the past and i'm worried if he loses his job my father would have to continue this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.strawpoll.me/17411999](https://www.strawpoll.me/17411999)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTomorrow at 12/02/2019 GMT 18:00 i will update everyone on my decision which will be influenced by the straw poll.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate 3 12/02/2019 18:00 GMT, Today at work i confronted my colleague behind the meat counter, due to everyone telling me to report him i decided to confront him before doing anything. I asked him why he has a hatred towards \"brown people.\" he then looked at me angrily walked off in to the walk in freezer. I then saw him purposely dip his penis in a vat of mincemeat and a \"brown person\" Hindu ate it 40 minutes ago. I have decided to either tell my dad tomorrow when he gets back from work or report him on the Friday. Thank you for giving me the confidence to take action, i believe he has some sort of mental issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate 4 15/02/2019 GMT, thanks everyone for the help i reported the knobhead, he's been working there for years and it seems no one has reported him but me.

      "description": "So my background is that I'm currently a high school senior (17M) and my girlfriend (17) is also a high school senior and here's the problem I have with our plan;\n\nSo we are both going to FSU (I applied and I want to go because FSU was my #1 choice and it has nothing to do with where my girlfriend was going as she was originally going to go to UCF after a gap year) and I love her a lot (we've been together for about a year and a half) but the thing is back last semester I was responsible for her much more than I wanted to be. Personally this is my first long term relationship and I know I'm extremely young, but I would basically wake up earlier than I used to so I picked her up from her house which is about 10 minutes and a drive on the highway away from mine, then another 8 minutes to school, and I still pick her up and drop her off from school. I tried talking to her about the whole morning pick up thing because it stressed me out a lot when she'd get angry at me for being late but the truth is I'd be tired and late because of traffic or something else and she put it on me that I don't love her or that it isn't the same etc. Eventually I got in trouble with my parents for this and her friend gives her rides to school now. \n\nAnyways, I digress: so she's pressuring the idea of living off campus from FSU (which my parents don't know about) so that we can be together in the apartment and she doesn't want to live on campus from fear of feeling suffocated by school and I may want to live on campus for the first year so I can get that full college experience and so I don't get sidetracked from my schooling, and we talked about the pros and cons today and she kept telling me how stupid of an idea it is and how it's better to live off campus and she gets mad at me for not making an immediate decision. The off campus and on campus are relatively similar prices (on campus for one year is $3500 AVG and off campus is a few hundred $ cheaper. I don't want to have to be responsible for her like in high school where I have to give her rides to class all the time (keep in mind she still doesn't even have her learner's permit and I told her for over a year to start taking drivers ED online) and I just can't do it. I told her I want to stay on campus to be more involved and she keeps telling me that I'm already stressed out being in Student Government and HOSA for high school that I couldn't handle it as a senior and it doesn't matter, but to me it does very much matter because I'd like to go either to med School or graduate school for medicine (my major is NFA Behavioral Neuroscience and hers is something with art). She doesn't understand the amount of work I'd have to put in to even be a good applicant for Med School or graduate schooling and doesn't quite 100% understand the work I'm willing to put in for it, which brings another worry that she may get frustrated with how often I work (she doesn't currently have a problem with how much I work which including school I have two jobs but she is very emotionally dependent). I doubt my parents would let me get an off-campus residence regardless and it makes me wonder how she'd react and I'm at such a dilemma. I want to have fun in my earlier years of life and college, I want to have the full experience, I don't want to sacrifice my relationship so I can have a drink once in a while (I do want to party sometimes, and in my culture it's very common for people to drink wine often, but she's very conservative about that and she doesn't agree with drinking because it reminds her of her father who is a very abusive figure in her family). \n\nI'm afraid of being tied down in the early prime years of my life but I love her very much, she's extremely talented at what she does, she helped me keep my head straight in school (I used to be a bad student) and she does make me very happy, we've had amazing moments in our relationship together, absolute bliss, but the reason I'm afraid is because we sometimes get in episodes where we constantly argue and we've almost broken up a few times in the past. If we do end up breaking up I'm not sure how we would feel still having to keep the lease on an apartment and my parents don't exactly approve of my relationship, they don't 100% like her but I think it's because we aren't the same nationality, and they're conservative immigrants who believe I should find someone of my own nationality (not RACE, but ORIGINAL NATIONALITY) instead. It's been killing me and I'm at a serious dilemma as to what I should do, and I'm new to Reddit so me coming here for advice may be a bad choice but I've seen other posts with amazing advice on this thread. Here's my plead for help, and please any advice or experiences in this type of thing would be extremely appreciated. Thank you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: We’re going on a break. Constant arguing and all, we decided beforehand that one of us would try to get a single dorm and that way we can be together overnight a few times a semester and see if we can handle the responsibility of one day being in our own sort of apartment, but also, yeah. We are likely breaking up, sorry for the wait, there’s more updates to come and frankly idk if I should even post them because at this point this is just a post about me being s little bitch about my relationship which isn’t what this subreddit is for but I mean hey if I don’t get banned from posting here or if I don’t annoy the living hell out of you all I might. Thank you all for the advice though, I don’t know if this is the end for us.",

      "description": "We dated for a year and something and worked together in the kitchen of a restaurant before the restaurant had to relocate. We broke up on good terms before the restaurant opened. Because I know the owners, I wanted a part time job to get some money for stuff and rely less on my parents. The owners asked her to come work as well.\n\nThat's when the nightmare began. I tried to remain neutral and keep her away, but she was obviously trying to catch my attention with annoying bullshit. She purposefully messed up my orders or went on breaks when there was a lot of work to do. To make things worse, I could only work when she was on the shift because of college schedule. I finally had enough, but rather than snap at her, I went straight to the bosses and told them that I've had enough.\n\nShe was being mean, disruptive and made me much more tired than I should have been, which made my work intolerable. At the same time, other people that worked with her told the bosses that the same was true on their shifts, when they worked with her as well. After some deliberation, they finally fired her.\n\nI think it's also fair to say that she doesn't have the best financial support and position, and this job helped her. But she's only 19 and can find another part time if she really wants. But was I an asshole for that?",

      "description": "This happened rather recently to me and I’m still sorta freaked out and angry about it.\n\nI live on an Air Force base in the barracks. \nEach floor of the building I live in has a washing and dryer room with around 5 to 6 washers and dryers a piece. Early this morning after I got off of work, I stripped everything off my bed and got my clothes ready to wash. When I got back later that night, I took my clothes to the dryers and dried them. Since it takes a good 70 minutes to dry clothes in those machines, I went up to my room to wait it out. Once they were done, I went to collect them. \n\nThere’s no one else in the room besides another person folding and doing his laundry as well. He gives me a look, but says nothing to me. I pay no mind to him and load up my bag with my sheets and clothes. I turn around to check for my socks and I realize that I dropped a lot of clothes on the ground while I was putting them in my laundry bag and going to the other dryer to get my sheets. As I pick them up I notice the guy has something in his hands, stretched out between his hands. I don’t pay it any mind until I realize that my favorite underwear isn’t in the mixture of clothes I dropped. I go to check my bag thinking I dropped them in already but I see that he has my underwear in his hands. He’s stretching them, inspecting the inside and feeling the lace along the sides all the while staring at them. I freeze and freak out for a second before thinking that he probably just wants to return them and is waiting for me to stand up or say something. I stand up and look at him expectedly with my hand outstretched at him before he turns around, with my underwear still in his hands. I say “hey” to him loudly and agitated and wave my hand at him, forcing him to turn around. \n\nMe: “Uh hey buddy, those are... My underwear that you’re holding.” \n\nHim: “I know.” \n\nMe: “Could you give them back to me?” \n\nMy hand is still outstretched and I’m basically glaring at this guy. I feel uncomfortable when people touch my clothes that I just washed, and seeing him manhandling something thats really private and personal infuriated me. We stare at each other for about a minute, both of us in silence, so I become a little forceful. \n\nMe: “Give me back my fucking underwear.” \n\nHe doesn’t respond and just pulls them closer to his chest. \n\nHim: “They’re warm.” \n\nAt this point I’m too baffled to say anything to him so I go up to him, snatch my underwear from his hands and go to my room to sort and organize my clothes. I’m still astonished at this as I’m typing it, but I’m so angry that I feel like I’m going to virtually explode. \n\nWIBTA for reporting him to my dorm manager? I know what he looks like, and there are cameras right outside the door to the washroom. I’m just afraid I’m overreacting here. \n\nWIBTA? ",

Intelligent, funny, incredibly sweet, and very pretty. I've never been great with women, and my buddy is as encouraging as one should be. At one point, he asked why I liked her, and I explained why and kind of said \"I don't see why a sleazy guy like me should be into someone so kind\". He was quick to say that I'm not sleazy, but...yeah I can be an asshole.\n\nI try to talk to her, and we have great moments. But I'm just so damn awkward. He's much better with her, but sometimes at my expense. I don't have a car because I'm saving for a motorcycle, and while I'm talking to her he brings this up, something he knows I'm insecure about. They can carry a conversation much better and I get to feel jealous.\n\nEarlier, I asked him if he wanted to hang out, and he said he was busy all day, but then later he posted a picture on Instagram showing him hanging out with her and being really chummy. I don't want to be mad at him, but it just feels like he's not being supportive or something. He was in a good relationship for a long time. Maybe 4-5 years,  but it recently ended on a sour note because she's dealing with mental health issues. I know he needs a win right now, but I feel like I never have something going for me. I don't know, maybe that's the wrong way to think about it. Please help.",

      "description": "For quick context: during social science class in the beginning of the school year (July specifically) our topic was about Marcos and Martial Law in the Philippines (google for more info cause its a lot, tl;dr wont do it justice). It's a very sensitive topic for many, but most of the class was able to discuss it in a civilised manner. This one girl though, lets call her Aya, defended Marcos and ML. Of course, many of the class didn't like it, and since it was the beginning of the year, it was our first impression of her. We collectively just decided to ignore her but there are also a lot of people who greatly disliked her after that, which was reasonable considering the topic.\n\nIt's the last month of school for us now. We were randomly assigned groups for our final project, and I ended up with Aya and my friend, who I will call Bee. Previously Bee was randomly assigned to be in a group with Aya and according to her, Aya is a nightmare to work with. I'm talking freeloader, doesn't actively contribute, gets distracted during group discussions, doesn't listen to the group's feedback of her work, and as a result her contributions are very lackluster. Since I wanted a good final grade, I still tried my best to be co-operative with Aya while trying to minimise tension between her and Bee. \nAya *was* hard to work with, but what made it worse was that Bee absolutely refused to work with Aya so I often found myself doing and fixing up most of the work. And during the whole time, Bee is messaging me talking about how bad Aya is and how she's so annoying meanwhile *she* doesn't do anything about it. I was tired of everything at this point, I called her out  for basically being a freeloader the whole time and out of anger said that she was worse than Aya in this situation. Bee got *really* pissed at me for that, saying how I was defending Aya's actions and that I probably don't even care that Aya is a Marcos apologist (when I do and she knows cause I talked about it with her) and how I don't care about what she feels or what she went through before (via when she had to deal with Aya in their previous group). Haven't talked to her since. Today, Bee started helping a bit with the work, but it doesn't even matter cause the deadline is tomorrow. \n\nI just feel really upset, guilty and stressed right now so I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. AITA? Should I have handled it better and been more considerate?\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend (20m) and I (20f) have been dating for a little over a year and we’ve had sex a couple of times. Last night we were hanging out with some friends at my place and it was hitting 2am, so I wanted to go to sleep soon and started to wind down the get together.  My boyfriend insisted that I come back with him since his roommate wasn’t there for the night, and I kind of didn’t want to. He got visibly upset with me so I agreed to come back with him. He hadn’t gotten any sleep the night before, so it was strange to me that he wanted to initiate sex being so tired. \n\nWe had some pretty great sex imo, but he wouldn’t finish. I tapped out after 15 minutes and he dragged it on for longer, and then, out of the blue, he asks for anal. We had never done that before, and I wasn’t even sure about how it felt nor was I mentally prepared. He had completely stopped what he was doing and kept insisting for it, so thinking that it might get him to finish sooner, I say yes, with a very clear boundary that if I said to stop, it meant we were stopping. I had read about it before hand so there was some preparation. \n\nHe was respectful throughout the whole thing, took it very slow, he said he was enjoying it a lot, but again, he wouldn’t finish and I don’t know why. He just kept going until I felt nauseous and told him to stop, I was out, I was exhausted and I couldn’t continue any type of intercourse at this point. \n\nHe stopped, cleaned up, and was very upset because he didn’t finish. I asked him why he wasn’t able to finish and he said he was holding back cause he really wanted to keep going, but I find that extremely hard to believe, going on for a little over 45 minutes at this point. He asked for a blowjob and I tried that but he was just taking way too long, at this point I felt like he wasn’t into me, nothing I did got him to finish and he ended up falling asleep very upset with me. I cried and I left on my own, and messaged him at 4am that I was hurt and didn’t want to talk for a while. \n\nHe messaged me and I told him my thoughts and he said that I was being petty and if I wanted to feel sorry for myself then to take as long as I want. I feel humiliated, I feel like I’m no good at sex and I’m still hurt and upset.\n\nAm I over exaggerating my feelings? I feel like I’m being selfish cause he got me to finish, but I tried my hardest and he just wouldn’t go over that edge.",

      "title": "AITA for talking about video games with my son and his teammates when video game discussion has been banned by their team",
      "description": "My 10 year old son plays house league hockey and has so for many years, but this year his team (manager and coaches) have forbid them from speaking about video games in the dressing room, during tournaments, and pretty much anytime they are around the team. This happened at the beginning of the year where they also forbid the team from naming their team The Brite Bombers (A Fortnite skin name). \n\nI admit that I maybe completely bias as I am an avid gamer. I play video games with many of my friends, both of my kids, and I also play with my kids and their friends. I love all types of games. I play board games, I play MTG, heck I even play a game for a living (I play poker for a living). \n\nI recently spoke with the team manager and some other parents at a practice and this topic came up and I said I don't understand why the kids cannot speak about video games. My son and I know at least a few of his teammates are upset they couldn't name their team the Brite Bombers and are annoyed they can't talk about what they like. Their team manager said it interferes with hockey. My response was I don't see how that could be.  I continued with saying as long as they aren't speaking about anything inappropriate then they should feel free to talk to their friends about what ever they wanted. The team manager responded by saying \"You're ok with them playing video games on their phone in the dressing rooms and in their hotels instead of bonding with their team?\" I responded by saying \"No, that's not what I said. I agree they shouldn't be on their phones in the dressing room and isolating themselves from the team. I always take my sons phone away as soon as he gets in the dressing room. What I disagree about is censoring our kids. Listen, they're 10 years old, youre not going to get deep discussion out of them by banning video game talk. Video games is like 90% of what 10 year old kids talk about. Ban playing them but lets not censor them.\" The other parents and team manager kept saying its bad for the hockey team. \n\nI feel like the disconnect comes from the fact that none of these parents play video games, seem to harbor some hatred for them, and also they come from an older generation. I am in my early 30's while the other parents are early to late 40's. I get along fine with all the parents but it seems crazy to me to censor our kids. I feel many of these parents are taking hockey way too seriously, especially for a house league team. \n\nI talk with the kids about video games and I dont see myself not talking about it with them if it comes up organically. If me and the kids just had a few epic games of Fortnite the night before, yeah I'm gonna talk about it when I see them next game or practice. So AITA or WIBTA if I continue to talk video games with the kids?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR Sons hockey team banned video game discussion, I agree with banning games but not censoring. I discuss and want to continue to discuss video games with my kid and his teammates. ",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to move to a different state before having kids?",
      "description": "So my fiancé (29M) and I (26F) have been dating for almost eight years. When I was 19 I moved out of my parents’ house on the West Coast of the US where I grew up, to the East Coast to be with him. Since then we have always talked about moving somewhere warmer because even though he grew up out here on the East Coast he says he is also tired of the long, cold winters. I never dealt with seasonal depression growing up since we barely had seasons (temps in the 50s were cold to me before moving here), but it was something I had to struggle to overcome after moving out here. We both ideally would want to move back to my home state because we both love it (he has visited my family out there with me many many times) but the area I grew up in is rather expensive. We have both researched and discussed the possibility of moving to other areas/states as a compromise, as long as they are warmer than where we are now. I absolutely love the beach and the sun and the outdoors and miss it all the time. He has about three more years at his job before he becomes vested with the state which would be smart to do for future retirement purposes. So I figured after he is vested we pack our bags and move like we have always wanted and then we start a family. We have never really been ready for kids up until this point but now he is starting to get baby fever a little I guess. Last night I told him I am hesitant to have kids before we move because I am afraid it would lock us down to stay here long term and we have both said we don’t want that. Having a kid complicates things and I would feel bad putting them into one school system just to pull them out, not to mention it changes the entire financial situation. He got mad at me and said I am withholding my eggs and using it as leverage and that I’m not thinking about a family with him for the right reasons. I’m just afraid I’d still be here with our kids ten years from now looking out the window at a cold winter storm regretting not settling down somewhere I truly love. Am I the asshole for not wanting to start a family without moving first, since it may not be for a few years from now?",

      "description": "TLDR; My mother (54F) lives in my brother's (29M) house rent free, sits around all day, and refuses to get a job. Recently denied disability. They can't keep paying for her and need help. My wife (31F) and I (32M) are financially stable but are feeling resentful about having to support her. \n\nThrowaway and first time poster here. So here it goes, are we the assholes here?\n\nMy mother has been living in my brother's house for the past two years in an in law apartment he had renovated for her. He lets her drive his car and provides a meal a day in groceries. This has him stretched thin but he was making it work. \n\nUp until recently she was receiving disability due to an illness that made it impossible to do the job she was doing. It wasn't remotely enough to support herself but with my brother's help she was making it work. However, after several years of payments, the disability/ retirement board heard her case and she is being cut off. After conferring with her physicians they made the determination that while she isn't able to do her old job, she is certainly well enough to do some kind of less physically demanding job.\n\nThis entire time, mother has been increasingly isolating herself in her room which has had a detrimental impact on her mental health (anxiety and depression). Any attempts to get her to engage, volunteer her time or do anything constructive are dismissed. She also refuses to look for a job, instead staying inside to watch TV or post on Facebook all day, every day. She has no plan to obtain a steady income and seems content to live off of my brother's generosity. This has my brother and his long term girlfriend (28F) very frustrated as they don't know how much longer they can handle this. The longer this draws on, the more obvious it is that to avoid her ending up homeless she will require someone to take on the burden of financially supporting her completely. \n\nNow my wife and I are financially stable. We both have good jobs that pay well but we have to work a lot of hours and we work hard for the living we've made for ourselves. We've also come to terms with the fact that we will have to take on some of the financial burden and we understand that it would be unfair of us to expect my brother to take on the burden of supporting her even if he were capable of doing so. \n\nHowever, we can't help but feel some resentment toward my mother who should be capable of supporting herself. She's only 54 years old and her physical health has gotten better to the point where she absolutely can work again but she chooses not to and is instead hanging onto the notion that she can appeal for more disability payments. Of course we won't let my mother go without a roof over her head but are we the assholes for being frustrated with her over this?",

      "description": "I come from a somewhat conservative household but it’s more my mom than my father. I’m currently 20 years old but at 16, I asked my  mother if I could get my septum pierced at 18. She basically mocked me for it and said no (which, to be fair sounds like what most moms would say). I ended up saving Christmas money until 18 to get my septum pierced after my birthday. At first, I hid it from her for a few days but I felt bad so I decided to tell her that I had my septum pierced. She ended up being super mad, telling me that I was a disappointment, etc. Til this day, she complains about how ugly I look with it and how no one will want to be around me. She says anyone who says it looks good is lying to me and that I look like I have no future (I’ve always been in a school and been actively looking for a job since I left my previous one). She also says that I look demonic with it. I’ve never taken it out because it actually makes me feel more confident about my nose. I  have always hated my nose and still hate how it looks when I have it flipped up. The piercing makes me forget about that insecurity and I just really love it! I don’t have a very big one, check my post history to see what it looks like.  Anyways, am i the asshole for not taking my septum piercing out since my mom hates it? ",

      "title": "AITA for distrusting my roommate in charge of the gas bill?",
      "description": "Background: I live with two other people. Utilities and gas are charged to the entire apartment instead of each tenant. When I first moved in, someone needed to put the gas bill in their name, and another needed to put the utilities bill in their name (electricity, ac, etc. are separate from gas). Of course the utilities bill is more expensive, and instead of talking about it with all of the roommates, one of my roommates just volunteered me to take the utilities  and she took gas. I had to pay $90 to even put the utilities in my name, and the bill has consistently been $70-150 a month (summer was difficult with ac). Gas is typically $5 a month at most for each person. \n\nWhen I pay for utilities, it takes both of my roommates at least a couple of weeks before paying me back for their parts. I always pay my roommate for gas as soon as she gets the bill. It’s frustrating dropping $100 and not getting 2/3 of the money back until halfway through the next billing period. I’m beginning to get frustrated with my roommates for not pulling their end when I am the one responsible for paying for the most up front. \n\nAnyways, it’s been a good month and utilities were only $50. I asked my roommates for their third as soon as I paid the bill. It has been over three weeks since I asked, and one of my roommates (the one in charge of gas) asked me to give her some time to pay her part because she’s running low on cash. I said it was ok since it was a lot less than it usually is. However, this week, she charged each of us $10 on Venmo for the gas bill. This is twice as much as we usually pay. Mind you, she still hasn’t even paid me for her utilities yet and is already asking for money from me (which even though it’s a higher than usual gas bill, I still owe her less than she owes me). Seeing as our gas bill is usually $5 each and she’s running low on cash and not paying me for utilities, I’m a little suspicious that she might be asking us for more than we actually owe. She hasn’t done anything like that in the past but it still feels sketchy to me and idk what to do. \n\nShe also just told me to not worry about paying her for the gas because I had to pay for my dog to go to the vet, but that just struck me as more suspicious. If someone owed me money (and they do), I wouldn’t just let them off the hook unless it really was just chump change — which it obviously isn’t for her. And if she was wanting to do that, then she could have just subtracted the amount I owed on the gas bill from the amount she needs to pay me for utilities. I’m worried she may also be expecting me to waive her bill as well. \n\nSo reddit, if I were to question her about the gas bill or ask the see the bill, WIBTA? I don’t want to accuse her of trying to take money from me and my roommate, but if I were to ask I essentially would be. Also, WIBTA for charging her for the full utilities if she waived my fee?\n\nEither way I’d also like some advice on how to deal with the situation. \n",

      "description": "Myself and this girl have been dating for 10 months now. We’ve been distance for the majority of it as she graduated college a year earlier than I did. We now live 6 hours apart and distance is much tougher on her than it is for me. She gets anxious if I don’t let her know what I’m doing. This is mostly if I’m around other girls (mutual friends of ours) throughout my day but it’s fairly rare that I hang out with them. She can not go more than 3 weeks without seeing each other, which until now has been fine. I have a light load of schoolwork so I had been driving up to see her nearly every weekend I had available.\n \nWinter break comes and I go stay with her for the almost the entire duration of the month and a half. Now that my last semester has rolled around, we’re back to the distance thing. This wouldn’t be an issue except for the fact that I run indoor track. Ive run track for about 9 years now and this is my last season I’ll ever run. The season ends soon. I have a meet tomorrow and a meet next week. I’ve repeatedly told her that once track is over I’ll drive to see her as often as I can but while I’m comleting we’ll have to wait.\n \nWe’ve been arguing a lot this week because I messed up and hung out with our mutual friend without telling her beforehand (something we’ve fought about before) - to the point where she says if I don’t drive up there tomorrow she has to break up with me. I’ve suggested that she come here instead but she needs me to make the drive to show her that I care. \n\nI don’t know if I’ve lost perspective or not.\n I’m lost and maybe left out details but I need other opinions I can’t sleep and my meet/ seeing her is tomorrow depending on what I do.",

      "description": "I come from a big family, my siblings and I are all in our 30s and have partners. Every other year we all celebrate Christmas together by getting together Christmas eve through to Boxing day. I am married and have a 4 year old dog, and a 6 week old baby. My dog is well behaved and has always attended Christmas with no bother.\n\n  \n\n\nThis year my BIL has decided my dog isn't welcome. I don't the why and cant get a straight answer out of him. He and my sister are hosting, so I understand that if they don't want the dog on the premises that's the end of it. However...\n\n1) they've had him there twice before. It's never been a problem in the past\n\n2) they didn't mention it would be a problem until after all the plans had been made, so we weren't able to make a different plan where the dog wouldn't be in their home\n\n3) we offered not to come, but my parents (who are getting on a bit etc) were so sad I can't do it to them\n\nSo today after 2 months of manipulative texts and phone calls etc I gave in and have agreed to take a taxi there and back on Christmas eve dinner and Christmas day lunch.\n\nThis means:\n\n1) spending a fortune on taxis\n\n2) waking up early to sort out the dog\n\n3) not having a crib there for the baby so she'll be overtired and screaming\n\nI thought I was ok with it, but its 0230 and I can't sleep because I'm so angry that I'm having to run around to make everyone else comfortable and wont be able to enjoy my first Christmas with my daughter. Am I being an asshole though?",

      "title": "AITA For telling my gf about my mental health / sexual issues?",
      "description": "So for the better part of my life I've had admittedly strange tastes and behaviors. It started off I believe by watching violent movies, and then I drifted into reading comics with a lot of gore, then finally into comics dedicated to extreme torture and internet snuff films. \n\nBasically a snuff film is a video of someone being killed. I mainly watch cartel and isis executions. I spent 4 years in the military and during that time I met others who I was able to share my interests with and sort of explore that part of myself with. I have NEVER translated these feelings into reality. I love animals and children. I just have less empathy for adults and I sometimes find slight humor and interest in watching murders.\n\nThis is also affects my sex life. I have several rape/bdsm fantasies. Rape is obviously wrong and id never do it, but I still have these feelings. \n\nNow, my girlfriend of almost a year is a great, wonderful person. She makes me very, very happy. Shes kind, sweet, and is very considerate of others. Shes pretty much the exact opposite of my \"real\" self. I do love her though, I know that because I get depressed when shes not around and I want to make her happy.\n\nNeedless to say she doesn't know that side of me, until recently. We used to have a very active sex life, I enjoy sex a lot and she says she likes my enthusiasm since it makes her feel desired and wanted.\n\nHowever, recently (the past few months) Ive had trouble performing. Its very hard to maintain an erection without thinking of either rape, or (rarely) violence. She has noticed and has tried to talk with me about it, which both emasculates and enrages me.\n\nShe is obviously not at fault. But its frustrating to talk about. Finally, after she tries to bring it up for a fourth time, I blow up at her. Screaming, slamming doors, what have you. I leave the house, and she blows up my phone asking what is wrong and if im okay.\n\nI answer her calls, and shes crying which makes me feel horrible. Finally I come back home, shes still in tears, I apologize and then decide to explain to her what I want.\n\nShes already sort of submissive in sex, and that was enough once. She thinks I wanted more of that. I then explain that I have a rape fantasy. She goes quiet, not really angry but sort of apprehensive, and starts asking me questions about it. I think shes sort of open to it at first.\n\nThen, like an idiot, I take this opportunity where I can finally talk about that side of myself and start explaining all my other thoughts and activities like watching the snuff videos and torture and stuff.\n\nShe goes from understanding to visibly upset again, she starts yelling, says that theres something wrong with me. Shes crying, I try to explain that I would never hurt her or anyone else who wasnt threatening me, that I love her so, so much.\n\nShe says she wishes I never even told her. We haven't been intimate and haven't really spoken since. I am so devastated as I really love her so much, shes so kind to me. Shes everything i wish I had in me, just a wonderful person, not awful like me.\n\nI wanted to open up to her and maybe talk about that side of myself and now Ive upset her, possibly traumatizing her and ruining our relationship all because I cant perform sexually and needed to tell her why.\n\nAITA for telling her about my interests?",

      "description": "This is more complicated then the title suggests. My best friend of 6 years broke up with his now ex around 4 months ago. They dated for about 2 and a half years. \n\nThey didn’t end on super bad terms he just knew that he didn’t want to be with her anymore. He told me he had fallen out of love with her and really didn’t care about her anymore. \n\nWell after they broke up they were still having sex casually which is stupid in my opinion but hey that’s them. One of the times they were texting he told her he couldn’t mess with her so she instead mentioned me.\n\nHe started questioning her and she admitted that she found me “irresistible”. He immediately texted me this when she told him. He basically told me to do whatever I wanted because they’re done. \n\nShe’s attractive and I have always thought so. Of course I wouldn’t act on things while they were together but since they’re done I figured why not hit her up. \n\nI need to make this part clear he told me it would be okay if I fucked her and that he didn’t care about her anymore. So I hit her up and we agreed on meeting up just to have sex. \n\nWell about a week ago my best friend and I are out at dinner and his ex comes up in a conversation. I don’t like keeping secrets from him so I told him that his ex and I had sex. He immediately freezes and tells me that I should probably leave. So I left. \n\nAfter that night we’ve hung out multiple times and things felt really weird. Tonight he told me that he’s angry with me and himself. He told me that he didn’t know that it would hurt him this bad. I feel bad for him and I obviously drift want to hurt him. I love him, he’s as close as a brother to me.\n\nI’m just as messed up about the whole thing as him. His friends are telling him to drop me because “you don’t just fuck your best friends ex”. I’m not going to justify my actions in anyway except purely that he told me that I could sleep with her.\n\nWell have at it. AITA?",

He knew her and I had gone on a date, kissed, and that then proceeded to ghost me, which affected me very negatively. When I told him (before the BBQ) that her presence bothered me, he told me that he invited her out of politeness.\n\nSo Saturday comes, and I go to the event around 22, this girl arrives around 23.30 and I began feeling really bad; even my other friends told me I suddenly felt disconnected. So around 1am, I decide to leave. I told my best friend that I didn't feel well around her, to what he responded that it made him sad that I was leaving and that he didn't feel it would affect me that much.\n\nI feel like an a-hole, and couldn't sleep properly for the last days.

We booked the trip about 6 months in advance so we could make sure to get off work and have the time for the holiday.\n\nIt was a nice resort location with 2 houses for me and my friends on the beach and we got great weather the whole week. The only thing the place was missing was both WiFi and phone reception so I couldn't text or talk to anyone that wasn't there with me. Sometimes my 4G would kick in but it would only be for a few minutes and eventually go away again. It was enough to get a message to my GF saying i wouldn't be able to reply much or talk to her all the time. I didn't actually go the full week without messaging her but I messaged her twice or three times a day except for one where I couldn't get a message to her.\n\nMy problem with all of this is that she got really upset when I came home because I wasn't messaging her enough even thought I told her my situation, and it wouldn't be too bad but it's affected our relationship to this day to the point of her getting angry with me for receiving a message from the same friends about booking another trip for this Summer.\n\nAITA in this situation?

      "description": "As the title states. I had an acquaintance I've known for years. I've never really gotten along with this person, for many reasons, but always tried to be nice.\n\nThis person is VERY peculiar. They don't like being asked 'How are you?' and become very easily upset by little things, such as giving them advice when they ranted about personal problems. Talking to them was like walking on eggshells. \n\nThis acquaintance made a post about how they never felt they could talk to people, or the people they talked to fell out of their lives. I contacted them to tell them why I had dropped out of talking to them because, if they had made a post being upset by that kind of thing, I didn't want to be a part of their upset. \n\nSo I told them why I had dropped out, because I knew talking about my problems with them may help. I didn't attack them, or accuse them or blame them, just tried to talk. In short, I listed why I felt it was hard to talk to them and how I felt they never really liked talking to me anyway, so I just dropped out, and wanted to give them that explanation and talk about the problem so we could maybe be friends.\n\n\nOn top of that, we had a mutual friend who had been kept from interacting with other friends because of this acquaintance. I mentioned to this friend if they felt that was controlling, and they said no. This friend told the acquaintance what I said.\n\nThey acquaintance blew up, and said that I needed to stop assuming things - which I'd understand if I'd accused them, but I really was just trying to tell them how I felt and worry about my other friend- and that they didn't want to be my friend anymore. \n\nWe worked it out after I just gave in and admitted I was wrong for trying to talk to them for how I felt, but they said they still weren't interested in being friends, even if I never felt we were more than acquaintances.\n\nNow I just feel stupid and even more like I shouldn't express my feelings, or I'm wrong for feeling them. \n\nHonestly, did I go about it wrong? AITA for trying to tell them the negative things I felt about our 'friendship?' How do you handle this kind of thing?",

      "description": "I am a low level supervisor at a fairly large business that routinely organizes parties for local offices. We had an in office super bowl party complete with drinking and snacks and a massive tv.\n\nIm not a huge sports fan but i showed up anyway. I have twelve people under me and most brought a date. Plus my bosses and ppl from other departments. I went stag as im single.\n\nAnyway since i dont care for football i spend most of my time hanging out by the makeshift bar and snack stand and an employees wife is with me. We hit it off joking about our lack of football knowledge and just generally joke throughout the night.\n\nA couple hours in and we've both had a lot of drinks. \n\n\"So you came alone?\" She says. I told her this before early on.\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\"\n\n\"Not completely alone.\" \n\nAt this point she forcefully grabs my crotch. I am shocked and sort of have a nervous laugh reaction which might have encouraged her as when i put my hand on her wrist to push her away gently she started \"groping\" me through my pants.\n\nAt this point the following exchange happens.\n\n\"Haha, whaaaat?\" I push her off me in a playfull way.\n\n\"Haha sorry.\" She replies\n\n\"Nah its okay I just need to go to the bathroom\"\n\nI then walk away and dont speak to her the rest of the party. At least until the end and we're all walking out and shes hammered. She calls me over to her as im walking out and kisses my cheek while putting her phone number in my hand.\n\nI just say bye i had a nice time and i leave.\n\nI have sort of resolved never to speak of this again but im joking with my best friend about it and he says i should tell my subordinate. I dont have any real relationship with my subordinate so it would be awkward. I also think, maybe if I did text her it wouldn't be such a bad thing? Like maybe they have an open relationship? Idk im kinda hung over right now.\n\nWhat do you guys believe.",

      "description": "I'm just beyond frustrated at this point with it. I've talked to her about it and she swears she's improving but nothing has changed. For months now I get phone calls where she's freaking out and asking if I'm alright. She calls and ask where I am, that I said I'd be home ages ago, etc. But she does this at 10:20 when I said I'd be home between 10 and 10:30. \n\nShe assumes that the worst has happened to me when I get off work so much as 5 minutes late, and is angry I could not send a message. Because I was busy, at work which she know. I call her as soon as I get off as well, and she asks me if I'm okay and if everything's okay and tells me I worried her.\n\nI've already gotten in trouble with my boss (who by the way is never in my store) because other people told him I'm on my phone but it's just me trying to keep her calm because it's been two hours since I asked a question about an account or something. She's freaking out because on my 10 minute break I asked a question, she responded 20 minutes later and my next 10 minute break isn't for another 2-3 hours. She'll text and call asking if we're late or forgot to pay or whatever terrible situation you can imagine with an account. No, we're 2 weeks early but we had extra money so I thought I would pat it early, like I told her 3 nights before. \n\nIt's this constant worrying that has me on edge. I can't ask an innocuous question without her freaking out. The perfect example is last night. I asked her what we wanted to do for dinner. She responded by panicking and saying she totally forgot and now she doesn't know what we said and now it's going to be so late for dinner and I'm gonna starve. When, it's an hour before dinner and we never decided anything.\n\nI am getting increasingly frustrated by this. I have consistently communicated to her how frustrating this is. I have said it calmly. I have said it rationally. I have said it simply. I have explained in detail. \n\nAnd yet, today, another conversation she can't remember about money, a simple question asked. I have stayed calm. I haven't yelled at her. I want to. Oh I want to, but I promised her a year ago I never would and I keep my promise. \n\nTL;DR: wife thinks the worst has happened all the time and I'm angry about it. AITA here?",

      "description": "This might not sound like a huge deal, but I feel awful.  For context, I’m in Colombia with my parents (in grade 11 but doing school online).  Anyway, we were going into the metro station and there was a man selling bottled drinks from a cart, which advertised the price of 1500 pesos (just over 50 cents in USD).  This was right by the escalator going up to the station. I asked for one and he pulled out and held up a bottle.  I said “sí” as it looked the same and handed him 1500 pesos and took the drink.  My parents and I then turned and went up the escalator going up to the metro.  As we were going up he yelled something to me and pointed to the change.  I assumed he meant I didn’t get my change, and thought wow how honest.  I waved back to him, meaning “no problem keep the change”.  It wasn’t until a few minutes later that I considered, “wait why would he have been giving me change? I gave him the exact price advertised”.  I realized that he had given me the much larger size, and I had unknowingly payed him short.  I felt absolutely awful, because every peso means so much to someone in poverty here.  I have so much money compared to the people here, yet I just accidentally walked off leaving this man with likely no profit.  I mean I didn’t know this at the time, but I just feel like such an asshole for realizing it afterwards. ",

      "description": "About 6 months ago a friend and his wife asked if I wanted to share a place with them, as they were moving back into town. I was looking into getting out of my current living situation so I said yes.\n\nMy issue is my friend asks me a lot to get stuff from the store for him. Usually that would be fine every now again, but it seems to happen every week or two. If it was as simple as getting a gallon of milk or something that’s fine. However, usually the requests get on my nerves. \nFor example: friend was putting together a birthday dinner for his wife. He was freaking himself out and running around like a chicken with his head cut off cleaning and trying to make everything look nice. I got home from a long day at work and he asked me to go to the liquor store and get a bottle of wine. Usually I’d be fine with it, however he was going to be leaving in a moment to go to her favorite restaurant to pick up a to go order, and would’ve passed another liquor store. He wanted me to save him the 10 minutes by spending 20 of mine  since I “wasn’t doing anything”.  Ended up being a big deal even though he ended up getting the wine and having more than enough time to fix everything. \n\nAnother time he asked if I would go out Black Friday morning and buy a TV for him since he was working. He did offer to pay but I made up an excuse as to why I didn’t want to as I hate crowds and was planning on taking advantage of having that morning off since my company was going to be closed. \n\nThe most recent was mentioning that I was going to go to sports store to pick up some gun ammo. He asked me to pick up an accessory for him and he’d pay me. I half jokingly asked him to just pick up some ammo for me, since it sounded like he was already planning on going at some point since he needed his ammo. His response was that he didn’t think of it till I mentioned I was going to that store. \n\nNot to mention the numerous times he asks me to pick up items, even when I ask if anyone wants a ride to the store. He will wait for me to get there and then call me with his request.\n\nI’ve brought it up with him before saying I don’t like it, that I’m fine with helping friends out but he asks for favors way more than any one else i know. He said, “yes I do, because you live with me”.\n\nAm I the asshole? My reasoning is that I hate having to bug them for money to pay me back for the items I get. In addition if they have time to get these things,  why do they ask me to help out? If they truly had no time I’d totally understand. My position is that simply because I am roommates with them does not mean that I should help them with their errands for their personal items, even if it isn’t that inconvenient for me. \n\n",

There’s a coffee shop near my office that I like to go to after work, probably 2-4 days per week, where I buy a drink and then sit with my laptop, wearing headphones, working on math problems for the material I’m learning. It’s a pretty big cafe that I’ve never seen at more than 20% capacity, so it’s not like I’m preventing other customers from sitting down, but I still feel awkward sitting there for so long, spending only a couple bucks on a tea. I’ve seen others do the same as me, but I think the fact that I do it so regularly makes me feel like I’m taking advantage of the spot, so I always leave a $5 tip when I leave.\n\nDoes the staff or owner there hate me?

      "description": "Ok, so a little background. My wife and I have been married for just over 7 years. From the day we met, she has known that I enjoy playing video games. I am definitely a casual gamer, but when a game comes out that I enjoy, I usually play it multiple hours a night until I either beat it or get bored of it. We have 3 kids, 2 together, 1 from a previous relationship I had, and I rarely start playing before the kids are in bed. Most of the time this cycle starts, she gets mad at me for staying up late playing the game, and for playing a game instead of going to sleep with her or doing something with her. For our entire relationship, I have tried getting her to just try playing a game with me, just to see if she would enjoy it. If I had to guess I would say she has actually done this less than 10 times, and most times it is only for 30 minutes or so. Everything we do together is based upon what she wants to do. If we watch a movie or show, she approves it. That's not to say I don't always want to watch it as well, but if it is something that she wants to watch and I don't care for, I usually compromise and watch it anyways, never the other way around. And it goes like that for everything we do. And that really doesn't bother me, honestly, video games are the only thing we don't really have in common.  \n\n\nShe doesn't understand why it is so important to me and says it isn't fair of me to get upset about it if she really just doesn't like it. I wouldn't say I get upset, just disappointed really. There is a few games that I know she would enjoy, but she just won't put a concerted effort. I tell her a relationship should be built on compromises and sometimes doing things that the other enjoys, even if we don't enjoy it 100%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - I love playing video games and want my wife to play with me, she refuses to.

      "description": "First I need to provide some context.\n\nBefore meeting Monica, she used to date a mutual friend, Paul. Nothing official, just one or two dates but I know a lot of chemistry was going on there because of what she told me. When I met her we used to date, but nothing official as well. I saw other girls and she also had social her social life. Things changed and after almost a year (I can't remember well) she was practically living with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped seeing other people and I thought she had done the same but we never talked about it. One day we were kissing and noticed a hickey. I asked what it was and she naturally replied that it was Paul. I was angry, but since nothing was official I simply said that I felt that our relationship was serious given the time and circumstances and that I understood that I had no right to demand anything, but I would not go ahead if she saw other people. She agreed and that was it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow comes the part that bothers me. Two years have passed and today Paul is my coworker and friend. In November he left an abusive relationship and his life and health came down. We did our best to help him. A couple of months ago we were buying new clothes for him. Monica saw a dress and asked if he would date her in that dress. At the moment I said nothing but this left me deeply disappointed, with anger and jealousy. When we got home I talked to her and said I was uncomfortable with her asking Paul if he would date her. She angrily said it was just a conversation, turned around and fell asleep. I do not know if she got angry because I felt jealous, for confronting her or the way I said it, but I did not want to insist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then I have noticed that she tries to boost his self-esteem with compliments I have not received in a long time. Almost every day we go to his house as soon as I get home from work and stay up late and she does not seem to want to leave. We do not have time for us because she does not want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has made me reevaluate our relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole of being jealous, even though his life is a mess? Was I the asshole for saying I was uncomfortable?",

I missed an important event ( football game lol )\n\nWhat really got under my skin is when they make comments like \"Oh carl you don't have kids or a job it's not like you're missing anything important\" or \"Carl you have plenty of free time, we hardly get any\".

She changed it back to the Queer Eye guy. I messaged her to let her know I would be changing it back and to not change it again, and she said she wanted all five profile pics to match because there were five guys on the show and we had a perfect number. I told her once again I didn't want to participate in thing thing that only she wanted, to which she replied pretty much \"Sorry dude, no pay, no say,\" and told me to \"take it up with the billing department\" aka my best friend.\n\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "  \n\nI admit I’m the world's biggest asshole at the start of this train-wreck. \n\n   \n \n\nFor reasons, I will skip the part on why I started using drugs.\n\n   \n \n\nAt the end of it all, after about ten months, I lost my home and all my possessions except those that could fit in my car. My wife had taken my two children, a long airplane ride away to live with her mother. I agreed and was grateful. I could not stop, even for my pleading wife and teary-eyed children. \n\nI lied to everyone and destroyed everyone's trust. I couldn't burn bridges fast enough. I was the brother that phoned and called you a slutty cunt for something from 20 years ago, the bastard that called our mom a fucking bitch for not loving me enough, she was to blame for my addiction. I have since apologized and tried to make things right, but many of those relationships are...very long gone. \n\nAbout a week before I was evicted, I 'came to' in my living room. I was surrounded by EMT, firemen, and sheriffs. The street in front of our house was packed with police cars and firetrucks and ambulances. I was totally, totally clueless. I was being handcuffed. Apparently, I called 911 something like 50 times in the space of thirty minutes. I was being arrested for 'harassing phone calls to 911' and taken to the local jail.   \n   \n \n\nMonday morning, the sheriff said I had a visitor. Now, I'm from Southern California, and it turns out my buddy from Long Beach hadn't heard from me in a few weeks, so he drove to my place. I wasn’t there. He asked my neighbors if they knew anything, and they told him I was arrested. Long Beach called our friend who lives in New York. He flew out, they met up and came to the jail. \n\nThe visitors were New York and Long Beach. They made a deal with the sheriff--if they would take me to a rehab, directly, I would be released.\n\nWhile waiting for the rehab to open, LB and NY put me up in a hotel but took my wallet, all my socks, my shoes, and my glasses. A few days later, all of us exhausted, I was in county rehab for six months. Rehab was paid by SSDI, (apparently addiction is a disability) meaning it was free. \n\n   \n \n\nAfter rehab,  I was living with my family again. Doing OK.  Long Beach calls and says I need to reimburse NY and himself. Flights were taken! Hotels rented! Pizza ordered! I have no idea of the amount, but I'm sure it is close to $2,000. I only replied to Long Beach with, \"Let me talk with my wife.\" Now, NY only replies to my texts with direct, short sentences. I didn't ask about money, just thanked him. He's washed his hands of me, and I understand and accept that. LB follows me on Facebook and I don't hear from him. \n\n   \n \n\nThat's the asshole part. \n\n   \n \n\nAITA for not paying them back, and making no movement in that direction? My only excuse is, \"I never \\*\\*asked\\*\\* you to do this for me, thanks should be enough. I didn't know you were itemizing and planning to bill me.\" ",

      "description": "So as a backstory: I'm not living at home anymore so on weekends I usually take the train home, which is a five-hour drive. Every Friday I'm driving with a neighbor and her son (I will be calling him Tom, he's about 8-9 at that time) as they visit their parents/grandparents on the weekend who live in the same town as my parents. I always bring some sort of gaming console with me to play on (DS, PSP, etc.) and always I let her son play on it for a while, which brings us to the situation.\n\nThat week I decided to bring my old Gameboy Classic for the first time which is literally my baby. I've got it when I was 14 from my older brother who bought it shortly after it was released and I always made sure that it is in top condition. And I let absolutely no one touch it as it is too valuable for me. So I'm sitting on the train with these two and started playing. After a while, Tom asked me if he could play and already reached for the console. I immediately pulled it away and said in the nicest tone possible: \"No sorry Tom. I'd gladly let you play with any other of my consoles but this one is very dear to me and I'm not comfortable with giving it away.\" Apparently, that had been the wrong thing to say as he said rather loudly: \"But I want it!\" and tried to rip it out of my hands which made me almost let it fall down. \n\nMe: \"I said NO!\"\n\nAnd at that moment his mother butted in: \"But you always let him play. And that thing is so old you that shouldn't be so cranky with somebody using it. There are already better things out there than that thing.\"\n\nI tried to explain to her what value the Gameboy has but she wasn't having any of it and neither did Tom who was starting to throw a temper tantrum.\n\nMother: \"I can't believe that you are so greedy! You always seemed so nice to me but apparently, you are not!\"\n\nThis was also told me by other passengers who \"couldn't believe that I won't share with a kid\", that I was \"a bad person for keeping this all to myself if I usually shared\", etc.\n\nThis made me really unsure if I really should have not given him my Gameboy because it is valuable to me.

      "description": " \n\nHi Guys!\n\nI have a weird relationship, 12 years, 10 married. Iv'e been a stay at home dad now for 10 years. I used to have a career, wasn't amazing made a livable wage for a 20 something. But it just wasn't enough to pay the bills so after her maternity leave I tried to get a big raise and failed. The wife had a better job anyways and a college education so she was our best bet to make it as a new family.\n\nFast Forward a couple of years, The kid is 3 years old. My wife and I had been using more conventional forms of birth control, condoms, eventually a IUD which she hated and was painful for her. So we started talking about other options. She is very mindful of her health. Constantly worrying about what hurts that day. She has her moments where she acts like a hypochondriac. But usually ends up not taking the doctors advice. Hormonal Birth control was never an option for her as she is totally against messing with hormones. So the first thing she suggested was that I go and get a vasectomy.\n\nIt took a couple of weeks to talk me into it. I talked with a couple friends I still had at the time, they seemed so taken back by the fact that her first idea was to get me fixed. I honestly sorta loved the idea of sex with no possibility of having another kid. At the time I was still coming to terms with my wife not being the motherly type. And not restarting the 18-year devotion clock sounded appealing. (side note. I raised a kid to about 3 1/2 years old with a different girl when I was 19-21. She left and moved back to her moms after she wasn't happy staying home raising the kid. She got on state assistance, state paternity tested me and I found out I wasn't the dad, so I was no stranger to how big of a job raising kids is.) This was our first kid together, she wasn't interested in having anymore, she had a dislike for people that devote themselves to their kids.\n\nSO I go I get snipped. We have tons of fun for years. I continue raising the kiddo. work some shit jobs here and there. Always take care of the house. do all the chores, all the kid work(take her to school, pick her up. make school lunches, doctors appointments)All vehicle maintenance(I was a vehicle tech before I left my career)to the point that we only have ever paid to have alignments and tires installed and balanced(I brought her car back from a cosmetic total when she crashed it, to only have her really total it 2 years later.)\n\nSo I like to think that I have done a pretty good job as a stay at home dad.\n\nLately we have been fighting a lot. And one of the things that seems to keep coming up lately is how she regrets not doing more with our kid in the early years. And that she feels I took those moments from her. I feel like I had no choice. By the time her maternity leave was ending she wanted out of the house, bad. I had come home one night from work, around 7:45pm. I open the door and my kid is in a jumper toy screaming her guts out. Wife is locked in the bedroom, I grab the kid pick her up and hold her. And suddenly my wife busts out of the room, doesn't say anything just leaves, and doesn't come back for an hour. This was when I realized that I had to quit working and just take care of the kid. She didn't want to subject the kid to daycare. Safe to say I thought she just wasn't a raising children sort of person. But lately we run into adorable kids while we are out with our daughter and she gets emotional and regrets her choices. Recently she got really mad at me for not wanting to get vasectomy reversed and that I was ok with not having anymore.\n\nI was like \"dude really?\"\n\nSo what say you reddit? Am I the asshole for not wanting to reverse the vasectomy that I wasn't thrilled about when I initially got it?",

      "description": "So I come to the gym, I warm up, and I see 1 of 3 squat racks are empty. One of the squat racks is taken up by my friend, so I decided to work out at the squat rack next to him. My friend, we will call him A, goes to the bathroom or something and leaves his stuff at his rack. So just when I start my set, a guy comes up to me and asks \n\nGuy : \"Who's stuff is this right here?'\nMe : \" It's my friends, A.\"\nGuy: \" is he squatting as well?\"\nMe: \"I think so\"\nGuy: \"Why don't you guys just work in with each other?\"\nMe: \"He does a lot more weight than I do, so it would be kind of inconvient.\"\nGuy: \"All you have to do is change out the weights man\"\nGuy continues to argue that I should work in with my friend\n\nNow, I would agree with this guy, however my friend is a serious lifter and can squat more than 100 pounds than I can. Additionally, me and friend are at different heights so we would have to constantly change the height of the bar as well. This guys tone was also kind of entitled, as if  we were supposed to work in with each other from the beginning. ( I know, a little biased). \n\nAt this point, I don't know if this is a normal thing gym people would ask each other to do, but in my 6 months of experience, this is a first for me. \n\nWhen I tried to talk to A and ask him if this was normal , the guy interrupted me and said: \"Yeah that's right, I told him that you guys should share racks. No need to hide it from me, it's not a secret.\" He would then sit somewhat behind us and just stared at us until a rack opened. Me and my friend just decided to share a rack in order to avoid this guys daggering stares. So, AITA for refusing to share a rack with my friend?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to invite my mom to my wedding?",
      "description": "Hi Reddit,\n\nSo let me start by saying that my fiancee and I are engaged, and have been since like mid-November. We're getting set up to have our wedding in July. We just sent out our save-the-dates a couple of weeks ago, and my mother did not make the list of people we've sent these to.\n\nI've had a pretty rocky relationship with my mom for most of my life. When I was growing up I never really has a concept of what it was to be a good mother and what it meant to be selfish and a mother who seems to have dulled motherly instincts. The man I grew up with around was not my biological father, rather a step dad, and I had really only known him to be my dad as my biological parents separated when I was two years old. My step dad was not really a nice guy and often acted out with his anger; nothing too severe that I know of, but when I wouldn't do chores, or talked back, I would often find myself getting whipped with a belt. I also chew my fingernails, for as long as I remember, I still do today. Back then, my parents tried to take action and would buy this weird formula from the store that you could put on your nails that put a horrible taste in your mouth, obviously to deter you from chewing your nails further. My step dad realized this was ineffective to me, I still would bite them, and I still remember him pinning me to the ground and basically dumping the remnants of the bottle into my mouth (though it was somewhat of a struggle so some on my face as well). I'm not sure to what extent my mom knows of these events, but nonetheless, the two of them got divorced when I was 10 I think. Needless to say, it was a pretty scarring event.\n\nI went to go live with my grandparents briefly who snowbird in Phoenix where we lived, while the dust settled and my parents sold the house and my mom got a new living situation set up. During this time my grandparents were going to take me on a road trip to go meet my real dad and my half-sister for the first time that I would remember; I used to live with them when my real parents were still married, but I don't have any memories from that age. I don't remember any event that took place that I wasn't allowed to go with them, but I still remember the hype for that trip vividly... it wasn't until I visited my grandparents over New Year's that I brought it up with my grandma, and I asked her why that trip never happened. She explained that it was because my mom simply didn't trust them to take me. She also pointed out that my mom was selfish and pointed out that the houses we lived in, my mom splurged on nice furniture -- a new living room set, a new master bedroom set, new dining room set, the whole shebang. My room was a bed, a thrift store particle board side table, and a Target TV stand in the closet.\n\nAnyway, I ended up living with my mom and would occasionally spend time at my step-dad's apartment. I think for a time my step-dad and my mom would try to work things out until they couldn't. I just realized one day I hadn't seen him in a while, and I never saw him again.\n\nThings were fine for a while, I had changed schools due to those events numerous times as my mom moved around trying to get settled. I was happy, we went on vacations and I had friends and was comfortable where we were.\n\nMy mother then started seeing this guy who quite clearly had bad habits. He would bring over some his friends (whom I remember being homeless, I'm not sure if this is true or not) when my mom wasn't home and drove a shitty old white van and had his hair slicked back and must've been Italian or something, he was a real greaseball. His name was Robert. I never liked him, he occasionally made an effort to get my involved with his handyman business he would try to start up and make jokes and stuff. But I hated him, he was so off-putting and strange.\n\nA breaking point came one day when I was in our office playing Roblox (this was 2007, I was such a pioneer) while I was on the phone with my grandma. I had my own cell phone and was charging it while on the phone, and I heard Robert come home with one of his friends, so I closed and locked the door to the office and kept doing my thing. He then knocked on the door and tried to come in, asking from the other side if I had a phone charger. I said yeah but I was using it, and he then proceeded to try and actually break down the door after I said I wasn't giving it up. I heard banging and yelling and he just couldn't get in, and my grandma was still on the phone and caught on. She was in Idaho at the time and called the local police from where she was at and had a unit dispatched. They showed up and my mom came home early after my grandma contacted her as well. I opened the door once things calmed down and the police arrived and there was a flathead screwdriver sticking out of the door frame like he was trying to break it off and get into the room. He was arrested that night and spent the night in jail obviously for a domestic dispute. I remember another time my mom had me call the police too because he was acting out, presumably because he was high as a kite. \n\nA couple of days later, I woke up early one morning to Robert telling me to pack some stuff up, I was going to live with my grandparents. It was before school time and I remember he brought me to my mom's place of employment to say goodbye (she worked nights as a nursing home). I had never been told I'd be leaving until that morning. It was an emotional temporary goodbye.\n\nA month or so goes by, and I'm attending a new school, and I'm meeting my dad and half-sister for the first time I'd remember. Obviously this got my nerves going a bit. Details here don't matter as much, I just continued my life somewhere new. I didn't keep in touch with my mom for a while, I didn't call or anything as it was sooo touchy. Eventually she decided she would come up to Idaho and start a new life up here. She actually did, and got her a nice house for rent a couple doors down from my grandparents. I was super excited.\n\nAnd then my mom decided she didn't want to live in Idaho, and moved back to Arizona, and I stayed there while she could set life up. I went back and lived with my grandparents again, and while there, she and Robert got married. That's what I lost touch with her for years.\n\nLife happened and I then lived with my dad and step-sister in Minnesota. I don't remember how but I got her address and wrote letters -- we did this for quite some time. In the letters she said her and Robert had gotten a divorce. I had let go of some of my extreme bitterness when I read this, and she brought up a point that still sticks with me - she said there's no handbook of how to be a good parent. She also explained that she thought it was in my best interest to live with my grandparents, which I couldn't argue. To this day, I can't tell if she was actually meaning what she said, or if she was just being selfish so she could get married to a piece of shit.\n\nWe stayed in sparse contact for a long time, and eventually I went down to visit her. I found out she was living with this woman, and while it was never explicitly said, I believe they were romantic. I didn't care really, while she was kinda weird she was nice, and I don't care what you're into, as long as you're happy. I had a good time with them and went back home. \n\nShe then separated from her and met this guy named Peter who is in his 80s (my mom is in her 50s) and it's definitely suspiciously like a gold-digger situation. He's nice, albeit weird and has some Puerto Rican values about him which just rub me the wrong way, but whatever. My mom seems truly happy for the first time I've seen her. I visited her once and had the opportunity to meet Peter before I got to know my now fiancee, so I knew what to expect when we went down there. Their house is horribly cluttered, which I believe is Peter's doing -- it's almost on the scale of hoarding. Entire rooms in their house full of boxes and paperwork and irrelevant garbage. I warned my fiancee of this before we visited.\n\nThe time we spent with them was a *disaster*. Our relationship was going through some heavy shit at the time and weighed on us the entire time. I failed to communicate with my mom we would be spending a couple nights in a hotel close by since I knew the state of their house and I wanted us to have some privacy, and my mom and her husband went batshit over this, getting offended and didn't understand why we'd want a hotel room when they have a room for us. This room had a tooon of boxes in it, pictures of Peter's ex-wife, all sorts of weird shit.\n\nWe then decided to spend most of the time exploring the state. My mom tried to insert herself into my vacation and just wouldn't take no for an answer, she wanted us to leave our rental car at her house the rest of vacation to go to destinations her and Peter wanted to visit (which I was annoyed about mostly because I paid a premium for a Mustang convertible rental -- imagine how much it costs to rent that to a 21 year old!) but we finally communicated to them we would just like to explore by ourselves. When it came to say goodbye, she was bitter we didn't spend more time with them and literally scolded me like a child that I don't call or text her enough -- bear in mind she doesn't make the effort to do these things either. It was an extremely awkward and unpleasant experience for me, let alone at the time for my fiancee. She also made abundantly clear she wanted to be invited to our wedding.\n\nWell, now we're getting married, and I had nothing but sour feelings for my mother. My fiancee has told me she doesn't want me to regret not inviting her but I think the regret of inviting her would greatly outweigh the regret of not doing so. My family does not like her at all and I feel it would ruin their experience. I can see her scolding",

      "description": "Backstory, Im a 29 Y/O residential, new construction builder and practicing general contractor.

Prior to me become a builder, I worked as a carpenter for some 5 odd years; while I went to Uni for business.\n\nFrom the design phase of this project I knew I was in for a journey when my ideas seemed to be completely disregard, Keep in mind I’m just as equally invested as my father. These unilateral decision made on his part began to fail and overhead costs began to skyrocket in the process...then the ideas that I initially proposed where implemented at extra cost and time...we all know what time is. \n\nMy father has always had a short fuse so I have became numb to his brash out lashes. The straw that broke the camels back and ultimately has driven me into disrespecting  (am I the asshole?) my father is when I bring up building code requirements that aren’t met that he blatantly disregards and flies off the handle when I grill him for these requirements.I could write a fucking book about this ordeal but I’m going to spare you the details.

      "description": "This happened a few hours ago. I manage and oversee a small car wash chain in the Midwest US. A customer came in with a brand new vehicle covered in snow (clearly left outside the night prior to their carwash), and after going through the wash, came out with ridged scratches (mind you, not scuff marks, which we normally are able to buff out) along the door linings of the vehicle. \n\nWhen I'm working a site I'm naturally running around all day checking equipment, cleaning the site, tending to customer service needs etc. so I didn't see the vehicle prior to it's wash. Customer approaches me irrate about the scratches and demands we repair the vehicle. I step away after politely asking the customer to give me a few minutes to review the cameras to inspect if either A. the customer had pre-existing scratches on said vehicle or B. had natural elements that could lead to the scratches. After checking all equipment and video, it's obvious that the snow on this car, combined with our equipment, created the scratches. \n\nI told the customer we cannot assume the liability of damages to the vehicle due to the snow on their car. They claim it is our responsibility to completely remove the snow off their vehicle prior to the wash, and that I'm an asshole for not instructing my employees to remove the snow and that we'll be sued for the damages (after telling them that due to the snow/ice covering the car, we cannot claim responsibility for any damages caused from the machines). \n\nKeep in mind, in my state and during the winter season, EVERY vehicle is covered in snow or ice, and we do not remove any pre-existing car parts or natural elements, as the process either takes 15+minutes&gt; per vehicle to fully prep PRIOR to a customer's wash or unless it will damage equipment, we will leave untouched.

      "description": "So for the record I don’t really think I’m an asshole for wanting this but my husband certainly does. Looking for opinions. \n\nWe have a 2 year old daughter whos become quite the handful in the past year. I’ve stayed home since she was born and lately I’ve been asking hubby about hiring a part time nanny so I can get a break in the mornings. He refused saying that looking after the child is my only job and it makes no sense for us to hire someone while I don’t bring in any income. \n\nI feel like he’s completely disregarding my needs. Ever since our daughter was born, I’ve felt so trapped indoors and have had little time to even go out to see friends or eat lunch in town, which I used to do semi frequently when I worked part time myself. \n\nMy husband works really long hours and won’t come home until 9-10pm so I can’t really ask him for help looking after her either. Financially I think we’re doing ok but my husband is always stressed about finances because we both have a bit of outstanding student debt but we’re chipping it down. So even tho he earns a lot he’s putting most of it towards our debt. While I understand his fears I still feel like this current situation is unsustainable. \n\nThe other day I brought up my sisters family and how they have two nannies (one for childcare and one to cook) even tho my sister doesn’t work as well and my husband blew up at me. I’ve never seen him so mad. He said that I have one job and I do it poorly while he’s busting his ass supporting all of us while paying off my debts. He told me if I want to hire a nanny I could just divorce him and find some other chump to support me. \n\nI was upset and cried but he just stormed out and left me and our daughter alone. I don’t know what to do but AITA?",

      "description": "Sorry if this is more of a /r/relationships post. To start off, Me and my (ex) girlfriend of a year recently broke up over how I feel our relationship should be. I had felt like I had been putting considerably more effort into the relationship  because I had been the only one to make attempts to see her. To give some backstory, I am 19 \\[M\\] and she is 18\\[F\\] and we both live with our parents. About once a week or even more I would set aside a day to go over to their house to spend time with her, and sometimes her family. Now dont get me wrong, her family has been absolutely generous and kind to me and ive eaten dinner with them countless times over the past year, but what was bugging me the past month or two was her inability to make attempts to go to my house and spend time to get to know my family. So far i can only think up of about 4 times that she has met my family, 3 of them in parking lots for about 5 minutes of small talk and once at my birthday when i invited her and her brother to come eat out with my family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer reasoning is that that is just how her family is like, and that they are conservative Catholics and that she is never allowed at a \"boys\" house. Now i would agree with her... if we hadnt been dating for more than a year. At that point i would think that I would be an exception,  mostly because I want her to come and meet my family as much as ive met and loved her family. I just feel as that this relationship has been pretty one sided in the amount of effort i go to see her. Before i had my own car, I would take the public bus just to hang with her at her house and to get to know her family. All i asked was for her to try to convince her or her family to come and get to know my family, as I have been a guest at their house countless times and they have been so kind, and she has been nothing more than just an \"acquaintance\" to mine. Maybe im over reacting, idk, but all i wouldve wanted was for a little more effort on her part to try to come and see me. \n\nFeel free to ask about any info that you think ive left out, but thats the gist of it.",

      "description": "I'll start with this: I'm not under any NDA, non-compete, or other legally-binding agreement that prohibits me from doing what I'm doing.  Also, all the software I'm using is open-source, except for the parts I developed in the past few months, and the open-source pieces are really the valuable portions of the software I've developed.\n\nI worked for a software company about ten years ago; during my tenure, they released a lot of their core code as open-source, for reasons I've never understood.\n\nAt the time, I pointed out that anyone could use their code to compete with them in the marketplace, but my opinion was ignored.  I built a demo and had long, drawn out arguments over e-mail with the leadership but in the end I was told to shut up and color.\n\nI quit and started work for my current company, writing unrelated software.  Since I left, my former company has not only maintained their open-source baseline but has actually taken it up a notch and released even more really cool software into the public domain (Apache 2 License).\n\nA few business opportunities came up last year on which my current company wants to compete.   I took the open-source code and created an application that works pretty well.  \n\nI asked my previous company if they want to partner going forward, but I have not been getting a warm reception.  I said that if they don't want to partner, I'd be selling it to everyone (including their competition), and this really made them upset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This happened many years ago, but I still question if I did the right thing.\n\nI worked retail in a mall when I was in my late teens, early twenties. I was in the store alone and was closing  up for the night. Luckily, one of the first things I would do was lower the gate before doing the rest of my duties. There wasn’t much space in the back “office” (it was more of a snappy storage room), so I started counting the cash drawer on the counter. \n\nThere was a janitor that I would see on a regular basis sweeping the mall. As he would pass my store I would give a friendly smile or a nod or a wave because I’ve always been taught to treat everyone with respect. This one particular evening he passed by earlier than normal. I didn’t think anything of it at first. As I was counting the cash (we were in the busy season so there was more than normal) he came back to the store, but without any tools or equipment.\n\nI would occasionally glance up at him from the corner of my eye and could see he was just standing in the doorway. I continued to try to do my work, but found I was distracted by him being there. He didn’t say anything, and he wasn’t doing anything. He just stood there. He did not speak English and I was barely conversational in Spanish at the time and didn’t know how to ask what he was doing. All I could do was ask if he needed help and he just shook his head no.\n\nAt this point (about 15-20 minutes later) I felt extremely uncomfortable. I gathered what was on the counter and took my closing paperwork and went into the back room. I made a makeshift desk from some boxes and completed the deposit bag and paperwork. I opened the door to see he was STILL THERE. I had to take the deposit bag to the bank and put it in the night drop, but didn’t feel comfortable walking out with him there. \n\nFinally, I got up the nerve to call security and explain what was going on. I told them that he wasn’t actually doing anything wrong, but it was making me feel uncomfortable. Within minutes two security guards came to escort him away and one of the guards came back to walk me to my car. I felt both embarrassed and relieved. \n\nThe next day I came into work and a few of my coworkers gave me a hard time about calling security.  They accused me of being paranoid. They defended him saying “this janitor was just doing his job and you had to get him in trouble!” Seriously?\n\nThough I feel like I did the right thing, it still bothers me. Were they right? Was I being paranoid? Or did I do the right thing in that situation?",

      "description": "This happened monday, fresh off the weekend and its been annoying me ever since. I am being treated like im in the wrong in this situation so lets see what you guys think.\n\nI drive a 2018 Range Rover with plenty of interior space. As such I keep three guns in my vehicle at all times. I keep a Glock 19 in my glove box, a .38 snubnose in my drivers side door, and a brand new V3 Tac 13 shotgun under the back seat.\n\nI also keep some other weapons and gear under the seats and in the side doors and trunk. I keep these for my own reasons and never bring them inside my office. I live in a metropolitan environment that is not friendly to weapons.\n\nTwo workers who I am on good terms with ask me if I would eat lunch with them. I agree. As we're leaving my coworker says he parked on the roof of our parking garage (he arrives late constantly and is unable to park in a desirable spot. This angers me to say the VERY least as he invited me).\n\nThey suggest using my Range Rover as it has generous amounts of leg room even with my equipment and is just a nicer vehicle in general.\n\nI agree. One coworker sits in my front passenger seat, the other sits in the back. My coworker compliments my car which I enjoy. However he is very touchy and opens my glove box, revealing my glock 19 as well as my knife, and documents which spill on the floor. I slam the glove box closed and tell him not to touch things in my vehicle.\n\nThe ride is mostly silent, until i see my other coworker in the back seat nudge my concealed shotgun with his foot. He also turns his head and looks in my truck and starts asking me about my gear. I keep my camera and emergency roadside tool kit in there, along with some other less than lethal equipment.\n\nHe starts asking me about them and i give him the silent treatment for a few minutes before telling him to not look into my trunk.\n\nLunch was terrible. Overpriced and they couldnt cook a steak properly. As a gesture of good will i pay for said lunch.\n\nLater i was asked by my boss if i am bringing weapons into the workplace, which im not. They ratted me out. The parking garage is building property and all equipment, be it shotgun, revolver, or tazer is locked securely in my Range Rover.\n\nI feel like my privacy was invaded, and that i am not in the wrong here despite being brought aside by my boss. Am i the asshole?",

I had thought there were some limits to this, but word got back to me from my friend who is dating one of her friends that my gf was mocking me about a really embarrassing sexual incident that happened.  \n\nI was so humiliated.  We have the same group of friends so I have to see these people a lot.  I talked to my gf about it, but she really didn’t see what the big deal was.   She told me that all women do this, it’s just how they relate to one another.   I told her I didn’t care about all women, I wanted our private stuff, especially sexual stuff, to just be between the two of us.  She still argued that I was overreacting, but agreed to keep the sexual stuff out of conversations.  \n\nFast forward to about two hours ago.   I’m talking to my friend about a minor issue he’s having with his gf.  I kept telling him that all he needed to do was just set firm boundaries with her like I did with mine and he gets quiet and starts acting uncomfortable.   \n\n\nI pressed him a little bit about what’s wrong and he tells me that he promised not to say anything and I couldn’t say that I heard it from him, but my gf never stopped making jokes and talking about our sex life.   She just told them that I freaked out about it and just swore them to secrecy, but her friend told her bf, my friend.  \n\nThis is all so high school drama I know, but I really feel like the problem is my gf doesn’t empathize and maybe a dose of embarrassment for her could make her see how all this makes me feel.   I have no shortage of embarrassing stories about her.  ",

      "description": "TLDR; at end \n\n (1) It begins with my last boyfriend. While I was dating him, she flirted w him in his Insta dms. We broke up, I thought I’d never have a problem with her again. Well, she happens to be close friends with my current bf.\n(2)I figure this out about a month in and tell him abt it and he says to try being friends w her. (Him &amp; I actually have an amazing relationship, the one “immature” flaw about us is this girl problem in my opinion.) \nSo I msg her asking about back then,she says she did in fact like him at the time, but had no idea we were together. I didn’t think abt the fact that he had me all over his Insta back then, so I was like ok ig.\n\n(3) Then one day I noticed an emoji by her name on Snap I hadn’t seen before. “Mutual #1 bffs” my bff of course being my bf. Ntm she has her own on again off again bf and they were together\nSo I message her with a ss and “how did this happen?” She says “he just sends me memes from time to time, that’s all” and I go “must be a lot of memes huh?” And she goes “lol maybe.”\n\n(4) I show my bf and he sees the attitude too. I ask that they drop their streak&amp; send less memes/posts, not much compared to the fact he had me drop a male friend (who goes to a different highschool) bc he was uncomfortable bc he had mentioned me to one of my bfs friends. Immediately when he asked me I ceased all contact with my friend. it was no problem at all just to make my bf feel comfortable in our relationship\nThe girl tells my bf it was all just a misunderstanding &amp; He says “I am not one to be controlled” which broke my heart. I wouldn’t turn into the thing that hurt me in before. I brought up the fact that he made me drop my friend and he said he was wrong and let me have that friend back. I’d honestly just rather us both drop our “problematic” friends and move on.\n\n(5)During, I found out from my bf himself he asked this girl out multiple times shortly before I came along and got rejected. So the feelings at least were there.\n(6) They still sit at lunch together, are snapping slightly less than him &amp; I,have a whole free period of band together. He has a nickname for her in his snap, She continues to go to my bf instead of her own bf with her problems. Idk why he can’t do what I did for him. He even said “sorry I don’t just drop friends like that”. Which I never asked to begin with.\n\nTLDR;\n(1)This girl flirted w my ex bf while I was with him, (2) claims she didn’t know we were together,but did like him,I get a new bf and she’s close w him, (3) notice they’re bffs on snap &amp; ask why when she has her own bf, (4) she has an attitude w me and calls it a misunderstanding, he calls me controlling for me asking them to drop at least their streaks, even tho he made me drop a whole male friend, he says he was wrong and lets me have that friend back, girl continues to be close w my bf, (5) my bf previously had strong feelings for her.

      "title": "AITA for wanting a \"suicidal\" friend out of my life?",
      "description": "I've got a friend (D) who I've known for ~15 years and he's the type of guy to get a girlfriend then change his whole life for her. His last relationship was 2 years long and she broke up with him just before Christmas.\n\n\nDuring their relationship I rarely saw him, the last time was about May. I'd text him weekly asking if he was free and wanted to hangout. He'd always say “working\" or \"with gf” so I tried just talking to him and he wouldn't respond after that. Eventually I just gave up, he doesn't want to talk with me so I don't have anything to say to him. At this point I just assumed he didn't want to be friends, a douchy way to do it, but I accepted it.\n\n\nA mutual friend (H) tells me that they broke up and D isn't handling it well. Then Dec. 24th D sends me a message saying he's feeling suicidal and isn't taking any calls(I don't take suicide well as I've had other situations like this). I freaked out and sent him the biggest paragraph of “don't do it man i love you” stuff, and he didn't read any of it. Then I talked to H, H texted D that he would call the cops if we didn't get a response, so D immediately calls H. After about 5 min H gets him to come over and he starts to feel better after we all talk about it. (H says D isn't suicidal/he won't hurt himself, he just wants the “suffering” to end so he is ok with death. If that makes sense)\n\n\nH left the state on the 27th and won't be back till summer so D doesn't really have any other friends in town right now. D calls me on new years and says he has a lot of crap on his mind and he'd like to talk, so we meet up and he tells me about this girl he's known for awhile and says she's super religious. He wants to get with her but she won't date anyone who doesn't believe in god. So he tells me that he's going for it. I told him I didn't think that was a good idea but he didn't want to hear it, so he will be changing religions(or faking it) soon just for this girl.\n\n\nAt this point I'm tired of his BS, he calls me his friend still but we don't do things friends do, he only ever talks to me about his problems then doesn't listen to my advice. I'm tired of trying to help him again(I used to be the friend in the group that helped everyone with their problems) and not getting anything, even a \"thanks for listening\" from him. I think I should just tell him I don't want to be friends anymore, and only talk to me if he really want to be friends again.\n\n\n\nTl;dr: Friend of many years who I haven't seen/talked to in months comes to me with problems and doesn't listen to advice, I'm tired of it and want it/him out of my life.\n\n",

      "description": "Of course, long story. I will work to keep it brief. Using a throwaway. \n\nI (26M) am with the woman I want to be with for the rest of my life (26F). We’ve been together for a year now, we just moved in together. It’s been great, I absolutely love and adore her. \n\nThat being said, she’s definitely more sexually experienced and wanting it more than I am. I feel like I’m rejecting her subtly and fairly often (maybe 2-3 times a week) while maybe having sex maybe 1-4 times a week. It has nothing to do with her, I think she’s the most beautiful and sexy person I’ve ever met - and I always tell her that. That it’s nothing she does, I just truly feel like I’m out of the phase in my life where I want to bang all the time. I feel bad, because I’ve been in her position, but that relationship was abusive towards me and has left me definitely different. I want to be everything for her, and want to be the man of her dreams, which I think I am. Just in this one section of life, I just can’t match her libido. \n\nThat being said, I can feel she’s bummed about it - and she still tries to approach me fairly often but she’s never pressuring me or rude in anyway. She understands (sorta) but I just feel so bad. \n\nAITA for being in my 20’s and having a lower libido than my SO? Whatever judgement it maybe - any advice to work with it. I try to do things that pleases her elsewhere, just sometimes I’m tired or just not into it. Where otherwise, when I’m into it, im fucking into it. It’s like I have no grey zone, just either turned on as fuck or turned completely off. Ugh. ",

      "title": "AITA for getting mad at my English teacher over video games?",
      "description": "My school has a system where every week, we have one period were you're allowed to go to any teacher's class and do anything, work or not, as long as you abide by that teacher's rules. Of course, some people spend time working, and some spend time cooling off and taking a bit of a rest from the hectic rest of the day, and this time around, my friend group basically decided to take some time off. \n\nWe've got a modded Terraria server set up on Google Cloud, and three of us are playing on that, one is playing that online MTG game, one is playing Brawl Stars, and one more person is playing League. Other people all around the room are doing assorted computer tasks, including games. After maybe half of the period finishes, my English teacher comes up and tells us this:  \n\n\nET: \"So I can't even get into Schoology (the system we use for grades, class management, etc), is it possible that you're causing it or taking up all of the bandwidth?\"\n\nNow, at this point at the conversation I'm already calling BS because I know how much data is coming/going from the server and it's not a lot (picture attached). If you'd looked at our screens you'd see just a ton of projectiles, but to be honest the server isn't even working that hard.\n\nME: \"Uhh, it might be why. We'll get off if you'd like.\"\n\nAt this point she walks away, probably to go back to working. Then, halfway across the room from us (we were sitting in the furthest corner from her), she says, quite loudly:\n\nET: \"And if you guys don't get off in the next 10 seconds, I think we can all say that you're addicted.\"\n\nShe goes back to her computer and 30 minutes later, as we're walking out as the period ends, I see her filling out grades, guess where? Schoology.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this is the point which I've been thinking about. We're all actually in the process of getting off (and I know for a fact that everyone that was on the server basically exited immediately). I don't think that she had any right to call us all addicted without any proof. \n\nIn addition, I know basically for a fact that we were not causing, or at least not the main cause of her site not loading. The other 20 other people in the room were basically all on computers or playing a video game of some kind, save a couple of people. I remember for a fact at least 4 other people playing video games on their phones or computers from where I could see. Other people were using Schoology in the room, so that proves that it was just her computer. We weren't even that loud- we were trying to keep our volumes down.\n\nFinally, I live in a quite well-to-do region of Silicon Valley, and the internet at our schools is spotty outside of classrooms, but it has always been reliable inside, and we've done this in previous free periods without teachers or anyone else in the room complaining, for essentially the entirety of the first semester. The wifi should definitely be able to handle the amount of data coming in/out of the server. It's done it before with no issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: My English teacher singled out and called my entire friend group addicted to video games over a likely false accusation that we were causing her wifi to slow down. AITA for getting mad at her?**",

      "description": "Over the past 4 months, my wife has started this habit of making plans without talking to me until after the fact. It's gone from volunteering me to do manual labor for her friends to making full blown travel plans for the both of us to go visit her brother three states away. Just the other day, she did it again by making plans with her sisters. These plans include flying all the way to the Gulf of Mexico and having a \"get away\" for 8 days. She only told me a day later that she had told her sisters she was going. She didn't take into account the cost of the flights, food, and a place to stay. \n\nAfter the last few months of dealing with this, I decided to express my feelings about it. She, of course, got mad at me for expressing how I felt. She yelled at me and told me to shut up and not talk to her. She made the entire discussion about herself and how terrible I was for feeling the way I did. At this point, I lost my cool and yelled for her to listen for a minute and let me explain why I feel the way I do. (I'm not proud of losing my cool, but I felt backed into a corner.) She then decided to shut me out and told me not to talk to her. \n\nI feel like I can never be upset about anything in this marriage. It's always my fault and i'm always a terrible person when I do try to have a discussion about our issues. I honestly have no clue what to do here.",

      "description": "Hi. I am a mom of a nine month old boy who I love and cherish but is lactose intolerant. Mu husband and I felt bad because we didnt know until 2 months after all the long nights and crying that his tummy was sensitive. I have a co worker who we will call Jill that is going to school to be a nurse but works full time. Her interest is in pediatrics and was low key mommy shaming me when I was pregnant and after I gave birth that I had no interest in breast feeding my child.  Another coworker on a separate team from ours is now in her 2nd trimester with her first child and didnt know what she was going to do as far as breast feeding.\n\nShe asked after a joint team meeting for advise and I said I had an instant bottle maker that I use for night feedings that cost a bit but worth every penny because not only does it warm the bottle perfectly but preps the formula almost like a baby Keurig lol. Well Jill cuts in and says I shouldnt be giving her advise because my baby is on formula and what's worse is that I would allow him to be on soy. I looked at her with a shocked face as she tried to say that in a \"jokingly matter\". I said every woman has a right to choose and that my baby is lactose intolerant. Not that I owed an explanation. She proceeded to say that soy has estrogen that is harmful to baby boys (I talked to my pediatrician about it and he looked at me stupid but assured me this is not the case as I already knew) and that I should have tried to breast feed because he might not of had this problem to begin with. I calmly got my things and walked out the door and turned and said childless women shouldnt have such an opinion until you are put in that situation.\n\nWhen we got back to our section it was uncomfortable as half the team took my side and the other half were either indifferent or took her side. She later explained I should be more open minded to the research as she is studying to be a nurse and I'm not. I told her that her research is flawed and to leave me alone for the rest of the week as I do not want to cause any more of a scene. It was loud enough for everyone to hear my intent and slightly embarrasse her since she wanted to call me out and try to make me look stupid. \n\nSo aita for saying childless women shouldnt have an opinion? Obviously I think anyone has a right to an opinion but I wanted to say that to make her hurt because I know she wants kids one day and hasnt found a partner that shares her goals.as she has told us many times.",

I saw the kid today at the gym and I jokingly said “hey man sorry I got you roped into being a DD” to which he said “no I never picked her up”.  Me, being an idiot I guess jokingly texted her saying “wow he told me he never picked you up that’s cold!”  She replied saying how he was an asshole all 4 years that they dated and must still be one, and didn’t respond after that (I tried to change the topic instead of focusing on that).\n\nAITA for bringing up her ex?

Since he often borrows my account to play my games, he was accedentally logged into my account when he purchased BFV.\n\nNow, here is the issue: I was planing on buying the game with USD to save ~10 USD in my local currency vs. purchasing in euros by using a VPN. So I tell him to buy the game on his account with USD using a VPN and then I would transfer that amount of money to his bank account.\n\nHe insisted that I should pay him the amount he payed for the game on my account, the 10 USD more expensive price. His reasoning being that the product was already in my possession. And he didn't stop arguing until I offered to pay the difference, so I decided to pay 5 USD more to end the situation.\n\nThen he couldn't figure out how to buy it using USD on his account, so he wanted to just but it using euros. As I was pretty frustrated at that point, I caved and agreed to it as I was very tired of the conversation.\n\nSo, AITA for being pissed about him insisting I pay the amount he accedentally payed on my account? Is his reasoning valid? ",

He's constantly late to things, he tends to cancel plans at the last minute, changes plans last minute, etc. \n\nUsually I put up with this because I attribute it to him mostly just being irresponsible instead of malicious. So I'll move plans around for him or hold off the group from leaving, that kind of thing. \n\nWell a few days ago we had made plans to meet up for drinks, just me and him. I moved my work schedule and everything because I usually work nights. And he cancels two hours ahead of time because \"he had to head home early\" (we live an hour apart and usually meet in the middle).\n\nAnd I just kinda snapped. Told him \"okay\" and for the few times we've had plans with mutual friends since I tell him times and places and don't send my usual \"reminder\" texts and facebook messages anymore. He confronted me about this and I just said I was sick of making exceptions for him and he needs to stop acting like a child and show up to things on time and as planned. \n\nHe told me I was overreacting for the other night, I told him maybe but it's not like I'm cutting him out of my life or anything. He stopped responding.\n\nI kind of feel bad, but I'm just so sick of making exceptions when it comes to plans for him. AITA?\n\nOkay, I guess that wasn't short.\n\n***TL;DR***\n\nFriend tends to cancel plans last minute, be constantly late, etc. After one arranged meet up where he canceled last minute I've stopped putting in the extra effort to include him in things, and just give him \"time, date, be there or don't\" messages.

They got it declawed because it kept scratching the kids, and then took it back to get declawed again on its back legs since it had started kick scratching them. I've seen the kids literally pull it out from under the couch by its tail when they want to play with it because it hides from them whenever they come into the room. \n\nBecause of this, I told them that if they visit my apartment they aren't allowed to interact with my cat in any way, and I made sure to put her in a carrier just in case. As soon as they get there the kids immediately run over and start shaking the carrier, and I got mad and told them to leave. My uncle argued with me until I was shouting and threatening to call the cops before he agreed to leave, and I told them they would have to pick up the computer parts from my parents because they aren't allowed in my apartment ever again.\n\nAfter this both of my parents and my grandma left angry messages on my phone telling me that I needed to apologize to them for the way I acted, because that is no way to treat family. I don't want to because I think they were being cruel to my cat after I made them specifically agree not to and now everyone is on my case about \"breaking up the family over a cat\" since my uncle doesn't want to talk to my parents until they get me under control. Am I in the wrong here? I honestly feel justified but literally no one is taking my side so I am questioning whether I was too forceful.",

We were at a place where they didn't sell alcohol and A with another person said they're going for a smoke. We waited, with the game ready to play for 40 mins. We later on found out that A in fact went to a bar to get drinks.\n\nLater on A also left the party to get food, again, taking some more people with them, while B and I and few others were ready to play games. At this point we decided to play games anyway. A was basically not there 80% of the time.\n\nFew days later i talked to A because this was not like them at all. I told them it was a shitty thing to do to a friend. \n\nA said \"yeah but I had stuff going on, you know. I wanted to get drunk to forget. I didn't want to be there anyway.\" \n\nI told A that personal problems are not an excuse to treat your friend like s@!t. That they should own up to their mistake. I really didn't like how they made the issue about themselves, again. Getting defensive and bringing their own problems forward, as an excuse for bad behaviour.\n\nA then said something along the lines of \"this is not your problem, it's between me and B. I apologized to them anyway and we're good. Why the f@#k do you care. Stop putting salt on my wounds. Leave me alone.\"\n\nI genuinely just wanted to see some sort of remorse for what A did because I didn't want to believe they would care so little about their friend. Because maybe one day I'll be treated the same.\n\nAm I the a-hole here for criticizing A? Especially because A was not going through the best time in their life at the time.\n",

I went home first and messaged her when I got home in our group chat since she told me to tell her when I got home (I had quite a few drinks). When I messaged her she told me she and another friend were bussing home together and I told her to shoot me a message when she got home except she never read the message so didn’t reply. I didn’t feel the need to check on her at that time because 1. She didn’t see my message in the first place so it made sense that she didn’t reply 2. I dont have any method of contacting her other than Facebook 3. The friend she was with got home ok so I just assumed she did too since they went home together\n\nWe had class this morning and she was being cold and I have no idea why. I asked a guy from our chat and he said it’s probably because I didn’t make sure she went home ok even though she didn’t reply\n\nI’m not even sure if this is the reason she was cold but after what he said I feel really bad.

      "description": "My girlfriends friend, I will call her des, and my girlfriend (will call gf) kind of had a falling out recently and my gf kind of keeps bringing up that it is my fault (which it is partially but we will get into that).\nBefore we get into this I want to discuss a little about des. Des is a student that dropped out of nursing into healthcare aid because she was failing her courses and then proceeded to fail her healthcare aid courses, yet she posts all over social media about how hard the nurse life is and how being a nurse just takes up all her time. Des also happened to be what some refer to as a tinderella where she was almost always talking to 4+ people on tinder and went out on tinder dates 3+ times per week. By time all of this started she had settled down and started dating a guy but just recently started the relationship (also had a string of crazy exes). It also wasn't uncommon for her to break off any and all friendships she had with people for months before turning back and trying to rekindle friendships, her and my gf had readded eachother on Facebook 8 times in the past 3 years. Now, everytime my gf would go to hang out with des she would come home upset and usually spend the first few hours crying because of how horrible des made her feel about things. Des would constantly belittle my gf about being an honours university student and say how she doesn't understand life because she has never worked a real job (note that gf is working while in school). Des also absolutely hates me and has ever since she met me. Now, a couple of months ago des had added me in Facebook and me being me I sometimes post certain controversial things on my Facebook (like posts about how safe injection sites are a good thing, or anything to do with politics, or how I agree with gun regulations. Note I live in Canada and not America). Des was getting super upset and at first requested I don't share these things on Facebook because they were untrue (a \"nurse\" that disagrees with the benefits of safe injection sites from a healthcare perspective is scary) so me being me, a condescending a-hole I took it further. I posted an article that discussed healthcare cuts made by the previous government that she so openly supported, and I tagged her in it. This went on for about a week, then something happened, someone posted on an anonymous app (called whisper) posing as her asking people to send her dick picks (note that I didn't even have her number let alone whisper). I Immedietly get messages from her, her boyfriend, my girlfriend, and others about posting that. I blow up at her and say I didn't even have her number let alone whisper (which I even offered to let her go through my phone, android, which keeps a history of apps downloaded and everything). She kept calling me an asshole and telling my gf to break up with me for what I did. So in response of this I blew up at her, told her how horrible of a friend she is and more.",

      "description": "My roommate is a friend of mine who I have been living with for about 7 months. It’s been a little rocky over the past few months. Nothing major, but she’s loud (answers all phone calls on speaker, turns tv up all the way even when she knows I’m trying to sleep and can hear it, etc) and doesn’t really respect my space or things (goes in my room without asking and moves my things) despite me repeatedly asking her not to touch my stuff and it’s just really driving me nuts. Her boyfriend is moving in town soon, so we talked about it and decided to have him take over my lease and I’ll be moving into my girlfriends place. This is fine, but I own the majority of the things in our common spaces, like the tv, various shelves, dishes, lamps, etc, and she’s mentioned letting her borrow them after I move out because I won’t need them at my new place. This is somewhat true. I won’t need them at the place I’m moving into, but could still use them and will definitely need them at future places, or I could sell them. I mentioned that she could buy some of it from me if she wants and she kind of scoffed at that. I really appreciate her friendship even though we weren’t great roommates, but don’t want to leave my things in her possession because they could get ruined or never returned. I’m worried she’ll be angry with me if I don’t leave some things. So, would I be the asshole if I moved all of my things when I leave?",

SERIOUSLY YOU ARE THE IDIOT”\n\nY: “HE SHOULD MAN UP AND BE MORE OF A PERSON INSTEAD IF GETTING MAD BECAUSE OF WORDS U HOPE YOU BOTH DIE IN A FIRE”\n\nM: “SERIOUSLY PRAYING THAT WE DIE? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!”\n\nY: “YOU BOTH ARE DOGS GO DIE”\n\nThen we talked to 1st teacher she said she couldn’t do anything in her position we understood then we talked to the 2nd teacher she said if we don’t become friends we will get a slip to the principal. I felt bad so I became his friend again but don’t talk to him too much.\n\nAm I the atagonist?",

I called them scum for lying to us. I called them cheap ass bastards as well. I was so angry I started to put some boxes back on the moving truck.  I told them karma is a bitch before his wife told us to leave or she would call the police. \n\n\nI know there were much better ways to handle a situation like that but I lost my cool.

      "description": "I present to you one of the strangest interactions I have ever had on this site. Over at r/banned, someone recounts a story of being banned from r/aww for making an offensive joke. The joke was mildly funny, at best. Another user comes along and basically accuses the joke-poster of being a bully. I pointed out that the fact that your actions might not be appreciated doesn't *necessarily* make them malicious, and that in this case, no harm was done. User replies that I'm defending abuse and that offensive jokes always cause harm, and asks why am I saying that it's okay to hurt people. And on, and on, and now the user is calling *me* an abuser because I might occasionally swear in my mother's company even though she would prefer that I didn't.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/banned/comments/a096g3/raww_i_couldnt_miss_the_opportunity_to_comment/eag5knb/\n\nAm I the abuser? lol.",

I finished securing my kids and left them with my SO and ran after the guy (who was still looking down) yelling, \"Get off your phone, moron!\"  I stood there, yelling at him, waiting for him to notice me.  I was right behind his back bumper, and he was stopped at the exit of the parking lot, just still staring down at his phone and ignoring me.  It took him a good while to finally look up and around to see who was yelling, and he still didn't see me.  Didn't bother to look in his rearview mirror.  As soon as he saw that I was yelling at him, I walked away.  I was furious and just wanted to make my point - he was driving through a parking lot with KIDS in it with his head buried in his phone.  I know I caused a scene and any normal person wouldn't have yelled their head off, but I wanted to make sure that he knew that what he was doing was not okay.  Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "So to start off, my parents divorced when I was two and I was put in the care of my grandparents from my dad’s side. Growing up, I’ve come to realized that my father had always lived off of my grandparents well into his 40’s. \n\nHe met my stepmom back in 2008 and remarried around that time. I lived with them for a while. They were both working and we were financially stable. When I was about 13, I moved in with my mom and stepdad. I was able to see my father every weekend and holiday. Until last summer 2018 I had my first internship at 16 and my father was opposed to it because I wasn’t seeing him as often. My summer weekdays would be at work and weekends at his house. I emphasized how important it was to me and how it could help me for college. He didn’t care and refused to drop me back to my mom’s house when my first day of work was the following Monday. My mom was extremely frustrated with my father so she did not let me see him ever since. But I do face-time him occasionally. \n\nWhen my dad and stepmom divorced in 2016 my dad was forced to move out of his house and lived with my grandparents for a while. He hasn’t gotten back on his feet ever since. My grandparents went back to Asia for retirement and sold the family business and house. My dad then had to move out of that house and is currently renting a small room. I spoke to him and he hasn’t been eating proper meals because he can’t cook in that house and my stepmom filled for child support for my half brother. My mom has gotten over what happened last summer so I could see my dad over weekends again if I wanted to but she doesn’t think I should stay over considering the living situation.  I agree with her.\n\nOverall, my father is not financially stable (he should and could be but I think he his spending his money on other matters...) regardless, If i go back to see him I won’t have a place to stay. I could stay over at my step mother’s place but I’m not comfortable with the living situation.\n\nAdding on to that, I’m a senior in high school and there are numerous finances that need to be taken care of. My mom has helped me with most of my expenses, my internship check from last  has covered some of what I need but there are still some concerns regarding college and other senior dues. I asked my mom for help, although she is willing to help pay for me, she was mad at me for not asking my dad for help. She told me it was unfair that she has to cover so many of my expenses whereas my father hasn’t acted like a father towards me since... well quite a while. She says the least he could do  for me is help pay for some of the expenses. However, I just feel so bad for my father because of his financial situation and instability. (Take note that he did put himself that situation for reasons I’m too ashamed to name)\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting stay with my dad over weekends again &amp; feeling bad for asking him to help me cover some finances considering his situation?\n\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I are in college. Today, he was expecting to get his math test back. He knew he didn’t do very well on it and was nervous about it. We had been texting all morning waiting for him to get his grade. I tried to be encouraging and let him know that even if he did do bad on the test, everything would be okay. \n\nWhile I was waiting for him to text me his test score, I was at the bus stop to head back to my apartment after class. I randomly ran into a good friend of mine, who is a guy (this will be relevant in just a minute.) My friend lives in the apartment complex next to mine, so we hopped on the bus together to head that way. We were having a conversation about spring break when my boyfriend texted me. I opened the text and it was a decent size paragraph about how he finally got his test grade back and how he didn’t do well and was upset about it. \n\nI didn’t reply back immediately because my friend was in the middle of trying to show me something on his phone. My friend and I continued conversing until we reached our apartments. This had been about 10-15 minutes max since I had opened my boyfriends text message. \n\nAs soon as I got back to my apartment, I texted my boyfriend this \n\n“Hey babe, sorry for leaving you on read. I ran into (friends name) at the bus stop and we rode the bus back and were in the middle of a conversation when I got your text. I’m really sorry you didn’t do as well as you had hoped on your test, but don’t let that bring you down babe. Just do your very best on the next tests and hopefully it will be okay!” \n\nHe responded back \n“No one wants to hear from the SO that they left you on read because they were with another guy right after you told them you failed a test you were worried about” \n\nI apologized to him again and told him i wasn’t ignoring him on purpose. He continued to be angry with me and talk about how if the situation was reversed, I would be mad at him and he is angry that there is a double standard with us when it comes to that. I disagreed with him and told him I didn’t think it was that big of a deal since I was only gone for 15 minutes max, and immediately had apologized for leaving him on read.  \n\nAnyways, after this, we didn’t text for about 4 hours because I was driving to my parents house far away. When we started texting again, I asked for an apology for him being so angry with me earlier. He responded “You want an apology for something you did?” \n\nand I explained to him that I always apologize to him afterwards when I overreact about things, and I would appreciate if he would do the same, so that way we could move on from the situation. He told me he refused to apologize for something that was entirely my fault. \n\nIt’s been 10 hours and he is still angry with me. \n\nso yeah...Am I the asshole and is this situation my fault? \n",

      "description": "Four of us live together, one is never there, one sleeps early and gets up early, and myself and the other (we'll call him Chris) are total night owls, rarely falling asleep before 3 AM, and usually waking up after midday. I am mega strict about noise after midnight, because I think its incredibly rude to keep someone awake, and frequently tell him to stfu when we're talking after midnight, out of respect to my earlybird house mate. I have PTSD, and always have nasty nightmares when my sleep is disturbed. Annoyingly noise doesn't wake me right up, but rouses me to the point that my brain will start terrorising me. Chris knows this. Chris has had to come and console me after said nightmares.  Chris also has a problem with light, and I have to make sure that all the hall lights remain off when he's sleeping, or he'll wake up. I use a torch if I have to go to the bathroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning Chris decided to get up super early, 8.30 to be precise, and had a loud political debate in the hallway outside my room with early bird housemate. Needless to say I proceeded to have a lovely creepy dream (about my grandmother begging me to not let her die, but I digress) and then work up, traumatised, unable to get back to sleep. I'm supposed to be finishing an essay today and I'm frazzled and exhausted, but whats really pissed me off, is that Chris's response to me texting him to shut up, was to tell me that 8.30 wasn't early, it was reasonable to wake me up then, and that I was lazy for not already being awake. I lost my shit at him, and we're still sniping at each other over text.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't see why as I show consideration for others who live in this house, that they can't show consideration for me. My PTSD is not their fault, nor my night owl tendencies, but I bend over backwards to accommodate them both. Just because Chris has decided to suddenly get up early, does not give him the right to make me feel shit for having the same sleeping patterns as he usually does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr; I'm the mother Teresa of accommodating my flatmates, they show me no consideration in exchange. Am I right to be angry?",

      "description": "First and foremost: this did not result in a traffic accident. It didn’t even result in any honking or gestures. I still feel crappy about it though. \n\nI was driving home when I attempted to let someone in. It’s a busy road and there’s no traffic lights for the side streets so it’s a complete nightmare to wait for someone to let you in. Having been one of the waiting ones more than once, I was sympathetic and stopped to let this pickup truck in.  \n\nThe driver clearly wasn’t paying attention. I flashed my lights three times. It got to be a good 10 seconds as the song I was listening to got through a full verse. A couple of people had angrily passed me. So I decide to go. This driver is totally zoned out and it’s been 10 seconds. Didn’t want to honk as it’s a thickly settled area and that’s disruptive. \n\nOf course, the second I decided to give up, the truck realized I had been letting them in. They moved to go in as I moved, but after it was too late for me to stop to let them in. (Low speed traffic but a small area). They ultimately had to brake fast and wait but the guy behind me let them in.  He hadn’t seen the whole thing I don’t think. Just the part where I went ahead and went! \n\nI doubt the truck realized I’d waited for them for ages before giving up. So they doubtlessly think I’m the asshole. But am I, objectively? What should I have done?\n\n",

Oftentimes just hearing their voices irritates the fuck out of me. It's like I can't bear hearing it for the next second. But then again, I can't do anything but keep it inside.\n  b. When in a bad day I don't like them anywhere near me. Sometimes even just looking at them puts me in a bad mood. I get this feeling like I can't bear being in the same space as they do.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I can't really do anything about it. They don't know anything about how I feel. But when I think about it, me feeling like this is already a pretty asshole-y thing to do. And not letting them know about it makes me feel even worse :( AITA? ",

      "description": "Last fall when I moved to a new city, I joined a new gym and decided to get a personal trainer. Our initial session went really well, so I decided to take the leap and buy her 10x package (yes yes, my mistake).\n\nFast forward a few months, I have 4 sessions left (I was sick for like a month and there’s been holidays in between) and I just don’t want to do it anymore. I’ve found a good gym routine on my own, plus taken up a sport so I get a good amount of exercise in my free time, and simply put I just don’t really enjoy her training style. The first few times were nice because I learned new things etc, but at this point I never feel like going, and I kind of feel like I’m wasting both of our times. \n\nThe only issue is I still have those 4 paid for sessions, so I’m worried it would be a slap in the face to her to virtually be like “I’d rather throw this money away than train with you”. Furthermore, I genuinely have to cancel/move next week’s session due to something coming up, so I’m worried that would be like a double whammy. She’s really nice and it’s nothing against her as a person, it’s just not working for me. So, Reddit, WIBTA if I told her I want to stop?\n\nTL;DR: Bought a 10 session packet with my personal trainer. I’m not enjoying it and don’t feel like I’m getting much out of it, so I want to stop going, but I have 4 paid for sessions left and am worried how it would come off to stop seeing her when she knows it means throwing money away. WIBTA if I end it anyway? ",

      "description": "Okay so this was a while ago but I just discovered this sub and had a rather long discussion with a friend of mine about it:\n\nI  was sitting on a train in one of those seating groups with 2 pairs of chairs facing each other. Of those four seats 3 were occupied.\n\nPIC for reference: [https://imgur.com/MBbJr8G](https://imgur.com/MBbJr8G) (I was sitting on the red seat,  empty seat is marked green, other two are occupied by innocent bystanders).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a tall guy and these seats are notoriously uncomfortable for tall people, ESPECIALLY the one at the window, because of these little trash cans that always get in the way of my knees and make my legs cramp because I have to sit in a weird way. So I always sit corridor side to have a bit of legroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe make a stop at a train station and many people enter. Because it was a busy time of day the last remaining free seat was the one on my right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese two women aged around 40 come by, carrying a bit of luggage and one asks me if I can scoot over to the window so she can sit down. I say to her that I would really prefer to not sit at the window because it is really uncomfortable for me because of said trashcan, to which she answers that she wont squeeze through to sit there and that she has luggage that wont fit. I then tell her that I will hold her luggage for her so that she can sit there but that I wont scoot over.\n\nNow at this point she is giving me \"the stare\" and mutters something to her friend like WTF is this piece of shit doing. \n\nI however have somehow decided that I will not back down on this and that her need to not squeeze through is not bigger than my need to not sit uncomfortably for the next 20 minutes. Also these women were not frail or elderly at all and quite small so I was under the impression that it would be no problem for her to take the empty seat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next 5 minutes this women then proceeds to mutter to her friend and give me the looks, until I decide to repeat my offer that she can sit in the corner and I will hold her baggage. She angrily agrees and sits down. For the next 15 minutes this women continues muttering and telling me outright that I am a dick for not scooting over but at this point I am not listening to her anymore and just sit there reading shit on my smartphone. Which is about when she gets up and leaves the train with her friend (about 3 stations later I guess).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA or not? Did I make a scene for nothing or was she in the right? I don't know why but I find myself thinking about this situation a lot.",

      "description": "Before you hate me I just would like to make clear I haven’t done this and wondering if I did would be an asshole. \n\nI go to a school right now and I am thirteen years old. I just joined a new school in September 2017.  The school year starts off with a trip to this day camp where kids go and meet each other. Getting new friends. I ended up sitting with this kid, let’s call him P. P seemed like a really nice guy, friendly cheerful and all. We got a long well until he’d started becoming really clingy. The school I go to has sports fields off campus so we have to go there by bus. P always wants to sit with me and not let me be with my friends. I found him to be quite obnoxious to me, not deliberately, but still. My friend told me P had sprayed a whole can of deodorant into her hair. One day I sat with someone different, despite saying I would go with P. I then told him that I preferred to go with my friend because I had personal matters (a white lie) on which I needed to discuss with my friend. P then proceeds to steal my friend’s pen, despite my friend saying ‘give it back it cost me £40!’ I then had to promise P that I would sit with him in exchange for him to give my friend his pen back. P refuses at first but then gives the pen back by tucking it towards his abdomen. My friend had to get of his chair and starch it to get it back. \n\n\n\nWill I be the asshole if I tell him I don’t want to be his friend anymore?\nThe reason I’m asking is because he has no friends and only talks to teachers. And is quite lonely. This is because of his actions. Sorry for bad grammar  and spacing, I’m on mobile.\n",

      "description": "So, as in many places recently, my area had it's first real snowfall of the season last week. So I was out shoveling, and when I was done I put out salt on the sidewalk, as city laws say I'm responsible for that. As I'm doing this, a guy walks up to me and asks me if it's pet safe rock salt. It's not, and I tell him as much, and he immediately goes off on me about how I'm being hugely inconsiderate to the pet owners in the neighborhood, because they still have to walk their dogs in the winter and how it's terrible that he has to be extra sure that his dog isn't hurt by the salt because of people like me. I kinda brushed him off, and after he saw that I wasn't going to engage with him, he left.\n\nNow, a couple of points in my defense: I don't have any pets. Pet safe rock salt is both more expensive ($11/bag vs. $4/bag) and it's a smaller bad (fifteen pound bags vs. twenty pound bags). This guy lives at the other end of the street from me, almost a quarter of a mile away, and he doesn't bring his dog this far down the street often anyway, as it apparently is old and has medical issues (this was all mentioned in his rant about how inconsiderate I was being). Finally, the only other person on the street who has pets (that I know of) has dogs that never actually leave their yard. \n\nBasically, I've been thinking about this since it happened. Am I the asshole for not buying pet safe rock salt, even if there aren't many pets in the area?",

      "description": "So I’ve (F17) been really sick lately. One part of it is a really bad cough and shortness of breath. My mother and her boyfriend smoke basically nonstop. Because of this, I wanted to leave my bedroom window open so I can get some fresh air. My room is on a completely different floor than them, so it wouldn’t even bother them unless they came up to my room. I only wanted it open until I was over this illness, even though I would prefer longer.\n\nMy mom’s boyfriend *freaked out* over the window being opened. He started screaming at me and said that if I didn’t go close it in ten seconds he would go get his drill and screw it shut. It’s already hard enough to breathe in this house with the window open. That would’ve just made it worst. \n\nWhen I asked my mom if she could text me if they leave (they usually head out to the casino every night- no jobs), she replied with this (copy and pasted):\n\n“So you don't think there's something wrong with you making the whole house cold because YOU want fresh air?”\n\nThis isn’t even close to being the only thing that’s happened, but this just really pissed me off. I want to have the ability to breathe decently and I’m getting treated as if I’m a terrible person. \n\nTL;DR: mom makes me feel like I’m being inconsiderate because I want to breathe fresh air with the window open when all she does is smoke ",

      "description": "I'm a 16M and my girlfriend is a 17F. This is my first legit relationship. \n\nSo basically the deal is I'm sick of my girlfriend not taking care of her mental Illness. It seems like every other day there is some kind of new problem, or she's all of a sudden got an urge to cut, or she just feels bad for no reason. I understand, because I have my own Medically diagnosed Mental health issues. What I don't understand is why she refused to get treatment or any kind of help at all. She was on Medicine for a while but she quit because it was 1. Giving her tremors and 2. She didn't like how it made her feel. Again that's understandable but she hasn't seemed to do anything to supplement it and honestly I can not be her therapist. It's hard enough for me to get through my daily day without trying to shoulder her along with me. I don't want to break up because I'm afraid she's going to hurt herself and because I geniuenly want her to get help. \n\nShe texted me about a half hour ago saying she had the urge to cut. I of course told her not to. She then said it's been going on for too weeks, which annoyed me because she's been saying everything's been fine. So I said she should speak with her therapist, and she said \"well I can't do that right now can I?\". I said I was here for her in the interim and she said \" but not here\" as in not at her house. I planned on staying home and I have been sick. Now she has the right to be a little mad cause I went out with my friend last night, so I'm obviously not sick enough to be bed ridden. I tell her I'm sick and say if she needs me to I will come over. She then just starts saying things like don't worry about it and no it's ok, and I reiterate that I'm there for her. Same responses. She invited me over earlier and I said no because her mom nor little sister was home and it makes me uncomfortable going behind her parents back like that. \n\nI feel guilty because I don't know what more I can do. Even when I've gone to comfort her it doesn't feel like I do much and she's always sad once I'm gone. It's really draining me ",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I had been dating for over 5 years, and I was ready to propose to her. She had mentioned offhandedly a year or so ago that it would mean a lot to her father (let's call him Will) if I was to ask for her hand in marriage. I think that this is a really old-fashioned tradition - why am I asking for permission to marry Will's daughter, when everyone involved knows that I'm going to marry her anyway, regardless of what he says? They also have no intention of paying for the entire wedding, so it's not like they adhere to all these traditions anyway.\n\nMy own parents never told me how to properly ask for permission to marry someone and my then-girlfriend (now fiancé) gave me no tips. So I did what I thought was right, and sat Will down and told him of my intention to propose to his daughter in a few days time. He avoided answering for a few hours and kept me hanging, until we were literally driving to the airport to pick up his daughter and finally said that I could have his blessing.\n\nI thought that all was well, but now, two months into our engagement, Will and his wife keep making snide comments (never in front of me, but my fiancé tells me about them) about how I was insulting in the way that I went about this whole situation, I'm not the traditional, chivalristic man that he thought I was, I asked permission in such an unconventional way, etc. etc. It's really driving a wedge between my fiancé and I because of how frequently it has come up. Like I said, I was never raised or told explicitly by anyone (fiancé, Will, my own parents) how to ask for someone's permission for marriage. AITA for not doing it to his standards, and possibly creating lifelong resentment? Or is this something that everyone but me knows how to do, and do properly?",

That being said, I recently cut contact with her after she posted something racist on Facebook. She was annoyed with another driver (who was apparently black), and she decided to post a racist screed about how she hates minorities. It was really troubling; I told her it wasn’t appropriate and defriended her. I will have to see racist cousin at an upcoming holiday party, and now I’m not sure I was in the right.

      "description": "**TL;DR:** Had an abusive rs, parents knew how bad it was for me, found out that I planned to keep talking to her sparsely after I  wanted to hurt myself, threatened my belongings and college education if I talked to her. I want them to know how much they hurt me.\n\nThis'll sound a bit convoluted at the start, but bear with me.\n\nFrom March until August, I was in an LDR with a girl I truly loved to the ends of the earth, but for multiple reasons including an abusive home on her end, it was incredibly toxic for both of us. She was manipulative most of the time and in early August, she had told me she came up positive on a pregnancy test after our meetup a week or so prior (because I was a stupid kid and didn't use protection). I had just moved in for my first college semester, so that on top of possibly being a dad crumbled on me and I told her I wanted to kill myself. Worried for me, she called campus police and they took me to a crisis center overnight.\n\nI'm under 18, so they had to tell my parents. I had to tell them about the possible pregnancy (which eventually turned out to be false). Once I left the hospital, I called this girl and told her things were over. She was sad and did her usual tricks to try and get me to stay, and I fell for it and told her we could check in on each other once every few months. I was mulling this over to myself and ultimately changed my mind later that day, but hadn't told her yet.\n\nMy parents ended up snooping through my text messages with her and found out. Upon seeing this, my mom gave me two options: take away my desktop that I built with my own money as well as my cell and laptop until further notice, or they would withdraw me from college. I was furious and got into a series of huge arguments with my parents. My dad wanted to get a restraining order on this girl and didn't even consider taking my stuff, he just wanted me home.\n\nAfter a long series of angry, tear-filled talks, they took all my stuff, gave me a flip phone, and left me at school. They told me they'd be monitoring my accounts and if I tried to contact this girl, they would withdraw me from school or stop supporting me financially once I'm 18 (they have loans in their names on my education). Not even a week later, they told me they trust me again and gave me everything back. I was confused, but glad I had all that.\n\nI've talked to them less over time, only for family visits and appointments with my psych since I need an adult present to get my antidepressants.\n\nBut I'm still incredibly bitter at them. To me, they've essentially used my college education as a bargaining chip to be over-protective of me. I know they love and care about me, and they've supported me most of my childhood, but their behavior here broke a lot of the trust I had in them. The fact that they wanted to get a restraining order on this underage girl who was nearly 2000 miles away from us disgusted me. I want them to know it, because I don't know how long I can boil my emotions without having a breakdown.",

      "description": "There’s a recent meme that’s been blowing up on the internet lately of a transgender women who goes into GameStop and the cashier says sir instead of mam, which the transgender female doesn’t like. She (he) decides to kick stuff around (games), yell and demand that the cashier call him a her. In a customer service setting, it’s both respectful and a way to keep a customer but the other customer asking her (him) to relax got the transgender women upset, starts kicking stuff more violently and I believe even threatening the both the customer and the worker. I say this all because someone posted on fb that it’s never ok to misgender someone and that she (he) is a meme because they are transgender, which I felt it’s more the way she (he) acted. We got into a fb argument and the person who posted it explains how I’m transphobic if I think it’s ok to “pick and choose” when to respect ones pronouns. All I said was, if I were threatened and treated disrespectfully by a trans person, I would misgender them. Which got her super pissed and told me she was very offended. Look, I believe in respecting people’s pronouns but if they are being the asshole to you, threatening you or being hateful to you, you shouldn’t have to respect them as they aren’t respecting you. So I told her that and she goes on to say that misgendering someone is the same as being racial to someone, which I think isn’t true. Being a raciest and saying someone’s assigned gender are not the same in my eyes, especially when it’s said by someone who says she identifies as “various genders and no gender all the same time”. She then calls me a female (I’m a guy) since she feels I didn’t respect the transgender females gender, which is hypocritical as she literally told me that you don’t get to pick and choose what to call someone under any circumstance. I just believe to let live, if someone wants to call themself something, you should respect it but if you choose not to, it’s rude and shouldn’t happen; but it shouldn’t be the same as calling someone of color a racial slur. So now that you read all that, please tell me; Am I the asshole? ",

Literally the next day I saw basically a copy of it on a scrap piece of paper on the floor and felt weirded out by it but didn’t know what to say.   Then they started posted / tagging the art and I felt ripped off and spent a week wondering if I should say something.   This morning I told them that what they’re posting makes me uncomfortable , and showed them my art again to explain why. They pretty much told me that they don’t remember me showing them that, and that “everyone does that style” and that they’re not going to stop. They asked me what I wanted them to do and I said I didn’t know.  \n\n\nShould I sit let it go?  Would I be wrong to confront them again? I feel like they should do their own shit and that they belittled my art. ",

      "description": "Tinder date asked me after the fact where I learned to have sex that rough. I tend to bite, spank, and grab during sex. She was into it but I guess she never met someone as \"aggressive\" as me.\n\nI just tell her that it comes naturally to me. That Ive thought about that stuff a lot, ever since I was young. She asks me more questions and I admit that I also think about hurting people in general.\n\nIf you ever played Hotline Miami theres a line in there that asks \"Do you like to hurt people\" or something along those lines and it resonated very deeply with me, because I do, and I know thats wrong.\n\nI think about hurting women during sex, I think about hurting men any other time. But those thoughts have never translated to reality and I am pretty much a normal guy. She is put off by me admitting this, and says just having thoughts like that make me a sociopath.\n\nI disagreed at the time. Why is that an issue if it hurts no one. Am I the asshole for just thinking about hurting people, despite being non violent? ",

They didn’t tell me they didn’t on mine however, so I naturally assumed they had. When we arrived, I used my 4G for a little while, before turning off my mobile data. After that, I made about 1 call and used my 4G for probably less than two minutes. This equated to 0.35 Gs of data used, which in my plan costed 350 dollars.\n\nKeep in mind my sister was using her data for pretty much the entire trip so far, texting and making calls too, and her cost is nowhere near as much as mine.\n\nNow my parents are mad at me for costing so much money, but in my defence I didn’t know I had such a dumb plan as NOBODY told me they just didn’t bother installing roaming on my phone, and I only used 0.35 G which in my mind was barely anything.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "A little background info: This pertains to some of my closest friends. People I've known and spent time with since I was in middle school. I also have a hard time saying no to them because I know if I needed something they're going to be there for me no matter what.\nOn to the relevant information:\nI recently moved into a new apartment that has a really nice gym that is supposed to be for residents and their guests only. We have a security guy that comes by to check occasionally but he really doesn't do much unless you're causing problems. \n\nAnyways, a lot of my close friends have come over to workout with me/use the facilities with me a bunch of times but recently I've been busy so I turned them down a few times. After a few times of being turned down they asked if they could borrow the access key to the gym and use it while I was out doing my own things and I agreed a couple of times. \n\nRecently though I've gotten a little tired of being asked for my access key since it's gotten to the point that they ask to come over at random times or if I'm not at home they ask if they can meet me where ever I'm going to get the access key so I told them that this is becoming a hassle for me because I have to make time between my plans to give them the key and then wait another few days until I see them again to get it back. \n\nTheir solution to that is to have me get another access key that they can keep and use whenever they want so they don't bother me.\n\nI decided that it's not fair to the rest of the people living in the apartment since they're paying residents and my friends are not. When I told them I wouldn't do it they threw a huge fit and argued that it's not hurting anyone since most of the times they go there aren't people there ( not true I've been with them many times and people have been there using equipment every single time). \n\nThey went on to about how they let me use their stuff such as letting me borrow their video games or their cars when mine isn't working so I should be a bro and get an extra key for them. I turned them down and they've been mad about it ever since. I feel kind of bad because they have let me borrow their stuff many times but at the same time it's not their apartment complex and I feel like I could get in a lot of trouble if they were ever asked by security.\n\n**TL;DR Friends use my apartment gym all the time but it got annoying for me to give them my access key all the time. Their solution is for me to lie and say I lost my key and to get another one to give to them. I turned them down but they're mad because they've given me stuff and helped me out in the past.** ",

      "description": "I'm not trying to brag or anything, this is relevant to the story. I was fortunate enough to be born into an extremely wealthy family. I'm talking levels of wealth that my future grandkids would not need to work for a single day of their lives. I own a bunch of properties that I buy and sell.\n\nI met a girl about 4 years ago who seemed pretty fantastic. This woman was born into a dirt poor family and went straight into work after highschool. She barely made ends meet but was a happy and humorous girl. We started dating, and for the first year I hid my wealth from her because I didn't want to attract gold diggers. When it became clear to me that she was not a gold digger I told her about my wealth. This did not change our relationship for the most part.\n\nAs the years went on I allowed her to stay at one of the properties I own rent free. Beyond that she always dreamed of getting a certain college degree. I was paying for her housing, her food, he utilities and for about half her tuition. This is fine for me. I once again am not trying to sound like a rich douche, but this money that I was spending on her affected me in no way.\n\nAnyways, a few weeks ago I found out she was cheating on me. I broke up with her obviously, and I stopped providing her financial support completely. She works part time. She will not have enough money to pay rent, she will not have enough money for school. I realize that I am not responsible for her financially, but I feel like an ass. I truly am doing this out of spite. I don't need the money, it makes no difference to me. I am knowingly condemning her to liekly homelessness and ruining her chances at a degree out of spite. I think I'm an asshole, am I?",

      "description": "I have a housemate that I don't know terribly well, but recently they leased another flat and let our house know that they would not be paying rent on our house anymore and it is up to us to find a sub-letter, no compromise. The only reasoning they are giving us is that something has happened in their personal life. It is unlikely we're going to be able to find a sub-letter on this short notice so it is highly likely we will end up paying this person's rent and our currently rent is the highest of any students I know.\n\nThe remaining housemates and I are not protected against these kinds of things as our lease is joint and several so I know legally I'm screwed, I'm more so looking for moral advice. I'm fairly sure the issue is mental health related and not monetary as we all go to a fairly privileged university. A few housemates know this person pretty well so they are defending this person's decision to skip rent and saying the rest of us should assume this person is at an all time low and trying to turn it around, although they do not know the root cause either. I truly wish this person nothing but the best in their new place but I'm struggling to see why I'm morally obligated to not be upset about being forced into this position? For contrast, when I knew I had to sublet my room in the same house, I let my housemates know right away, took the entire burden on myself, and did not tell my housemates to figure it out for themselves. \n\nBonus points if you have any writings by philosophers that might apply here because I'm a bit of a nerd for that stuff. If any of my housemates are reading this, I'm posting here because I'm uncertain not because I'm trying to prove a point lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I'm upset I have to pay rent for someone I hardly know and I haven't been given a reason other than they \"had to drop all their commitments\", AITA?",

I always felt like the odd one out, but we were all still pretty close regardless. John came out to us that he was gay.

I found some of the things they said funny but I never said anything hurtful and I never told John. One day, out of nowhere, John contacted me and was super upset because he found out that I was talking shit about him (which was not true) and told me he was done with me and to never speak to him again. Which hurt me that I didnt get a chance to say my side and he was quick to believe whatever someone else told him.\n\nFast forward, I was still friends with Chris for a while, but he was still friends with John which was pretty awkward. However, I felt that Chris was close to John and didnt care for me, so I started not talking to Chris too. One day he did say hi to me, and I walked away from him with saying hi back because I thought he was being fake. Ever since we haven’t spoken. Ive been in the same room with them both and havent spoken a word to either of them - and dont think I ever will again, which is saddening. But am I the asshole in the situation??",

      "description": "Some back story: my girl had a really rough life until she was 14 and finally came to live with us. I've known her since she was 7 because I lived with her mother and we were both heroin addicts. There's a whole lot of back story so I'm not gonna get into it, but I realised how shitty of a person her mother was and separated myself from her, but I ended up meeting my stepdaughters father about 9 years ago and we've been together almost 7 years. My girl ended up in foster care and cys (children and youth services) never even tried to contact her father and when we finally found out where she was he had to fight for a year to get her. She had a lot of issues at first, the worst of it was the pathological and compulsive lying, but then came the boys. I don't totally blame her, her mother was horrible and slept with anyone she could. Now she's 19 and she has this boyfriend who is abusive, physically and emotionally. She has cheated on him multiple times with multiple different people, so she's not innocent either. The kid isn't allowed here because he has no respect for our rules and she lies to us constantly \"oh brandy is picking me up\" like I don't look out the window and see it's this little asshole. She started college and she met a kid who's a really good guy and she's basically using him for his car, I think she does care about him, but as soon as the good kid leaves, she's getting picked up by \"brandy\". This kid is legitimately crazy, he drives past our house on a regular basis, when he was allowed here he would pinch her/slap her over and over again until she finally defended herself and he would gaslight her into feeling bad that she hurt him back. He would constantly be trying to get in her pants right on our couch and it definitely worked at least once because my husbands blanket was on the couch and I went to get it and there was fucking sperm on it. That's when we decided he's not allowed here anymore. Last week she told me she was getting picked up by \"brandy\" and usually before she leaves she'll tell me she's going and we say our I love  you's but she didn't that day so I went and looked out the window, sure as shit she's getting picked up by that fuck bag, literally an hour after the other kid left. I stewed over this for a couple of days until she said something about getting picked up by a female friend and I said something along the lines of \"oh, does this one have facial hair too?\" And she totally freaked. Saying that she's acting like her mother and no one believes a word that comes out of her mouth was probably a bit much, I do feel bad about it, but we have no idea what to do! We've gone about it every which way we can, including telling her if she's going to continue seeing that asshole, we just don't wanna hear about him or the drama that comes with him. I've asked her repeatedly not to lie to me about who's picking her up, don't say a name or anything, just say \"Hey I'm going out I'll be back later\" it's the lying that pisses me off. I know she has to make her own choices and mistakes, so I don't tell her what to do, just give advice if she asks for it. I'm her mom, she is MY daughter and we love each other. I told her I was sorry for what I said and we've made up. Please someone give me some advice on any aspect of this, even tell me I'm an asshole if that's your opinion. We just don't know what to do.",

      "description": "So we started talking not too long ago about random things. The first thing she really said to me was “I’m a little I hope you don’t mind” I didn’t really care and we continued talking. I feel we really clicked and we were talking for a whole day. Things started to get kinda weird when she insisted on calling me Daddy (I’m 15 and she’s 14) again I didn’t really care but it was always just in the back of my head. She always seemed to be crying whenever we texted as well because she couldn’t tell anyone that she was a little and I did feel bad for her and I’d comfort text her. \n\nThings started getting worse yesterday, she went shopping and bought a pacifier and a baby bottle, I definitely thought this was weird but it wasn’t really affecting me all to much. \n\nCut to about 30 min ago, we were talking and I brought up how I was allergic to my cat and him rubbing against my leg made it itchy. She replied “I imagined myself rubbing against your leg and it made by no no parts tingly.” I desperately tried to change the subject and then she said “send me a photo of your special place” I was jokingly going to send her a picture of the fortnite lobby. Then she said “I want a picture of your cock.” \n\nI basically blocked her straight away. I unblocked her and sent her a few paragraphs explaining some things and how if she really needed someone to talk to she could message me but she could no longer call me daddy. She replied saying don’t worry, don’t text me. I can’t help but feel like I was a bit too quick to block and basically end a friendship Which was going well. Am I the asshole here.",

      "description": "TL;DR boyfriend keeps on spending money on games but is very stingy when it comes to important things. told him that he needed to have a limit on how much he spends on gaming but ended up in an argument.\n\nThis is a throwaway because I just pretty much wanna remain anonymous so he would not found out. My boyfriend is a gamer, he said he just grew up in a gaming family so pretty much inn his free time, all he does is game. I don't mind, I let him do what he wants and then I go out do what I want. Mostly going out with my friends or just having movie night with the girls.\n\nLately though, a lot of games has been coming out that has piqued his curiosity and wanted every game. Almost. He drops a couple hundred dollars on his games, of course I understand it's his money. One thing, that irritates me a bit is when it comes to household items and groceries, he becomes really hesitant. Claiming that we shouldn't spend too much on groceries (he won't let me buy groceries with my money but I end up doing it anyway).\n\nHe's been complaining about how he's always broke. I told him that he should probably slow down on getting every game he can get. Today alone, he spent about $200 for Fortnite and Fallout '76. He has been trying to persuade me to let him buy Soul Calibur. As I was not feeling well today, I scolded him that he should probably save more money so that he doesn't complain being broke all the time. Spend his money on things that actually needed. Told him that he don't need to get his hands on every game he gets. He got mad and we're not talking right now because I'm too tired to argue about how stupid this is.",

      "description": "I had my son back in January 2018 and this man has been a constant in my son's life. He gave me money for a crib (that I didn't end up buying due to lack of space), he 'gave' me his car to drive while pregnant with the understanding he would financially help me get a better car for the safety of the baby (he kept telling me to pick a car, but without knowing his budget I felt uncomfortable choosing a car so I gave him a list of cars I liked and said whatever he found would work. He never found one so I moved on and did my own thing.) He visited in the hospital after my son was born. This man has been extremely supportive and kind to me and my son since day 1. \n\nThe early weeks of being home he often stopped by unannounced (me and baby lived with my mom, still do in fact) and he often stayed for a few hours. Being a fresh mom that just had a fairly traumatic c-section, the last thing I wanted to do was wear pants-- or a shirt most days-- that would press on my new incision. Yet here he was, almost 4 days a week, knocking louder than a 300sqft apartment calls for, me scrambling to put pants on while trying to settle the started baby. He always asked how I was, if I needed anything, which I greatly appreciated. But c'mon. I don't want to wear these pants. Please leave. \n\nAnd he would stay. And I would awkwardly leave the room every so often to try and nurse while he watched soccer and twiddled on his phone. So now do I have to wear pants, but now I can't watch my own show. \n\nThen he started calling himself Grampa Pheonix and I had to have a discrete talk with my mom about how I didn't like that he had dubbed himself a grampa. \n\nOne day he showed up and asked if I had gotten the baby vaccinated (he was only a month old) and when I said no, he exclaimed \"Good! Don't do it. He will get autism.\" I looked at my mom and had to leave the room before I told him he is in no way apart of that decision process. \n\nSo fast forward to last week. My son's first birthday. This man has decided I \"need to open my son an account so he can put money in for his college. Like $20,000 by the time he's 18.\" Ok dude, looky here. I do not need your money. My son does not need to grow up with the silver spoon you keep pushing on him. Kindly fuck off. I informed him I already have an account set up for his college fund and I do not need help. \n\nWell everyone, I came home yesterday and saw an envelope with \"Happy Birthday Mr Carter (not my son's name, by the way. His nickname is Cardo), From Mom, Grandpa- Godfather\" written on it, and $200 cash inside. \n\nI find this \"gift\" to be extremely in poor taste as I have made it clear I don't need or want his money for my son. Plus I made it clear he is not my son's grampa and I don't appreciate him self-declaring it. And now this Godfather status?? I feel like he's blatantly ignoring my wishes and my mom is enabling it. \n\nSo Reddit. AMIT here? Do I give the money back and reiterate my feelings? Help me out here. ",

      "description": "Two of my best friends got into a relationship with eachother over the summer. They are really happy together, and I'm genuinely really happy for them as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm beginning to resent some aspects of the relationship. They eat lunch with our group of friends, but spend the whole time engaging in PDA. Whenever the two of them are together it's the same thing, which makes it impossible to hang out with both of them at the same time. It's nothing too intense, but it pretty much causes them to disengage from everyone else. This doesn't bother me too much in group settings, but when I'm hanging out with them myself I regularly find my words ignored in favor of them looking into eachothers eyes. It makes my presence feel really unnecessary and not valued when I'm with people that are my two closest friends, which is not great for my social insecurity. I've talked to them about this very honestly and politely, and they've empathized but also not changed anything about their behaviour. I think that it's honestly kind of selfish to completely ignore everything around them especially when they're just with one other person. I don't want for them to break up by any means, I love how happy they make each other, but I'm really getting tired of feeling like such a third wheel, and I'm considering confronting them in a more aggressive manner. Is this an asshole mindset? I feel like I'm being much too sensitive and self-absorbed ",

      "description": "So I found an article about healthy, non-rabid wolves attacking villagers, so I screenshotted it and posted it to an unnamed forum about wolves. (Keep in mind the title was a little passive-aggressive. Something like 'dont use only sick wolves attack humans as a defense.')\n\nI obviously expected a reaction, and I got a few comments here and there correcting me. Sure, I'll read your articles and take your criticism as well.\n\nAnd then a moderator saw my post. Now, it's been a while since this happened. (2-3 yrs) So don't expect me to remember every detail.\n\nTurns out, they said posting screenshots was against the rules. But I didn't know that at the time. PLIS, there were screenshots everywhere else on the article. Not only that, but I didn't see a reason why you couldn't post screenshots. So, naturally, I retaliated. (I was 13 or 14 at the time. I'm also diagnosed with autism.)\n\nWhat I posted was something along the lines of 'Bruh you're just salty I found a documented case of this.'\n\nThe post was removed on the spot. \n\nLooking back now, I can't really tell if that moderator was just doing their job and I was ignorant, or if they didn't like me saying something they didn't like about their favorite animal.",

      "description": "Hello,\n\nThis may be long, I appreciate everyone that took the time to read this.\n\nImportant details to note:\n\nMy parents (56/55) are very loving however both of them are alcoholics, irresponsible with raising children and irresponsible financially. My dad constantly gets DUIs and is an abusive piece of shit most of the time and my mom enables the crap out of his and has now joined him in all this. They have both bought many homes, lost many homes, have been through bankruptcy, spent thousands of dollars on my dad's DUI cases, have left myself and my younger sisters (I'm 28,they're 25/24)for me to raise from a young age (7ish). They would disappear for days in end working odd jobs, they never showed up for parent teacher meetings or looked at our school work/ report cards. \n\nThey bought a house under my name when I was young and didn't pay properly and ruining my credit to where I couldn't even qualify for a $500 credit card. \n\nHowever, they are always willing to help in anyway they can when they are sober. Our birthday parties have always been happy memories, they travelled with us alot and have bought us anything we've ever wanted (more or less within reason).\n\nThe problem:\n\nMy parents had a house that my sister and I helped pay for (the home that ruined my credit). They bought this house so that they would be able to help us out when we got married and got our own homes. When I got married last year, we sat down and everyone agreed to sell the home as they had alot of debt on it and would not be able to afford it without my help. The mortgage plus debt per month was about $5200/month not including cars and bills.\n\nWhen they sold the house, they got a little leftover money after paying the debts, that we all as a family agreed to give to me to get a house and when my sisters decided to buy their houses in the future, I would give them their portions split evenly. As my parents are not responsible enough to hold on to it. \n\nMy husband and I bought our home, and my dad went to jail shortly after for a few months and we tried to help my mom out as much as we can, we lent her close to $2000 even though my mom was not working. My sisters were paying all the bills and I felt bad so we helped. My dad has been out for a month, both my parents work now and they still keep asking for money and I refused even though they gave me money for my wedding and the house. One of my sisters still live at home and pays rent, the other one lives with me as it was toxic for her to live at home when my dad got out. \n\nI still lent them $500 yesterday, saying I borrowed it from someone else so they would be inclined to pay me back but I want to believe that this is the last time I will do it. \n\nWIBTA if I refused to going forward?

      "title": "AITA For calling My Boyfriend's Best Friend Out?",
      "description": "   For pistols at dawn. Well... maybe not. But almost. My Boyfriend’s best friend has been an asshole lately. BF hasn’t seen him for months and he barely texts or calls. BF had a birthday party for a major birthday this past Saturday and asshole best friend- henceforth known as ABF, who was supposed to come didn’t show, with no explanation. Today was BF's actual birthday and ABF texts “by the way happy birthday dude.” To which my response was eyes of flame. I am fuckin furious. Goddamn righteous anger is pouring in a waterfall from my mouth as I watch my gentle, kind, wonderful boyfriend, who would let himself get run over by a car if it meant not hurting someone's feelings, wilt. Not even a fuckin phone call from his supposed best friend.  \n   My BF has picked this friend’s drunk ass up in a goddamn hurricane, has been his designated driver even when he's not invited out, driven him home from hours away in the middle of the night. He makes all the excuses in the world for him- but at this point, I’ve had enough.  \nI ask BF to give me the dude’s number- I’d like to have a word with him. Bf protests- making more excuses on his behalf, but gives it to me.  \nThe following conversation ensues.   \n**Me**: Hey \\[ABF\\], it's laurelynfaye \\[BF\\] gave me your number.\n\n**ABF**: What's up (no question mark. Ass.) \n\n**Me**: I wanted to thank you for telling \\[BF\\] Happy Birthday. Since you couldn't make it to his party.\n\n**ABF**: Okay, how's he doing?\n\n**Me**: He's fine. He was hurt that you, someone he considers his best friend, couldn't come and neglected to let him know, but lots of others managed to make it. Even \\[friend 1 ABF has issues with\\] and \\[friend 2 ABF doesn't like\\], who he hasn't seen in years. \\[BF\\] was thrilled. He had a wonderful time. \\[BF\\] Forgives you, of course. Says you were probably busy. But me? Well. Let's just say I think you could be a better friend. And that \\[BF\\] deserves better from you. \n\n**ABF**: I told \\[BF\\] it was a maybe (BF says he confirmed his attendance, but maybe there was a misunderstanding, though I'm not inclined to think so.) Saturday was my one day back in Houston and I left. I'll be back for the weekend of Christmas then gone again. After that Next time, I'll be in Houston will be late March/ early April.\n\n**Me**: So he said (in reference to ABF being busy.) And yet. He deserves better from you. He hasn't seen you in months. And before that for just as long. I have the right to be angry with you on his behalf. Treat him better. Get in touch more often. That's all I have to say. \n\nThis is where the conversation ended. I think I was within my rights, and I was honest and forthright with my boyfriend about the conversation ABF and I were having. Part of it on my side is guilt because I think their relationship may have changed when BF and I became a couple, a year ago now. But I encourage BF to spend time with his friends, I was the one who talked him into a party, and due to living about 45 minutes from each other he sees them as much as or even more than he sees me. (We were close friends for a year and a half before we got together, and I know how important his friends are to him, ABF in particular, due to all the stories I've heard.)\n\nThe last time ABF even asked BF to hang out was 2 months ago, and he texted BF last minute on a Friday night to see if he wanted to go, right then, to Ren Camp for a whole weekend. BF was with me at the time, we were spending one of our rare nights together, and told ABF he couldn't as he was with me. ABF was less than pleased. Before that BF hadn't seen ABF since late July, in spite of BF inviting ABF out a number of times. The time in June was a party BF's brother was throwing and ABF got so drunk before BF ever got there, that ABF didn't recognize BF. I feel that this is unacceptable behavior for a friend and told him so. I'm starting to wonder if I was in the wrong though, with distance from the issue. AITA for calling him out?  \n ",

The whole situation is sad an awful, and I'd like to think I've been as supportive as I could in the past 2 years.\n\nOne thing that didn't bother me at first was the fact that everytime I said something J didn't like, she'd bring up K's death. Or talk about something sad that happened in my personal life, she would bring up J, as if it was a competition.\n\n\"Oh your cat ran away? My best friend died.\"\n\nStuff like that.\nIt's getting more and more aggravating because it seems like everytime I try and talk to her about something serious or something that she did that upset me, she brings up K.

I’m just starting out so it’s nothing big. \n\nI had to take another job at a local restaurant to help with expenses and recently made friends with some co-worker there. We hung out last Sunday and I brought along my professional camera. I took pictures of them because I wanted to. I offered to give it to them for free. I also promised to do some minor editing for them. I didn’t tell them when I would have it ready, though. \n\nThe night we parted, this dude kept on bugging me to give him the pictures I just took a couple of hours ago. I explained to him that I can’t work on it right now because I had some other stuff waiting for me to edit for a client I had. He said ok, then the next day he kept on bugging me. I got so annoyed that I just did the pictures first so that he would shut up. \n\nI messaged him in a lighthearted way that the pictures are ready and I hope he was happy now because I had to do it first over my current projects. \n\nThis what pissed me off the most, he just replied with a “hahahaha” and something along the lines of “cool, bro”. He didn’t even say thank you! \n\nI got pissed and told him that’s rude. He told me that he didn’t thought I would get angry for such a minor thing. I then proceeded to very bluntly tell him to at least say thank you. He eventually did. \n\nDid I overreact? I read back all the messages I’ve sent about the matter and I noticed I was slowly getting more passively aggressive each time I replied until the final one.  I’ve been on edge because of lack sleep lately and I don’t know if I was the rude one or not. \n\ntldr: AITA for snapping at a newly made friend because he didn’t say thank you after I edited his pictures?",

      "description": "Hey guys; been dating my (25F) bf (27M) for almost 4 years now and we’ve lived together for 2.5.  This has been happening for a while now and I’ve read books and tried to be understanding that my boyfriend should be able to do what makes him happy and if it’s not a huge deal then I should just let things be... and that I can’t expect my SO to do the same things that I’m willing to do for him.\n\nIt just really hurts my feelings that after a week or two of us being apart, he will constantly say how much he misses me, and I will say the same back but when I am finally home the first night and want nothing more than to see him, he stays out absurdly long at his work party (like 3-4 am). I totally get that if there is a work party he should be there to network and have fun, but I can’t help feeling that in the reverse situation, I’d go to the work event but leave slightly earlier (like maybe 9-10pm) to be able to spend some quality time with him after not seeing him for so long. I especially wouldn’t have the mood to go clubbing when my SO is at home waiting to see me. I don’t have any suspicions on cheating or anything.. it just hurts my feelings somehow.\n\nI got really upset at this in the past... I’m not sure where this low feeling comes from but each time it happens I get to the point question whether I want to be with him long term. Maybe it’s the imbalance I feel? Am I just being a baby? I’m debating whether I should calmly talk to him that him going out late the night when I’m back from a long trip hurts my feelings... but I’m worried it’ll turn into an argument. Im thinking I should probably say it anyway and see how he reacts since it bugs me so much.\n\nI feel how I’ve been dealing with it is I just try to ignore it- we don’t get into fights about it but to be honest I don’t feel as crazy about him as I did in the past.. maybe this belongs in relationship advice lol",

      "description": "This is my first post ever and I'm on mobile. I hope I'm doing this right...\n\nOk, so we've been dating for a few months (oct 2018) with no major problems. He told me when we met that he had 2 kids from a previous relationship. That was fine with me. When I asked why him and his kids mother broke up, he told me she caught him cheating on her and kicked him out of their house. He currently lives with his mother. They were together since high school. So I asked him one day, why they never got married, since they were together for so many years. (Up to this point he always referred to her as his baby momma...) at first he said it just didn't happen, then he told me they did get married. And still are, just separated. I was kind of upset but not majorly, since I'm also in the same situation. Except I left my husband and we are currently getting a divorce. I told him he could have told me that but ok...\nWe went on a trip to Texas in December, he met my family, we had a good time. And so far, he's really good to me. Very supportive, comes through when I need him, shows up for me... etc\nWe went to a new years party together and I saw that day that he texted his wife \"happy new year. I still love you\" which made me extremely uncomfortable. So I asked him, how do you and your wife talk? Are you still trying to make things work with her? Because if you are, then there's no reason for me to be around. At this time, he didn't know I saw the text and assured me that he's into me and the marriage is over. \nSo, we're still going out, seeing each other several times a week and on wknds. He told me he was going to a Knicks game. I didn't question it. BUT I was still uncomfortable about that new years text and (sue me) I looked in his phone to see how he really talked to his wife. \nI found out that he wasn't telling the truth about a lot of things. The biggest thing was the reason he and his wife split. It was because he got the other woman pregnant and she had his child... currently 8 months old. And reading further, I found that he sees this other woman at least once a week and has been sleeping with her. And i also saw that he is going to the game with her and not the friend he told me he was going with. In that conversation she told him she got a hotel room in midtown and wasn't going to be on her period... he told her he was going to try to take off work (he works nights)...\n\nSo last Saturday morning I asked him about all of this, he was confused about how I found out, but he did FINALLY tell me what was going on. I didn't tell him everything I knew, I let it out bit by bit. He thought I had a friend at Verizon giving me info. Then I suggested that it was his new baby's mother telling me stuff, so he calls her right there and asks her if she's been telling his girl things about him. She asks, \"which one?\" And then proceeds to start cursing him out and blah blah blah....\nSo all week we've been talking about this. He apologized and brought me flowers. Told me he should have told me about the other kid. And I told him how I really found out, by reading his texts. And I also told him that him going to the game makes me incredibly uncomfortable but he feels that he should go because I went through his phone. He also says that the plans to go were made before we met. I told him that doesn't matter, because I'm here now. And those plans need to change. He feels I'm being unreasonable. I don't think I am.\nLastly, we've only been dating since October and were supposedly exclusive since new year's. I've been upfront and honest with him since we've been seeing each other and I THOUGHT I was getting the same back. When he told me he was still married, I asked him if there was anything else I needed to know, he told me no. This was in the beginning of December. \nSo now I'm feeling like if he does go to this game, he's telling me he doesn't give a damn how I feel about it, he is going to do whatever he wants...\n\nTl;dr: found out boyfriend was lying and cheating on me, and still wants to go to the basketball game with the woman he was cheating on me with, even though I told him it doesn't seem right and makes me uncomfortable. He feels that because I went through his phone and read his texts, that he's justified in going. \nAITA for not wanting him to go? \n\n*I don't know if it matters but they're supposedly floor seats, but who knows, he could be lying about that too...",

      "description": "First of all sorry for the title, couldn't think of anything better.\n\nContext: So, two close friends of mine had a child together recently, and named me godfather. They had some requests that I 100% agree (like vaccines, washing your hands to pick up the baby etc) and some that i don't necessarily do (like no cursing with the baby present, even though she will not learn anything) but follow, since, well, their child.\n\nAnd one of the things they specifically told everyone they don't want is kissing the baby. Something related to baby acne, I don't know a lot about, but the rules were set. But their grandmother simply cannot understand that and insists on hugging and kissing the baby whenever they aren't looking.\n\nI told the parents about it and boy they were pissed, confronted the grandmother and I thought problem solved. But no, she continued to do it and I was included on her \"avoid doing while looking\" list, and some marks (don't know if indeed acne, a regular rash or some other thing) started to appear on the baby's face.\n\nNow to the possible asshole part: one day, I catch her with some other family members kissing and passing the baby as it was a doll for them to put their lips on, so I came in, asked for the baby kinda already taking her from the grandm. She insisted on not giving him to me, saying she was family and i'm not, and I have no right to take her grandchildren from her, to Wich I replied \"well, if an outsider cares more about the baby's health than her own grandmother, I think the problem isn't on me, when you learn to follow the rules the parents set, I'll give her back to you\" and went to another room.\n\nNot 10 minutes later the rest of the family all left, and the mother said even if I'm right, I shouldn't have said that. I apologized but I'm divided because later the father thanked me and said I did what I should've done. So, AITA here? Do I have a position to make sure the parents rules are followed even if it's against the blood family?\n",

I asked if it was hers and she said it wasn't hers. We immediately knew who it was. A girl who was the nephew of a now imprisoned drug dealer. Her father was an is very incorporated in the dealing and their house is full of ferraris and other expensive cars.\n\nI pulled up a news article on her uncles arrest, in the national news I would like to add. Now, as you can guess because she loaned this girl a gucci scarf, this girl was quite a good friend of hers. She told me I should respect him. To that I responded \"I don't have respect for drug dealers to be honest\" she stormed into the room later with the other girl and a teacher as she explained to the teacher that I said I don't have respect for drug dealers.\n\nSo my question is not really whether that was the wrong words to use as I think that can be universally agreed upon. But AIMTA for pulling up this article in the national news. Keep in mind, everyone knew about the uncles history. ",

      "description": "For some context I will give you some backstory first. I am a 18 yr old girl diagnosed with depression, anxiety, OCD, and ADD. My inner circle of friends all have some form of depression as well. My friends are always talking about how depressed they are and how much they want to die. Most of the time their just joking and I'm no different. Humor has been the one thing keeping me grounded with my mental issues and I use it frequently to cope. My role in the friend group is the backbone, the person who keeps you grounded and listen to everybody's problems. I've never been the one to truly talk about my depression openly, mostly making it into a joke when I do so I don't feel like a pussy. My friends are the opposite, day after day I listen to their problems and how depressed they are.  One friend in particular has a lot of problems and a history of abuse. I try to help her but I know she needs therapy for her problems. I know I can't help her in the way she needs and doesn't really take my advice. She doesn't respect herself and that's a big problem. I'm starting to become bitter around my friends and distancing myself, refraining myself from telling them to grow up. I know you can't stop feeling depressed. I've been dealing with this since I was 8. But I can't help but view them as enjoying drowning in their self pity. I think about killing myself a lot but I drag my ass out of it and tell my self to stop being a bitch. The world doesn't owe you anything and it could be a lot worse.\n\nSo I need to know AITA for getting tired of listening a dealing with my depressed friends problems all the time?",

She asked Why in a really whiney tone and I said “Because it’s my computer and it’s not my fault you chose to put it off till the last minute” and my parents overheard and started telling me to give the laptop to her and I responded no. Then they got mad at me and grounded me from electronics for 3 days. Stuff like this happens weekly",

      "description": "So we’ve been best friends since middle school, and it wasn’t until University that we started to drift apart. We were still good friends, but because of our conflicting and busy schedules we wouldn’t talk as much. In my opinion, this was due to lack of effort on both parts, but whenever we’d see each other it would be like old times. \n\nLong story short, she starts seeing a guy and gets pregnant and I hear all of this from a mutual. She didn’t tell me herself that she was pregnant until 6 months in. And it was only because she had accidentally ran into my mom the day before telling me. When I first heard from our mutual friend I didn’t confront her because she was actively keeping it a secret (even moved out of town) and I didn’t want her to feel embarrassed or anything. So I waited until she was ready.\n\nAfter being told I dove straight into pulling together family and friends to organize her baby shower. She has a habit of talking to me only when it’s convenient for her. few days ago she randomly sends me pregnant pictures obviously looking for some sort of happy reaction from me and I didn’t even know what to say. I realized that it’s more than not being happy for her... I just don’t care. I just feel some sort of moral obligation to help. ",

      "description": "The first time I ever met this guy, the second he walked through the door he mentioned a quilt I had folded over my couch in the front room was ugly. \"Wow, that's an ugly blanket!\" I wrote it off as maybe he was just socially awkward and was looking for something to say and that's what came out of his mouth cause he was nervous(He was early 20's at the time). The quilt was a gift, made from my deceased Grandmother, who loved to sew/knit/quilt in her spare time. I didn't press the issue and just let it roll off, my roommate mentioned it was something my Grandmother made, and there was no apology; I later mentioned to my roommate that it was pretty rude of him to say after he had left. \n\nAnother instance when he came over he mentioned again about the ugliness of the blanket, I bit my tongue and just rolled my eyes. There were a few more people this time and he brought his hookah pipe. I didn't partake in any cause I don't smoke tobacco, but he went to the kitchen to get it all setup. The kitchen is kind of my space with my roommate situation. I do all the grocery/cooking so I always maintain the kitchen and it's cleanliness. After they had left, there was a huge mess of tobacco all over the counters, on the floors, and some smudge marks on the drawers that I had to clean. I brought this up to my roommate again after the fact, and she just kind of shrugged it off (she's very unconfrontational, so I expected the reaction and he doesn't come around very often).\n\nA few years have gone by, and he's going to be coming over again. It never fails for him to make the rude comment about the blanket, and when he does I'm pretty sure I'm just going to explode and call him a piece of shit. He is not my friend at all, and he's the only friend of my roommate's that I really just can't stand and I've made this known to her whenever he comes up in conversation (rarely). Typically when I reach my tipping point I don't have much of a filter and that's what'll go down if anything is said. WIBTA for calling him out, in front of his &amp; my roommate's friends on the spot? ",

In fact, there are many times I feel like posting here if only just to prove my own sanity. \n\n\nSo, for bg; he’s been working at a cosmetic-type dentist clinic, (it offers teeth whitening, lip implants, etc...as well as normal dental work) decorating &amp; doing some repairs for the owner, who I’ll call Len. \n\n\nHe came home on his lunch break, &amp; started off by telling me, that Len had dropped a strip of tablets out of his pocket, &amp; hadn’t noticed, there was only one left, so (for some reason?!) he brought it home &amp; asked me what they were (I’m a nurse). Sildenafil. \n\n\nI told him they were Viagra, &amp; he started laughing. \n\n\nThen he goes on to start telling me about Len’s plans for the surgery. It’s really massive, &amp; there’s loads of spare rooms, so he plans to rent them out for things like nails, hair, &amp; a yoga studio. Fair enough. \n\n\nThen he starts chatting about what he started out by calling ‘homeopathic cures’, which then turned into, ‘health &amp; wellness’; going on to clarify that he meant that this was basically *’thinking’* yourself well, &amp; that it could cure cancer 🙄\n\n\nAlso that doctors would only give you ‘pills’ &amp; send you away, which I know from *personal* experience, is not even close to the truth, besides which we have free health care in our country...but that’s a whole different story. \n\n\nHe said Len had said this. I’m not sure if he’d got the wrong end of the stick; surely a *qualified medical professional* should not be spouting this bs? But I never got clarification. \n\n\nI called him on it, &amp; he starting getting really angry, saying it was true. There weren’t enough fucks left in me to give, tbh, so I just said we’d have to agree to disagree, &amp; he walked out. \n\n\nAbout 10 mins later, I noticed the pill packet was still on the coffee table in front of me, he was in the kitchen, so I picked it up, took it in &amp; said, \n\n\n“Here, you should tell Len he doesn’t need these, why would he, if he can just ‘think’ his cock hard?”\n\nHe shot me a spiteful look, &amp; I walked back to the living room to hear him shout, \n\n\n“Are you just a hateful person?”\n\n\n“I guess I must be”, I replied. \n\nI mean, c’mon though, talk about reckless advice!

I knew from the start that that would be a bad idea, so I refused.  \n\nThe other night, however, she tried to debate the topic of racism with me and her viewpoint was really irritating to me. (I won't include what her point of view is, in order to avoid biased responses, but it was quite extreme.) I couldn't help but tell her that I disagreed, and that her opinion was very toxic. She got angry with me, which I accepted, until she threw a personal insult at me (again, I won't get specific, but she mentioned the title of a song I like in an insulting way.) \n\nThis is where I think I may have been an asshole: she sent me an apology message saying that she shouldn't have said what she did...which I ignored. \n\nThe next day she calls my sister and tells her we got into an argument and that I blocked her number (I didn't.) She also tells my sister that I always respond poorly to arguments, and that she always apologized \"for my benefit\" in past arguments...when we've never actually argued before!? When I text her, telling her she was never blocked, she replied by saying she's \"extremely mad at me\" but doesn't want to give up on our friendship. Utterly pissed off, I say I do not want to talk to her. She says \"do you not want to be friends? Is it so hard to say you don't want to be friends?\" And so I reply:\n\n\"I don't want to be friends lmao and leave my family alone\" \n\nAnd then she replies with the following message: \n\n\"Lol awww poor (my name), she couldn't handle being called out on her shit. Is anyone surprised? Nope. Enjoy your shit life. What a waste of my fucking time. Oh and don't forget to remember why you have those abandonment issues. It's because you're a selfish cunt who constantly cuts people off but has the audacity to expect something different in return. I hope that doctor really helps you. I'll be happy to leave your family alone, they have enough on their hands all thanks to you. Good luck. And goodbye.\"\n\nThis message was out of line but did I have it coming for ending a fairly deep friendship over ONE argument? For the record, I replied with \"lmao :)\" to her rant and then blocked her, but I have to see this girl at work Friday so would like some guidance on this situation. ",

My mom forces me to pray and go to the mosque but I do not want to, yet I don’t have a say in it.

She also says I must marry a Muslim man when I’m older, and I don’t even like men, I’m a lesbian, although she doesn’t know. She’ll randomly begin to lecture me or when I’m just sitting in the car looking out the window, she screams at me and tells me I need to pray.\n\nThis has taken a toll on my mental health. I have diagnosed depression, I have a therapist, I’ve self harmed (clean for 2 months now) and it’s due to religion. Religion isn’t the only reason but is quite a big part of it. The worst part is, my mom mocks sometimes because of it or says it’s because I’m not religious. I don’t believe “god is the answer” and that if I pray everything will magically be better.\n\nI know that she can force me to practice Islam but she can’t force me to believe anything.\n\nSo that leads me to the question, AITA for despising religion or do I have the right to believe in what I want to believe? \n\n\n",

My SO suffered from a very advanced case of anxiety and depression. At first I was very accommodating and I was able to calm her and help her through her struggles. After the first year she lost her mom in an accident and I was there for her every step of the way. After that event she changed pretty significantly. Her condition escalated to violent outbursts, getting upset over nothing and she even gave me a black eye. 1 year after her moms passing I let her know that she needs help and her depression was now dragging me down. (I am a veteran of OIF and OEF, diagnosed with PTSD and struggling in my own way). I said this cannot continue unless she seeks help. She promised she would, but that never materialized. 6 months later I was getting so depressed that I would avoid her and whenever she came home from work it was causing my heart to race like a flashback... it was unhealthy and unfair. I started seeing a therapist from the VA to talk about all of this as well as my way of coping. I care so deeply about her but I had to walk away for my own health. It was effecting my work, friends, and sanity. I am not an expert on depression and I suffer from it as well, but I apologize if I offend anyone by not caring enough or giving it my all because I really did...\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "Context: Friends with \"T\" for about 7 years, met \"W\" through T. I've known W about 4 years. Over the past 12-18 months, T &amp; I have slowly drifted apart, W &amp; I are still close friends. I don't believe that T is jealous because she still sees W a lot. Both T &amp; W have very fucked up sense of humour like me. Or so I thought. I'm 30, W is 29, T is 28.\n\nThe past weekend I saw W &amp; told her I missed talking with T, but felt it could be weird just randomly messaging asking how she is. I know it probably wouldn't be but I'd convinced myself it would.\n\nYesterday I saw a picture of that Momo thing on Facebook. I didn't even know what it was, I just saw something that looked to me, very Tim Burton-ish.\n\nI created a group chat with both T &amp; W, saying that it reminded me of a Tim Burton version of T. (Both T &amp; W LOVE Tim Burton.)\n\nT replied saying it was the rudest thing anyone had ever said to her, told W &amp; I to keep our bitchy chats to ourselves &amp; insinuated I was a bully before leaving the chat.\n\nI immediately messaged T, told her I was sincerely sorry, I didn't mean to insinuate or imply anything, but I didn't know what she meant by \"bitchy chats\" as this was the first time I'd mentioned it.\n\nT messaged back to say that she can't believe I thought it was an appropriate way to start a conversation &amp; that she thinks it's shady that W &amp; I went out on the weekend &amp; now she gets that message. \n\nI replied saying that I'm sorry but it's the truth, that I'd been talking with W about trying to strike up a friendship with T again &amp; was trying to do so by making a joke. I apologised again for the bad judgment, &amp; assured her that W had nothing to do with it. That was 24 hours ago, I've not heard from her since.\n\nWhile that was going on, W was sharing with me what was happening between her &amp; T.\n\nInitially T was ignoring W &amp; then told W that it was too much of a coincidence that she &amp; I were out on the weekend, &amp; that W didn't defend her. (W was at work and hadn't seen it yet).\n\nI apologised to W for getting her in the middle of this, to which she said \"Couldn't have meant that much to her for her to write me off so quickly.\"\n\nThat was about 24 hrs ago, neither of us have heard from T since.\n\nI genuinely thought that T had the kind of humour that would have found that funny - I obviously never would have said it to her if I thought this would have upset her. I've seen her mock herself many times.\n\nAm I the the asshole?\n\nTLDR - Playfully mocked a friend who got very offended, thought me and another friend were bitching about her behind her back, won't about accept apology or talk to us.",

      "description": "A little bit of background:\n\nI was raised in a Christian church in California. My church in particular had the stance of \"Being LGBT+ is okay  as long as you don't do anything about it\". Personally, I was never sold on Christian values as a kid, and that's continued throughout my adolescence. Good for you if you believe in it; it's just never been my sort of religion. My mom, while insistent on us going to church every week and occasionally praying at the dinner table, was never extreme about her views with the exception of this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story:\n\nWhen I was in middle school (around 12-13?), I dated a girl. Well, it was as much of a relationship as middle schoolers could really have, especially ones with strict homophobic Asian parents. We constantly lived in fear of our parents finding out what was happening. My mom constantly random checked my phone and messages, so we had to delete screenshots and conversations while using alternate apps that were disguised in the game folders. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite all of this caution, one random check led to everything spilling. My mom found out, I got grounded, and then everything spiraled out of control. My mom threatened to move my schools, forced me to get a therapist, and at one point kicked me out. She told our family as well. Since then, our relationship has improved, but I'm still wary around her. In fact, when we went to Disney Sea just last summer, she refused to buy me a shirt with Donald Duck on it only because it had a rainbow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this Christmas where I am now 15. She gave me these leggings with rainbow letters. Considering how big of a deal the rainbow was on that shirt, this seemed really abrupt to me. I asked her if it meant what I thought it meant, and she said yes, and that she loved me. The thing is, I really doubted that she would change her mind this fast, because it's been multiple years and suddenly she accepts this part of me she condemned before?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething I didn't mention was that during this time, she had been dating this guy that she met on Christian Mingle. We're not very friendly and hardly talk, but I do know that he is supportive of LGBT+ people because someone on his side is gay. I also know that he knows I am bisexual. I feel like she gave me those leggings due to her pleasing her boyfriend, and not considering me. She doesn't like to bring it up even now, and is uncomfortable with the topic if I talk about female celebrities that I find attractive. Since we don't talk about it, and I know her Christian friends aren't very supportive of LGBT+ people either, AITA for thinking that she just \"accepted\" me to pander to her boyfriend?",

      "description": "So tonight I was doing a load of laundry (it was towels if you must know). In the laundry room on my floor, there are two washing machines and two dryers. I live in an apartment building, with two washing machines and two dryers on my floor.\n\nA wash takes 30 minutes, and a dry takes 45, for a total runtime of 1hour, 15 minutes for the whole shebang. In addition, the laundry room closes every night at 10pm.\n\nI started my wash at around 8pm, and I noticed that both of the dryers had their doors closed, which meant that they were in use, but they weren't on, so whoever those clothes belonged to hadn't picked them up yet.\n\n30 minutes later, around 8:30, I returned to switch my wash to the dryer. I opened both dryer doors and found they were both still occupied. It's alright, this happens, I forget my laundry too sometimes.\n\nSo I went back to my apartment and waited another 20 minutes (I set a timer with Alexa). When I went back, the clothes still hadn't been removed! I opened both of the dryers and while one had sensitive garments and shirts and whatnot in it, the other was mostly towels. Knowing which one I would prefer not to get wrinkled, I removed the towels and put them on a table in the laundry room, then put my own towels in for a drying. It was now about 8:45pm and I was against the clock for getting my laundry done before the room closed. If I wasn't against the clock like this, I would have had no problem whatsoever waiting for the person to finish their wash.\n\nI should also point out that the laundry I removed was ICE-COLD, indicating to me at least, that it had been there for some time. It was also still a little wet, because this person had overloaded the machine. (Again, something I've done before but learned my lesson from it.)\n\nWhen I went to retrieve my towels, I found a note that told me off for being a jerk. (I won't reprint it here because this is long enough.)\n\nGuys, I feel like I did everything right, and considering the time constraints placed on me by the room being closed, I couldn't just wait for these people to do another drying as I then would have been out of luck for my laundry. Also, they left their stuff in the dryers for at least an hour doing absolutely nothing about it. I also didn't want to go knocking door-to-door as I just can't handle that kind of social interaction on a Sunday night.\n\nAITA?",

She then informed me that I'd be getting a raise, I just need to sign the paperwork. \n\nThe paper she gave me said that my new rate of pay would be $11.30. I was so happy because I am currently being paid $10.50. Eighty cents is a good raise. However I then noticed that she had made a mistake and put that I am currently being paid $11.

There's no question that she goes above and beyond, which is appreciated and acknowledged. She has a habit however of stepping off break to do small tasks, which range from sending a load of dishes through the wash to hopping on the espresso machine to make 2 or 3 drinks real quick.   \n\n\nEven more than that, she often is at the cafe during her off hours (not uncommon among all the employees, we have a strong community here) where she will hang out in the back room and busy herself with tasks like doing dishes, refilling coffee bean containers, cleaning coffee urns, etc etc. Even going as far as to hop behind the bar with me while my other coworker was on break.  \n\n\nI understand this is all well-intentioned, but it makes me extremely uncomfortable and I often get upset with her about it. We have a coworker who is happy to volunteer to stay late which i am totally cool with because she is volunteering to stay on the clock. But that's different. I've told her to stop doing this, and she's given me excuses like she works when she is stressed to take her mind off, or that in her past she had a huge problem with taking responsibility and she aims to correct that in her life now. I've talked with one of our coworkers about this and he said it comes off to him as passive aggression (\"you should be working as hard as I am and I'm not even supposed to be!) but to me it comes off as this weird unbalanced power dynamic and servitude that makes me extremely uncomfortable.  \n\n\nIt may or may not be relevant, but both she and I are the equivalent of a \"shift leader.\" More authority than the other baristas, but not the manager.",

My mother has asked me to meet her halfway to take her cat the rest of the way because she's scared to drive that far of a distance in her car.\n\nI'm fine with doing that, but I'm concerned because it's possible that the appointment for her cat might overlap with my boyfriend's father's hernia surgery. I already agreed to be there a week ago before the cat got sick, but now I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. \n\nOn the one hand, my boyfriend AND his mother will be there with his father. On the other hand, my boyfriend has already helped with my mother's vet bills and transportation to other hospitals, and I feel like being there for him through this is the LEAST I can do.\n\nI really need an outside opinion on how to handle this.

I did feel a bit bad and told them I would be up for studying the material they missed and offering clarification if they didn't understand a concept or two, given it was just studying. I clearly told them I couldn't teach them what they missed.\n\nwell, they don't prioritize school and decide to not even look at what we are learning during the time they were gone and they expect me to essentially teach them. I understand having to go and do research to further our academic careers and to keep our resumes looking good and feel, again, a bit bad for them. when I asked them about their trip all they said was it was fun and really liked where they went but, later on they let it slip that being \"out in the sun all day, building, wasn't as fun\" now I know for a fact this was not a research trip and was most likely a mission trip of sorts. this is a rather big deal because they know I am atheist and I wouldn't empathize (understand) their situation. \n\n bells start going off in in my head because looking back I think our professor would have been a bit more lenient given it was research. anyway,  because I realized they lied to me and specifically told me it was a research trip and not church related (then I really would have said you are on your own), I shut down all possibility of communication because I know they want me to teach them stuff they could have at least looked at. I feel terrible because I feel like a shitty friend and I know they won't understand much but also feel like they were definitely just going to use me. \n\nso, aita for refusing to tutor my  classmate? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

As soon as she comes home she logs on saying she has homework to do, but when I usually check in it looks like my daughter is playing a game and typing in chat.

      "description": "Ok, apologies if this gets a bit rambly. \n\nI (25M) met this girl (22F) through mutual friends when we were all on a night out together. Spent a lot of time chatting to her that night, she was also being quite flirty I thought and asked me to dance and I thought I had a chance with her. At this point my pal told me she had a boyfriend so I dropped it. After I left, she messaged me asking me if I'd like to walk her home, but I said I'd already left.\n\nFast forward a few months and we've become reasonably good friends, chatting semi regularly and seeing each other in group situations. After our initial flirtation, I hadn't thought about her like that and just viewed her as a pal. My pal though kept saying how much she thought me and her would be good together, so much more so than her and her boyfriend, which I just laughed off. \n\nWe were all our again one night as a group and me and this girl ended up spending most of the night just chatting to one another, and she also brought up how she'd been told we'd be good together by others. Again i laughed it off but also felt kinda odd that she'd brought. \n\nA few months passed and the more we chatted, I began to realise I was developing feelings for her, which I felt super guilty about. I began to feel like she was also being a bit odd. She was keen to organise a movie night, just us two, would message me when she was out saying she needed to tell me stuff but then never say what when I asked her the next day, stuff like that. \n\nIt all came a head a couple weeks ago. We were at a party and I was very drunk. We were chatting and she again said how people always said we'd be good together. Again I laughed, but I think she noticed I was kinda awkward so asked what was up. As I was drunk, I just came out with it and said I had a crush on her, but knew she had a boyfriend so wasn't ever going to try anything. \n\nShe said she felt the same way and had feelings for me too, but nothing could happen. We chatted about it for a bit (how long had this been the case, what caused it etc) before she excised herself, saying she'd come back to say bye but never did. \n\nShe messaged me the next day as if nothing had happened, and I tried to go along with it, but eventually caved and asked if we could chat about it. Initially she said yes but then said she'd rather not as she felt it'd be inappropriate. She said although she liked me, she loved her boyfriend, and if it had been any other time she would have been keen to try something. I accepted that, apologised for bringing it up in the first place, and we haven't really spoken since. \n\nIt was never my intention or expectation to break up her and her boyfriend, but I just felt I had to get it off my chest as I felt I was kinda lying to her otherwise. So, am I the asshole, or is this just a bit of a shite situation? \n\nTL:DR - developed a crush on a girl with a boyfriend. Told her, she said she liked me back, but had a boyfriend so nothing could happen. No longer speaking. ",

      "description": "Long time listener, first time poster.\n\n(tl;dr, AITA for uninviting a friend from my wedding for consistently telling me, and others, that my marriage is a huge mistake)\n\nLet's start with the good news -- I'm getting married next year! I'm thrilled, my fiancé (28M) is thrilled, we're stupidly in love -- all that good stuff. We're planning a large wedding in the city we both live in.\n\nNow, for the hard part. Between sending out the \"save the dates\" and invitations proper, my friend \"Anne\" made it very, very clear that she thinks my impending marriage is a huge mistake. \n\nMy fiancé and I got engaged very quickly (after &lt; 4 months) -- which I get would give people pause -- but almost everyone who knows us (including our families) has basically gone: \"yep, you two are perfect. We support you.\" Except Anne.\n\nI've recently learned that Anne has repeatedly gossiped within our friend group about how we're \"never going to make it\", &amp; how we're total idiots for getting engaged so soon. Things came to a head a few weeks ago when Anne got very drunk at a party and loudly announced, right in front of me, that I'm \"irresponsible\" and make \"impulsive decisions,\" and that my marriage was stupid and irresponsible. She apologized the next day, blaming her drunkenness, and said that she \"didn't mean\" it, but the damage was done. (Complicating things is that Anne is very close friends with an ex of mine, also in our social circle, whom I went no contact with after he behaved horribly to me when I started dating my now-fiancé. I strongly suspect that my ex is spinning narratives about how this wedding is a huge mistake, or a sign of my emotional immaturity, and that she's bought into that narrative. Anne's closeness with my ex has hurt me for a while -- she's blown off multiple plans with me while hanging with him (platonically) regularly -- but I'd still tried to make the friendship work: inviting her to my engagement party (she attended) and sending her and her bf save-the dates.\n\nBut now, the idea of Anne attending my wedding makes me feel sick. I want to spend our wedding surrounded by people who love and support us, not stressing about people who've made it clear they're aching to see us fail.\n\nBut -- etiquette says that once you send out STDs (or invite someone to the engagement party), it's impossibly rude to uninvite them. Would I BTA if I did so? And, if I decided to uninvite them, should I tell her directly that I no longer wish her to come, or just quietly leave her off the final invitation list. (Or should I ask my MOH, who knows her, to be an intermediary here?) I don't want to be rude -- or to get a reputation in my wider friend group as a Bridezilla. I'm not too concerned about salvaging a close friendship with this girl but I also don't want to, like, create a giant dramatic social battle within our extended friend circle. ",

      "description": "I used to work in this company that involves going around the country when cargo is damaged or missing to do a report for my clients to claim from insurance. Company was small, 10 people in it, director was an Uncle-in-Law, let’s call him John. My department had me and my manager, let’s call him Larry. \n\nNow this is my first job and I was stupid enough to stay there for 2.5 years. Job schedule is very unstable as clients can receive damaged/missing goods any time, so it was pretty much a 24hours job. I was told at the start that it would be this way and still be required to be at the office from 9am-6pm even when there isn’t any job outside of the office. \n\nMy manager Larry was very passionate in teaching me at the start and left me alone to do jobs when he felt comfortable as every manager would do. However, about 1-2 months into the job, I started noticing that all the jobs were mostly taken by me and my manager pretty much doesn’t do much. He will take the jobs that are easy and ended at 2-3pm and go home afterwards or would pass the job to me and tell the admin that he was going with me but went home instead. The ones that landed on the weekends and lasted at night were all done by me. As this was my first job, I thought it was ok, I’m just in a junior role and I should just do my job properly without complaining. So I did this for 2.5 years, jobs that started at 10pm and ended at 7am, jobs that extended for 2 weeks including weekends where I work 7am to 7pm daily. I did it all. \n\nThe worse part is, I wasn’t entitled to any overtime pay or any off days or compensation. I asked my manager and he said the company never did give compensation. I asked John and was basically brushed off with, “oh you were unlucky that the job started at this time at night or burned through your weekend.” So I didn’t pursue further but felt it was weird.\n\nFast forward to this year Feb, Chinese New Year was around the corner, yes I am Chinese, CNY is like thanksgiving for us. There was a job that lasted a week and required me to burn through CNY working 10-12 hours a day. This job required at least 4 people to do it but my manager only managed to get 3 as the company was not able to afford for the rest. So I quit, without serving my 1 months notice. I was scolded by my Uncle-in-law and he blamed me for making him lose money for that job. Was it wrong for me to do so?\n\nOn a side note, there was a falling out with my Uncle-in-Law. He has not turned up for any of the family gatherings and my sister is getting married next month, but he has turned down the invitation.",

      "description": "So, some backstory. I have some pretty s*itty grades and being in highschool (junior) that means my mom gets to punish me. So she limits my computer time, the one that I built and payed for, but whatever. Nothing out of the usual for us as we butt heads ALOT. \n\nSo this all starts out as a normal day you know, me getting out of bed at 7:25 when the bus comes at 7:30 and go to school. When i get home I remember to unload the dishwasher (my mom had asked me to last night) and do it before my mom gets home. She says nothing so I assume its all good, nothing gone wrong. Come 6:30 and its my designated time to go on my computer and I do. I get in discord and start up Rainbow Six Siege (for those not familiar a 5v5 fps) and start a ranked match (competitive mode where if you leave you get penalized) when my mom comes in and says “you’re not supposed to be on your computer”\nMe: Why?\nMom: You didnt do the dishwasher and I had to get you up this morning\nMe: The dishwasher is done and you think you had to get me up but I was already awake\nMom: Well that doesnt matter get off\nMe: Well i just started something and it might take up to 45 minutes\nMom: Just leave!\n(Note, from this point on she is yelling and I am being calm as to not escalate the frick out of this)\nMe: I cant i’ll get banned. Can you just let me finish? Please?\nMom (as if i had just murdered my sister and brother infront of her): You’re gonna f*cking regret you just said that.\nShe leaves and I continue finishing up, at this point I dont want to play anymore, shed ruined the mood.\n(Halfway into the match 2-3) \nMom seeing i just finished a round: Did you just start another one?!?!\nMe: No, its a round based system not one round equals win/loss\nShe walks away\nI finish up the game (3-5) in like 25 minutes not nearly as long as i thought it would have taken so I walk into the kitchen (where my mom is) and grab something to eat and pet my dog. As soon as I walk out of the kitchen I hear her say “Get the f*ck back in here” and I do cause i’m scared at this point\nMom: For every 5 minutes you played on your computer you get one day off of it and you can only use your phone during the time limits for your computer.\nMe: grunts trying not to show emotion\nMom: How lit is that?\nMe: Thats pretty lit to be honest (cause im a smart*ss)\nMom: OH I SEE WHAT THIS IS TO YOU! ITS ALL JUST A GAME AND YOU’RE TRYING TO GET POWER!! WELL NO IM THE ONE WHO WHERES THE PANTS IN THIS HOUSE!!\nMe: not really phased but i just raise my eyebrows and cross my arms\nAnd now shes fucking PISSED so my dad being a f*cking G tells me to come with him and he just calmly talks to me about what I did and blah blah blah “what can i do as a parent” and we actually come to a conclusion, just like this story.",

      "description": "Hello everyone, I created a new account so that this wouldn't be associated with my regular one.\n\nThree months ago I discovered that my husband was emotionally cheating on me and had plans to meet with her. She messaged me every bit of contact they had ever had when she discovered he was married and made a Facebook post that was viewed by many people in their industry. He did not lose his job, but he's not socially accepted in most circles right now. My sister is tech savvy and gained us access to all of his accounts before these confrontations happened, so I'm reasonably sure that this was the first time he had attempted to step outside of our marriage.\n\nWe've been married since we were twenty-two, I was his first. He was not mine. I had one boyfriend before him. He said this was the reason why he had wanted to have sex with another woman, because he did not have the experience like I did. \n\nAfter a lot of arguing and crying, I decided to forgive him. Please do not tell me to divorce him because he cheated, I chose to stay. I love him, but please judge the rest of this situation.\n\nOne stipulation of my forgiveness was that he had to admit what he had done to our families, including our wonderful son. We sat David down and my husband told him what happened and why we were fighting the previous few weeks, and David nodded, said thanks for telling him, then turned to me and told me he supports and loves me, but his father is dead to him. And he has stuck to his word. At family dinners he basically pretended his father didn't exist and only talked with me. \n\nThis went on for nearly a month before my husband told us that he will not allow a person into his own home that treats him with such disrespect, that it is no one's place to judge him (except for me). David asked me if I was going to accept that, and I said yes, because it's our home and I have chosen to forgive his father. So David walked out and is not allowed back home until he's willing to be respectful to his father, but I do meet him for lunch at least once a week without my husband knowing.\n\nBut I miss him. I miss sitting at home with my only son and talking about all the fantastic things going on in his life. Sneaking around to see him doesn't sit right with me, but my husband has a right to feel comfortable in his own home.\n\nSo AITA for siding with my husband and agreeing to bar our son from our house?

      "description": "Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about four months and live together, quick I know. A few weeks ago I suggested me and my boyfriend go out to Denny's for Valentine's day because he loves their burgers and I want to treat him to something special. Now my boyfriend is one of those type of people who don't really celebrate holidays he'll literally say \"It's just another day.\" But he says if I want to celebrate Valentine's with him he'd happily do it if it makes me happy. Now I assumed we would be spending it together ALONE, with E A C H  O T H E  R. Now sidenote if you've read my post history my boyfriend has had his friend over bumming off us for over a month at this point. I've spoken to him about and we talked about it as people suggested, his friend will be leaving very soon. Today i asked my boyfriend if we were going to be able to spend Valentine's alone with each other seeing that it's three days away his friend is still here. He says \"If you mean alone at Denny's then yeah, is that enough for you?\"  I was filled with both sadness, rejection, and anger towards my boyfriend and his friend. I'm upset and honestly want to cry right now because we haven't had alone time with each other (not even sex just time to be intimate with one another without anyone else) in over a month. He just said \"Is that okay for you.\" I tell him sure in a fake kind of nonchalant tone, he goes on \"Besides it's just another day I'll be at work til 4 anyways.\" But I don't see how him working til 4 automatically means we can't spend the rest of the day alone. I'm just so sad and ready to tell him forget it i don't want to go out and spend Valentine's day together if we won't be alone in the house to do so",

      "description": "My fiancee and I have been together for 3 years but we have known eachother for almost a decade. We've been doing well but this last year has been rough for us. \n\nAt the beginning of last year she lost her mother. It was sudden and hit her really hard. Since she already suffers from depression this made it a lot worse. I encouraged her to seek counseling but after months she refused. She tried BetterHelp for about a month but felt it was worthless. \n\nThe last few months have been even more difficult. I was unemployed for a month making finances tight. I now have a well paying job and started college to try to better my future. But my fiancee? She still has her job that she hates but refuses to apply for other jobs. She doesn't want to go back to school because the associates she got feel like a waste to her. \n\nBut to get to the core of it. She never does anything. I cook, clean, do laundry, take out he trash, feet the pets and clean up after them. It was ok when I was just working but now my time is going to be tight and wont be able to do all of that. Shes told me she feels herself sinking but refuses to go talk to a doctor because she doesnt want to go through all the hassle. But I dont want to he with someone who doesnt actively try to make their situation better. Not only all of this but our bedroom is pretty much dead. Shes too tired after working to want to do anything. \n\nI understand all of her situations but I'm tryin to better my life but I can't help feel like she doesnt want that. What ever she wants (which in conversation is always answered with \"I dont know\" over and over) I cant give to her and I dont want to be stuck in a sexless, apathy ridden relationship while I'm trying to better myself. \n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to end things?",

      "description": "**Long post ahead. (tl;dr below)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I've been with this girl for around 3.5 years now. She and I are both each other's firsts. The first couple of years were great. I felt like she was a little clingy at the start, but I realized that it was just my not ever having another human being in my life before and being selfish with my time. I always obliged to her requests to hang out every day of the week (we were both in university at the time), but I did feel like it was emotionally draining. We get along great and she is on the same wavelength as me in terms of humor and some issues, but we are both pretty reasonable adults that understand that we don't have to agree on everything in the world and that's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problems started about a year into the relationship, when I realized she was not the most optimistic of people. I myself am a very (overly) optimistic person who always hopes for the best even if it is a long shot. I figure, why worry about horrible things now when you have all the time in the world later if it comes true? Sadly, she does not hold the same worldview and is constantly thinking about worst case scenarios and how she is not good enough and will never amount to anything. She also doesn't really know what to do with her life and constantly thinks lesser of herself for it. One thing that really shocked me was the flippant way she used phrases like \"I want to die\" when small things didn't go as planned or she didn't get good grades and such. I didn't understand it when I first encountered it, and dealt with it pretty horribly (*\"why don't you just think about happier things instead if thinking about stuff like this gets you so down?\"*). I got better at consoling her but I still never really understood her line of thinking.\n\nI only *recently* understood it when she was trying to explain it to me and I realized that little things that were not going correctly would *severely* stress her out. Also social situations with new people or people she's not entirely comfortable with. I realized that it is probably something that she is not in control of and so I am trying to be as supportive as I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, when we first started dating, we would get physical and stuff, but after a year and a half into the relationship, we went overseas on exchange and didn't see each other for months at a time. This was when we stopped the physicality and it just never started up again. I tried initiating it a few times to no avail but it got harder and harder (pun not intended) to so I stopped entirely, thinking that maybe she was just not in a good place for it right now. At around this same time, she started talking to me (on text) less and less as well, which contributed to increased awkwardness and less opportunities for physicality. We still talked everyday, but at its worst, she would text a \"*Good morning\"* and I would regale her with stuff happening during the day, but she would only reply at night stuff like \"*I'm so tired today, let's sleep. Goodnight!*\". Naturally I felt the distance and it was disheartening to say the least.\n\nIn addition, I am personally a very physical person and I love hugs and stuff like that, but this also dwindled, which made me kinda sad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe final thing is that she started to not tell me everything about her life. By this time we had graduated and so began the job searches. I expected her to tell me about companies she was looking at, maybe ask me for advice or something, but nothing at all. I did ask her about it but she would give vague answers and no names of the companies she was applying to. I would find out about the actual companies and the results only sometimes when we were out together with mutual friends and when people asked her about her job search. This really hurt as I felt like she couldn't tell me everything anymore. I talked to her about it and she did say that she didn't like announcing stuff like this because of the possibility that she doesn't get what she applied for which would lead to telling people she got rejected. I totally understand that, but I sort of assumed that I wasn't just *anyone*. She does have a best friend with whom she talks often about stuff like this though, which kinda hurt a bit, as I felt like I was less than a best friend now. Coupled with the distance and sparsity of interactions, I feel like I'm just a friend now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently sat her down to talk to her about it, and I had planned to break up with her, but she started tearing up when I was building up to it and talking to her about these problems. I didn't think she cared enough to cry, so that really surprised me and I told her that I'm willing to try again, but things need to change. This was around 6 months ago. Things have gotten better as we are talking more and going out more, but I still feel like just a friend at this point as she can't talk to me about everything and the lack of physicality (sexual and otherwise).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(tl;dr)\n\nSo, in summary,\n\n1. She feels distant as she doesn't tell me about her days unless I ask and she doesn't feel comfortable talking to me about everything\n2. There is very little nonsexual physicality even though I am a very physical person, and no sexual physicality.\n3. Her pessimism (which I totally understand and I don't fault her but I feel like it's changing me into a less optimistic person :/ )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AITA** for wanting to break up with her for these reasons, and should I do it sooner rather than later? :/",

      "description": "For context, this just happened over Christmas - I live alone with a dog and two cats, a short walk from my parent's house.  My parent's house is very large, so they were hosting Christmas for our extended family.  I agreed to help my parents out by spending Christmas Eve and Christmas Day cooking sides and desserts for both dinners and then showing up with food to join the family later in the day. \n\nOn Christmas morning, I am running around in my kitchen in some pajamas, trying to cook several things at once, and I hear a knock on my door.  It's some extended family, including my baby cousin (a toddler.)  I was pretty taken aback, as I was a) not in a state to receive guests and b) in the middle of several things.  \n\nThey came in when I opened the door, and immediately several of them were launching questions at me at once.  The kid wanted to see the pets (who ran and hid) and what was I making and where is some furniture they recalled from last time and how is everything going and what am I watching and where did I get these recipes and when are we even eating again anyway?!  I was doing some concentration-heavy tasks at the time (trying a complex baking recipe for the first time,) so I was trying to keep up with the timing of that while also trying to answer their questions.  I got very flustered.  \n\nEventually I tried hinting they should leave by saying things like 'I wasn't expecting company,' and 'I wish I had known you were coming,' 'I'm sorry, I really have to concentrate on this' and 'my pets are hiding, they get really stressed out by kids and loud voices,' and 'Oh, just a heads up, I need to hop in the shower soon.' (All of which was true.)\n\nEventually my family got very snippy with me, such as snapping at me \"well go and take a shower then!\" and \"Well OUR cats don't hide from baby cousin!\" but fortunately they finally left. \n\nLater I brought it up with my mom, and she implied that I was the weird one for being uncomfortable with unannounced visitors.  My family's frustrated reactions also seem to indicate this.  Personally, I think it's rude to show up unannounced/uninvited anywhere, and would never consider doing that to someone else; so I was pretty taken aback when it happened to me, and maybe didn't handle it well? \n\nTL;DR: Is it cool to drop by someone's house unexpectedly, or rude af?",

      "description": "Myself and a group of 5-6 friends were planning where to go to dinner together that night. We all live in the same building and were meeting at one of our places to decide. The restaurant we decided on was a fairly nice place with a more upscale atmosphere. \n\nOne guy in our group was wearing flip flops, sweatpants, and an oversized t-shirt, and this is what he normally tends to wear on an everyday basis. I asked him if he would change into some nicer clothes (I suggested jeans and close-toed shoes) before we went to dinner, and he seemed kind of offended, as if I were judging him. He decided to just go back to his apartment, and we ended up going to dinner without him. \n\nI’m worried that I made him feel excluded, since he is very accustomed to the more comfortable clothes he normally wears, but I also have a strong belief that people should wear jeans/slacks and appropriate shoes when going out, and everyone else in our group was dressed appropriately. \n\nAm I within my bounds here, or should I have just ignored it and left him be? \n\n",

I work on the bar but do interact with the restaurant customers. \n\nI’ve had a lovely group of ladies in for a birthday and they are sat in the bar having drinks after their meal. Many drinks have been had by the group. 3 men approach the bar and are also chatting to the ladies. I make their drinks and they tell me to put it on the ladies tab. \n\nI ask the women for confirmation to add drinks to the tab and was told no, so I ask the men to pay for the drinks (I had a feeling these guys were trying to pull one over me and score some free beer)\n\nAfter some back and forth I put the drinks through on the tab having been told yes by one of the women. The man then says he’s “from -insert chain name-“ to which I reply rather bluntly “that’s nice”. He then asks by name if my manager is in. I respond by saying he is not but I can get another manager. From his perspective I believe he was trying to stop a scene occurring (I can get v loud without realising). He declines my offer of getting a manger. He then asks that I’m not upset. \n\nShortly after he orders some wine and I ask the usual questions to identify which wine he would like. His response was “whatever the ladies were drinking”. Gee helpful. I happen to remember what wine it was and pass him a bottle. I put it on the tab bc I didn’t want to start that one again. \n\nI’m then informed by my team that he is a company director and they do know the ladies. I stand by my actions of checking before adding drinks to the tab.\n\nThey finish up and he hovers by the bar. I mumble “have a nice night” to show I’m not upset by previous conversation. He asks me to repeat myself so again I say “have a nice night”. He looked annoyed so I attempted to explain that I thought we may have had a misunderstanding and I thought he was trying to pull a fast one. He wasn’t having it. He proceeds to scold me like a child, telling me my “attitude is wrong” and “not to ever do that again”. \n\nI understand from his perspective I was being rude but enough to be chewed out like that?\n\nAm I the asshole for doing my job? Or for being short? I mean I must be if it’s enough for a director to call me out. ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have very different personalities. The thing we both have in common is we're both stubborn and opinionated. The problem is our opinions are VERY different on just about anything. Politics, spirituality, morals, relationships, etc. The issue is I LIKE talking about different opinions but he doesn't. Part of the reason why I liked him so much before we were dating was the fact that he was so different than anyone else I'd known.\n\nOccasionally, I try to bring up my own thoughts and opinions on stuff that I know we'll debate about. I know he hates it and sometimes he'll throw more personal jabs out there which can hurt. I've tried just keeping my mouth shut and sticking to neutral topics but our relationship is just so boring without any deeper discussions. He's fine with the 'how was your day?' 'whats new with (friend)?' type of discussions but I'm not, at least not all the time. \n\nI've considered the idea that maybe we're just not compatible and maybe we'd be better off apart and I've tried talking to him about it but I just get accused of not being patient with him (he has temper issues) and liking to argue about things that don't even matter. We've been together over two years and yes, I feel in that time he has changed incrementally, but it's still no guarantee of the future. I know our end goal is marriage and we've brought it up but I can't marry someone who doesn't interest me and leaves me feeling drained and biting my tongue. \n\nSo am I the asshole for bringing up controversial topics even though he prefers small talk?",

      "description": "So today on my way home from class, there was a middle aged man standing in the middle of the lane. (Btw I'm not on a very popular/busy road).  We made eye contact as I approached him and I slowed waaaay down. He gave me the \"f*ck off\" look, so I politely smiled and went in the oncoming lane to by pass him (which was clear and safe). As I am pulling around him he seemed to be holding packages of some kind and was just standing at the foot of somebody's drive way, but yet, in the middle of the lane? Anyways, rousing him he snapped his head toward my direction like he was possessed and creepily walked backwards in my direction as I'm about to go around him. He is practically running backwards at this point to try to get me to hit him? I don't know, I am so bewildered from this thing. Very odd experience, but I wasn't sure if what I did and how I handled it made me the AH. ",

      "description": "I doubt the responses to this are going to completely change my mind on what I've decided to do, but I'm looking for someone to \"check my work,\" if you will. It's a rather... complicated situation.\n\nAbout two years ago, I started dating my wonderful girlfriend (we'll call her B in this situation). Not terribly long before her and I started dating, my girlfriend's mom stopped dating her boyfriend of ten years (we'll call him A). \"A,\" as I found out later, was someone who lived in the house but didn't contribute much financially, emotionally, or physically. B never had a good relationship with A, until things marginally better after B's mom stopped dating A. This is all important because:\nA little less than one year later, A buys a local business and hires \"B\" to work there. As a manager,\"A\" brings on the woman who was working there for around four years and is practically the face of the business -- we'll call her S. S is extremely charismatic, one of the most interesting, devoted, and (unfortunately) boundary-less people I've ever met in my life. A few weeks after the whole transaction happened, I went to go see where my girlfriend worked, started helping take out trash and other misc. things, and was eventually hired after she had really no reason to -- I am very grateful for the opportunity I was afforded.\n\n\"S,\" during all the time I've known her, successfully completes the divorce process with her ex-husband, a relationship she never wanted in the first place. Because \"S\" has a boundary problem, she became the manager and quickly took on more than she could handle. \"A\" turned into an absentee owner who knew nothing to begin with, and he quickly tasked \"S\" to deal with all the stuff he didn't know how to do -- day to day operations of the business, hiring and firing employees, etc. -- on top of other stuff like depositing his personal checks, coming into the store whenever he felt like it and demanding a meeting with her (there were three people there including me and she couldn't really get free), and generally has to handle all the high level administrivia and most of the low level daily work because he couldn't hire another person. She was expected to do everything without much access to anything (including bank statements to reconcile against), and eventually got burnt out. Oh, and \"S\" got really sick. She doesn't know exactly what she has, but likely something autoimmune. She was very much pushed to her breaking point throughout the year. There was tons of miscommunication, no communication at all, etc.\n\nTL;DR of above information: \"S\" is manager for \"A's\" business, and \"S' is pushed to breaking point for many reasons. Miscommunication was rampant, and made things terrible.\n\"B\" and I became really discouraged throughout the year as we watched her lose a ton of weight, struggle with the day-to-day of the business given the seagull owner, and raise two single boys. Eventually (recently), \"S\" rightfully decided to leave the business. \"B\" commits to leave too, very loyal to \"S,\" and I had decided before I even joined the company that -- given what I had known about the personal and business practices of the owner -- to leave if \"S\" left.\n\"S\" put her two weeks in. \"A\" comes to the business, never talking to \"S\" while \"S\" wasn't there. \"A\" says that \"S\" has 'brainwashed' \"B\" and starts proclaiming \"S\" as a bad manager. There was allegedly some yelling, lots of tears, etc. Because \"B\" &amp; \"A\" have a personal relationship, and because \"B\" feels really strongly about how \"A\" only ever shows the 'business' side with no empathy, \"B\" says she doesn't want a relationship anymore with \"A\" because of how he has treated \"S.\" \"B\" puts in two week notice.\n\nIt's now Thursday morning, I'm opening the store, and \"A\" is going to talk to me as the only one at my location (there's two) that knows about the day-to-day operations of the business. Mentally, I had made a list of things that I didn't like about how he is and what I would need to stay for a while:\n\n* I had no patience for hearing anything even close to \"S\" was a 'bad manager' after what I saw her do for him, how hard she tried, etc. If she was suddenly useless to him, I don't want to work for a person who treats employees that way\n\n* I wanted \"A\" to commit to working in the store a little more rather than just leave, by his own free will, without me asking him to\n\n* I didn't want to hear anything about \"B.\"\n\nWhat actually happened was:\n\n* He said that \"S\" was a bad manager, and that if she didn't train any new employees, she was useless and should just go immediately\n\n* He bashed \"B,\" saying that \"she didn't have a right to her feelings\"\n\nAnd that was enough for me. I told him I was actively looking for another job, and I would try to give my two weeks. I eventually do get another job through a connection I have with my (now old) job, contingent on starting immediately. I submit my resignation.\nFast forward a few days, \"S\" is showing a person from the other store how to do things. The other lady from the other store is becoming overwhelmed and goes to the back to talk to \"A.\" While \"S\" is talking to a customer, \"A\" calls \"S\" a b****. \"S\" walks out, given that \"A\" needs \"S\" more than \"S\" needs \"A.\" \n\nEveryone's now gone.\n\nBefore I even left, I had a feeling I'd be the only one in the position to want to help the business. I was strongly discouraged from staying. \"S\" was on the phone with me one night last week (when this all went down) threatening to fire me if I attempted to stay and help. That got \"S\" off my perfectly good side and on to my more skeptical side. On top of that, I've now got \"B\" mad at \"A,\" and given \"B\" is my girlfriend, she's already stated that if I help \"A\" in any way, she would be (probably rightfully) pissed at me. I still want to help, and I don't want to live in a world where people don't help others -- even if they don't deserve it. \n\nOn Tuesday, I plan on going in for a few hours and helping whatever way I can, in spite of \"S\" and \"B\"s wishes. AITA for going to help them, even though my old manager and girlfriend don't want to?",

      "title": "AITA for kicking my roommate out after they pay rent next month?",
      "description": "It's my apartment since July 2017 and per the lease I signed rent is officially due the 1st, and last day is 4th. If paid after there is a $95 late fee. My landlord says even if I'm on time and someone else is late, he wants all the rent + late fee at once not separate, and since it's solely my apartment I'm solely responsible for rent even if a roommate is late. Cool. When I ask about adding others to the lease, he says \"we'll discuss later\" and it never happens, so I'm the only person on lease\n\nThis new roommate (found on craigslist) has been late since they moved in (September), except for January rent. When they moved in, they had a habit of doing everyone's dishes without asking, which I thought was cool at first. They also bought my cat a big bag of cat food that I didn't ask for. Cool. The first month I reminded them that the last day rent is due on the 4th, they said they'd pay it on the 4th, and I texted back today IS the 4th. They sent the rent a few days later, late fee included. Probably forgetful, no big deal.\n\nNext month, I remind them in advance it's due the 4th at the latest and they're still late. And there's always some excuse about a paycheck issue even though they work for a well known corporate place not a hole in the wall mom n pop store. Then I realized we get paid the same Fridays every 2 weeks, and that they're probably spending what they get paid in the middle of the month so that they have to wait for a friday after the 4th to get paid and send rent. They are always getting packages from Amazon delivered but late on rent. Also noticed the tags on their car expired in September.\n\nIn november they randomly texted me a sob story about how the rent was too much, they can't afford food and that they would be forced to start camming to make ends meet which would give them gender dismorphia, and asked if anything could be done. They have feminine voice and features but said they were transitioning to male prior to moving in, and I don't fully get it but I understand lgbtq people have issues with housing. I felt bad and said I can lower their monthly rent by $100 but that's pretty much it. They said that's perfect. Still late every month. Before they moved in they said the original price was fine and sent me pay stubs that seemed legit, but 2 months after moving in and they'll have to do camming to pay rent???\n\nThe final straw was when they were late for December and said they'd pay the late fee later that month. So I had to pay the $95 late fee out of my own pocket. I wait til after christmas and ask about it. No response. They pay Jan rent on time, no late fee from the previous month included. I text them and they said they would have last month's late fee Friday. Friday the 11th, I text them, no response. The 19th again, no response. I explained the situation to my other roommate and asked if they could text them something random because I wanted to see if they were deliberately ignoring my texts. Sure enough, they responded to the other roommate within hours meaning they are straight up ignoring my texts. \n\nOnce my work schedule calms down, I'm going to find a time we're both home and talk to them aka listen out for when they tiptoe to the kitchen and confront them. They tend to stay in their room all the time, or aren't home or tip toe around the apartment. I don't stalk them about this matter btw.\n\nAfter they pay rent for Feb though, whether they eventually pay me back for the december late fee or not, I'm giving them a 30 day notice and kicking them out. On one hand, shit happens and people experience struggle, and if I was going through financial stuff I would want help and a home. On the other, I feel like I'm being too nice and taken advantage of and don't understand why they're ignoring my texts rather than just say what's up. AITA?",

It was something I don’r even think about it and didn’t believe would be a great surprise but whatever, I thought it was just shocking.\n\nSince then she has started sending me links of studies showing that people who believe in god have less chance of getting Depression, of famous people(Woody Allen, I guess) saying they’d be happier if the believed in God. Which you know, cool but it’s not something I can change.\n\nThis really annoyed me and I went to talk to her, I said it wasn’t something I can change and I don’t see how these articles may help. She got super defensive and started saying how she was just doing this for my own well being, and how being without a god makes a person lost in life and how important it is to believe in a Higher Force.\n\nThis pissed me off so I just said that, unlike her, I’m nlt able to believe in God just bc it benefits me. Suffice to say that we’re still angry with each other.\n\nI don’t know what to feel, in one hand, it was really harsh and cruel for me to say that, on the other hand, I feel really disrespected and the way she approched was just stupid(in my opinion)\n\nam I the asshole?",

I don't know what exactly happened to them because three of them were in the same school and we couldn't find much time to see each other. \n  I had a hard time last year. It was a time when I felt mentally and physically bad. I was seeing doctors all the time. I started taking anti depressant. And I didn't get better. One of these friends knew my condition and probably told the other two but they didn't even text me or call me to say \"We are so sorry.\" \n    Then one of them called me to talk about her love life. And told me that she was not going to talk with other two. Because of some kind of boyfriend thing. I listen to her for a long time and she told me that she wanted to see me. I said that that was cool with me. And we met up. She only talked about herself and when I told her that I was having a tough time couple months ago, she said \"Oh, ok.\" then talked about herself again. \n   That day I decided not to talk to them anymore. But I never told them that I was upset about this. One of them was texting me because she doesn't have any friends anymore but I didn't answer her back. She doesn't know why I don't respond her. She probably thinks  I'm a dick.\n   Sometimes I think maybe the thing that I'm doing is wrong because I never told them about my feelings and they still don't know that. AITA?",

When I was studying I was getting state money, since my father is dead + mother unemployed and I was full-time enrolled in studies (I live in Europe).\n\nMy mum has always been terrible with money, she spends everything she gets and she can't grasp the concept of investment and long-term planning. Now she lives with her soon to be husband, who finances her. He has a son abroad which also helps him financially (but he has his own pension enough for both of them). She can't find a job, since we come from a very small and poor place and she's not willing to relocate to the capital or abroad, as she has never lived in any other place in her life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory: \n\nI came to visit my mother and grandparents and as I'm leaving tomorrow my mother mentioned money. I will leave some money to my grandma since I know that she will use it for stuff they really need, but of course I have to hide it, as my mother is a jealous person and would complain.\n\nNow, she said we have to say in front of her husband that I've bought a lot of stuff to my grandparents, since her husband's son also buys stuff for them. And then she also mentioned how she got money from him (her stepson) and how they all love and respect her and she's so happy bla bla bla.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like she's trying passively-aggressively to make me feel guilty for not giving her any money, but even if I give her I know she'll use it for stupidities such as make-up or clothes, so I don't really know it really pays off to give anything to her. Btw for two years living abroad, she has never visited me and yesterday when I asked her, she said she'll see, but she has no money for that (flights are around 100-150€ for a weekend trip maximum).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA for leaving her only 10-20€ (for gas) and nothing more, as I plan to do?

We respected each other within the house, everything went smoothly. \n\nRecently, one of my friends (let’s call him George) found a girlfriend (Denise). George and Denise instantly hit it off, and after they first met, Denise stayed at our place for around three nights. All good, they really hit it off and they’re getting to know each other, I understand, it’s exciting. \n\nIt’s been 4 months since then however, and Denise consistently stays the evenings, mornings, and nights at our place, at least 5 times a week. \n\nAfter about two months of this, I voiced my concerns that she’s around too much. He got predictably defensive and didn’t understand what the issue was at all, so I decided to begrudgingly drop it. She lives with her parents, so he says staying with her isn’t an option at all, which I find a bit unfair as well. \n\nWell it’s been two more months of this and I’m finally at the end of my rope. She showers here, does laundry here, sleeps here, etc., and I’m ready to demand some form of compensation from her. Granted, she spends all of her time in his room, but I still feel like the rest of us are getting shafted. \n\nAITA for having a problem with this?

      "description": "First sorry for the format I’m on my phone and fairly new to posting on reddit. \n\nAnyways some backstory before beginning I work as a kitchen manager in a small bar that is relaxed workwise but can get very busy very quickly depending on the weather really. My coworker is in her early 30s and drinks atleast a 1L bottle of liquor atleast every other day so....\nShe was feeling very ill this morning (had a straight up double dragon from what she told me) and was very loudly vomiting in the bathroom. She said she was sick from the breakfast she ate but I knew she was just hung over. She said she was too sick to work and would need me to work bar and have someone come in to the kitchen for me. I figured why not said sure if she can find someone, but the only person available was a trainee. I told her he can’t come in since he does not know the systems or menu fully (he’d have to prep for the night while doing multiple orders as he’d be the only kitchen worker) and I know he couldn’t handle it since it was his 3rd week and he was struggling to get the hang of it. My coworker agreed and said you’re right he’s too unexperienced, but proceeded to call the manager and say she was leaving and the trainee would come in and I’d work bar. I loudly (not aggressively just loud enough for manager on the phone to hear me) said “trainee can’t come in he doesn’t know the systems or menu” she immediately started yelling and cussing at me saying to F off and that I was being rude and not sympathetic to her sickness. I’m normally a calm guy but this rubbed me the wrong way as she always plays the victim so I said “I’ll be rude if that’s what you want... the reason you feel so shitty is because you drink a bottle of fireball each night til 2am” she quickly yelled to shut up and soon left after when the manager showed up to take her shift. Both the manager and owner have told her to cut back her drinking (it’s normally at our bar and really cuts our profits, we get half off and her tab is between 100-200$ after that discount). She’s since apologized and we’re decent terms again (I’m still a little salty with her work ethic and drinking). I’ve ran it through my head a few times though so I wanted an unbiased opinion, what do you think reddit AITA?",

      "description": "First time ever posting to Reddit so sorry if I mess up on something. Friend told me I should post here.\n\nOkay so I recently got out of a pretty bad relationship. It didn't last too long, only a couple of months. Before me and this girl got together we were pretty close friends. We always argued, but we had a lot of fun. She and I both had a breakdown one night and agreed that it's best if we broke up. We then both made a promise to the other that we wouldn't get into another relationship, (as we both still really liked each other,) for a long while. We agreed that two months should be long enough.\n\nEverything went fine for about a week. We were still friends, and we still talked pretty consistently. It was almost like nothing ever happened. Then one day, when I'm hanging out with my peers, less than two weeks after our breakup, one asks me if I'm doing okay. I say yeah, and ask why. They reply, \"Because you and (ex) broke up.\" Obviously I say I'm alright, and say that we're both still friends, so I'm alright. Then another person says, \"Wait, I thought (best friend) and (ex) were a couple?\" Things got really quiet really fast. I ask what they mean, and they say that they saw them hugging and holding hands and being 'more-than-friendly' with each other. Obviously I get upset.\n\nI confront her about it, and she doesn't see the problem. She says that the promise made at that time was 'then' and this is 'now'. Essentially she's trying to excuse breaking our promise. We have an argument over that, she ends up crying, and getting her new boyfriend, (my best friend,) to scream at me for being, in his words, an \"insensitive bitch.\" I don't know if I'm the asshole or not. Obviously I don't own her, but a promise is a promise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR; My ex girlfriend and I made a promise to not get with anybody for two months. Two weeks later I find out that she got with my best friend. Her and her new boy toy both think I'm insensitive for being pissed off at her for breaking our promise.",

And this is where he told me that he had past anger management issues, and is taking therapy to control it. \n\nI was so shocked, it felt like he was lying to me all along, I have heard many stories about abusive people like this, and it terrifies me just thinking about being in a relationship with such person. The people who can put up a nice image to have their victim let down the guard. \n\nWhen I get home after that, I texted him and told him to not contact me anymore. He asked what was wrong and I told him about my concerns. He said he is very sorry and hope I can find someone better. I felt kinda sorry for him, but then I don’t know if he was that sincere or was just putting up an act. \n\nI told my friends about this and they said I’m being paranoid and and asshole for not seeing him trying to improve. But I was just concern about my safety. \n\nSo, Am I the Asshole in this?",

      "description": "On mobile so bear with me\n\nI’m 17. My mom has a 2 year old and a 9 month old child with “f”. F is an absolute leech. He has a “job” at a shelter where he comes in roughly once every two weeks (no exaggeration). On days where he goes to work he depends on other people for rides and gets very upset if we’re late. This is bad enough, but when he’s not working, he’s a full time slob. He regularly makes my mom late to work by falling asleep every time my mom wakes him up. I’ve come home multiple times to him passed out with the two year old wreaking havoc, completely unattended. All he does is sit around and watch tv. If the baby doesn’t want to sit, tough tits let him cry for hours. I can’t focus on anything when there’s a screaming child, for both moral and practical reasons, so I just pick him up and watch him whenever he doesn’t feel like it, which is very often. I’m the older of the kids who live at home, have a license and car, and spend almost every day between 2:30 and 5:30 watching him, while f fucks off and kicks dirt outside. After my mom gets home it’s pretty much his time to fuck off, which he does. He completely ignores anything the children  or my mom need and as a result the nights usually spin into chaotic messes if there’s anything out of the ordinary planned. Guess who plays the part of the knight in shining armor who does what any normal human would do and gives my mom a hand. It sucks more when I work (part time but still more than once every two weeks, lol)because if my sister is out (which she usually is) she’s watching 2 kids alone after working a 9-5. This’d be upsetting on its own, but I get no credit for this. My mom comes home and makes me clean up the mess that the 2 year old has created, that f hadn’t even bothered to attempt to counteract. I get he’s watching two kids, but even I can clean up with both of them. I know the babies don’t wake up till around 11 , so I know he hasn’t been up since 7am going to school and actually doing something with his life like me. He’s a deadbeat who puts in minimum effort. My mom knows this too but refuses to leave him. I’ve heard her say the exact words “I am doing to much and you refuse to help.” I want to kick the shit out of him for being so awful to my mom, and making my life hell, but I also don’t want to go to jail for assault. I want to know if my frustration is warranted, and how I should go about dealing with this.",

      "description": "Ok so this is my first ever post so go easy on me.\n\nSo let me set the scene, im at a friends birthday party and we are 7 girls in total ( everyon is under 15) it's about 9 pm and we are playing a game and we end up talking about who is the bravest in the group, so i want to prove that i am brave by going outside in the dark ( while it's raining ). Keep in mind that some of my friends have been talking about how scared they are that someone will come in and kill us. \n\nAnyway so i go outside with another friend let's call her L. And we dance for a bit then go to the corner of the house and i scream so dose L,( this was my idea btw ) so we sneak to the other side of the house and stay ther for about 2 and a half minute and then we run to the door and ring the bell. After that we go back and L's phone has been ringing for some time but my phone is inside the house. So after we have been outside for about 7/8 minutes we go back inside and i see two of my friends crying and breathing heavily in the corner and im shook. Me and L starts apologising and hugging them and saying that we didn't know they thought it was real and that i feel really bad about what i did. They had messaged their parents to come get them. They eventually calm down and we go down stair and play with ballons and stuff. Their parents come and pick them up, My friends say it's fine and that their okay now but i still feel pretty bad about what i did. They ended up going about 15 minutes earlier than they would have otherwise. Me and the birthday kid starts playing with some ballons and she says that it's okay and i should't worry about it.\n\nBut I still feel really guilty about what i did and im wondering if they where overeacting or im an asshole for scaring them, what do you think??\nPs thanks for reading and sorry if i spell any words wrong english isn't my first language.",

      "description": "Okay the title sounds bad but please here me out.\n\nSo, I will refer to my friend as X, as I don’t want to use her real name.\n\nX is a girl I’ve known for many years, she’s a sweet girl, and she does have some mental problems, similar to me, she has depression, however it hasn’t been diagnosed. She claims she has anxiety, which I can see, however many things she does doesn’t qualify for someone with social anxiety. (Something I have)\n\nWhenever she has a problem, she will tell everyone about it, and constantly receive support from it, and sometimes when she doesn’t get that, she throws these massive rants on how about nobody likes her and that she is thinking about death. (I do understand when being ignored by friends absolutely sucks)\n\nSo, overall she does get support from her friends, it’s great, I’ve always been there for her, I’ve been her shoulder to cry on, someone to rant at from any time of the day, etc. I want her to be happy, but I’m tired of sacrificing my own happiness for her, when I get nothing in return (I know I sound entitled, but believe me when friendships are supposed to be a two way street)\n\nSo, earlier today I was with her, and I had already a pretty bad day, and I wasn’t really in the mood to talk. And I was getting more and more upset, I didn’t want to say anything to make her upset so I just followed her, another friend was with us too.\n\nWe went to the shops and I said I was gonna wait outside as I didn’t feel well, she bought her food and as she left, she didn’t bat an eyelid to my direction and kept walking. \n\nI did go back to X and my friend, and the entire time she just ignored me and I just felt really bad. Eventually I wanted to leave and go to my class which was in 10 minutes, and she blanked me and kept talking to the friend with us.\n\nI actually got really upset because I just felt unimportant. Later I was with a councillor and I was leaving my class, I got a message from my friend and he asked if I was okay and he noticed I was sad earlier.\n\nI didn’t get anything from X, which just made me think she just didn’t care. We were supposed to go out later today, but I was still upset and she walked past me as I was visibly upset, glanced at me and walked on with another person.\n\nTLDR: Friend ignores me when I’m upset but expects empathy from me\n\nWould be appreciated if not hurtful comments were posted, I do understand if I am being an asshole, but I wanted to rant a little.\n\n",

Neon said that he had \"told him it was okay for him to say it\", while Deer and another one of our friends said Neon had said something like \"oh come on, say it!

      "description": "I'd like to state that I am asking this on behalf of my girlfriend. I didn't see any rules against that but if there is one, sorry, I can delete it. (Obligatory I'm on mobile and I absolutely suck at writing. I'm more elegant in person, trust me. \n\nWhen I met my girlfriend, who we will call Steph, over ten years ago, she had had a best friend that she was inseparable from, we will call her Alice. She and Alice would talk daily and, living across the street from eachother, practically lived together. A few years later, Alice's family moved to a town about 45-60 minutes away, sometimes longer since we are near a city notorious for traffic. \n\nAfter the move, they seemed to still talk often but neither one of them really wanted to be the one to drive to the other. After a while the talking came less and less but both were still friendly with one another. This never struck me as odd. In the past 10 years we have all become grown adults and this is how I assumed many long distance adult friendships were. \n\nI would like to add here that Steph is the kinda of person who can get along with everyone and can be genuinely loved but is very picky about friends and is sometimes almost entirely without them. She can be introverted like me so she's happier with fewer people around her. She often says to me \"Friendships are back and forth and I'm not going to be friends with someone who won't put effort into the relationship.\" Makes sense to me. \n\nA few years back, my Steph's father passed away and Alice didn't really reach out. For the wake, she just stopped in but didn't really stay. It was mostly me and friends of mine that were there for her. \n\nA few weeks ago, Alice moved again with her boyfriend this time and had a housewarming party. Steph was invited but she decided to not go because she didn't feel they were close anymore. This week they made plans for lunch for today. The planning, as I understand was Alice wanted Steph to drive out by her but when my girlfriend suggested a restaurant by us, Alice complained about the drive so they agreed on a place in the middle. \n\nToday, Steph canceled on the plans last minute and I thought it was rude (which is why I'm here). She said that she just has no interested pursuing the relationship anymore and said to me \"She hasn't been a friend to me in years. And talking to her this week was like pulling teeth, and she didn't seem interested. I still can't forgive her for not being there for me after my dad passed.. you were my rock, I'm so grateful you were there. I would have loved to had a friend by my side, and was absolutely heartbroken when she barely made an appearance.\"\n\nI understand that's hard for her but I was raised in a way that if you make plans you follow through, and canceling last minute can be a low blow. I feel like they have alot to sort out but Steph doesn't seem to want to try anymore. \n\n",

      "description": "Ok. So married for 10 years, we have a 2 year old. We live in a pretty slow part of town. Like, we have a huge backyard and chickens, so you know it's not busy. Lately my husband has been absolutely going off the rails at me over leaving the main back door (in the kitchen) open with the glassed-in screen door closed and locked. I also leave it open during the day when I'm going to the grocery store because it's way easier to wrangle a ton of shopping and toddler if I only have to open the one door. It's open and locked during the day because the kiddo likes to watch the chickens but I don't want her to be able to get outside. It also really annoys him when he comes home from work and I have to unlock the screen door to let him in.\n\n\nToday I got up to do chores and left the door open and locked because it brightens up the kitchen in the morning. I was in the bathroom when he got up and didn't think anything of it but he absolutely went off. Yelling at me in front of our daughter about how \"he swears to God\" if he comes home one more time and the back door is open... And that I must only do it to bother him. I told him he was being silly and he said he didn't want anything to do with me for the rest of the day, even though we had plans.\n\n\nAm I wrong in thinking that's it's not a big deal if it works best for me and kiddo?",

      "description": "Now, I know what some of you may say. \"You are not obliged to go out with someone if you don't want to\". And I know it, that isn't why I'm second-guessing myself. There is more to it. Also, i want to thank you for taking your time to read my case in advance, i appreciate it.\n\nSo, essentially, let's say there's this girl who used to like me before, I had rejected her a few times because overall she just isn't my type. She's pretty and all, but I don't like her personality that much. Now, she once revealed to me she liked me and wanted a relationship a few years ago, but I politely declined. She didn't talk to me for a while but we were still friends, and we ended up talking even more. Fast forward a few years later (now it's February from 2019), and she invited me to go to a sports convention (where you exercise) in a hotel. I was like \"sure\" and went with her. She ended up exercising and I just waited because I arrived a bit late (not on purpose, traffic) so we decided to go to the pool.\n\nNow, here's where the interesting part comes. While at the pool, she all of a sudden torpedoed at me, hugged me and kissed me. I was shocked, but I liked it (I had broken up with my ex a few months back and hadn't kissed a girl until then, at least not sober). It felt nice, but I didn't feel anything emotionally related. I stopped the kiss but she continued. To save you some trouble, let's say we ended up deciding we were gonna woohoo. \n\nBut, the thing is, and I'm not gonna lie and pretend to be the nice guy, but I kinda had the impression she still liked me. Why is this a problem? Because I feel I let my own pleasure potentially send off a misinterpreted sign. Now, I also have to clear up I NEVER hinted as to me liking her, nor that the woohoo was gonna start any relationship. I thought it was clear it was just casual woohoo, but a few days later she texted me asking if I wanted to go out with her.\n\nMe, not knowing she meant an actual date and not wanting to be rude, I said \"sure\". I didn't ti out with her though, a day before our \"date\" I asked her: \"hey, I want to have something clear, is this a romantic date or a friends hangout?\" She said \"it's a date, you idiot\" (we get along with insults). But I didn't want that, so I cancelled the date (politely, obviously). I then said we could still go but as friends only, then she proceeded to insult me and never spoke to me again.\n\nI also have to mention, we \"woohoo-ed\" in a motel, which costs money. I didn't have any so o told her I'd pay her later, so she paid the room. Thing is, I never gave her the money back, because she stopped talking to me.\n\nEssentially, I wanna know if ITA in three things:\n\n1. Woohoo even if I assumed she probably still liked me\n2. Declining the date a day before\n3. Not paying her back (take into consideration, she stopped talking to me and insulted me)\n\nThanks for reading.",

I just figured 'oh he might just be waiting for someone' since he a) wasn't directly behind a car but more to the side and b) at his cellphone. \nAs I was pulling up a gas pump became free so I drove past and pulled into it since he was still at his cellphone and didn't move. That's when he honked at me and I gave him like a shrug.\n\nSo the gas pump next to me became free like a minute later and he pulled up and just ignored me. He passed me when he went into the shop to pay byt he just eyed me and didn't say anything. \n\nSo yea as I said incredibly minor but I still appreciate your opinion :)",

      "description": "I’ll try to keep this short, but I’m pretty good friends with this coworker of two years. \nShe’s a young mother with two kids. \nPretty bad work ethic, calls out constantly because of her kids or mental health. Puts minimal effort in to make up for her truancy.  (Yes sounds harsh, but work ethic isn’t the sole reason why I befriend someone. This is just the cumulation of years of getting kinda tired of enabling her behavior at work.)\n\n\nLet’s just start at MLK day, she asked me to cover her shift for that day. At my work place, “covering a shift” means switching a shift. We get in trouble for overtime. \nI asked her which shift she’d switch with me and her response was “Well... erm... oh yeah I have to switch with you? I’ll ask the manager... and I guess I have *one more day of PTO*.” \n(She obviously just wanted the day off without having to work another day.)\n\n\nSo fast forward to last Tues/Wednesday, she calls off twice because of her kids being sick. I know now she’s in the red with her PTO.\n\nShe says Thursday that she can come in on Saturday to pick up a shift even though we are fully staffed in order to fill her hour deficit. \n\nOn Friday she tells me she “just doesn’t want to come in tomorrow”. She then texts me on Saturday she “can’t get a ride because her husband is sick”. (Bullshit, we live in a large city with uber/public transit)\n\n\nSo today, Monday morning, I can’t sleep, check my phone and see push notifications from her Instagram messaging me at 4am that she “needs a favor, it’s kinda an emergency and that [she] understands if I can’t because it’s last minute.” Full stop no other info.\n\n\nI don’t even open IG and go back to sleep because I’m sure she wants me to cover her shift for some reason. She has been saying her uncle is in hospice for the past week so I was sure that was the reason. I’m convinced I’m not going to do it already because 1) promised my dad I’d help him do some work around the house  (he just had hip replacement and can’t do a lot) and 2) my job is labor intensive and I injured my back on Friday, need to rest it.\n\nI don’t wake up until like 10:30, shift starts at 12. I decide to just wait until 11 to text her back. \n\nI just text her a question mark and she still hasn’t answered, I check her IG story and see her kid in a hospital bed. \n\nFeel like a bit of an ass ignoring her at first  but how would she expect me to wake up at that hour on my day off? \n\nYes 100% I should have just texted her back at 5am and told her I’m not covering for her because I’m not obligated, but it’s really on HER for using up her PTO unnecessarily, and then when shit really hits the fan she doesn’t have any! She also didn’t mention anything about her kid to me, I had to find that out myself. \n\nTL:dr constantly truant coworker texts me to cover her during an “emergency” on my day off, I kinda have the “girl who cried wolf” feeling about it but it turns out her kid is actually in the ER. \n\n\n",

      "description": "So, it all started last summer when I asked out this girl, A, and got rejected: no big deal. However, from there we started texting and meeting up, and became good friends, completely platonically. (all of my friends know this)\n\nThis year I discovered that me and a girl, B, both have feelings for each other, which was cool. A few days ago however, A asked if I wanted to meet up on Thursday (not as a valentine, it's just we were both free that day.)\n\nToday, I mentioned in passing to a \"friend\", C, my plans for Thursday, (Keep in mind that I had had no contact with B, and had definitely not been asked to do anything on valentines by her,) and was told that I was being stupid by C, and that B would be angry. I took it with a pinch of salt, as he is one of B's close friends, and want us to get together, but not before asking him not to tell her, to which he promised. I pretty much ignored it until a few hours later, when mutual friends all begin to chime in, supporting C. I asked C how they knew, and he told me that he had \"accidentally\" told them. (I later discovered that he had immediately pulled B aside and told her upon seeing her, and had gone on to tell others in the group.) Just now however, he sent me a screenshot of a conversation he'd had with B, where she mentioned that she'd be \"fuming\" if she had found out any later, or from someone else. In my opinion, she, and C, had no right to be upset at all, and my meeting A will have no bearing on any interactions that I might have with B in the future, yet judging by my friends reactions, I feel like I'm missing something. So, AITA? ",

      "description": "Joe is my fiancé’s best friend and I’ve considered him a good friend for years. He recently watched our cats while we were out of the country for a week. I agreed to pay him. When we returned home Joe was there so we watched some tv. I got a call from my family so I stepped into a different room to talk to them. Joe and my fiancé Ryan followed me a few minutes later and made it hard to hear my family. I asked Ryan to keep it down and when nothing changed I got visibly annoyed and walked back to the living room. Joe left immediately and I ended the call. Ryan and I sat down close together on the couch, he got a text from Joe and I saw the preview saying “that was kinda bitchy”. \n\nApparently Joe had been trying to speak to me about payment. I thought they were just chatting loudly together, being oblivious to my call. Joe thought I was annoyed that he was asking for payment when I was just annoyed that I couldn’t hear my family. I paid him immediately after hearing this, I wasn’t putting it off just hadn’t considered it an urgent issue.\n\nRyan got really annoyed at me and told me “you need to stop doing this to my friends”. I was really surprised, because I think I’m a very mellow person and I rarely show people I’m annoyed. I asked Ryan if I make a pattern of being rude to our (his?) friends, and after thinking about it he reminded me that I get annoyed when people talk during movies. I do get annoyed and will comment if friends repeatedly interrupt movies we haven’t seen, but I never thought I was rude about it. Ryan told me he doesn’t show annoyance around my friends, but that’s because he isn’t friends with my friends. I thought his friends had become mine too over the years, and that friends were allowed to occasionally show frustration with each other. I see them get in arguments and get past it, why can’t I even show I’m annoyed?\n\nRyan told Joe not to call me bitchy. Later Ryan apologized, saying I don’t make a habit of being rude and that he was just annoyed that this happened. I told him it was a sexist double standard, that when I get annoyed once in a blue moon it’s “bitchy” and I “need to stop” behaving that way, when they can get annoyed and even angry at each other somewhat regularly. That I was only called “bitchy” because I’m apparently expected to always be happy and not cause any trouble. He agreed and apologized for being hypocritical. \n\n**TL;DR:** I got annoyed at my fiance’s best friend, who I also consider a close friend. He misunderstood why I was annoyed and told my fiancé I was “bitchy” instead of just waiting a minute to talk to me and clear it up. I may have been a little rude but now I feel like I’m not allowed to show any annoyance, which to me means I’m not really his friend, I’m just the tag along fiancée. AITA?",

Didn't work) the paint by number that she is trying to get is around 50 dollars, almost as much as i spent on the supplies in the beginning. Also I very much support original art even if it's bad versus something purchased(she knows this)\n\nSo am I just up-tight or wut? \nMoney is tight and I'm afraid it will be wasted on this",

      "title": "AITA for giving a wedding gift 3 months late and not saying anything about it until it was 2 months past the wedding?",
      "description": "Throwaway account because too many of my coworkers know my actual account. Sorry if this is a bit lengthy. TLDR at the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: So I have a friend who is a coworker of mine and we've known each other for about 3 years now. We got along right away and although he is a work friend I consider him to be a friend outside of work too. When we first started working together we had the same role. About a year ago I received a promotion and am now technically his boss. He had been dating his (now wife) for a long time - I think like 9 years or something? - and they got engaged shortly after we met. I was invited to the wedding with a +1 for my SO, and it was super far advanced notice (like 8 months maybe) so I had plenty of time to request days off of work, RSVP to the wedding, and get a gift. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took the time off of work immediately and set a calendar event and multiple reminders in my phone. My first fuck up is when I received the RSVP in the mail I ended up losing it and couldn't find it for like 4 months. I ended up giving the RSVP via text message like 2 months before the wedding after he reached out and asked about it. I felt shitty about that, but figured it wasn't a huge deal. My second fuck up is not asking about registry details. I had no clue where they were registered for a wedding gift, and realistically I was too embarrassed to ask them. Everyone else I know who was going to the wedding was also either a current coworker of mine, or a past coworker of mine, and for some reason I was too embarrassed or ashamed to reach out to any of them for registration details. So I made the worst decision, which is to make no decision at all. I let it go and pushed it off until the weekend of the wedding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe wedding was talked about as if it were going to be a huge event, but when we arrived there it was a relatively small venue and there were probably 40-50 people max. I looked around at the group of coworkers that were there, and realized it was a very small group of us. I assumed there was going to be a huge number of us there, as we work with a  large team (over 100 people), but it was really just a small group who he considered to be his closest of friends. That's when I really started to feel super shitty about the gift thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe wedding was really nice. It was an outdoor wedding. Ceremony was nice, everyone was beautiful, weather was perfect. It was a nice wedding. The reception was outdoors too, under this really big tent thing. There was an open bar, food was decent, and the staff was hilarious (it was a family owned farm and the owners were there and they were both characters). Once everyone got settled into their meals, after the speeches and normal wedding stuff, that's when people started to mingle. I'm pretty socially awkward and my SO doesn't really know anyone so I'm left to be the leader. I didn't interact with my friend or his wife for a while into the wedding, because I didn't want to interrupt their meal or surround them. They were already being bombarded with other family members and I just felt like I would be a bother, so I wanted to wait for a time where I didn't feel as if I was interrupting. We ended up connecting and taking some pictures and chatting for a bit - he seemed really excited to have us both there but was also running around like crazy, as I would expect from a groom at his wedding. My SO and I don't really know his wife very well so we didn't connect with her until later in the evening, but she is very nice and we chatted for a little while. She was mostly on the dance floor all night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe venue had on-site lodging, kind of like a huge cabin with lots of cool loft things and tucked away bunk beds. Every one of my friends/coworkers who attended the wedding - with the exception of 1 person - stayed over at the venue. Realistically I could have stayed, but weddings really stress me out and I've been struggling a bit with my work/life perception outside of my work environment now that I am these peoples boss. I don't want to let any confidential information slip or get into any gossip sessions about coworkers, or make an ass of myself and lose respect in the workplace. So we didn't stay the night and ended up leaving close to 11. We were leaving on the earlier side of most guests, but we lived about an hour away from the venue and didn't want to be driving too late at night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the wedding I was still feeling anxious about the gift and not really knowing what to do. As far as my SO was concerned I had purchased something from the registry and all was good. I was even more ashamed to reach out to someone for information, as the wedding had already passed. I ended up ordering something online for them a few days after the wedding. I really think they will enjoy this gift and it's something I know they will use all the time (it's a kitchen/baking item). Unfortunately the item I purchased was on backorder for 2-3 weeks. Not a huge deal I thought, normally it would have arrived in 1 week so what's a few extra weeks? They'll be on their honeymoon anyways, right? Well the gift continued to be pushed back - last I heard the delivery date was supposed to be end of November but I still have not received a shipping date. I've reached out to the company and we are in communication - I seem to have just ordered at the wrong time. Either way it doesn't help my situation or my anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't talked since the wedding, and although we still work together we are currently in different buildings so I don't see him but we will eventually work in the same building again and I want to resolve any issues before that happens. I sent him a text about a week ago letting him know the situation with the gift, that I was very sorry about the delay, that my SO and I had a wonderful time at the wedding (realistically I should have said that the day after the wedding but I didn't), and that I hope we could hang out soon. He hasn't responded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my reason for writing all this is because I'm worried that I've been a huge asshole and that I've ruined a friendship. I'm also worried about how we will interact at work now if he is upset with me. I don't want a negative perception of me to be spread around the workplace either, and I know he likes to gossip. I've already gotten some negative vibes from this one girl who was at the wedding, but I don't know if it's all in my head or if it's real. I'm torn between whether or not I should text him again, or if I should just wait until the gift gets here before reaching out again. Either way I feel like a bag of dicks about it and I'm wondering if other people were in this situation if they'd have the same feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not getting a gift on time or communicating this better?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; invited to a wedding of a friend/coworker, didn't get a gift until after the wedding, gift still hasn't arrived 3 months after the wedding, hadn't reached out to the groom until 1 week ago and he hasn't texted back.",

      "description": "I couldn't find the right words to put in the title but I hope the title is good enough. Anyways:  \n\n\nMy school has spent all of women's history month honoring it by doing little things and organizing a big assembly for the end of the month. The assembly is about honoring women's history and showing solidarity with the ongoing struggle for women's rights. At this assembly the female students and staff of my school are meant to wear blue as a sort of demonstration (the school didn't really specify what it's for but I have my suspicions at the end of the post they aren't important). When the announcement about the demonstration was made I was expecting it to be an option offered to all students a sort of \"wear blue to show you support women's rights\" type deal, however the announcement was very specific that it was only for the female students. Thinking this probably wasn't what our principal meant to say I head to the main office to ask for clarification and ask \"Are male students also allowed to wear blue tomorrow for the assembly?\" to which my principal grows angry then controls herself, gives me a curt no, and ushers me out of the office. I don't think that's right. I think that one of the keys to effectively solving the issues of women's rights is to include both genders in solving it. Without men being included in protests for women's rights, and actively being excluded I think it just fosters a new kind of sexism. So I plan to wear blue tomorrow (at least initially assuming my principal doesn't try to force me to take it off). WIBTA to do that?  \n\n\nTl;dr : My school is having an assembly where the female students are encouraged to wear blue but the male students aren't allowed to and I think that's the same type of thing the women's rights movement stands against so I plan to wear blue despite the ban WIBTA?  \n\n\nmy suspicions as to why males aren't allowed: Keep in mind these are just suspicions and nothing I say in this bit is in any way fact.   \nMy principal has always been very obsessed with our image as a school since we're seen as the bootleg of a similar school with the same premise as ours. At the assembly tomorrow there are going to be state legislators (I think two but at least one) and I think my principal is using this demonstration to show off something to the effect of \"our girls are progressive and great\". However if there are boys in the picture it doesn't jump out as women standing up for women so I think our principal decided to make it female only.",

      "description": "So just to preface, my mom tends to be kind of a short fuse in general. She tends to kind of explode over rather small things but usually it's just a bit of yelling and door slams. You know, marriage related loudness, I guess. She gets like this especially when she's had a bit of alcohol, and she's quite a lightweight afaik.\n\nFYI I'm 16 as of writing and my sister is 14. We also have a dog.\n\nMy dad's been gone since Monday morning for some kind of work training and he's due back either Thursday night or Friday night. He does system ops for a power company, so they have occasional training weeks that he has to drive hours away for and stay at for the week.\n\nThe first time my dad mentioned this as far as I know she got kind of pissed off about it, mostly about the timing of something I guess. I just kinda went whatever and moved on.\n\nToday though I don't know what the hell set her off. I was in my room working when I basically just started hearing stuff slamming in my parents room. After getting a bit stressed about it I just passed it off as my mom just loudly reorganizing clothes. But then she started getting really vocal and pretty much just screaming because my dad had probably hung up on her for screaming. I guess she got a call through again and is basicaly just screaming at him now that he's a f*ing douchebag or whatever, kill you, I don't even know I was trying not to listen. She was just getting progressively louder and rougher and whatever. I decided that I was just not going to ignore it anymore and got up and left my room.\n\nI think she managed to break something in the dishwasher and some lamps and stuff were knocked over in the living area. Since my parents room is directly adjacent to my room I left cause it was loud as hell, and my sister was in the living area sitting on the couch with our dog. I decided to just take her and our dog to my grandparents house because honestly I hated just putting up with my mom's ranting and screaming when I was her age, and not having to listen to someone with anger management problems screaming over the phone at their husband or just like, nobody at all potentially isn't worth it. We left quickly and headed to.my grandparents and that's where I am now. It's a short drive FYI, only a few minutes \n\nDon't really know if I did the right thing, but I couldn't just stay there with my sister. I was legitimately feeling a bit unsafe there (I don't think I should feel like I might have to like, you know, hit my mom or something because she's losing her shit) so I left. AITA?",

      "description": "I was cleaning the hallway the other day and among the junk was a nondescript notebook. I flipped through it quickly to see who's it was to see what pile it should go into. Two things became evident. 1) It looked like diary notes from infidelity 2) it was my wife's. I was so shocked that I read the whole thing and everything in it was matching our life. Right down to her interactions with our kids. I was shaking and having an immediate crisis. Chose to confront her about it. She says it's fictional, that I'm a bad person for limiting her creative writing and reading her private notes.\n\nI choose to believe her about it being fictional. And we have a stressful life so I get fantasizing about something else. What really hurts is the active choice to write it specifically about being infidelity and in the setting of our family. One portion was about how the affair was not infidelity towards \"the husband\" (me) but kissing the husband would be infidelity towards the lover. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I'm quite frankly disgusted. I've found empty condom wrappers in her pants before (for personal use she says) and gotten home to towels in the bathroom smelling of unknown mens perfume when after having been travelling with the kids when she was home alone. So I read it in  that context. She swears that she wouldn't be unfaithful (and that she doesn't have the time or energy).",

      "description": "When I was in elementary school, my case of Tourette’s syndrome was really bad, and I’d ended up making random noises at times. This one kid bullied me physically and verbally for most of 5th grade because of my Tourette’s and the fact that I have general anxiety disorder, and I’d eventually had enough. (I’d asked him to stop for quite a while by the way) One day when I came to school, the kid started pushing me around again, so I punched the kid in the face, breaking his nose, then I said it was because of my Tourette’s when I was called down to the principal’s office, allowing me to not receive any punishment. Did I do something a bit too extreme there or not? (If you don’t know, Tourette’s Syndrome is a neurological disorder that basically causes the person with it to do things without telling their brain they want to I guess. It basically causes neurons to randomly fire at times. Tourette’s syndrome is apparently on the Autism spectrum but I don’t know for sure)",

      "description": "So I’m 23, and 40 weeks pregnant with a sweet little girl. Her dad and I were together for two years, and split when I found out I was pregnant. He REALLY did not want me to keep this baby. We grew up in the same hometown but never really talked until we were both a few years out of high school and in the military. I’m stationed in GA and he is in VA, in different branches. We have had almost zero contact my entire pregnancy, since it’s normally just him saying everything under the sun to make me upset and cry. \n\nHis family knows about the baby (he didn’t tell them, I had to when I was about 6 1/2 months along) and they are kind enough to call a couple times a week and see how I’m feeling and just make sure I’m okay. \n\nHe doesn’t want to be on the birth certificate, he won’t let me give her his last name (both things I want for her, but if he doesn’t sign a paternity acknowledgment, I have no choice) he doesn’t want me to file for child support either. He doesn’t want any record of this child near his name. I know I can still file without his permission, and a paternity test will be done, and it will all happen anyways. \n\nHe wants to just give me money every month, which I trust he will do since we are both military and his career is EXTREMELY important to him. After talking to his family today, I feel awful about the amount we settled on. We settled on $600 a month, which will only cover daycare and I’m paying for everything else for her. He hasn’t helped with any of the baby gear, clothes, diapers, etc. His family thinks he should only be responsible for helping with half of daycare, which will stretch my budget extremely thin. \n\nMind you, he has no bills, family pays his truck and insurance, he pays about $300 for rent in his buddies house, and he has probably $100,000 in savings. If I agree to that $300 a month I will never be able to establish any sort of savings, and always be on thin ice, while he is still rolling in money and no responsibilities. \n\nMy fear is if we go to court, the amount they come up with for him to pay will be similar to that $300 since I “technically” make more than he does because I am one rank higher. (Obviously that’s just how it will be and I’ll have to get over it) I actually have to pay rent, utilities, a car note, insurance, a cell phone bill, and support our daughter. He is deploying soon after she is born, and he has a very high risk career, so I do worry something will  happen to him and it will be as though our daughter never existed on his end.\n\nAm I the asshole for not respecting his wishes and wanting to file for paternity/child support?",

      "description": "Recently I met a girl on Bumble, who as it happened wanted a casual non-exclusive situation, which was fine with me.\n\nShe told me she was still in love with her ex and didn’t want a relationship, but she ends up drunkenly entering a relationship with another Bumble guy that confesses love to her. She initially feels like this is a mistake but starts having a good time\n\nNot long after this an interaction with her ex brings those feelings rushing back, and her new bf starts being a bit of a dick in a series of ways. He openly says he enjoys teasing her and winding her up, he asks for naked photos quite flippantly without really appreciating them or helping her feel secure about what she’s exposed, he jokes about sleeping with other girls and about giving her number away to other guys, telling her they think she’s hot.\n\nPossibly the biggest issue is that this guy doesn’t seem to want to offer physical affection, and literally sets a timer for cuddles. Eventually, she asks him if it’s alright for a guy to stay over. He says yes, And I stay over, but nothing happens, although there are some tender and intimate moments.\n\nNot long after she invites me out to an electronic club with a friend of hers. The night ends and I decide to take her home since she’s pretty drunk, but we get burgers first. It’s at this time that she confesses she has already slept with someone else, and that she wanted to do stuff with me a few nights ago. Additionally she says that if I go home with her she will probably end up doing stuff with me too.\n\nI reason that, she’s already cheating on him with other people, and he is also neglecting her in some really basic ways. From what I can gather she is plucking up the courage to end it but is worried about doing that for a series of reasons. I go home with her, and we have sex multiple times that evening, and the next day.\n\nTLDR: I slept with a girl in an unhappy relationship who is already cheating on her kind of dickish boyfriend.\n\nAm I the asshole for going home with her?",

To each their own, but I've had really good conversations with people via text, then on meeting I find out that I am not attracted to them and that would have been clear if they'd represented themselves accurately. Obviously everyone wants to put their most flattering photos, but I'm talking about major weight/age/face differences. Not an attack at any type of person, but just being accurate.\n\nI never like to ghost someone and I always send a \"It was nice meeting but I don't think I'm interested in pursuing anything further\" type message. Would I be an asshole to include \"... to be honest, the reason is you look quite different from your photos and when we met I realised you're not my type\".\n\nIf someone said that to me I think I would be upset, but then realise that I should look at being more accurate.

      "description": "So I have what you might describe as a fairly loud laugh. It's not ridiculously loud, but it's noticeable and hearty at least. I also have chronic depression, among other things, so I don't usually laugh much, especially not a rib-tickling, belly-shaking, earth-shattering laugh to end all laughs. A titter or a giggle or an occasional snort is about all you'd usually get from me, however lately I've been feeling pretty good. See the thing about chronic illness is that there's often periods where your illness decides to go on cooldown for a little while. For me, this is the first time in longer than I can actually remember where I've felt energetic and hyperactive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the aforementioned boyfriend of mine and I were just finishing up a game of CIV for the night. He closed his game, I closed my game and opened reddit to browse for a bit; all was right with the world. Immediately upon opening reddit I saw a post which some of you may have seen earlier: AITA for accidentally hatching my roommate's egg? I don't know about any of you but that title, my god. It tickled me in a way that I haven't been tickled in a long time. I mean, accidental egg hatching? Hilarious. So I started laughing. It was the kind of laugh where I just let everything go, you know? It felt wonderful. I had tears rolling down my cheeks and everything. Marvellous. Not to the boyfriend though! He grunted (if you could call it a grunt), and told me in a very irritated tone that I was laughing too loud. No biggie right? Except... It was. As soon as he said that, my heart sank completely and the egg post wasn't funny anymore. Am I overreacting? Maybe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor as long as I've been dating people, I've been with some really nasty men. Men who think that my personality is horribly flawed and that I need to change myself to accommodate them more. For a while I believed them, that I'm a dreadful person and that I'll never amount to anything. It sounds pathetic when I put it in writing but I was young and stupid, as cliche as it is to say that. The long and short of it is, until I met my current man, I'd never known anyone I could truly be myself with. Every version of who I am is tailored specifically to who I'm currently talking to, and it's always been that way. I found it easier to do that than to let the real me out and open to rejection. But I love my boyfriend and I've never felt more comfortable with anyone. This one thing just really upset me because the only thing I've ever wanted in a man is someone I can be completely and apologetically myself with. Knowing that I annoyed him but doing something as simple as laughing too loud... It hurt, man. Now I don't know if I can let myself go like that around him again. Of course I forgave him, but I kinda chewed him out a little bit first... AITA?",

I am using my house as a venue for Jin's farewell party as he is leaving the country and has no where else to host a party. \n\nMy ex had a history of being controlling due to past issues and I have put them aside to love her as she is. However I have gotten fed up with not being allowed to socialize with people she dislikes. She especially dislikes Jin due to her being in the same highschool as him in the past. I have spoke to her repeatedly and in my eyes I can see that he has changed from the way she described him, however she refuses to believe this and still holds her opinion of him. \n\nThis past year as well I have not gone out to parties or basically meet anyone other than my ex as she gets insecure very easily. I have lost many friends due to this. You can find out more on a previous post I made on r/relationships. \n\nI think I have reached my breaking point, but I still have doubts on the breakup.

      "description": "Friend: Kate\nEx-boyfriend: Jake\n\nSo my friend Kate (of 5 years) was on the receiving end of an emotionally abusive relationship with Jake.  They dated for 3 years.  Whenever you spoke with Kate she would complain about Jake.  Talk about how Jake treated her poorly etc but still stuck around with Jake because “he was nice to her sometimes.”  I would constantly tell Kate she could do better etc etc but it all fell on deaf ears.\n\nWell in January (2018) Jake dumped Kate and shit hit the fan.  Kate was completely heart broken and constantly begged Jake to come back.  Jake then decided he would have a friends with benefits relationship with Kate while he saw other people.  Kate entered the FWB relationship with Jake and is upset he is seeing other people as well.\n\nSo it is currently February 2019.  For the past year Kate has talked about *nothing else* but Jake and the “problems” she has with him.  I’m not even exaggerating that *every fucking conversation* I have with Kate is about Jake and, for lack of a better word, what he’s done this time and how she wishes he could just see that she loved him so much etc etc.\n\nI feel like I have done all I can to help her.  I’ve given all the advice I can give.  I’ve tried to tell her she can do better and I’ve encouraged her to see other people.  I’ve even hooked her up with a therapist (she says the therapy just “isn’t helping”) but this shit just seems to be getting worse.  I’ve told her I’ve done all I can do and I’m sick of hearing about it because I don’t like how she’s allowing herself (I feel) to get hurt.  She will talk about something else for maybe 3 minutes before “*and another thing Jake’s done*” comes back up.  It’s gotten to the point that I’ve been avoiding hanging out with her because I just don’t want to hear about it and *she’s started showing up at my fucking workplace where I can’t escape to talk to me about Jake*.  At this point most of our mutual friends have also stopped talking to her because all she talks about with them is also Jake.\n\nSo this brings me to my WIBTA question.  I’ve just accepted a new job at a location where Kate doesn’t know and I’ve recently moved house to a new address she doesn’t know either.\n\nWIBTA if I ghosted Kate and just disappeared?\n\nTLDR:  WIBTA if I ghosted my friend who was dumped by her abusive ex 12 months ago and still won’t make steps to get over him and won’t stop talking about him to the point of cornering me at my workplace?",

For some reason the girl wanted to target me (for reasons unbeknownst to me).\n\nShe said, \"I would rather die a Virgin than hookup with [my name]\".\n\nGroup laughs, including me because haha funny joke. It didn't really hurry that much because I didn't real put feel any attraction or anything to her.\n\nI respond with \"But you're not a Virgin though\".\n\nGroup laughs, including the group of girls (important). She then process to glare at me, say fuck you faggot, then storm off. We were all confused but then the group of fields went after her.\n\nNext day all the girls were giving me the cold shoulder. Luckily it was the last day though.\n\nSo AITA? Or was this just an overreaction on her part. Remember, she would BRAG about how much sex she had.",

      "description": "I'll try to make this as quick as I can, and this is an alt account because my friend has my main. In short, I have a friend named B who started becoming very... sensitive the last few years. Of course, I'm not judgmental about how people express themselves, but B is very, how do I put this... Tumblr-y, if you catch my drift. We share a lot of the same opinions, so I'm not criticizing their beliefs, but I mean they're very sensitive and use words they saw a post about, and this often ends with them calling any relationship where they and their partner break up as \"abusive\" and \"toxic\".\n\nI'm an abuse victim in several different ways, so the first time this happened I was horrified and asked B about it all, and they essentially just came back with \"Well they were passive aggressive a lot\" which I totally get is toxic behavior, but so far ever past relationship they've been in is now deemed \"abusive\". Even relationships where B was fine at first with them breaking up are now deemed abusive. Now, B has a good idea of what abuse is as their parents were pretty emotionally distant and their dad was downright emotionally manipulative, but the things B has deemed abuse in their romantic relationships is completely ridiculous. \n\nOn top of this, over the past few years they've also gained more and more mental illnesses, and now I think they say they have DID, BPD, PTSD, Bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, the list goes on. I try to leave this topic where it is because I'm not going to try and analyze someone's personal life like this, but people with BPD typically have issues with relationships and B refuses to accept that their partners aren't abusive for being a furry (literally an argument) and that the unsteady nature of their relationships could be because of their BPD.\n\nWhile that's all frustrating, they also use the words trauma very liberally, and say they understand it very well but have some faulty ideals about it. I can remember one time I was talking about a character from a game we both played that was traumatized and angry, and I said I liked him because I could relate to the feeling. B started talking about how awful he was, how he was mean and a bad person, and I replied that he was obviously traumatized. B got defensive and said they KNEW how trauma worked, and they knew that's why of course, but they still thought he was bad. Weird thing to be offended by on my part, of course, but this was just the most recent example. B labels a lot of things trauma (one of their exes, The Furry, made them a fursona, so now any mention of fursonas is traumatic for B) yet often fails to recognize trauma in anyone else except really personal and common things for them.\n\nAm I the asshole for being angry about this?",

The bad thing is that she’s not doing her fair share of work. We’ve been texting her asking if she’s done with her research but she always responds that she’s busy with another activity like National Honor Society or band practice and that she doesn’t have it. I understand that because she’s in the top of the class she’s very busy but I don’t think we should have to pick up her slack. My friend decided to just do her research. Today she asked for all of the research so she can write her report but my friend has taken her name off of the project and is refusing to share the research with her. This is a big project that is worth a lot of points and I know how much her rank is worth to her so I suggested that she pay us. My friend agreed to this and she begrudgingly did so as well. My friend came up with a price but it was a lot higher than what I intended it to be but she ended up paying. There’s no risk of her reporting us because it’ll show she didn’t do the work and she’d get in trouble also but I feel like my friend asked for too much money ($110) and I’m thinking about giving my half of it back to her.",

Okay, so Cailyn was bi, which I had no issue with, until my friend told me she had a crush on me. I tried to ignore it and hoped it would go away. It didn’t. \n\nOne day, Cailyn saw me “winking at her” and confessed to me using a letter. To clarify, I have dry eyes, causing the occasional irregular blinking, it’s not bad really. This doesn’t seem bad, except for the fact that CAILYN ALREADY HAD A GIRLFRIEND! \n\nLater that month, Cailyn complained to me about her girlfriend cheating on her. I didn’t feel sorry for her, seeing as she had confessed to a girl while in that relationship. \n\nI still feel bad for not being sorry for her, and don’t know if I should have been sympathetic.

Something you won’t understand since you get paid for yours, so please respect my time and wishes when I ask to return after my lunch time is over”.  She got very upset and stormed off.

      "description": "Sorry for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile.\n\nMy mom recently got a boyfriend, which was back in November last year. He's a chill dude, I have almost no problems with him. Sometimes he tries to parent me around which bothers me but other than that, he has more perks.\n\nThe thing about me is that it takes me a VERY long time to adjust to new people, especially if it's someone way older and I have to live with them. That plus social anxiety and I almost avoid the person until I get adjusted to their presence. This has happened very often, and when I used to live with my extended family, I had to deal with it for ten years straight. Complete nightmare.\n\nAt the dining table, I always prefer to eat alone or with my mom. I've known my mom for, well, my entire life, compared to this guy who I've known for a measly 5 months. When he sits down to eat dinner I get extremely awkward and uncomfortable, and try my darndest to not attract attention to myself. I eat as quietly as possible and try to focus on my phone, but really I'm a sweaty son of a bitch and always have him in my peripheral vision. Sometimes I can't even get up from my chair to put away my dish in fear that he might say something.\n\nI keep myself isolated in my room 99% of the time. He's talked to me a bit about my behavior, which he's noticed. I've told him that I have a weird fear towards him and he doesn't understand why, even after explaining my anxiety. Even after a long ass conversation about me avoiding him he still doesn't understand, but he does leave me alone. My mom is pissed at me for feeling this way, but there's nothing I can do about it. \n\nTLDR: Don't wan't to interact with mom's boyfriend due to anxiety issues and general social awkwardness. ",

      "description": "My fiancé, \"Milo\", and I are getting married next year. We have already started planning our wedding, and have had the \"financial talk\" with both of our parents. We don't have an enormous budget, and want to have a classy wedding for our guests, so therefore we have narrowed our guest list to only 115 people. \nJust one problem: my fiancé's side of the family is huge, with dozens of cousins and relatives, whereas my side is more medium-sized. \nAfter having the money talk with our families, my parents gave us $10,000 towards our wedding and my grandparents gifted $5,000. I was initially thinking they would gift less but they were very kind and really want Milo and I to have the wedding of our dreams. The talk with Milo's parents, however, did not go as well. They criticized our budget and made clear that they would not help contribute financially to our wedding. I was surprised by this 1) because they have always gotten along well with me and are very supportive of Milo and I's relationship and 2) Milo is their only child, and this is the only wedding they will be able to be actively involved in. \nSo... here's where it gets tricky. In order to maintain our budget we have chosen to cut down the guest list from Milo's large side of the family. Milo's parents are not happy about this, as they want all of their brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews to attend our wedding. But personally, Milo and I don't think it is very fair for my side of the family (my parents and grandparents) to pay for his entire side of the family to come. We are still trying to make the guest list 50/50 (half from his side and half from mine), but that leaves out a lot of his side of the family. I feel that if Milo's parents want more of their large side of the family to attend, they should at least help contribute financially towards the cost of extra guests. If Milo's parents had their way, the guest list would nearly double. But for now, Milo and I are deciding the guest list and giving my parents a say in who they would like to attend.\nWhat do you all think? AITA for not letting my future in-laws have a say in the guest list? I do feel very bad about this situation, I would love to have everyone at my wedding if I could, but the cost is the main issue.

      "description": "Throwaway because all of my friends know my real account. Sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. If you see any mistakes feel free to correct me, English isn't my first language.\n\nSo some background, my little brother and me are actually half brothers, but neither of our fathers were ever in the picture. My mom was super young when she had us and she never actually wanted kids, so she dumped us with our grandfather and only occasionally visited.\n\n Now, my grandpa is an amazing man but he worked full time and never really had much time for us, so me and my brother were always super close. We always felt like it was us two against the world. \n\nMy bro is best friends with this kid, B, they've know each other for a couple of years and instantly connected. \n\nNow, B has a huge family, and I've never been able to keep track of all of them, I'd seen him around before but 5 months ago was the first time I actually had a conversation with B's eldest brother. We hit I off right away, he's funny, charming and we share a lot of hobbies. We started hanging out, and I'm not sure when hanging out turned into dating but we just kinda fell into it. \n\nA week ago he asked me to be his bf officially, I was over the moon. However, B found out yesterday when I came to their house and he went ballistic. He told I had turned his brother into a faggot and stuff like that (the bf is bi, but hadn't come out to his family).\n\nMy bf and I basically ran out of the house to escape him, but after twenty minutes into lunch I told him I was too uncomfortable, that he had to go back and figure things out with B. He agreed, we paid the check and we went our separate ways.\n\nWhen I got home my bro was furious, he told me B had texted him about the situation and accused me of ruining their friendship. He told me I had to break up with B's or he'd never speak to me again. He then went into his room, slammed the door and won't speak to me no matter how much I plead, it's been about two hours.\n\nI'm thinking about breaking up with my bf because I feel like if I don't I'll lose my little brother forever, but it also feels like a betrayal to him.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA?",

      "description": "About a year ago I got a job at a movie theater, it was a great job over the summer but the hours were long and late. When the school year came around it was too much and was interfering with my school work so I wanted to quit. At this time a girl I was \"Friends\" with started talking about getting a job and asked me about my work. I honestly can't stand her she's one of those teenage \"hypebeasts\" who only care about expensive clothes and that's all she'd talk about. I didn't know if I wanted to quit or not but I didn't want her working beside me due to her being so annoying. So I said something that was technically true she stole something in my lunch the first day I saw her (Kool aid pouch so you know how mad I'd be) so I embellished it and said she stole something of mine. She applied and thought it was super weird she didn't get a job and I didn't say anything. Am I the asshole?\nTDLR: I prevented a \"friend\" from working with me.",

      "description": "So one of my friend groups has a FB messenger group chat. We post in there and I probably post about 50% more than anyone else because I throw in 2-3 memes a day. I don't put anything offensive because this isn't the group for that. I routinely get a couple emotes on my posts and never had any complaints or obvious annoyance on account of them.\n\nToday I got into some banter with a specific friend, texts going back an forth... Maybe a total of 8. Then all of a sudden the leader of the group, a pretty close friend of mine says \"MY_NAME_HERE DO YOU WANT ME TO BAN YOU?\" and I think it's a joke on account of the subpar meme.\n\nI give a thumbs up emote and she says \"Do you think I was joking?\" and sends me a DM saying that my \"constant posting\" was upsetting \"everyone\".\n\nI'm not upset that she doesn't like me posting so much, I don't mind changing something so minor. I am, however, very upset at the way she handled this. I was never given any hint or suggestion that I post too much by anyone, I get positive responses for setting up plans and posts among the group. She should have told me to ease off if she was uncomfortable instead of going to 0-100 in front of everyone....... Or am I The Asshole here?",

There are a handful of rooms to sit in lay in for some time and then in each locker room there is a hot tub area where you have to be naked to go inside. We went to each of the rooms and then my mom wanted me to go to the hot tub area with her which I refused. I’m not overweight but my mom has made comments on my weight before saying that I should watch what I eat and just small comments. I told her that I felt uncomfortable being naked around other naked people and felt uncomfortable with nudity especially from other people, it’s weird but that’s how I am. My mom wasn’t happy at all saying that “it’s the best part” of the place and saying she wasted money despite my brother, me, and her going into the other rooms. I then told her I’d wait for her if she wanted to go into the hot tub area herself in which she got irritated even more. In the end we left and she was annoyed.

She runs upstairs and slams the door. I try and talk it over but she's having non of it.\n\nHonestly, I'm kinda annoyed, I thought I was doing every right, I've supported her continuously through this and she has the cheek to say I don't care. \n\nI got up, left and went home, I haven't heard from her since. \n\nIt's been 2 days, I left a text asking if she wanted to talk, no reply. \n\nDid I do something wrong?

      "description": "I’ve been in a relationship with my partner for 4 years and we are both students but in different universities. Naturally, when I got into uni I made a lot of new friends. I started to get along with this one guy at the start of my second year. My boyfriend met most of my friends but had not had the opportunity to meet this specific guy until this last new year’s eve (this will matter later in the story). We are in our third year and the situation started to change. I loved my group of friends and got along really well with everybody including this guy. Somewhere along the second semester of last year I started to get the impression he likes me but I quickly called myself crazy as he is aware I have a boyfriend and how long we’ve been together. But even so, he started to have a weird behavior I was not ok with. For example, one time we were out to a cabin with friends and we shared rooms. I shared a room with him and another good friend (3 different beds). One night I drunkenly passed out on my bed only to wake up in the morning and see he squeezed his way in bed with me. When I confronted him, he blamed the booze. Another major situation was when we partied at a friend’s house that lives outside the city so we had no means of getting home without paying an arm and a leg for uber/taxi so we spent the night there. He casually asked me if he could hold me during the night like it was a normal and appropriate question to ask me to which I obviously replied no. He even met my boyfriend before this last situation on our new year’s eve trip with a bunch of uni friends where I also brought my boyfriend so he saw how evidently in love we were so I really don’t understand why he does such things. Apart from these things, there are also flirty jokes and minor things I am not ok with. He has no respect for my relationship and I take it as a lack of respect for me as well. \n\nSo I started to put some distance between us, we are still friends and all but I started texting him less or only if it was necessary, I purposely don’t sit near him at social events or in class but otherwise have normal conversations.  \n\nAITA for doing this? This obviously changed our relationship entirely as before I considered him one of my best friends and we would hang out and talk a lot more. \n\nTL:DR My friend has an inappropriate behavior towards me so I distanced myself from him.

      "description": "Okay, so I'm a fourth generation Korean American. I don't know a lick of any languages other than English and a bit of Spanish I learned in school. I've never been to Korea, nor do I want to go. My dad is the only person in my family who speaks any Korean or has been to Korea. And the only thing I know about Korean culture is what other people tell me. In short, I'm only Korean by blood and nothing else. I don't bring it up and I don't act any different from an average American, but I still always invariably get The Question from coworkers/strangers/Tinder peeps. Now, The Question comes in many different forms, but it's purpose is to elicit my ethnic background. \n\nHere are some forms The Question takes and how I answer them. (These are actually what people say)\n\n* \"Where are you from?\" Los Angeles\n* \"No, I mean, where were you born?\" Los Angeles\n* \"No, like, where are you REALLY from?\" ...Los Angeles\n* \"Where are your parents from then?\" Well my mom was born in Los Angeles, but my dad is from Houston...\n* \"What's your nationality?\" American\n* \"What kind of Asian/Chinese are you?\" Asian American. No Chinese. (note: There are many people who are convinced that 'Asian' and 'Chinese' are interchangeable)\n* (my personal favorite) \"What are you?\" Yeah, let me sum up my entire existence and identity with my race...\n\nHaving had this conversation at least once a week since I was a kid, I know exactly what the asker mean by the first question. I know I'm being cheeky, but this question always rubs me the wrong way. It's also kinda funny/sad to see people try to find different ways to ask this question so I let it run as long as they keep trying. And I only tell them the literal answer of the question they ask. Yesterday (after about three failed attempts at The Question) a coworker said that I was being rude since I knew what she was asking. My rationale for my behavior was that if they do want to know this information about me, they should be able to ask the right questions. It's not that hard. 'What's your ethnicity/ethnic background' is perfectly fine. I feel like all those other forms of The Question innately make the person being asked The Question seem more 'different' or 'foreign'.

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship and have been for nearly half a year.  Everything has been as great as a much as a long distance relationship can be.  So I was at a family get together for Christmas Eve while she went to work and when I was about to leave she texts me \"(male coworker's name) spanked my butt.\"  I thought she was upset about it because, to me and probably most workplace environments, that's sexual assault.  After asking her if she was okay and if she said anything about it, I got back an \"I'm alright lol.\"  She played it off like it didn't mean anything to her.  Her male coworker is gay if that means anything to the story.  This may be an excuse she has for it to be \"okay.\"  I let her know that I think he is getting too comfortable and that I was upset by what happened, not necessarily upset at her.  I chose my words carefully but that is all I said about it initially.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was met with her being defensive.  She said that I was blaming her for what happened and that I was mad at her specifically.  I tried to tell her that I was upset about what happened but she was mad at me for being upset.  From my perspective, I have no idea how she wanted me to react.  It made me feel like I'm not allowed to be upset and I know that she would react the same way if we were switched.  I don't know if I'm being a jealous significant other or not anymore, I feel like I'm the bad guy now.  ",

      "description": "Some context: \n\n I lived in a house where I had four other roommates, and I got the short straw and got the room with no door. (Just a curtain suspended above the door frame.) One of my roommates started bringing her boyfriend over, more and more. Until eventually he just stayed there all the time and never paid rent, always ate our food, had *very* loud sex, and was basically just an asshole. Everything was as okay as it could get until I started noticing things out of place and stuff knocked over, I always just chalked it up to the animals in the house (One dog, three cats) but I kept note of it. Later, when I returned home from work one night, and went into my room, it looked like I had been robbed. Clothes everywhere, dresser/TV knocked over, the whole nine yards.\n\n \n\nThis definitely wasn't an animal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI later learned that one of my roommate's cats that she was cat sitting got out and hid under my dresser and they had to move everything to get it. They didn't bother cleaning anything up. As I was cleaning it I noticed that money, games, and other stuff has gone missing. I confronted them about it and they played dumb and said they didn't know, so I told them I'm moving out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here we are, I just moved into a new apartment with one roommate this time. Today, they came up to me and asked if one of their friends can stay a week at our place. I'm not sure if I like that idea because I just experienced the above or if I'm just being overly-sensitive/protective of my things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

The women in question here, let's call her Julia (idk her name) was at the gym at the same time. Coincidentally, I was following her a lot, waiting for her to finish using the bench press, machine fly, and the pull-up bar. I'm guessing we just had the same routine.\n\nBut she seems to think I was following her. When she finished using the pull-up bar and saw me behind her for the 3rd time, she accused me of following her/creeping on her. I said I wasn't and pointed out we most likely just had the same routine. She denied this and got a bit louder. This was kind of embarrassing for me, and I asked her to please not make a scene because people are watching. She just stormed off. \n\nFor the rest of my workout people were kind of sneaking looks at me. This makes me wonder, was I doing anything wrong? I honestly feel too embarrassed to go back there.\n\nAITA?",

She and her hubby to be are getting married in September of this year and I will be her bridesmaid!\n\n\\--\n\nI recently dyed my hair black.  My natural hair is a very dark brown.  Nothing major, right?\n\nToday I received a call from my sister saying she does not want me to redye my hair before the wedding so the black can fade out.  Mind you it's only been black for about 2 weeks now. She does not want me to have black hair on her wedding day.  I explained how black is not that simple, it will not just fade and if I left it, the roots would grow out.  I dyed my hair so it would look its best, not it's worst (how it would with roots showing!)  \n\nShe blamed it on my mum saying I would look too \"gothic\" and pale in pictures as their chosen colour is dark red.  I then messaged my mum stating I will not be deciding my hair colour for the next 5 months because of 1 day.  She asked if I could just dye it red or something other than black.  I refused and said I would be keeping it black.  I have now upset both my sister and my mum over my hair choices. \n\nI personally love having my hair black and it does not seem like a major colour change to me.  Mum already expressed her distaste of it when I saw her last.  I am a 25 year old woman, I should be able to make my own hair decisions.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here?  \n\nShould I just dye my hair to make them both happy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Ok,  so everything started on a weekend with friends, we were planning what  to do on the next day. Two girls who one is my brother's gf and the  other is a dear friend's gf were asking for all of us to go to a motel  to relax and be on the jacuzzi. The rest of us weren't that much into  the idea so we were proposing other stuff and my brother's gf, let's  call her Alexa, began getting angry and demanding to go to the motel or  else she would go with my friend's gf, who we will call Louise... \n\nMy bf,  who we will call Ismael, his friend, Antonio and my brother, Gustavo,  have been friends since they were kids and Antonio said Ismael is the  voice of reason (who he normally is) and that we should listen to him.  and Alexa said: \"He's not mine\" in an angry voice and was secretly  saying things to Louise at the same time they were looking at me (I've  been having problems with Louise about other stuff but we were trying to  work it out) so I began to feel angry and uncomfortable with this  situation since the motel proposition.\n\nSo, Ismael said... \"Look, we're  just trying to have a good time, there's no need for this to get out of  hand.\" Alexa then said: \"You can shut up because I'm just asking to go  to a motel and no one is backing me up.\" This is the moment she crossed  the limit for me and I said: \"You need to back off and chill, we're  organizing something for all of us to enjoy, so tone it down girl\" She  answered: \"Don't mess with me, because I'm talking to Ismael, not you.\" I  then stood up and got near her screaming things that I honestly don't  remember because how angry I was. Ismael just took me from the arm and  told me to calm down.\n\nMy brother was also asking Alexa to calm down but  she just wasn't listening and this is the same thing for every situation  that doesn't go her way. Anyway, we left (from my parents house lol)  and didn't go out with my brother and Alexa. Since then, things have  been tense between her and me and honestly it makes me furious everytime  I have to spend time with her but she's family... I don't want to be  \"the bigger person\" because she was being a bitch to everyone in that  reunion. Louise and I don't talk anymore, I gave up on that  relationship.\n\nWere we wrong for not listening to her? Should my brother have calmed her down? Should I have not been angry over something (someone) so stupid and retarded?\n\nSorry  if I made an error, I was translating from Spanish to English all the  discussion, it was a bit more intense than it sounds lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo...

      "description": "Plot twist- not a throwaway! \n\nCut to this evening. My friend FakeName and I, two poor college kids, are hanging out without anything to do. He just learned to play Texas Hold Em poker so we decided to sit down and play for a bit. At the beginning, we didn’t play any stakes, just for fun. \n\nNow I don’t want to toot my horn or anything, but I know what I’m doing when I play poker. I’ve studied the statistics, game theory strategy, and played a lot online and live. I’m not like a god or anything but I really enjoy it and have put a decent amount of time into improving my play. \n\nSo when FakeName suggested put some skin in the game, I happily agreed. It wasn’t anything crazy, just whoever wins gets a drink from the loser. He won the first game, and we upped the prize pool to two drinks. We went back and forth like this for a few games (1 on 1 they lasted 10-20 minutes each). \n\nEventually I started to pull away. FakeName is very new to the game, and he was making all the amateur mistakes. He only bet when he felt good about his hand, and he called my bets way too much when he was “just hoping for that one card to come out!” He had some physical tells too- big eyes when his card came, fingering his chips when he just couldn’t wait to bet. In other words- very easy to exploit. \n\nThis is where I feel bad. Instead of stopping while I was marginally ahead (2-3 drinks), I said yes when he asked the chance to go double or nothing. I won. I said I was willing to let him go double or nothing until he won or we was ready to stop; before we know it, an hour has gone by and he’s down 40 drinks. Yeah, 40. That’s like $200 and waaay more than we should have been wagering given our stations in life. \n\nWhat makes it worse is that we had joked earlier that we were both the kind of people who couldn’t give up on a bad thing- that if we found ourselves in a hole we had the tendency to dig ourselves deeper trying to get out. Then two hours later the exact thing has happened to him, with me knowingly profiting off of his bad decisions. \n\nI know FakeName is a grown adult and he hopefully learned a good lesson, but I can’t help but feel like I should have kept it from getting to where it did. He’s definitely going to want to pay me what he technically owes even though I don’t really care enough to try and enforce a dumb debt like that. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n\n",

Last week we found out they are serving cheesy chips (me and EB both love those) so MB and EB said they were going to order it around 8pm (5pm at the time) so I went for a nap and when I woke up they had just ordered pizza at which point they said they didn't order cheesy chips. So I went for a nap when MB woke me saying pizza was there so I go downstairs and get my 2 sides when I notice there's one extra side So I ask \"did you really not get cheesy chips?\" I take my sides upstairs as I prefer my pizza cold so I finished my sides, browsed reddit and slept. I wake up at 6AM and go to check the receipt, Sure enough cheesy chips were on there at which point I open the box to see that they were untouched so I ate them (EB eats his own pizza and still is hungry enough to eat mine) so I took 3 slices of pizza and the cheesy chips and eat it all. 1 hour later EB comes upstairs calling me a \"pig\" when he is twice the size of me, because I had his pizza I get mad and tell him to stuff it. EV comes back with 2 slices of my pizza and eats it as loud as possible saying he's going to have all my pizza MB tells me I'm in the wrong because I shouldn't have eaten it. I tell him that he and EB lied to me and I'm just having what I deserve.

      "description": "So when I was 16 I had just gotten my first girlfriend and having a car and it being summer we went to a midnight movie at our local theater. When we walked into the theater to my girlfriend's and I delight we were the only ones there and went right to the back row. Well, as the movie started playing three guys walked in but its whatever they're sitting towards the front and there's still 15 empty rows between us. 10 minutes into the movie though one of the guys gets up and starts walking up the stairs and sits to the right of my gf who is to the right of me. This itself wasn't a problem because I saw the trolling humor in sitting next to two high schoolers in a theater to ruin their back row privacy but what was a problem was his stench... Even walking up the stairs I could tell his long hair was super greasy and unkempt and when he sat down it smelled like he just hopped out of a bath of rotten eggs and put on his dead whale deodorant after getting off a 12 hour shift of shoveling cow shit. I visibly gagged at the first whiff and he was even one seat away from me leaving my poor gf to take the full brunt. 15 minutes pass and its become completely unbearable. My gf leans over and asks if we can leave which I quickly agree with. As we stood up to leave we had to walk past him and being 16 and thoroughly annoyed at this point I thought the only logical thing to do was take the lid off our large soda and dump it on him as we walked by. Saying he was pissed would be an understatement but I didn't care and told him \"Maybe this will finally get you to take a shower\" and walked out with him fuming and his friends laughing. My gf thought it was a little unnecessary but wasn't mad about it either and years later I reflect on that night and wonder AITA?",

I have known him from the 8th grade. \n\nWhenever and I mean whenever we go out, I pay for food, drinks and tickets(including for him) Been doing this for 6 years at least. At this point, he expects me to pay for him.\n\nHe has paid for my food less than 4 times in these 6 years. I remember paying for his movie tickets on HIS birthday coz he didn't get enough money to spend. \n\nHe used to have a part time job earning a respectable amount, I guess he gave it to his family to meet house expenses, because I haven't seen even a penny from that money.\n\nHis behaviour towards me is fine, he respects me and my family but when I sometimes bluff that I don't have money, he hangs out with some other mutual friends(who stay near his place).\n\nAs a conservative estimate I guess I have spent $1000 on him.\n\nCurrent situation:\n\nHis sisters wedding is this month and his family has to pay the expenses ( We are Indians, staying in India). So the family is in an even bigger financial crunch.\n\nThis week his mom got ill with Swine flu, which has even impacted them further. \n\nA mutual friend told me that he requires money, and that he broke down while asking. (He hasn't approached me directly for money yet)\n\nBut our friend group has asked me to donate if possible. I really don't feel like.\n\nBe blunt Reddit, Am I the asshole here?\n\nI don't earn yet. All of the money I spend is given to me by my mother. If I were to donate to him, I would have to ask my mom for this.",

R and my mom didn't become romantically involved until after the deal with ex-stepdad was over and done with, but R did give us a place to stay while my ex-stepdad was packing up his stuff to leave. don't get me wrong, i'm grateful to him for that, but that's not what this is about.\n\nsee, R and i tend to clash. a lot. it's been happening more and more recently. he has almost no social skills and has to make insensitive smartass comments all the time to me and my mom. that, and he's really judgmental about people who drink. my mom is by no means an alcoholic. she only has one or two drinks a night before she goes to bed to wind down and relax. she never gets violent or confrontational, and doesn't prioritize having a drink over her own family. she never drinks and drives and is very responsible about the whole thing.\n\nR, however, feels the need to make snide comments to her every time she has even one. god forbid she has two. he actually said \"you're having ANOTHER ONE?\" to her just because she decided to have two. this has caused many fights between them, and despite both of us asking him to stop, he never does.\n\nR also makes these types of comments to me, so most of the time i just stay in my room. when i do talk to him, it's almost like he tries to pick a fight with me, and mom has to intervene. one time the internet was out when i needed it for homework. he made fun of me and said \"what are you going to do if the internet suddenly goes out forever?\" and no matter how many times i tried to explain that i needed it for homework, he wouldn't shut up about how addicted to technology i was.\n\ndespite all of this, my mom loves R very much and always tells me that he's really a nice guy, despite all the arguments. it always makes me feel super guilty because i can't stand him, but she seems happier with him than she ever did with my ex-stepdad. am i the asshole for feeling the way i do?",

He stole things from his own family (his Uncle and Aunt, his mom and dad died when he was younger). I stopped talking to him after the stealing incident. In December, 2018 he wanted to change so, he came back to his Uncle and Aunt and asked them to forgive him. He then ran away from there just after 1 month without telling anyone. No contact, no information.\n\nNow this happened today: he messaged me on Instagram saying that he needs money urgently. He didn't told me what would he do with the money. It wasn't a huge amount, but I told him I can't give him at this moment. \n\nI am feeling bad now, because he have helped me previously when we were close. I think he would have done something if it was me in his position. Or what if he actually needed money for something important? AITA for not helping him?",

The whole thing was weird and it felt a little passive aggressive.\n\nHere’s my reasons..\n\n1. I listen to music in public to kind of be in my own zone, wearing only one earbud would be pretty worthless for that\n2.  I usually have a focus when I go shopping, I hate listening to strangers conversations, kind of distracts me\n3. It may sound silly but I also use it to avoid random men flirting with me sometimes, I’ve had even store employees do that so it bothers me. \n4. I feel that listening to music makes me relax, I’m a bit of an anxious person so it helps\n\nI’ve never thought it’s an issue, I feel that I don’t owe random people my attention (unless they’re an employee or something), the only times I think it could be an issue is if I’m in the way (but I’m a small woman and my anxiety always makes me really aware so I’m never standing in a path). \n\nAm I wrong about of of this?

      "description": "This happened about a week ago and I'm currently dealing with the repercussions of it. \n\nI work in an office environment. Came into work one morning and as I passed our break room, I saw through the window on the door one of my colleagues, a girl in her early 20s (we'll call her kate), was crying in there. Two of my other colleagues were there comforting her too. \n\nI continued to my desk and got on with working. When one of the other colleagues passed by I asked what was wrong with Kate, out of curiosity. My colleague tells me Kate's dog had died. I had honestly thought it would be something way worse judging by how hysterically upset Kate had looked. \n\nAnyway, I got on with my day. Fastforward to later, I'm on my break making a coffee. I see that Kate is doing the same, so I take the opportunity to give her my condolences because she still looked upset. She thanked me and we got talking a little, and she was telling me how she'd had this dog for *such* a long time and how it was *so* hard to deal with the loss. I humored her until she came out with something along the lines of \"I feel like I've lost a child\".\n\nI snapped at this point. I found it extremely disrespectful to anyone who's lost a child. And to compare something as precious as a child to a dog is ridiculous to me. I said something like \"No offense but are you seriously comparing losing a pet to losing a child?\" and she seemed speechless, presumably guilty. I explained to her, quite calmly under the circumstances, why this was wrong and how insulting it was, etc. She starts crying again and walks out.\n\nI shrug it off and assume that's the end of it. Until later that night when I receive a message from another colleague telling me how AWFUL I am for pointing out that a child is worth more than a dog. I was removed from my work group chat, and several people actually deleted me as a friend.\n\nBack to the present day, I have now basically been exiled from the group. Most people at work are not talking to me unless they have to discuss something work related. I am not invited out for lunch anymore. Also for context the people doing this are the younger people in our office. They were already cliquey and I believe they already disliked me and have used this as an opportunity to gang up on me. What makes me more angry though is the fact that some of the more mature people in the office have also seemingly taken their side too.\n\nWhile I can see that I may have been slightly insensitive to get frustrated with her while she was still upset, because she clearly has some emotional issues, I don't think it warrants the entire workforce turning against me.

Y let us know that his aunt offered to let us stay at her house at the location where we’re headed free of charge. This sounded like a great deal, except for the fact that we know how Y is with his money. I’d hate for us to plan out this entire trip and then Y not be able to go last minute because he didn’t save up enough, meaning that myself, X, and Z would be out of a place to stay. I’m not 100% sure that we’d be able to book a hotel room in time if this happened. \n\nThat’s when X and I started talking about having a backup plan in the event that this happened. We talked about potentially booking a place ahead of time and then cancelling if it turns out that Y could go on this trip. We kept the idea to ourselves for a while because Y is a very stubborn, defensive person and had the potential to get angry and completely drop the idea of a trip if one of us brought up our concerns.\n\nX decided to tell Y tonight about the backup plan for the trip. She talked about how we know how he is with money and how we’re concerned that he wouldn’t be able to come due to a lack of funds. Exactly what I thought would happen happened and Y essentially told X to fuck off and now Y doesn’t want to come anymore. \n\nZ says that we should’ve been up front with Y about the fact that we’re concerned about his financial situation in the beginning. Looking back, I agree with Z. It was wrong of us to make plans behind their backs, but I felt like if we brought up any criticism of Y’s spending habits he’d shut down and want to pull out of the trip which is exactly what happened. X says that we shouldn’t feel bad for being cautious. I still feel guilty though. AITA? ",

      "description": "About 8 months ago I was living in my hometown 2.5 hours away from my girlfriend. She quite literally begged me to move in with her, but I didn't want to give up the job I had making and saving money while living at home for free. She persisted, and said I could live with her rent free, as well. Knowing this would lead to resentment, I pointed out how it might be troublesome. Nevertheless, she convinced me and I packed up my things and moved. I started working at a convenient store making minimum wage to try and save money toward the next lease we actually were signing together. After a few months, she demanded I pay some rent. We fought about it a little, but I ultimately decided to pay her 100 bucks a month out of her 550. \n\n2 months have gone by, and now I'm not paying enough rent - she wants more than 100 (her initial request). I also split groceries with her and dog food for our 2 dogs. Now, as I mentioned before, I'm working for minimum wage and part time while I look for a job. If I could get more hours at the store, I would, but there are others who work there full time and I can't take their hours as a newbie.\n\nAnyway, today she wants to break up because of the resentment built from me not paying enough rent. She has asked me to give up all my vices in order to pay her more while she is about to go on her 3rd roundtrip flight trip in the last 365 days. I can't pay more, yet she says I'm taking advantage of her. I think I'm the one being taken advantage of, though. Apparently she has asked her friends and parents, and they all agree I'm an asshole. Am I really the asshole here or what? ",

      "description": "Iv been with this girl for over 3 years now, we generally get along pretty well. She is a bit anti social/finds it hard to make female friends so when she told me she was going to go out clubbing with a work friend I thought great she's socializing and is making a new friend but the problem is tonight she mentioned she wants to go out on Valentines day. I initially questioned why would she go out clubbing on valentines day out of all the days she could have chosen and I was frustrated at her for thinking that it was a good idea. We have plans for dinner but outside of that nothing else, I was hoping I could spend the night with her as a couple and just hang out but when i tried to explain that to her she got upset and said we spend every day seeing each other. I don't want her to feel like Im controlling her by telling her how I feel but that's how she is seeing it I think. Am I the asshole for telling her not to go clubbing on valentines day?",

I believe she has genuine mental issues if she thinks I'd ever think about her as anything more than the worthless piece of shit that decided to crawl into my dads bed. It's not even just because he's dating again, it's just because he choose an airhead who barely graduated high school. She came over and I kept saying remarks to get under her skin. I even called my dad a pedophile which was where my dad yelled at me. I told my mom about it and she got mad and started saying that my dad didn't deserve me saying those things about him.

      "description": "For some background, in my basic engineering class we are building a device that will propel a miniature foam plane with the goal of maximizing flight time. The stated rules are that \"the glider can be modified, but no material or parts can be completely removed.\" Also whether or not the device actually works has no bearing on the grade. There is a competition at the end of class but it has no significance other than as fun activity and reward. \n\nAnyways, over lunch I asked my friend what their group was planning on doing. Apparently they had talked to the professor and he's allowing them to completely grind up their foam airplane. They are planning to grind up the foam airplane, make a new one made out of balsa wood, and attach/insert the ground up foam airplane to the balsa air plane. \n\nThis seemed very wacky to me and I was pretty surprised that the professor was allowing this. I don't think you should be allowed to completely demolish it but because we apparently could I wanted to incorporate it into my groups project. We were going to use a device similar to a ballista to launch a projectile with our foam airplane attached.  At some point, while in flight, a parachute would deploy and our foam airplane would float down. This is entirely different than building a new airplane. If the foam airplane was ground up it would just improve our project not drastically change it.\n\nI mentioned using this idea for my group and my friend got vehemently upset. She insulted my character several times and was actually pretty rude. I don't see the problem here. It isn't as if I'm grinding up the foam airplane and then making a new one. I just think my group should have the option to grind it up.  However because she told me it would be wrong to use it. Because she told me about it would be petty of me to use it and basically cheating. However, one of my group members already knew that we could (though he hadn't brought it up yet).  I already told her that we were 90% certain we weren't going to use it and at this point it isn't worth it. But, I think we should be able to. She admitted that it is entirely possible I could have come up with the idea or that my group member could have, but \"thats not what happened.\"\n\nShe thinks I'm an asshole for even considering to use it. I don't think she has any real claim to it. Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I ordered 4 XLs from Pizzapizza and the ETA was 40 minutes. I had cash on hand, but the driver came about 7 minutes late. Basically this chain offers everything for free if we they don't make it in time (40 minutes). The total was about $60 and my driver had rough English. He said he was only 1 minute late, but the app clearly showed he was suppose to be here 7 minutes ago. We had 11 teenagers but only 2 of us talked to him and we were very calm and ready to pay, but we wanted it to be free. He said something about if I called HQ or maybe customer support and I said I would call, then my friend handed a $10 tip (we planed to give him a $10 tip from the start even if we had to pay or not) and he told me to call the owners and he just left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never called the owners (I forgot), but I feel bad for the guy, I'm not sure if the driver has to pay for the food. It was over $60, even with the tip, thats like 4 hours of work too pay off $50 as a driver.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPizzapizza says that the driver doesn't have to pay, but because it's a franchise, not every location will follow that. He asked to call the owners so maybe its one of those locations that don't follow the rule.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpon further research I found this :\" The Time Guarantee is not offered on all orders. For example, larger orders take longer to prepare and cook and therefore will not be guaranteed. You will be informed as to whether or not the guarantee applies at the time you place your order.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould 4XLs be considered a large order? It never told us it was not applicable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe driver didn't give that much resistance, no sob story, nothing we talked to him for like maybe 2 minutes, and after the tip he just left, so i'm not sure if he has to pay for it or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe pizzapizza I was ordering at was new (only 2 weeks old) and my dad told after all this happened that he saw the owner crying because he wasn't getting business like a week ago. I saw alot of videos on snapchat of people shouting at the owners because their card got declined but still got charged because their card machine does not handle apple pay properly and those people would not get a refund.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my defense policy is policy and I didn't want him to pocket $60 + $10 tip and tell the owners that the pizza was late. I didn't want to create a scene and we willing to pay, but we would rather have free pizza. The app has a timer from when you order, and it says it will be delivered guaranteed before this timer reached zero or you get the entire order for free, and it did reach zero.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there is any pizza pizza delivery man/women, could you tell me if you guys have to pay for free pizza? Or what would happen in this situation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways TL;DR I ordered 4 XL Pizzas and it was 7 minutes late and I got them for free but tipped him $10. I'm not sure if the delivery man will have to pay for it.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my bf’s “bestie” she crosses the line and disrespects our relationship?",
      "description": "AITA?\n\nSorry for the length...thank you for reading. \n\nA little back story: I have been seeing my boyfriend for going on 3 years and we have a beautiful son. The first time I ‘met’ her she made it clear to ignore and avoid me before I was finally introduced to her formally. (We were all casually hanging at a bar she says hi to everyone but skips over me) she pulls him away and continues to ignore me. No big deal. No harm no foul. I didnt even know that was his good friend until after, but I figured she should know I was the person he was seeing and would say hello. Even if I was a newcomer people typically say hello to new people. \n\nThroughout our relationship she never really makes an effort to get to know me. She only ever wants to hang out with him at the bar and prefers if it is just him. \n\nA few times we have all been hanging out with friends she always manages to pull him away from the group to have these close conversations in which she is very touchy with him. Her close girlfriends have told me that she does that to make sure she is the closest to him. They warned me that she would do this to me as well. 4 of her own close friends have said to me something of a similar nature.  I was sure of myself and don’t feel threatened by her in any capacity. She is not a stunning looker and she lives with her mom still. I have never even felt the need to ask my boyfriend if their relationship was ever anything more. \n\nAs time progresses there are instances of her just... what I am assuming is... trying to put me in my place. She posted a picture of herself kissing my boyfriend on the cheek on her Instagram story. I was pissed. Thats blatantly disrespectful in my eyes. They explained it away and said it was no big deal. Another night we were out, she borrows his jacket to wear because she forgot hers. She is a bigger girl and instead of asking another one of the single guys who are her size she asks my boyfriend who is smaller than she is.  I feel insane being upset at this but the demeanor and history makes me look at it in a shady kind of way.  Yet another night him and I are standing by the dance floor waiting for a good song, holding hands. She comes up behind us and physically breaks our hands apart so that she can run to the dance floor too. And nearly any time we are out she becomes too touchy with him. Not the normal hugs and such. But talking to him like a girlfriend would. Leaning into him holding on to his chest or shirt. Another time she showed up on his guys trip with his best friend (a trip that I obviously cant go on) and posted a ton of pics of her with my BF. \n\nIt has just been a series of small petty shit that sneakily insinuates her disrespect for me and my relationship with him. I have told my bf that I feel I should talk to her woman to woman but he knows her better and says its not necessary. \n\nI know many opinions are going to focus on my boyfriends role in this and I agree. It has been a point of contention that he just doesn’t see or want to acknowledge that he needs to give it to her straight. Tell her to cut the shit. I don’t believe their friendship will change if she just cuts the shit. Given these things it is difficult to really start a friendship with her. I’m not into the competition thing...\n\nFor a point of reference I get along with all of his other female friends and have become close with some of them. My boyfriend does NOT reciprocate her actions and is not touchy feely with her at all. \n\nBack to the present:\nWe are out for a friends Birthday. She shows late and gives me a half hearted wave after hugs to everyone. Whatever I couldn’t care less. She means nothing in my life. But the rest of the night she pulls my boyfriend away. I cannot even dance or hang out with him unless I go track them down and interrupt them. No exaggeration. Again I blame him as well. We didn’t come have him disappear most of the night with her. The first few times I go up friendly and ask him to dance. She looks annoyed and glares at me and continues to keep talking to him. He seems torn but comes with me anyways. He doesn’t want to be in that uncomfortable situation and it’s understandable. She had made mention in front of me using their friendship as something unbreakable. I feel that she holds their long history over our relationship and he buys into it being that “relationships can come and go, but friends are forever”...\n\nThe final straw of the same night was when we leave to a new bar and she pulls him away once again to the bar and they are together the entire time we are there. People are asking me where he is and I don’t know until I have to track them down in the crowd or at a bar. I pulled him aside to mention wth was going on and he said he was here with me. Ok cool he sees it. A few minutes later we are socializing and doing whatever you do at the bar and I see them again together at the bar getting a drink. No big deal. It turns into 10 minutes then 20.... she is leaning on him and grabs his head a plants a kiss on his cheek. That pushes my boundary and have had enough of her shady actions that night. I go to them and ask what the hell is going on and what is so important that they are chatting the whole night. (Just her talking about some drama with herself, she is always in the middle of some drama) We (her and I) start yelling at one another and the bouncers say they are going to ask us to leave if we don’t stop. She asks what my problem with her is and I attempt to tell her. She over talks me saying how much she tries with me and how much respect she has had for me. I suggest we talk about all this outside. We go outside and once we are away from the group and my boyfriend, her whole attitude changes. She doesn’t even try to hear anything I want to explain (I was heated but calm enough to not get out of control). She goes for low blows and begins bringing up rough patches in my relationship that I thought were private. She says he tells her everything and asks “ you think he really loves you... no” and “I love when you are threatened by me. I makes me feel so good”. I can’t keep talking to this chick. And leave with my BF. He was on my side but not fully. He kept trying to tell me to give her a chance. He said he won’t choose and I would never ask him to. \n\nI had no intentions to start anything on a night we were celebrating someone’s birthday.  \n\nAm I missing some perspective here? I feel that is is difficult to explain these vibes that I get from her and because no one is in my shoes they think I am over-reacting. \n\nAm I the asshole for not “giving this person a chance” in the first place, letting it get to a boiling point and losing it with her?\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Firstly, what a wild Reddit ride it has been the last day. I have tried to read and respond as much as I can. Being that his career involves working 24 hour shifts we have had 3 days of “space”....I still need more and have planned to stay else where for a while. \n \nYour comments have put my feelings into words and I feel somewhat clearer in that aspect. \n\nI don’t know how or what will be the next step here but I know it won’t be easy. \n\nThank you all. \n\n\nUPDATE 2: the turmoil has gotten worse and we are looking at an extended “break”. I need to get back to putting myself first so that I can be a strong mother and woman. He needs to figure out if he can prioritize our relationship and family or if it will continue to be himself and his friends that are always first. I am seeking a family therapist to give us guidance during this break because honestly we have both dug this hole that we have found ourselves in and if we think that just time and space will fix anything. We are being idiots. Even if the relationship doesn’t continue we will need to coparent. And at this point if he disrespected me in our relationship I expect that it may be the same in our coparenting relationship. And that leaves us in an even shittier position because I will feel helpless in times that he has my son and I cannot rely on him to parent in a way that is respectful to whatever wishes I have. Even with counseling, it is ultimately up to him to want to accept the reality of what it takes to have a family together with me or not. ",

      "description": "Hello All,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my parents gave me $120K (40K for each of us) when they got a lump sum of money from a house sale because are not responsible with money what so-ever. They gave me this money to use some for my house and give my sisters their 40K when they get married/buy a house. My parents gave me full control of this money as to when and how it will be given to my siblings. My sisters do not have plans to do either(marriage or buy a house)in the near future but they have  followed in my parents foot steps and have terrible spending habits. My parents were not good parents and I had to raise my sisters for the most part (I'm the oldest 28, 25, 24), I packed their lunches, dropped them off at school, went to parent-teacher meetings among other things.\n\nOne of them (25 yr old) makes about 70K /year (Canadian), has no property except a car and lives with my parents rent-free. She has no savings, lives paycheck to paycheck and often asks to borrow money form myself or someone else because she's spent all hers. \n\nThe other makes about 42k/year, no car, lives with me and pays rent, (I put aside half of her rent money to give to her when she decides to move out). She is also in the same situation as the other, lives paycheck to paycheck, spends endless amounts of money on food and amazon.\n\nBoth of them have student loans under 10K each and are just making interest payments as they don't feel the need to pay this off right away for whatever reason.\n\nHere's my issue, I think that in order to teach them how to save (I know they are adults, but they were spoiled and are still my babies), I want to tell them that they should each save up at least 20K or pay off their student loans and save 10K before I release this money to them for a wedding or buying a home. \n\nI feel terrible as I should have taught them to save and spend their money wisely, but I'm not much older than them, so I didn't really have an opportunity to.\n\nWIBTA if I did this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, my sisters still come to me for advise, money issues, guidance as a parent role instead of my parents, if this has any relevance.",

      "description": "My parents opened up a restaurant with my brother's in-laws (the wife's aunt and cousins). My parents provided the finances while the in-laws covered the cooking aspect. My parents let the in-laws design the whole restaurant and name it. It goes good for a month and a half, and then the in-laws just stop showing up for work. No notice or reason was given at the time. The restaurant failed, and my parents wanted to speak with them, but all they did was cuss them out. The in-laws still had access to the restaurant and were stealing from it. That was the last straw, we called the cops. Cut ties, and my parents ate the cost. My brother's father/mother in law told him that my parents were too controlling as the reason for quitting. I am so angry at this point, but life moves on. Fast forward about two years later, my brother is celebrating his babies half birthday and who shows up...the shitty in laws who destroyed my parents financially. I ask my brother what they are doing there angrily. He responds \"they are all friends now, its cool\". WTF kind of shit is this. I felt so betrayed, i left the party immediately. I ask my mom when i get home about it, and she tell me they are not friends. My parents state the whole restaurant situation is in the past and would just rather not talk about it. In the end, they tell me they moved past it because they want to have a peaceful relationship with my brothers wifes family, so that there would be no conflict and obstacles to see their only grandchild. my parents feared that they would be prevented from seeing their only grandchild. I am so furious at this point, that i cussed out my brother and his wife for betraying my parents. My parents babysit their kid while they go to work. I hated to see them using my parents while hanging out with people that disrespected my family. Even if my parents moved on, i would never hang out with people that disrespected them. I recently disowned my brother for pulling that stunt. My parents now hate me for cussing out my brother and his wife. AITA for defending my parents?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR \n\nParents opened restaurant with brother's in-laws. Restaurant failed because in-laws ditched the partnership. Parents lost money. Years later sees brother hanging out with in-laws who disrespected and treated my family like shit. Cussed out brother and his wife for betraying us. Parents hate me for doing that.",

      "description": "I started smoking 5 years ago. I was a pack a day smoker for a long time but recently decided to quit and switch to nicotine gum. I understand that it can be really hard to quit, this is at least my 10th time trying to put them down. \n\nThe issue to me is that she never touched a cigarette in her life until shortly after she met me and asked to try a hit. The day after she went out and bought a pack. \n\nShe has been smoking for 4 months and smokes around 5 cigs a day, some days she just has a single cig. That shows me, along with her claims that she isnt addicted, that it shouldnt be very hard for her to quit, especially if I'm able to do it. \n\nIt bothers me that she wont quit because I very clearly communicated to her that it concerns me a lot (even if it wasnt unhealthy already she has asthma to make it even worse). It also makes it significantly harder for me to quit while she is still smoking. I stopped doing adderall and other drugs besides pot, and cut back on my drinking significantly because she was concerned, so I feel like expecting her to quit is extremely reasonable, especially when part of the reason I quit was her being concerned about my health.\n\nShe doesnt think it's a big deal, but hasn't provides me with any argument on why she smokes besides \"I'm not addicted, I just like it.\" To me, that's ridiculous and you should be able to put down a nasty habit your SO hates you doing, especially with the things I have put down because of her concern.",

My parents are always complaining about my appearance (hair, acne, skin) and how ugly I am. When I don’t do as well as others academically or in any activity they yell at me and say it’s my fault for not trying harder or they compare me to them and wish I was more like them. Even when I end up receiving good results they just say “ok” and move on. They follow me everywhere I go, judge my friends, eavesdrop on my conversations and yell at me when I do something they don’t like.\n\n\nMy parents believe a student should only study. \nI’m not allowed to hang out with my friends and I’m not allowed to talk to them through voice call at home and when I relax and do something I like, they say it’s a waste of time and say I should be studying or doing something productive.

      "description": "On mobile, sorry for any bad formatting\n\nFor background, me and my girlfriend have been dating for over four years now. She always had periodic panic attacks, but they really ramped up once we started college. \n\nThe problem is very obvious as to why she’s having these attacks, she absolutely overloads herself and refuses to take care of herself, in my opinion. Let me explain. \n\nShe’s an education major, so it’s not inherently hard since it’s her passion, but it does require her to make extra time to observe at various schools in the area. Obviously the classes can still be quite demanding at times. Her class schedule usually has her busy Monday-Friday 9-1. She’s also in choir, so Tuesday-Friday 2-3:15 is booked along with multiple concerts each semester. She’s also in band, so that means Monday-Thursday she’s busy 3:30-5 along with any marching band or concert band event throughout the semester. She unofficially has a music minor meaning that she takes multiple understudy classes per week learning different instruments. Finally, she’s also a Head Resident meaning she is a Resident Assistance that is in charge of all the other Resident Assistances in a particular area. This means that multiple nights a week, usually 2-3 hours each time, she has to check the dorms to make sure nothing bad is happening. Finally, she is the president of a co-Ed fraternity which requires overseeing and planning many facets of what happens in the fraternity. Hopefully you get the picture of how busy this makes her. \n\nIn short, she has at most a few hours a day in the evening to take care of herself most days if she’s lucky and she often has to stay up past midnight and get up a 8 and the constant overload causes the panic attacks. The worst part is that she put herself into this situation knowing it would make her this busy. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I want to help her when she has these panic attacks, but I am simply not capable of doing that and I think it’s really unfair that she gets angry at me for not doing something that should be handled by professionals instead of her 20 year old boyfriend. Even if I did help her, it does nothing to prevent the next panic attack that I know is going to happen a week later and it’s getting very taxing on my mental health because even if I try talking to her about this she will have an attack. I think the worst thing she does, however, is she’ll make passing jokes to her friends about this and act like it’s all just a funny joke.\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that she just wants my immediate comfort that I have no idea how to give instead of seeking long term help by seeing a therapist, being prescribed anxiety medication, or dropping a few activities to give her more breathing room, but then I’m the bad guy for saying that and somehow I have to apologize for suggesting it. \n\nSo, I genuinely want to know if I’m the asshole because this is driving me nuts knowing we’re about to be back in college in two weeks ",

I've always told him that I never want to be the kind of mom that would tell my childs father he couldnt be in the picture, and that he would always be welcome to visit or keep her for a few months at a time. \n\nEvery month since the seperation he has said that he would be coming to pick her up. Telling me to pack her bags because he'd be here next week. Next week would never come. He would call the day after his planned pick up date and spin me a tale of why he couldnt come and how shitty his life is and how much hes struggling. He only calls her once every week (if that) even though hes welcome to call anytime.\n\nNow that some of the background is covered heres the main events: In December he calls saying he cant spend Christmas without her so he asked if he bought me a roundtrip ticket if I would bring the baby to him. I refused because I'm not going to stand in the Oakland Airport and have a breakdown handing over our daughter, and because I dont want to see him. My mom offered to do it after asking me if I was okay with the idea (I was) so he promised the ticket would be bought and she'd leave on the 17th. He would call our duaghter and ask her if she's ready to see California again and tell her he misses her and cant wait to see her. Christmas came and went because he never bought the tickets and never bothered to give any excuse for why, he acted like the whole thing never got talked about in the first place.\n\nSo here we are in January and he calls to ask if he can pick her up because he wants his daughter with him for his birthday and again says he wants to keep her for a few months. This time I just said no. I told him to stop \"making plans\" to pick her up because I wont let her go with him until custody papers are filed and looked at by a judge. A judge can tell him when he can see his daughter. \n\nAm I the asshole for not letting him see his daughter?\n",

      "description": "This will require a lot of context, and will likely be a long story.\n\nContext: Since I was 16 (currently 20, turning 21 in 2 months) I began to notice that my Mum isn't the best really. She takes care of us (my 2 older brothers and I), she loves us, etcetera but she seems to always be in a bad spot with money, relationships (had a few abusive ones, currently in one) and how she treats us during those times is absolutely horrible (doesn't hit us, but calls us names and screams/yells at us everyday. Literally, every day).\n\nStill context: Almost 3 years ago a girl decided to be in a relationship with me and we are very much in love with one another. I believe so, although some people might say \"YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TRUE LOVE IS!\". Anyway, since I started dating her my Mum has been telling me \"She's manipulating you!\", \"She's changing you!\", \"She doesn't want you to be happy!\". Then Mum spreads rumours around the theatre about the same stuff. Everyone I care about at the theatre starts attacking me (out of love) because I'm in this horrible relationship! Keep in mind, the only time I'm not happy at this point is when I'm at home or when I'm being talked to by these people.\n\nCONTEXT!: GF got a job in the capital city of our country earning QUITE A BIT (A FUCKING LOT IN MY EYES) and moved in with her sister there who is earning almost the same. Since GF knew about the job, she and I have planned on me moving in early 2019 (likely very early February). This has been a plan for about 6 months and my Mum has known about it.\n\nSituation!\n\nA week before I'm due to leave, Mum gets an e-mail from the owners of the place we're renting saying they are coming for an inspection. The owners really don't like us at this point and will use any excuse to get us out because we're horrible tenants. The inspection is 1 day after I leave. I wasn't going to stay because this place is so much of a s\\*\\*\\*hole that I've wanted to leave for almost 5 years (not this place specifically, just being around my family), but I decide I'll stay for the day because my two brothers don't talk to people (mental illnesses) and Mum becomes an emotional wreck, especially recently, if she hears anything negative at all which will likely be said.\n\nMy Mum wants me to stay for a whole 'nother week as a \"VALUE WEEK\" where we spend time together so that I can leave the house happy rather than upset. It's GF's birthday a day after the inspection, and I want to be there for it. If I'm down here I'll be f\\*\\*\\*ing fuming that I'm not there, and then after that day I'll just be sad I'm not with GF yet. I told Mum this, but Mum and my brothers NEEEEEEEEEEEEED it. She's pleading and pleading and I keep saying \"No\" and then she bursts into tears.\n\nTL;DR (I'm bad at these), I'm meant to move in with my girlfriend soon but I decided to stay another day for the inspection of my family's house to help out, but because that week leading up will be stressful my Mum wants me to stay another week so we can spend quality time together before I leave but I know it isn't going to be quality time and I'll be upset the whole week.",

      "description": "Hey reddit, my wife's communication has started to decline since she left for training.\n\nSo some back story. My wife and I are both in the military. Last Aug she left for basic and after a few weeks home in Dec she left agian until April. We have two young kids and doing this by myself is obviously a challenge. I have bad anxiety and insecuritys do to a past emotional affair my wife had at the very beginning of our relationship a few weeks after we moved in together. After she left for basic my anxiety and insecuritys went through the roof. I decide to get help last year and after 3 months of therapy and some medication my confidence is way up and I'm making great progress.\n\nThroughout all of this I have kept my wife in the loop. And she has been nothing but supportive and understanding. She really is my rock in this world. And I try to be as supportive as I can be well she is away. I love the fact that she joined for our family. She has sacrificed alot for us and I will never forget it.\n\nSo to my problem. Since leaving agian in January. She has started to talk less and less to me. After a few weeks of me feeling like I always having to initiate conversation. I brought up the issue and explained that is was starting to effect my mental state in a negative way. This led to tears from her and me feeling like shit for making her cry. \n\nThis was last weekend. Friday night she had ordered pizza before we called and as soon as it got there she hung up on me mid sentence then said she wasn't able to talk because she smoked to much weed (legal in Canada). That hurt a little but I understand. She had a long week at work and was excited. I got over it fast. Then Saturday we were texting and set up plans to talk after the kids went to bed and she got back from dinner with friends. \n\nThe last text I sent was that the kids were asleep and I was ready to call when ever she was  that was at 7 PM. She texted me shortly after \"awesome. My phone is dieing\" I said \"ok just let me know if you can still call and no worries if you cant. I hope dinner is going well\".\n\nThat was the last text we had until after ten. She had decided to stay out and not text and answer. I smoke some pot to calm down and went to bed hoping to be over it in the morning. But I wasnt. What she did hurt me that night. AITA for being frustrated and hurt and always feeling like I put in the effort to communicate? when  all I ever get is \"I forget\" to text back or initiate? \n\nThanks for the judgement. I currently asked her to give me some space to calm down so I dont say anything mean or that I would regreat.",

      "description": "Context: My younger brother (13) is a boy genius (knows the mathematics to put a satellite in space). His brain moves faster than his mouth and he has very intelligent thoughts and ideas. The only downside to this is that his brilliant mind never stops, which results in him talking a lot. Our family is also certain he has ADD because of genetics but it is undiagnosed.\n\nThe story: My younger brother and I (17) are at a thanksgiving bonfire with our small private school. It is being held at a farm and the farmhands were giving the students rides to the fire via hayride. \n\n     While on the way there I sit with my brother and everything is as normal, we have s’mores, hang out with friends, and tell jokes. The topic of our in depth discussion that night was the ethics of CRISPR designer babies, which other people were debating due to me and my brother talking about it. But the real problem started after a couple hours had gone by and we were on our way back. My brother had taken a different tractor due to there not being room on mine. \n\n     On the tractor a girl asked me what I was talking about, so I told her and explained what CRISPR is. At this point another girl, in the same grade and age (13) as my brother, on the ride says “Oh god, is that a (My last name)?” To which I replied “Yea!” She then proceeds to tell me how much she hates my brother because “He never shuts up and you’re just like him. A know it all show off that will never let anyone think for themselves” \n\n     I was taken aback and tried to calmly say “So what if his brain works more than yours?”  She didn’t like that, and replied with “Well, his brain is dumb and so is your stupid brain too.” I didn’t want to fight so I thought I’d drill her into the ground (metaphorically) before it got became a cycle of verbal attacks. I then yelled at her “YOU ARE SO SIMPLE MINDED THAT YOU CAN’T SEE THE BRILLIANCE BEFORE YOU, HIS “STUPID AND DUMB BRAIN” KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE REALITY OF LIFE THAN YOU CAN EVEN COMPREHEND! NEXT TIME YOU DISS MY BROTHER IN FRONT OF ME I WILL DISS YOU IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY! DOES YOUR BRAIN HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO LITERALLY UNDERSTAND ME? YES OR NO?”\n\n     She was speechless for a few minutes until the ride was over and we then went to our cars and left. On the ride home I started wondering if I overreacted, and I can’t shake the feeling. AITA?",

      "description": "TL;DR- friend uses his disability benefits $$$ to buy Gucci. AITA for thinking he doesn't deserve the money?\n\nPlease excuse me for potentially being insensitive, if I'm saying something out of turn let me know and I will gladly change the wording. I'm super open to constructive criticism.\n\nSo, I've been buddies and lived with this dude for the past few years throughout college. We'll call him J. His family is low-income and has many kids. He always says they're \"poor as shit\", but his closet is full of luxury brand clothing-- like YSL, Givenchy, Gucci. During the whole time I knew him, he always liked online shopping and high fashion. I never really questioned this, I figured maybe he had a sugar momma or like some weird side job that paid hella money. Or he was wildly good at investing. Yes, I'm naive as shit.\n\nLike I said, J and I have been friends/housemates for a while and been open to each other about most things. He receives a good chunk of money from FAFSA financial aid to pay for rent, tuition, and miscellaneous expenses. A few months ago he asked me to borrow money, and I said \"yeah why, whats up?\" just to check if he's okay. He said he ran out of money to pay for groceries, and joked to me that he ran out of his disability money. This is the first time he's ever brought the benefits up to me.\n\nSO HERE'S THE OTHER PART: J has a physical disability that entitles him to benefits. I don't want to disclose the disability because I know he's on Reddit, but since I was close to J, I know the extent of the disability. It doesn't have anything to do with mobility, passing waste, cognitive ability, nor is it an invisible disability. J is physically very healthy and is otherwise a \"regular\" young adult. His disability doesn't qualify him for disability parking.\n\nMe: Oh, I didn't know you got that for \\[disability\\], that's pretty cool.\n\nJ: Haha yeah, it's basically like free money. I can do whatever I want with $800 every month!\n\nMe: So... What happened to the money this month? You forgot groceries?\n\nJ: Yeah I bought too many clothes this week! \\[Favorite brand\\] released their new collection!\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I didn't end up lending him the money, told him to ask his parents.\n\nYadda yadda. After hearing this, I was really appalled that he blew through that much money. I don't receive any financial aid from the school. My parents make a good amt of money, but I still work 2 jobs and thrift most of my clothes. I cook and rarely eat out. But this dude is using his disability benefits to buy brand name items????????\n\nI don't identify with any particular political party, and am not well-versed in how our tax system works, but to my understanding, a chunk of people's taxes go to supporting the poor, right? So people are funding his shopping habit? Is this legal?\n\nAfter that day, I start casually watching the packages that come in. I realize that he buys 2-3 luxury items per month. I start making small talk about what he's ordered, sneak in a question on how much it is. This dude buys $300 shoes and $500 jackets, occasionally the odd $50 sweater. Um... WHAT?? He doesn't send any of the money back to his family or invest it. It mostly goes straight to clothing (and living expenses, when he remembers...). EDIT: Also, I asked him if he works. He doesn't currently, hasn't since high school.\n\nI know that low-income populations may not have access to resources that teach budget control. I also don't think poor people \"deserve to be miserable\". And, I am not trying to trivialize the struggles of his disability, since I'm sure he has experiences that I will never have to face. But I am conflicted because I want to support marginalized groups, but I also feel like this is wrong? I've been trying to be more mindful of understanding underprivileged groups (all kinds, not limited to the standard race/gender/etc.), but this whole situation made me sit down and think about what I'm advocating for. I know it's not new, but it's so much more jarring to see your own friend \"gaming the system\". I saw a tweet shaming poor folks buying iPhones, and the highly \"liked\" response was that \"poor people deserve humanity and to feel like they belong\". I've been reading a few articles that say the same message, \"poor people deserve nice things and to splurge\" because of the social stigma that comes from being part of the \"haves\" and the \"have nots\".\n\nI don't know if I'm just backward and bigoted or if I have a right to be angry and should tell him. At the very least tell him to budget better? If I'm the asshole, can you please explain why? I genuinely want to understand, it might honestly just be a mental block b/c I never had to deal with money issues (at home), my family was very fortunate to be pretty financially stable so I don't have experience going through that.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA for thinking my friend doesn't deserve disability benefits? Or at least should be given less than he currently receives?\n\nEDIT: some grammar and info.",

      "description": "For Context: My parents have been divorced for round about 5 years. I‘m currently 18 ( living at my mothers place ) so when they made said decision I was 13 and most of my teen-years were therefore heavily impacted by that. In these years both of my parents have equally tried, no clue whether or not intentionally, to ruin the iteration of the family we had before the divorce. And to be honest, while I definitely suffered from it, I can understand that. They held grudges against each others for various reasons. What I disliked is their lack of communication and their repeated efforts to use me and my siblings against each others. Long story short, they had a very toxic relationship the last few years.\n\nAs the title suggests my mother is currently suffering from cancer and was diagnosed earlier this year ( Breast cancer ). While it‘s rarely lethal it‘s still putting a massive toll on her and us. Luckily she‘s almost through the Chemotherapy and everything‘s going good so far. \nI remember a talk I had with her shortly before her first Chemo. It was very emotional and during it she repeatedly told me how awful my father was and how helpless she feels that she apparently tried to sneak back into her life by visiting her at the hospital. Again, I was well aware of their respective opinions for each other. It definitely wasn‘t a surprise. \n\nFast forwards to today, we celebrated Thanksgiving together with my father, we were going to celebrate Christmas with him ( he apparently has no time that evening ) and are going on a „Family“ Dinner on the 25th. On top if that he came to my mothers Birthday party and has been at our house very frequently the last few months. \nSo you could think that‘s good news? I, on the other hand, am totally uncomfortable. It seems so surreal to me. I can not enjoy anything once both of my parents take part in it. \nI did not have an actual conversation with either of them about my concerns yet. I‘m well aware that that could solve quite a few things but due to various reason I didn‘t. \n\nI will ask again: Am I the Asshole for declining the invitation to a Christmas „Family“ Dinner from my mother? Am I the Asshole for not talking to my parents about my concerns? Am I the Asshole for not embracing the fact that my parents and siblings prefer the current situation? \n\n",

At some point we got to the subject about next year ( last year) and I told him I wanted to come along with them to which he responded with \"No don't. Don't be so clingy. Your mother and I want to have some alone time too.\" Which made me very upset but I just kept quiet about it and ended the conversation at that point.\n\nMy father can be rather strict ,to which I am used to, and both my parents barely have time so I do understand him wanting some alone time with her. I completly stand behing him. On the other side though the way he said it hurt, not just my feelings but I felt something resembeling a stinging pain in my heart + I was very hyped for the con next year so it was quite the downer.\n\nNow people of reddit I'd like to ask if I either or both of us did something wrong and if yes then what?\n\n( I also want to excuse myself for the bad dnglish since it isn't my first language)",

      "description": "So recently, my long time SO and I broke up. When we started dating she was my boyfriend, but she came out to me as trans. I really wanted to give it a try because I loved her- but we found we weren’t sexually compatible anymore, so instead of dragging the relationship out and resenting each other we decided to mutually split so we could maintain our friendship. It has been so much better now- and it almost feels like I gained a sister rather then lost a partner.\n\nHere is the problem. We had been living with my parents and paying rent. I had been on disability and could barely afford to live, and then my family needed help financially so we paid a good amount of rent and everyone was fine with the arrangement. They called my SO their family and loved her.\n\nWhen we broke up, we obviously planned on her finding a new place to stay. Sharing a room was a little tight for us anyway and we though more personal space now that we weren’t dating was good.\n\nWe didn’t even get a chance to tell my parents that.\n\nLess than 24 hours after we broke up my parents said she had 2 weeks to get out. I was shocked because they had never been hostile to her before- and they couldn’t even wait a few days to tell us she needed to move out. My ex is really hurt by this- her family was not supportive of her coming out and my family had become her adoptive family. She feels like she lost yet another family.\n\nI tried to talk to them about this and they just said ‘this is hard for us too’ and wouldn’t talk to me at all. Luckily we have a friend who happened to have a spare room for a good price offer my ex a room so we are moving her out in time, but my feelings are really hurt.\n\nI didn’t expect her to keep living with us- and it’s their house so I respect their rules- but we paid rent and having them spring this on us less than 24 hours after we broke up really has caused a rift between us. \n\nSo, AITA for being really upset with them? I’m honestly having a hard time imaging how I’ll forgive them. \n\n",

      "description": "I’m a (18m) and my friend in question is also an (18m). Iv know him since the 7th grade we met playing online video games. At that time we both had the passion of playing together and “trolling” because that’s what you did when you were 12  on call of duty. He use to record YouTube videos of us prank calling and doing various video game stuff. \n\nWhen we got to high school he stopped making vids got in a pretty bad state of mind and just lost what seems to be all passion for anything. (Also I live in a different state than him) and I’m not sure if I grew a more positive mind set or I stayed the same as when we met, but he seems to always only see the negatives in things. He’s always mad at the most the dumbest things ever. And lately iv been trying to push him to get back into making YouTube vids because we still play games every night, or at least I do and he just sits on the mic and talks with me. Iv even gone to the extent to start making videos myself because I always wanted to but I thought it would push him to maybe give it a try again. Iv tried to start a podcast with him and another friend. But he makes excuses as to why he can’t, or he just gets super pissed and yells that he doesn’t want to. \n\nI’m not sure if I should continue to push him towards things he’s mentioned to be passionate about in the past or not. He’s my homie and I care about him and I want him to succeed it just sucks seeing this happen to someone you know has the potential, the energy, and the talent to do cool stuff just waste it on sulking in sadness and dwelling on things that don’t effect him in anyway. \n\n",

      "description": "So, my boyfriend and I have been dating for a year now and we both live away from home while at university.  This summer (starting in May), I have planned to stay in the town our school is in because I enjoy independence and would rather not live at home.  I have been putting in a lot of effort searching for jobs for the Summer.  \n\nMy boyfriend has been indecisive to this point as to whether he wants to stay or not for valid reasons.  He has had some issues regarding his parents and is not necessarily happy living at home, but at the same time he enjoys his home and seeing his sisters, one of which is getting married this August.  \n\nThis indecisivity would not bother me normally, as   long distance in the summer is no issue for us; however, his lack of choice is now annoying me for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst of all, I have to sublet a place to live for the summer as my lease for my new house next year does not start until September.  As I am hard pressed for money, I am looking for cheap options.  If my boyfriend stayed, it would be most economical to share a room and split rent.  This could get us a nice appartment for cheaper rent.  That said, as he has still not made any indication of what he wants (and where I rent depends on of were living together or not) I have been unable to secure housing yet for the summer, which is a month away.\n\nSecond of all, and the more significant issue, my boyfriend and I have both been offered the same jobs at a local historic site as tour guides.  This is a very appealing offer to me as it is close to campus, interesting, and good hours.  The problem is, my boyfriend does not want to live together while working the same job (he believes it would be an unhealthy amount of time together, and I agree).  I am currently in the various stages of the interview process for three jobs, but would really like to accept this position as it is my ideal place to work.  It would also relieve me of the burden of continuing interviews for other jobs, which is extremely stressful in the midst of preparing for finals.  However, my boyfriend's indecisiveness is preventing me from doing so.\n\nLastly, I am just generally worried that if he is uncertain if he wants to stay for the Summer, he may eventually regret his decision and displace that frustration on me, which would be extremely unhealthy for our relationship.\n\nI've talked to him about this, and he still is understandably unsettled about what he wants to do, but he is putting in no effort when it comes to finding another job himself, and for some reason seems to assume that it one person were to look for a different job, it would be me.\n\nI feel as if I am putting in all the work in regards to planning for summer (a month away) and he is just making things more difficult for me.  It's making me extremely annoyed and honestly worried about living together if it were founded from conflict.  AITA?",

      "description": "This happened many years ago and it bugs me to this day because I don't know if AITA and if I should handled this situation differently: \n\nI was travelling to Chicago for a conference, we landed and everyone got up to get off the plane. I was sitting in the isle seat and gathered my belongings and waited for my turn. The person sitting directly ahead of me went (male) and when I looked down to see if there was anyone in his isle I saw a lady struggling with the seat belt of her kid with an intellectual disability. I didn't know how long this would take and to be completely honest after the long flight I wanted off the plane  so I moved forward towards the front exit following the male.  Approx 4-5 seats down the male who was the father put his finger directly on my chest, which to be honest startled me, and told me to step aside for his family. I looked back and the lady was there with the kid. I apologized and stepped aside they went past me and I followed them off the plane feeling pretty shitty. Once off they all stepped aside to arrange their belongings so I kept on walking. I guess the dad wasn't done with me because he started swearing a streak at me from behind. I'm not big on confrontations so I kept on walking and went on my way feeling selfish for not waiting longer for the mom/kid as well as not standing up for myself to the dad who had no problem getting physical and seemed to be looking for a fight.  I think back and I probably could have told the father that he could of assisted with the seat-belt and if they were talking a long time I don't believe I should have to wait but at the time I really felt like an asshole. Today not so much but I still wonder if AITA? ",

      "description": "This guy and I were dating for two weeks or so, but have known each other for longer. I felt he wasn’t always there for me in the past. He even straight-up ghosted me for 5 months over a disagreement. I guess that abandonment affected me more deeply than I’d like to admit. When we finally got together, my insecurities got the best of me and I panicked, asking him not to abandon me like he did in the past.\n\nThe very fact he was CAPABLE of just dropping me like that should’ve hinted at his true character, but hindsight being 20/20 and all that.\n\nHe got upset with me, saying I had naive expectations and was being too dramatic. We went our separate ways until he reached out and apologized. \n\nThings were alright until Christmas Eve when he texted me, saying “I like you. Can’t we just date and see where things go without overanalyzing?”\n\nNow keep in mind, this was Christmas Eve and I was spending time with my WHOLE family. I’m talking aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, you name it.  It wasn’t until half an hour after he sent the initial message before I was able to take a minute to check my phone. It went from one to three messages with decreasing enthusiasm from “I like you” to “Just a yes or no would be fine” to “Let’s at least hang out sometime”.\n\nI responded saying, “I like you too. Let’s just have fun and see where things go.”\n\nOn with the party. After dinner and presents, I check my phone again. He replies “Forget it. Take care.”\n\nWhat the fuck.\n\nI tried calling him, twice. Both times went straight to voicemail. At this point, I’m thinking this motherfucker is playing some stupid games. Whatever. Done.\n\nI don’t know why, but two hours later I call one more time and guess what, he picks up.\n\n“What the FUCK is your problem !?” I hiss. At this point I was exasperated to high heaven.\n\nHe said his phone died and it took a bit to charge. He’s busy too, you know, and as much as he likes me, if this is how I’m going to act then I can forget about dating.\n\nI’m was well aware he was spending Christmas eve by himself. How “busy” could he be?\n\nI told him yeah. If this is how things are going to be, then we’re better off going our separate ways.\n\nI feel like he was gaslighting me, but maybe not?\n\nWho’s the asshole?",

      "description": "This happened on Thursday, I was at school doing rehearsals for our assessed drama performance and a guy known for making fun of people comments on our piece saying \"You guys sound extremely gay\". Me and my friend start saying things that he is always saying to other people, an example being \"just look at you\" which I have no clue what it means. We also mentioned how he gets paid to walk to school which got him even angrier \n\nThe guy gets heated that we are saying things that he is always saying to other people but is just standing there calling us \"cunts\" and whatever other insult he can think off. To be fair it was 3 of us who were just laughing and just saying what he is always saying to other people but it felt so good as we were finally able to let him feel the insults that he places on other people.\n\nAnyways, he's arguing with my friend about something and I say something that I can't remember. He starts coming towards me saying \"Back it up then\" and mind you I'm sitting down, so I stand up and say I'm not scared of you (I'm quite tall and decently built), he pushes me and I walk towards him again repeating myself. This guy then tackles me and sits on me (this dude has to weigh at least 120kg/260lb of a mixture of fat and muscle since he does play rugby). He then punches me in the face and I grab his hands and restrain them so he can't do it again. I then ask my friends in a calm voice \"Is someone gonna get him off of me\". \n\nHe then starts shouting \"remember this\" over and over gets off me then walks away. Me and my friends are now laughing even harder as he couldn't take what he dished out and I tell as many people as I can the story so he can't twist it in his favour to make it seem as if it was an actual fight. Afterwards he had went home since he split his trousers and I sent him a snapchat selfie of my now bruised cheek with the caption \"I'll remember this\", he replies saying \"Just see what happens at rugby training you pussy\". Low and behold, nothing happened.\n\nSo come Friday he's told some of our mutual friends that I had \"ran to him which caused him to use my own body weight and slam me down\" and that I was \"screaming and pleading for someone to get him off of me\". I tell them the truth and also tell them to ask people in my group, \"bully\" was friends with one of them who verifies what I said. \n\nNow a lot of our mutual friends are saying things in class to him like \"Remember this, this is really important\" basically taking the piss out of what he said. I'm now starting to feel bad even though he started this whole thing but then I remember how he almost let another one of out mutual friends die due to alcohol poisoning.\n\nAITA for making fun of him and technically being the reason why a lot of people are now making \"Back it up then\" or \"Remember this\" jokes?\n\nTLDR: Guy bullies others, Friends and I turn the tables on him, he get's angry and physical, jokes are now being made about him.",

I say yes and she comes over. \n\nAfter we spent some time talking about what happened I asked if she wanted a drink and her response was, \"oh god yes!

Not like jumping my bones making out with me but like a quick peck then backing away.\n\nWe wake up the next morning in my bed naked, clearly had sex. She gets up grabs her stuff and takes off. Doesn't really say anything outside \"I'll talk to you later\" and she is walking out.\n\nShe obviously tells at least one person in our friend circle because I start getting texts asking wtf happened. It isn't much of a secret to them that I have had a crush on her for a long time so they are accusing me of taking advantage of her (and implying worse) by having her come over and drink.\n\nI am really freaking out, so am I an asshole (or worse) for what happened?",

      "description": "Throwaway; high school drama alert.\n\nThis happened in our senior year of high school but it's basically ongoing. For my birthday, my friend of 9 years gave me a birthday card that essentially says \"I'm sorry i can get you a present this year, I'll treat you sometime\". Now, I am not one to complain about gifts and I was happy with just the letter-- what really irked me was that at the end of the year, she got all of her teachers something. And I am not talking about simple stuff like chocolates; she ordered pens and cups and other things online, in store, etc. She was running around being busy with delivering gifts and stuff. \n\nFast forward to a month later, we're going to the movies. I offered to pay for her tickets but she paid for mine too because it was the birthday promise. I was taken aback. I planned on having an actual lunch/dinner date with her where we could sit down, talk, have a good time. Not her just paying for my movie tickets because she just wanted to get the promise over with.\n\nI talked to another friend about how I felt like I didn't matter (even though I spent a lot of time, thoughts, and resources for her bday). She low balled me and gave her effort somewhere else. The other friend said that my close friend probably feels more comfortable with me and thinks that she doesn't have to shower me with gifts or anything to prove our friendship. I can definitely understand this point of view, taking into account that my close friend probably didn't realize that I would feel this way and that she did it with no harm in mind (she's a nice girl but kind of slow ). This is also plausible because she spent major money on another girl's present, but their relationship is pretty sad to look at (like master and servant).\n\nI haven't told her about how I felt but it definitely made me take a step back and look at our friendship. Although I still talk to her, I am not putting in as much effort as before. \n\nAm I the asshole for not liking how my friend only gave me a letter for my bday, yet went out of her way to buy gifts for others (with the possible reason that she feels comfortable enough with me)? I also feel like it might be petty to bring this up?",

We went to our neighbors house to tell them what happened, but a woman we had never met before answered. We explain that we accidentally hit her car while backing out, and she immediately starts crying and explains that her son just died. We immediately felt worse and tried to comfort her while we brought her out to the car.\n\nSparing the details, she got really angry at us. She began yelling at us and insulting us, while constantly bringing up that her son had died. She then called the police and made us call our parents because she didn't trust us \"stupid, incompetent teenagers\". The police showed up, and she again reiterated to him that her son had just died before even explaining the situation. The police officer looked at the cars and pointed out the damage along with additional damage which I claimed we couldn't have caused due to its location and the amount of damaged compared to the other dent (it was quite worse). She got even angrier that we weren't taking blame for it, and once again reiterated that her son died and we were only making it harder.\n\nThings got infinitely worse when my dad showed up. She yelled that his \"stupid\" children ruined her car and weren't taking the full blame for it, and as usual brought up at her son just died. Here's one thing to know about my dad: if you insult and/or hurt his children, you are fucking doomed. He immediately spat back at her and started a screaming match, which eventually culminated into this:\n\nWoman: \"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT!\"\n\nDad: \"I have every right to speak to you like this. My children did the smart and responsible thing by telling you about the accident and giving you their information, and you have to audacity to stand here yelling at and insulting them? Grow the fuck up, you pathetic miserable old cunt!\"\n\nWoman: \"MY SON JUST DIED!\"\n\nDad: \"You know? Good for him. Now that he's dead, he doesn't have to be around you.\"\n\nNow I know my dad's comment was completely uncalled for and totally rude, and, honestly, I was getting fed up too. I strongly dislike it when people constantly play the pity/grief card. I have never lost a child, and everyone express their grief differently. At the beginning I really did feel for her, but the fact that she kept bringing it up just made it feel like she was trying to manipulate us. By the end of it, I didn't even care that her son had died. That feeling still haunts me to this day.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking she played the grief card too much, and eventually not caring that her son had died? Is she the asshole?

Things are generally good between us.\n\n\nHowever, my girlfriend gets drunk 1-3 times per week every week, and honestly, I do NOT like drunk her. Sometimes dunk her is just annoying and unreasonable, and other times, drunk her is straight up confrontational and mean. Either way, I don’t like drunk her. At all.\n\n\nShe always starts drinking intending on having 1-3 drinks, but then it always spirals into getting very drunk, often to the point of blacking out. We’ve talked about it and she knows I don’t like drunk her, and she said she’d cut back. She’s even admitted she thinks it’s a problem because sometimes she feels that she needs to get drunk to be able to cope with the stress of her job. So she agreed to curtail her drinking. But lo and behold, she’s with her family at thanksgiving and completely plastered, and sending me obviously drunk, pissy sounding texts. The usual.\n\n\nThe thing is, both of our dad’s are functioning alcoholics. They both drink quite heavily to stay “happy” because they can’t confront their own shit, yet they still hold down decent jobs and live a mostly normal life. But the thing is, I don’t want to be with someone like that. And if my gf can’t curtail her drinking, this is not going to work.\n\n\nTl;dr: Would I be the asshole if I asked her to stop drinking altogether, or else we’re through?",

      "description": "Backstory: I've been friends with some of these people since middle school, and we graduated high school together last year. Now my best friend since 7th grade is kind of the ringleader and is extremely stubborn and likes to avoid her problems, in addition to having extreme anxiety issues and doesn't get help for it (her family can't afford it and she doesn't want to admit it to them).\nEver since about a year ago I found my calling in career and have started focusing on doing as much as I can to learn and run my own business, so my free time has dwindled. In addition to that I have been spending more time with my business partner, teacher, mentor, you name it, we're extremely close and I try to learn as much as I can. I found someone who I get along with and is already a professional in multiple areas I'm interested in. So I spend most of my time there, with them and their family. \n\nMy friends got jealous and we're concerned for me spending all of my time with my mentor, so I had tried to explain it to them how much this learning meant for me. In the end, my best friend thought I didn't have time for her, assumed I was busy, felt too bad about herself to ask (?) I'm not sure. But we stopped hanging out as much, and grew apart. They made group chats not including me, and stopped inviting me to things. I tried to text her as much as I could, but I'm really terrible at communication with more than 1 or 2 people and I stopped seeing her every day after graduation, and especially when they all moved to colleges away from our home town. Last time I texted her was over winter break. It was awkward and her answers seemed distant. \n\nHere's where the beans spill: A couple weeks ago she posted about me on social media to all our friends saying how she was petty and didn't like me. She printed out her own face and put it over mine in our prom pictures. \n\nI asked my other friend if she hated me too, and her response said, \"nah but imma be real with ya, it was shitty for you to abandon her\" \n\nThe next day when I hadn't heard back from anyone else I unfriended all of them and I haven't heard anything since. It still kinda stings, and wonder if I should've tried harder?\n\n\nTLDR: I didn't have much time for my friends after I discovered my career and my best friend bullied me on social media in front of everyone. I deleted all their contacts and unfriended them.",

      "description": "As a kid, I quickly learned that due to my mom's ultra strict Christianity and [infantilization](https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/general/the-causes-and-symptoms-of-infantilization/), I had to hide who I was to be able to have as close to a normal childhood I could. She would get upset with me the more clear it was I was growing up. She just had serious issues, and I understand now that it's because she is extremely dependent on being a mother. She revealed to me as a child that she was a child slave in her home country for a few years with her sister. She comes from a very sexist/racist society and on seperate occasions has told me that I am intellectually inferior for being Hispanic and a woman. Now I'm looking back at it, I mostly see it as a projection of her feelings of herself and the sexism/racism she went through. She is also very racist to black people, but it partly black herself.\n\nShe doesn't have any friends, or ever leaves the house. She never allowed me to leave the house besides school or errands with her. I was never allowed to play in a park or hang out with friends after class. I could never go anywhere on weekends or during summer vacation either. When I used to come home late cause of sports practice in high school, I got beat for it and called a whore. It wasnt until I was 17, and told them I would call the cops if they did it again that they loosened up. So at 17, was when I was allowed to have friends and have a life. I basically had no childhood and no relationship with them because I learned that avoidance was key in making my life easier under their rule.\n\nMy dad was traditional in that what my mom says goes when it came to raising us. Their marriage was arranged by my grandmother when my mom was 19, my dad 26. They had a very unhappy resentful marriage. My mom also manipulated him into thinking if he let me do normal things kids do, I'd become a whore. (She had a sister who had 9 kids starting at 13 years old.) I didn't have much of a relationship with him cause he sadly worked like 16 hours a day and would come home to a fight with my mom.\n\nFor more information, ya'll can see some of my post history on r/raisedbynarcissists cause there is more I can say. I've read books about all of this and tried talking to friends about it. I know I \"should\" try to talk to them about how I felt growing up and try to salvage our relationship, but I don't feel there is anything to salvage. I am graduating college in May, so I no longer need their tax returns to prove to the government I am so poor I need financial aid. A few months ago, I told them I don't want to continue a relationship with them anymore, just like that. I blocked them on my phone and continue getting messages from my mother making me feel really guilty about it all. AITA or should I put myself through years of more stress and reminders of the pain just because they are my parents and had it bad too?",

      "description": "I'm new to reddit and doing this mobile, but I would really like some advice (its kinda long)\n\nI am in my second semester of my 1st year at a University. As a music major, I am always in a classroom, working in the music lab, crying in practice room, or at rehearsal. I am very busy, so I value all my time I spend doing nothing. I'm the kind of person that needs a day or 2 to be away from everyone and everything just to destress and be ready for another busy week. \n\nI do spend a lot of my free time with friends, eating dinner together and what not. However, no one gets as much of my time and energy as my best friend, lets call him John. John is a music major too (most of my friends are) and is genuinely a really good friend to me. We make each other better and he's usually very enthusiastic about everything. He's always high energy, when his depression doesn't hit, and is always tapping around (he's a percussionist). His constant drive pushes me to be a better musician and person.\n\nHowever, he takes all of my free time. He's in my dorm everyday, playing my playstation (despite having his own) and leaving a mess in my room. I love him, but he's a slob. He actually has a lot of health issues. despite him being pretty skinny.  But skinny doesn't always mean healthy. I have to constantly remind him to eat, drink water instead of soda, and so on. I don't mind, I know a symptom of depression is not eating or eating really bad so I'm not mean about it, just want him to get better. My other friends and even some of my teachers see me and him as more of a mother son relationship than friends because I am always taking care of him. Again, I don't mind this, just not every waking moment of my life. \n\nBeing around him so much has made it hard for guys I like to approach me because they think me and John are dating, even though we both know that will never happen. I tried making plans with a guy I like to come to my dorm and watch Avatar: The Last Airbender with me, but ended up cancelling because I couldn't get away from John without feeling like a dick. I want to be able to have a life outside of him, but I don't want to be a dick and abandon him either. I can't even play games that we have started together without him. We started playing Little Big Planet 3 together (it was my first time playing and he's already beat it) and gets upset if I play without him. We played COD Zombies and he gets jealous if I don't play with him. \n\nI no longer have time to do nothing on the weekends because we do \"nothing\" together, meaning I'm taking care of him all weekend, just to jump back into a busy week. Last semester he jokingly ridiculed me for not accomplishing anything on the weekends, and now he spends all his time with me. Sometimes I get it, you need a friend, but other times, it's seems unhealthy.\n\nI want to tell him to back off and be more independent, but I don't want to hurt his feelings or our friendship. He is my best friend. I feel bad for saying no when he wants to hang out, but I know it's what I need for my own sanity. AITA?",

      "description": "I'll try to keep it short... \n\nI come home to have lunch before I have to leave again for work. A car is parked in my spot that we (I have a girlfriend) pay for and I honk the horn hoping to get the person's attention. I wait for about 2 min and call the leasing office. I give them the plate number to see if they can call them and get them to move their car. After I am told they don't have the plate on file, I park in a spot that I'm not allowed to be in for a brief moment. \n\nThere are plenty of empty spots mind you, but I do not have the correct sticker for all those empty spaces. I can only park in MY spot without being towed. I go around door to door asking if they know who the car belongs to, and no answers. I left the car where it is for just a moment since they only tow at night for cars without correct stickers so I should be fine for the hour. However, I don't know how long this person plans on being in my spot. If I come home from work, they could still be there. \n\nI thought about leaving a note but it was raining. After I thought about it I called for a tow truck because the same people keep taking my spot. I have given countless warnings to those who live in our complex and never towed them. These same people keep rolling their eyes or giving me the \"one second\" finger. Excuse me?! \n\nI call the tow and it arrives in time and takes the car away. The tow truck driver was very polite and understood as he also agreed that it sucks for people to inconvenience you while you are paying for your parking spot. After the tow left, I went outside to move my car into my spot. When I was heading back in, the person came out looking for their car. \n\nI could have walked back into my apartment without saying a word but I decided to let them know that I had their car towed and gave them an explanation. I told this person that I gave many warnings and didn't have much time to keep searching. This person lied to my face saying, \"I thought this was a spot for me to park in as I was here visiting someone.\" If you were here to visit someone, that person you're visiting told you the rules. There were plenty of spots available and you chose the one you are not allowed to park in? The person rolled their eyes at me as I told them I'm sorry, but they had to be towed and that it is happens way to often. So, AITA?\n\nTL;DR : I had someone towed from the parking spot that belongs to us (pay rent, you own a spot). I couldn't find who the vehicle belonged to and I was trying to enjoy lunch so the car gets towed. Person comes out for their car and I give them an explanation. They have an attitude for being in the wrong. ",

We still work across the street from each other and live in neighbouring towns, so we see each other often.\n\nShe's engaged to a man (23M) from Texas (we're from Canada). He came up to visit her for Christmas, and went home last night (Dec 25th). She messaged me today telling me that she's scared for him because he got arrested for bringing marijuana (edibles) on the plane with him into Texas.\n\nI honestly had no words. I threw some bullshit \"he has no priors, there will be a trial, it could work out just stay positive!\" crap at her over messenger, but while texting her I was just rolling my eyes.\n\nI love her fiance. He's a bit of an oddball, but he loves her and they're an amazing couple. I know these thoughts aren't influenced by any personal feelings against him, but I... I just .. how can somebody be so fucking stupid??? Weed is legal in Canada, but possession is still prison time in Texas!! How the hell did he think he could sneak an illegal drug past American airport security???\n\nI feel awful for thinking about how stupid he is over being concerned for him, which makes me feel like AITA. But I think some of it might be because of how much his dumb choice is hurting my friend, because I'm very protective of her, so then I feel like I'm NTA.\n\nI'm really torn about this, and I'm especially upset because now I'm having to read my friend's messages about how \"he'll never survive prison\" and how \"our future together is ruined\" from my friend, and having to try and be sympathetic, when all I want to do is tell her that he's a goddamn moron and if he's thrown behind bars then it's nobody's fault but his own (not to mention HERS for letting him bring her weed on a goddamn airplane!!)\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

I've been weighing myself first thing daily, except for the days I sleepover at my BF's (30m) house. I suppose that I would like to weigh myself those mornings as well, except he has no scale..\n\nThere is room in his bathroom for a scale and I would like to bring one and leave it. Sounds reasonable enough, right? Now for the asshole part.\n\nHe is overweight (~40lbs and I suspect that he has gained a little over the course of our relationship), I am not. I have become quite a lot fitter over the course of our relationship, and feel great about it and myself, and it causes me to feel isolated from him in that regard.. \n\nHe does not seem to care particularly about his health, which does bother me(somewhat increasingly), as I don't want to longterm be with someone that can't bother to show up for themself and take care of their health. For one thing, if he lost weight I suspect his snoring would decrease (the main deterrent to me staying over more, so if nothing else, I feel that should be a motivator?). \n\nI feel like maybe leaving a scale, you know, for me to use.. Might make him more cognizant of his weight... And could maybe spark the thought of making steps towards being healthy.. Which I worry is rather passive aggressive, which I really try not to be.. I mean, I don't preach to him or otherwise try to criticize his habits.. \n\nTLDR: I am health minded and want to leave a bathroom scale at less healthy BF's house for supposedly my own usage, but really to inspire him to use it.

      "description": "Not sure if I stepped in something here, or if this guy is a bit of a rough diamond, so if you'd care to judge... \n\nI met a guy for drinks at a trendy spot last night. We'd chatted on bumble first and I thought I'd sort of felt him out and judged him to be an easy-going and good-humored duded (maybe informative of why I said what I said here). He met me at the bar, smartly dressed and looking just as he did in his pics. One thing that I noticed in particular was his height; he was a bit taller than I'd expected, moreso than me by an inch or so, and I'm somewhat tall myself so I found it interesting and maybe something to playfully commiserate over. Ergo, when we were waiting for I drinks, I said: \"How tall are you, by the way?\" \n\nAt which point he put on a short of shocked smile, and kinda looked like I'd slapped him in the face. He replied: \"Just so you know, that's kind of a shitty thing to ask someone on a date.\" \n\nI was horrified, obviously, and immediately apologized and explained myself. But honestly the night never really recovered after that. The impression I got was that he immediately pegged me as superficial and weird for having remarked on something like that. So he was pretty cool on me and looked quite happy at the chance to make his exit. \n\nRight. I'm feeling totally socially inept at the moment. Is that an assholeish thing to ask a person? I mean I'm not exactly in the habit of doing it. I was just curious and thought it was a benign piece of trivia at worst. So obviously to me that seems like an odd thing to take issue with, but he made it clear that he found it unnecessarily invasive. AITA, or just tone-deaf? Or was he being overly sensitive?",

      "description": "I have a kitten that I foster through a rescue. She's had diarrhea that can get pretty bad, requiring daily baths as it gets on her legs and feet. I've been dealing with this for three months now. The rescue has spent hundreds on tests for this kitten at this clinic.\n\nHer vet decided to try this antibiotic that required ordering through a compounding pharmacy. This is actually something I suggested probably two months ago but the vet encouraged us to try special foods. It was ordered last Tuesday. The rescue called Monday to see if it was in. It wasn't but the person who would know was out sick. Yesterday, I called again. All they could tell us was it was ordered.\n\nToday, I sent an email today asking if they could find out if the pharmacy had sent it out yet, and if not, when they would. They responded with an email that said \"it's been ordered.\" I said, \"I know, but that doesn't answer my questions.\" I then decided to call. I explained that the vet told us that we should only make one change at a time with this kitten. So if the medication is going to take a couple weeks to get, we could make other changes in the meantime to see if she improves. (It's a long shot, but better than waiting.) All I wanted was an estimate as to when the medication would get here so we could decide, vs. what the \"could be this week or maybe next week\" that they told us.\n\nI am put on hold and get transferred to Vet A. She basically complains about all the phone calls about this. She then makes a comment about how all these \"shelter cats\" take up so much time (which I guess was a dig at the rescue) and how she is too busy to be dealing with this. So she says she will have the vet who owns the clinic call me.\n\nThe owner-vet calls me and basically yells at me. He says that the staff state I was rude to them. (I was insistent, but never yelled or called them names. I simply requested that they call the pharmacy for an update so I could plan.) He tells me I was being unreasonable and hung up on me. \n\nI should point out that this vet clinic isn't super busy. When I've been there, the lobby is usually empty and the phone isn't ringing off the hook. And they usually aren't dealing with emergencies or things like that. I’ve also brought my own pets there and recent spent close to $1000 on one of my cats. So I am a customer. \n\nIronically, The owner-vet was able to tell me during his call that medication had been shipped and would be there tomorrow--which was all I was asking for in the first place.\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to know when I could expect the medication?\n\nTLDR: My vet got angry because I wanted to know how much longer it would take to get the medication that was ordered over a week ago.\n",

      "description": "I just had gotten off of a long shift at work, and I work customer service. This particular time was a pretty awful day... constantly having to deal with irate customers, getting yelled/sworn at, and just having to take a lot of extra shit from people claiming everything is my fault when, in fact, store policy doesn't allow me to carry out certain tasks.\n\nWell, I had just gotten off work and was reminded of a christmas party my girlfriend's work was putting on, but I couldn't FOR THE LIFE OF ME remember if it was that night, or if it was the following week. So, I called her; obvious thing to do. I knew she was already off of work and I just needed to confirm with her. \n\nI get her contact from my \"recent calls\" list, and hit dial; it definitely wasn't her that picked up. I heard the basic \"hello\" and my response is always \"hey babe, what's up?\" and as soon as I said that, the other person goes \"ummmm don't call me that, weirdo. Who is this?\" \n\n\"This is [insert name]. Wait, is this not [gf]?\"\n\n\"No. Who are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. Then who is this?\"\n\n\"You called me. Who are you?\"\n\nAnd after that I hung up. I was super confused. I sat contemplating what was going on for a solid 5 minutes before I called her house phone. No one answered. I called her cell phone one more time. This time an older-sounding gentleman picked up.\n\nI asked once more for my girlfriend and he said that there wasn't anyone there by that name. And right after he had said that, I hear someone bust out laughing. A few seconds later my girlfriend picks up and says *laughing*\"hey hun! My sister and her boyfriend had my phone! What are you up to!?\"\n\nAnd I was honestly pissed off. I had an absolutely horrible day, and all I needed to know was the date on a party that was happening and I needed to know if I was to head over to her place or what I was supposed to be doing... and they thought it was hilarious to joke around with me. I have told my girlfriend that my days usually aren't great because of work, and work nearly always puts down my mood. So I'm not sure why she thought it was a great idea to mess around with me. \n\nI told her I was trying to see when the date of the party was, but to forget about it cause I was going home. I told her it pissed me off that she was messing with me after work, and told her I had a super shitty day. Still laughing, she said \"oh btw, my sister says she's sorry.\" \n\nI told her I didn't care, and that I would talk to her another time; after that, I hung up. She texted me saying the party was next week, and I told her I was going to be driving and not to call or text anymore tonight, and that I would see her tomorrow. After that I told her goodnight and that's all that was said. \n\nAITA for being actually pretty upset that they were messing with me? I know I probably didn't act very kindly after such a bad day of work, but honestly... would anyone else take it that fairly? I was honestly super worried for a solid few minutes as to what happened to my gf or what was really going on. \n\nNot gonna lie, still upset about it. ",

      "description": "Background: my boyfriend and I have discussed a threesome in the past. And I initially agreed to it, but wanted to take my time in finding the right girl for our FFM. \n\nAfter quite some thought, I was having second thoughts about the threesome. I’m into women and men, but am very territorial when it comes to my significant other. I found a girl and everything but just wasn’t sure I was ready to watch my man stick his dick in another woman. So, I kinda haggled the process. I wanted to make sure I was 100% ready. \n\nFast forward: About 4 months I’m having even more second thoughts about engaging in this sex act. I begin to become uneasy and just can’t set aside the insecurity watching him sex someone else could possibly bring. \n\nI decide to CANCEL the threesome entirely and explain to him that I am just not ready. He assures me it’s 100% ok. However, I try to compromise and propose him sit in on watching me and the third party have sex instead (since this is something he’d previously mentioned also)\n\nAITA for still wanting to have sex with the third party after canceling the threesome out of insecurity?",

      "description": "So I (19F) have had the best year of my life specifically because I’m spending less time at home with my parents (38F) and (45M). \nNow they had me pretty young and honesty were not together very long before hand ... like 2 months I believe. \n\nThere’s a huge gap between me and my younger brother and so they didn’t get married until he was almost 2. And so I took on a lot of house work and semi-parenting as I got older. \n\nNow my parents anyways... they are clearly not happy. They complain to me constantly about each other and are always in bad moods. My mom doesn’t even have a talking voice she just yells all the time and my dad, who has a lot of health issues, is just always miserable. He constantly ‘joked’ about divorce and his next wife and comments about other women and even makes jokes about my friends wanting him or if they have any hot siblings to set him up with. \n\nMy mom doesn’t work a lot, she sort of gets to pick her own hours since she works at our family company and most of the time she’s at home, she sits on the couch on her I pad or playing video games or watching YouTube. My dad works a lot. And he has the worst hours on top of his health issues. He’s been working from 3am - 9am, 7 days a week, 364 days a year for over 20 years. And I’m not joking. He doesn’t get days off and he rarely gets work cancellations and when he does it’s because of insane weather and they legally can’t make him work. He recently took on more hours during the day as well to make more money. \n\nThe also have a lot of pets... mostly because of my mother’s attachment and social issues... so she has pets rather than friends. But neither of them can stand the mess the pets make and then just freak out about how untidy the house is or how the other one isn’t helping enough to clean. \n\nI honestly don’t think they’ve even had sex in ... I wouldn’t be surprised if it were years tbh. My father complains about my mothers weight constantly, and she has grown in size quite a bit the past few years, and he brings it up to her often as well. I had to talk him out of buying her a scale for Christmas, which he seriously thought would be a good gift to motivate her into working out more. \n\nUsually my dads bad mood is brought on by my mothers attitude towards him or just her constant complaining about things. And then if he’s moody (because of her) she’ll complain to me about how he always has a fucking attitude and she’s sick of his shit and he never does anything and he’s always taking on projects he doesn’t finish and all he does is complain. \n\nI’ve gotten to the point where I ignore both of them and just nod along. \n\nMy brothers (11m) and (13m) are starting to pick up on the shit that I’ve been dealing with for years regarding them and every so often we’ll just look to each other with raised eyebrows like here we go.... \n\nMy only concern is that they’re staying together for stability, familiarity, and ‘because of the kids’ but I know it’s sometimes worse to stay together for the kids. Their relationship is completely toxic and it’s always sort of affected their parenting as well. I don’t think they notice much but I try to communicate with them nicely about that so they can kind of ‘get the idea for themselves’ about what to do in certain situations. \n\nAnyways yeah sorry for the rant but I’ve been thinking for the past ... idk 8 years that they should get divorced and just wanted to hear other thoughts on the toxicity.

I lived with them whilst I was at university, where we shared many human experiences, conversations and genuine, happy moments. I consider them some of the best people I've been lucky enough to have met.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, even though they've tried to reach out to me (via messages, phonecall) I have actively been avoiding or dodging them for around a year now. This has occured since I left university.\n\n  \n\n\nBasically, from my perspective, life is not going the way I thought it would. At uni I achieved a 1st degree whilst also doing a year in industry. I sought out other avenues to flesh out my work experience and build my portfilio (my intention is not to brag, just to set the scene). However, after leaving uni my heart wasn't in the field i got my degree in (it made me very miserbale on some days), so I decided to return home, work part time for a bit, to figure out what I wanted to do in life.\n\n  \n\n\nFast forward 1.5 years and I'm still working a menial part time job, procrasting in life and still feeling extremely lost. In that time, when friends/ex housemates have tried to contact me, I've actively avoided them. Im abit ashamed of where I am atm, so the idea of having a conversation with them, just to tell them I've not progressed at all and have little to talk about, is embarrassing to me. I also feel a shadow of the person I used to be, so I dont want them to see me at this moment in time.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, I know deep down this is not a real enough reason to blow them off and ignore them. I'm accutly aware that I'm probably damaging these relationships through silence. It's not my intention to be cold, disinterested or unloyal. In quiet moments I do d myself thinking about them alot. But if you tried to check-in on your friend numerous times and were ignored by them for seemingly no reason for a year, wouldn't you think they were being an asshole?\n\n  \n\n\nAITA for ignoring my friends for almost a year?",

One of the things that inspired me to get better was a short YouTube video of a group called Air Force para rescue (or PJs). They just seemed so cool and if inspired me to get my act cleaned up. \n\nAs a way to honor these guys proxy improving my life I decided to get the same tattoo that they get when they graduate basic training. It's basically two green feet. I Think it looks so aweome. \n\nI went to the gym just now and this guy asked me where I served. I said I wasn't sure what he was talking about. He said my tattoo, I explained to him what I said above and he basically looked at me like I was a piece of shit and told me what I did was inexcusable. I asked why he was an authority and he said he was an army guy and would never dream about \"stealing\" another units tattoo. I was really intimidated by him so I just sort of walked away.\n\nAm I an asshole or was he just massive gatekeeping?",

      "description": "I worked a night job, taking phonecalls from customers and putting orders in the system. I was employed casually for 16 months working on a roster that gave me about 4 or 5 nights a week, though the shifts were only four hours. Most nights, I didn't even work the full four hours and was sent home half an hour to an hour early, meaning I didn't get paid for the time that I missed out on. This is a problem, because (due to a very bad depressive episode that began a few years ago that I'm now getting on top of with meds and therapy) I am in debt and need all the money I can get. \n\nThe working environment was very toxic. The supervisor and her 2iC were petty and belittling, and showed no respect for anyone but each other. They constantly complained about our manager (who works the day shift), other staff members, and customers. They showed blatant favouritism with those of us under their authority. There were two of us employed before another girl, and my supervisor and the 2iC trained her beyond what we were trained to do, despite that fact that we were senior to her and she was employed to do exactly the same job we were. Ultimately, she also resigned before either of us.\n\nThey were also vulgar and inappropriate, making jokes and comments that are not appropriate for the workplace. Recently, the supervisor made a joke to the other non-favourite coworker that she should have picked up one of the clients of the prostitute who works down the street to \"make a little extra money before you go home\".\n\nI was offered a new job doing something similar for another company. The hours are better (30 hours a week, looking to move into full time after a trial/training period), and I'll get benefits like sick days and leave that I didn't get at my casual job. I have accepted this job and started less than a week later, finishing up my roster with the old job without telling anyone until payroll was processed because I didn't want them stripping me of what few shifts I had left there or not paying me, because I needed the money.\n\nTLDR: In order to escape a toxic working environment I took a new job, and they asked me to start in 3 days. I left my job without notice so they didn't take away my last few shifts and paid me on time.",

      "description": "TLDR: My mother only ever buys gifts indirectly for herself, or so it seems.\n\nTonight I visited my mother and younger brothers at their house. While there my mother dropped a wrapped gift in my lap and insisted I open it then and there despite previously made plans for me to host Christmas at my new house with everyone. She wouldn’t take no for an answer.\n\nThe gift inside was a hideous purple Wal-Mart dress not in my size. The texture of the fabric immediately made me want to scrub my hands. I admit I could have reacted more enthusiastically. I just did not have the energy in me to fake it. \n\nMy mother was obviously upset at my less than ecstatic reaction. She got very flustered and told me I was free to return it but she did not have a receipt for the item and couldn’t I just try to like it?  Couldn’t I just try to appreciate her taste in gifts for once?\n\nThis sounds like making a mountain out of a molehill but this has been a pattern for a long, long time. Previous gifts have included; dollar store jewelry that causes me to break out in a rash (multiple years, multiple conversations on why she never saw me wear it), lipgloss that she had opened and liked, etc. Nearly every time she will take the gifts back for herself under the guise that at least someone (herself) will get use out of it.\n\nIt would be one thing if these things came from an acquaintance that did not know me that well. But my mother has known me for 29 years. She was there growing up as the cheap costume jewelry she insisted I wear kept causing infections in my ears, she was there when as a toddler I would scratch myself bloody over clothing textures, she has never in my entire life seen my voluntary wear makeup.\n\nI put a lot of thought into the gifts I give. I shop through the year, never leaving things to the last minute. I keep a list on my phone of things people in my life mention they like or would buy for themselves if they could justify the spending. \n\nI know I shouldn’t hold other people to the same standards I hold myself to. I know I should have just sucked it up and acted my heart out and quietly donated the dress later. But I could use some perspective and maybe some advice. Reddit, am I the asshole for hating the gifts my mother gives me?\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry for any formatting issues, on mobile. So lately due to me leaving my hometown soon my friends have been trying to hang out with me before I go. BFF asks me and my husband to go on a double date with her and her SO. We agree, leave the plans in her hands as most of the time we invite her places and we know her SO is picky as hell about doing things and often makes excuses why he can’t hang out. \n\nNo plans are made to do anything specific and on the day of husband and I go out to eat for dinner. I let BFF know about an hour beforehand that we’ll be in town after then so once she’s done with chores and stuff they can meet us to do whatever. All cool, an hour later we’re done, she’s just finishing up and says she’ll be there in an hour. Cool, we waste time, then ask if she’s left yet. She’s on her way! Then 20 minutes later she says she’s running behind because her SO isn’t ready yet. This is where I get annoyed. \n\nHer SO is often late to plans and when they’re together it causes her to be late too. I could care less about spending time with SO, he’s not me or my husbands favorite person, but we put up with the antics in order to make BFF happy because she likes when we all hang out together. I figure it’ll take at most 15 minutes to get ready, but 15 minutes and a text later she’s saying SO is doing his hair, he somehow has no idea how long it’ll take, and she’s apologizing saying it’s her fault that we’ve been waiting so long. \n\nAt this point we’ve been waiting on them for over an hour in town since she had originally said she was leaving, not doing anything because we have no idea what they want to do. (we live in a small town so if we were to go waste time doing an activity, like say a movie, then we couldn’t see it with them) \n\nSo with no foreseeable time that they’ll show up at all I text BFF back and say don’t worry about hanging out, it’s getting late, we’re sleepy, we can get together some other time. Now I’m being ignored. \n",

      "description": "So, I'm in college and my spring break is coming up. I had been making plans with some out of town friends, but my dad found out his father's kidney disease might be in its final stages. My dad is from Costa Rica, and most of his family, father included, live there. My dad planned to go visit him at the end of the month, and asked me if I wanted to go with him. \n\nThe problem is, I don't have much of a connection with my dad's family. The distance and language barrier has kept me from really being able to do much, and when I was in middle school my parents divorced and the court said that I couldn't leave the state with my dad (rough divorce where my mom pulled a lot of shit against him to make it worse on his side).   \nAfter thinking over the decision for a couple days, and talking about it with my therapist, I decided I didn't want to go. When I told my dad why I didn't want to, he was upset (which makes sense) and ultimately, I told him I would go since I didn't want him to get more upset, and now we're having to stress over figuring out the logistics of staying in the country for a week without staying at his parents' house (one of his brothers lives next door and the two don't get along, so my dad doesn't want to see his brother more than he has to.)  \nWe're leaving on the 29th and coming back April 5th. I'm not really looking forward to the trip, but I haven't said anything to my dad. So, I think I'm probably the asshole here, but, AITA?",

      "description": "So, I’m in high school and over the past couple of years I’ve gotten a lot closer to my good friend, who I’ll call A. Around that time I started eating with his friend group at lunch, and now we all frequently hang out together outside of school. He confided in me at the start of last year that he used to have a crush on a girl in our group, B. He asked her out and she turned him down. 8 months later, he tells our group he’s starting to develop feelings for a girl outside our group. Soon after this, B gets a crush on me, and we start talking a lot more and eventually begin dating. Wanting to test the waters of our relationship before revealing it to the group, we wait to tell everyone until we’re two and a half months into our relationship. Everyone seems to have a positive, if not surprised reaction initially. \n    The next week, A pulls me aside and tells me he was hurt that I didn’t tell him sooner, and that he thought we were closer. Moreover, he seems to think I had an obligation to let him know, since he’d had his crush on B for a long time. I don’t agree that my decision to wait has any bearing on our friendship, since it’s a personal choice. I assumed his feelings for her were over; it had been months since B rejected him, and he now has a crush on a different girl. \nSoon, a mutual friend starts a rumor that B and I have been dating for 5 months- double the actual time. I find out that A believes this lie, and he goes so far as to argue that I’m wrong about my own relationship length. I’m really hurt that he wouldn’t believe me. I tell him it makes me feel uncomfortable that he’s partaking in the rumors and he gives an apology didn’t seem sincere. He later told me he wasn’t sure who to believe because I had already violated his trust by not sharing about the relationship with B.\nDid I violate his trust by waiting to tell him? Am I in the wrong for not giving him a heads up? AITA here?\n",

      "description": "I’m (21M) and she is (21F) we were dating for about a year when one night when she was at a party she posted a picture on Instagram of her and her friend doing a pose. Nothing abnormal since she’s very social and fills her weekends with plans with friends. But someone who I’ve heard their name before commented “my boo get it “. From my understanding she’s only mentioned him a couple times in the past as a close friend who attends college about a hour away. But this comment troubled me so I dug deeper into it, keep in mind while I’m doing this. She’s at the party. \n\nA little bit of backstory, we broke up and got back together 3 times and this time has been going on for about 2 months. No one knows about us right now because her parents don’t like me for a reason I won’t get into now. But basically we’re in secrecy from her friends and family. This plays into this story later \n\n\nI had a friend who was also friends with the guy dm the guy asking if he and my girlfriend at the time were dating or had anything romantic going on. My friend saved all the messages thru the conversation and this is the transcript. We”ll call the other guy (jack)\n\nThis is the transcript \n\nFriend - Do u and (my girlfriend) have a thing I saw your insta comment \n\nJack - Idk ask her \nidk if she wants to have sum \n\n\nFriend - why do u say that \nwait hold up lemme ask u this do u guys flirt and stuff compliments hearts i loves u and everything \n\nJack - yeah \nwe have talks about us and says she likes where we are rn but idek where we are rn \n\nFriend - that’s not fair u need to have a serious talk with her about this \n\nJack- i try and when i do she says that we already talked about this and i tell her that if we’re not gonna be something more then i’m not gonna wait around and stuff \n\nFriend- what does she say when u say that \n\nJack - She’s like we went over this already or goes. “Ooo all you want is a relationship with me and nothing else” \n\nFriend- tf is she trying to get at when she says that like duh obviously u want something with her but she like won’t take u or whatever and when u try to talk about a relationship she barely says anything \nwhy don’t u ask her why she does that to u it’s not fair and u seem so down about this i hate it \n\nJack - Ooo and when I say that stuff she says it’s bc it’s hard for us to hangout but like I always ask when she’s free and then I see her out with other people \nsounds like a lie since she’s always with other people \n\n\nFriend - does she have feelings for you \n\nJack - The thing is I’m pretty sure she has them Haven’t really asked her bc I think it’s a mutual thing \n\nFriend - wdym it’s a mutual thing and how are u sure that she has them when u haven’t asked like how has she made it clear \n\nJack - we just both know it it’s just not spoken \n\nAfter getting that information I was extremely upset and felt that was cheating. She basically led this guy on never telling him she was with someone. She said she said I love you to him in a caring way since they have been friends for years but he obviously wanted a relationship and was taking it in a romantic way. She apologized and cried and said sorry for not telling me and for not being clear with him but she insists she didn’t cheat because she never thought of him anything more then a friend. What troubles me is what she was doing to make him think they were at that level where he could post that publicly on her Instagram. I told her how it looked to me and she had a track record of hiding small and big things from me and she said she just didn’t think this was a big deal so she didn’t tell me. What’s worse is after the confrontation she told him via text that she didn’t have feelings for him and the guy completely ghosted her. That just makes me think she must of been leading him on pretty hard. Then she started crying to me saying how she’s sad she lost him as a friend and how much he meant to her and how she’s really hurt and wish’s this situation could of gone differently. She blames me for losing him as a friend. I got sick of it and told her I needed a couple days of space. During that time , she never apologized again. Never tried to contact me to plea. She just was quiet and then when I did confront her again she begged me not to leave saying she needs me and I said we need to take a couple days break\n\nShe constantly tells me how me keeping her waiting for a answer if I’m going to leave her is hurtful to her and how I’m being mean etc. she’s said how I haven’t said “I love you” to her in awhile and just has been guilting me a lot. Yesterday she told me how she held back tears all day and how I’m hurting her so much. \n\nI’ve decided to leave her and I will tonight when I meet with her but I feel incredibly shitty because of the way she’s said I made her feel. Am I overreacting? Is this cheating? They never met and she never expressed she had feelings for him. She said she just didn’t know how to clearly tell him and she thought he took the hints. She didn’t want to lose the friendship she had with him by telling him she was with someone. But at the same time she shouldn’t of hid it from me and let it get to that level. She broke my trust and I just can’t think of her the same again. I can’t help but feel incredibly bad for this and I feel like I’m the guilty one\n\n\n",

      "description": "We were both due to attend a careers event this Wednesday in London, so we'd drive down and then drive back, with a stop off point both ways with family to break up the journey, staying overnight. She is involved as a witness in a court proceeding of some kind, so needs to be back in time to attend that, potentially 9am on the Thursday.\n\nThe thing is, we live in the Scottish borders. Without breaks, such a journey is easily 6hrs of driving and she can't drive. She keeps floating options like leaving the event early, considering we'd have to leave early in the morning anyway to attend it on time (stop off about 90 mins away), or leaving early on Thursday morning from the stop off point, which would likely be 3AM.\n\nEvery option involves risk, fatigue, and she of course can't afford to pay for a train back up. My position is that this is one opportunity to network among many in a given year, and it's not a big deal to miss it, especially for how far it is, but her court appearance is something I consider very important.\n\nI'm being made to feel like I'm the bad guy for not wanting to accommodate her in this situation, by taking on a lot of driving either after a long day (and leaving during rush hour, so possibly 7hrs), or waking in the middle of the night to drive 5hrs. Am I being unreasonable, or overestimating how bad the drive etc would really be? \n\nThanks",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I were hanging out in the living room of my apartment watching movies. I didn’t realize the front door was unlocked until around 2am when a girl  (early 20s) walked right in and flopped down on the empty couch next to us. We’ve never seen this person in our lives. To say she was hammered would have been an understatement. She was clearly blacked out and didn’t know where she was.  My boyfriend and I shook her awake and asked what she was doing here or if she knew any of my roommates.  She groaned, slurred some incoherent words, and said “this is my apartment.” It wasn’t. We kept trying to get more information out of her but she was just too far gone. We asked if she lived in the building. No answer. I grabbed her phone out of her pocket to text or call someone for her, but it was password protected and she wouldn’t give me the password.  I even offered to call her an Uber if she could just give me an address. Again, nothing. Most of the things she said made no sense, but she seemed adamant about staying. At one point she even said “don’t worry, I’m not gonna throw up on your couch” despite us telling her over and over again that she needs to go home. \n\nEventually, we had enough and insisted that she needs to leave. We helped her get up and walk to the door. We asked if she could get down the elevator by herself and she said yes. We watched her stumble down the hallway, get into the elevator, and that was the last we saw of her.\n\nOnce I told friends and family this story, some thought I should’ve just let her crash on the couch for the night because she was really vulnerable in that moment. She could’ve gotten lost, taken advantage of, or worse. But on the other hand, it’s not my responsibility to take care of her. She’s a complete stranger and she basically broke into my apartment, even if it was an accident. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\ntl;dr Complete stranger walks into my apartment blackout drunk.  I tried to help her, but she wasn’t cooperating. She was clearly vulnerable and confused, but I made her leave anyway. ",

The cousin with cancer doesn’t know about this, it would be a surprise.\n\nAt first I thought not many people would be on board with it, but turns out everybody is (19 people). I don’t want to shave my hair at all. To explain a little bit, my brother and I are the only two family members who are biracial (black/white). Hair for black women is often a controversial topic; there was just recently a law passed in NYC saying you can’t discriminate based on having natural hair. Imagine having to pass a law for that? The natural hair movement has been a big thing in recent years; I stopped relaxing my hair 5 years ago. I mention all this to say, black women’s hair is a touchy topic.\n\nI’ve just recently gotten to the point where my hair is healthy and it’s down past my shoulders. I’ve only spoken to my brother and one of my more reasonable cousins about this (my black parent {mother} died when I was 7). They both basically said “yeah I get where you’re coming from, but it’ll look bad if you’re the only one who doesn’t do it”. Honestly, I don't think my cousin with cancer would be mad about it, but I know for a fact others would. This may make me shallow, but would I be an asshole for not shaving my head in solidarity? ",

      "title": "AITA for blowing up at my mother about my grades?",
      "description": "I am in my second year of high school at the moment, and have an incredibly challenging course load. I've never really felt challenged before as a student, and always had straight A's. \n\nAnyway, at the start of this year, I purposefully tried to take much harder classes, ie one or two grade levels above mine, to maybe find school interesting and to appeal to colleges. (looking at MIT and CalTech at the moment, heres hoping...) The workload hit me like a truck, and I had no idea how to study, as I had never had to do it before. Needless to say, I struggled a lot and my first quarter report card came back with four B's and three A's.\n\nFor context, first and third quarter grades don't go on your permenent transcript, only semester grades. My parents were understandably quite angry, and i was also beating myself up because I knew i could do better. I used the frustration I was feeling and worked my ass off to bring my first semester grades to six A's and one B. That B stung and it hurt all the more to know that it was in Math, normally one of my best subjects. \n\nAfter the grades were locked in, I was driving home from school with my mother in the passenger seat. (On my learner's permit, need an adult in the car while I'm driving.) The conversation turned to grades and she said that she was proud of me for doing better in the second quarter, and she knows that I'll \"work harder in the second semester.\" This made me absolutely furious. I had gotten less than 4 hours of sleep a night for almost 3 months, studying, playing multiple high-level sports, doing homework, for her to tell me that I had to work harder? I snapped back and said that I had worked harder than I ever had before for those semester grades, and that it was incredibly rude of her to not understand what I had to do to get them. She seemed to understand what I was getting at and stopped talking about the issue, while looking a little miffed. I immediately felt bad about what I had said because I knew she only wanted to see me succeed and get into my dream schools, and also she had no way of knowing that I had to work so hard and get such minimal sleep. I rarely complain to others about that type of stuff, I just don't see the point in dragging others down for my own validation. I waited a few minutes of silence in the car, then apologized for being a jerk, and that I knew she wanted the best for me. She thanked me and that seemed to be the end of it, but there was still a weird air in the car because I very rarely start conflict with my parents. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth and I just want to know if I was justified in feeling slighted by her \"compliment.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - Got relatively bad grades first quarter, worked my ass off to improve them for when they go on my actual transcript. Got them almost perfect, not exactly. Mom said that she was proud, but knew I would work harder next semester. Got mad at her and snapped that she had no idea the work I put in for those grades. Whole thing seems resolved, but I still felt bad.",

      "description": "Context: I have two kids: a son (13) and a daughter (11). I share custody of them with my ex wife; they’re with her for 8 days and then they come back to me for 6. I think they’re great kids, and I love them a lot, but I have a habit of losing my temper with them. They have trouble with communicating with me, my son has trouble with his grades, and my daughter is afraid that if she hangs out with friends outside of school, she’ll screw up, and they’ll hate her (which I don’t understand). My son is a bit more extroverted, but they both hide behind their phones a lot. My kids also have a habit of defending their mom whenever she and I have and argument, which makes me feel like they kind of just don’t care about me.   A few days ago, there was an info meeting for a school trip that I attended. Little did I know that my ex and our son would also be there. My ex and I have a, for lack of a better word, volatile relationship. I believe my son just kinda wanted to leave with his mom to avoid some sort of argument between the two of us, but I wanted to talk to him so I walked up to say hi.   I think I may have come off as disrespectful, because I ask my ex to give us a minute in a very flippant tone. My ex didn’t like this, so there was an argument. All three of us left upset.  The incident: So, a few days later, I picked my son and daughter up from school. We could all tell there was tension, so my daughter tried to lighten things up a bit with small talk, but it didn’t really work. We were on our way to pick up something to eat when my son told me that he felt the way he spoke to his mother was disrespectful. I think we were equally respectful to each other, and after putting up with my ex for so long, I think this was the final straw. I yelled at him for being disrespectful, and he called me an asshole. I pulled the car over, we both got out, and grabbed him by the front of his shirt and dared him to hit me and see what happened.   My daughter got out and tried to put herself between us, and my son told me that if I did hit him, I’d lose custody forever. I lost my composure when he said that. I told them that they were antisocial brats, and that they were their mom’s little soldiers, and a whole lot of of things. It got to the point that some lady came over to ask if everything was ok. By this point, they were both in tears, and they both told me that I made them feel little and useless. Eventually, things calmed down, and we got back in the car. My kids tried to act like it was just a tiny thing, but I could see that they were still upset. I think I might have permanently screwed things up.  So, Reddit? AITA",

      "description": "So before I begin, I'm aware cultural appropriation is a real thing, I'm just not sure if this counts. I'm Caucasian, but I'm not American, too.\nI've always been fascinated by the military, and military history. I served ten years in my country's armed forces, and another five in another country's just to get a different perspective. I'm now going to university as a mature student to study history. In that time I've traveled a lot, and whenever I go places I like to get tattoos that are symbolic of that nation's warrior culture. They're always done in-country. Samurai tattoos in Japan, an SPQR in Rome, Viking tattoos in Denmark, Allied soldiers storming Normandy done in LA. You get the idea. I have quite a few now, covering my arms, back, and creeping onto my chest. None of the artists had ever had a problem doing the work for a foreigner.\nAnyway, I went home with a woman the other day, a bit younger than me at the Uni. When I took my shirt off she asked me about the tattoos, and I told her, after which her mood was completely gone and she left.\nLater I asked for an explanation, and she said that she hated how they glorified war, which I've heard in the past but don't agree with, and is not what I'm asking about here. She also said that I was culturally appropriating the culture of POC, a term I'd never heard before that day, and found bizarre given most of the cultures represented aren't \"of colour\". Although calling them POC was a bit strange, I suppose she may have had a point, but I felt that all of my tattoos were soldiers, of which I had been for a very long time.\nSo, subreddit, do you believe AITA for having these tattoos? It's certainly too late to do anything about them now.",

      "description": "To start, I'm a first year in community college. I am currently enrolled in a Western Civilization course. We had to write a research paper about any particular topic relating to Western Civ.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends and I were talking in discord as I was finishing up the essay. I asked my friends, \"Do any of you want to see my essay?\". My one friend, we'll call A, said yes. I assumed that A would simply look at my paper and maybe give some comments. I uploaded the file into discord for him to download. He downloads the file, copies all of my work except my name, and uploads it to pastebin. He said he did this so \"Now when your professor checks for plagiarism, this'll come up and she'll call you out for plagiarism\". This was very funny to him, but for a guy like me with awful anxiety, this is horrible. I asked him to take it down, but he said he couldn't. I quickly decided I had to upload my file to my professor's website, because I thought if I delayed any longer, it may seem like I stole it from pastebin and just slapped my name on it. I barely have any proof that I wrote it, except for one thing; A month prior to the due date, we had to hand in a thesis statement to my professor. I used the same thesis statement verbatim in my essay. I'm hoping that could hold as solid evidence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my father about this situation, and he is furious. He called A's parents and told them the situation. Now my friends, including A, are berating me for doing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm confused on is this: Although he explicitly said that it's a \"good prank\", his defense is that he didn't mean to make it this bad of a situation. I believe him, I assume he would've deleted it if he had that option. I also eventually convinced him to email pastebin to ask for it to be removed. I believe that regardless, he still caused this situation and should be held accountable. I could get into serious trouble for plagiarism, and even be kicked out of my college. Was it wrong to allow my dad to inform his parents, and possibly get him in trouble?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome notes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*I've known A and my other friends for years\n\n  \n\\*I probably shouldn't have trusted A. He always pulls these kinds of pranks without thinking on me and my other friends.\n\n  \n\\*I still do not know the outcome of my paper. I have not been contacted by my professor yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny insight would be appreciated. Thank you.",

      "description": "\n\nI’m at a hotel with my family for a gathering this weekend, and I’m sharing a room with my sister.   The room has one bed and one pull out couch. I arrived with my father a few hours before my mother and sister arrived, so I set my stuff up on the bed. \n\nWhen my sister arrived my mother asked something along the lines of “I assume you are on the bed because your sister was last time”, which my sister responded to with “no, I was on the couch last time” which I am fairly certain is true, although it has been almost a year and a half since last time we shared a hotel room so I’m not totally sure.\n\nMy first response to this was that in the long history of us sharing hotel rooms I was almost always on the floor or couch, but I didn’t think it was that big a deal. I initially offered to switch with her on the second night, which they both shut down very quickly saying that last time I had the bed both nights ( I’m pretty sure we were only there one night)\n\n    I mentioned that I didn’t care that much where I was but they had yet to politely ask me to move. All they did was make points as to why my sister was more deserving of it than me, and they shouldn’t have to ask because I wasn’t entitled to it. It’s not just that they hadn’t said please or anything, they hadn’t directly asked at all. I’m pressured into shit all the time by them so while I don’t think where I sleep is a huge deal, I felt like a bit of respect would have been nice this time.\n\nI decided I wanted to be clear about this, and said that I would happily move, but it would like to be asked first. My mom once again talked how she shouldn’t have to ask at all, and after a few minutes of that my sister asked in a very exasperated tone if I would please move. I said I would be happy to and switched spots with her.\n\nFor context me and me sister are both college age, she’s two years older than me, and have had a slightly rocky relationship most of our lives, though things have been going better lately.  I know this might seem a bit childish or petty, but as the younger kid I don’t tend to get much respect and I sort of felt like I would like some instead of just backing down immediately like I usually do.",

You will come to know him in all his shit covered splendor in a few moments.\n\nFor the better part of 2 years I have watched him turn my department into a revolving door of people who can’t stand to be around him. He once made a new hire, an 18 year old kid, quit his first job, on the first day, by screaming at him for what seemed like forever, but was probably only a couple of minutes. I’m talking spit flying, jabbing him in the chest with his fingers, like if Gordon Ramsay looked like Guy Fieri, and acted like Leona Helmsley. \n\nHe once got on a fork lift and in a fit of rage rammed into a pallet at speed, sending its contents flying, then demanded that my coworker clean it up, alone, because he “shouldn’t have left this lift there.” It wasn’t his lift, and he’s not even a lift operator. \n\nHe’s temperamental, rude, angry, selfish, and a bully. He’s a bad boss, and a terrible person. He demanded to be added to our work’s group chat, and then started flooding it with messages bragging about all the “super young pussy” he gets. Someone once made the mistake of telling him that none of us believed him. So instead he started sending us nude pictures of the girls that he takes home. Most of the time the girls in question are clearly sleeping in the photos, meaning they probably have no idea these pictures have been taken. Furthermore, I’m 29 and I would go nowhere near these girls. If they’re 20 years old I’d be surprised. Did I mention that he’s a 50 something year old married man. Now I’ve never met his wife, but you can bet she doesn’t deserve this shit.\n\nI have, after almost 2 years, decided to leave my job. Now when you leave my job you are asked to do 2 exit interviews, one with the company’s HR, and the other with your union rep, and the union president for our location. I have decided to go scorched earth in these exit interviews. I have saved every shitty vulgar text message he has ever sent me, and after about a year working there I started keeping a journal of all the times he flipped out. I plan on handing these both over to HR and the union, and making damn sure they know that he’s the reason I’m leaving. This, I don’t feel bad about, I honestly doubt anything will happen to him in terms of losing his job or being disciplined.\n\nI have also thought about sending a collection of his text messages to his wife. This is what I’m iffy about. I told a close friend my plan and he called me an ass hole. He said it’s not my business, and for all I know that’s their arrangement. Let me be very clear, I’m not planning on doing this because I feel sympathy for his wife. This would be solely because I hate my boss, and because he drove me away from a job that I actually really liked. So AITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway because my friends all follow me on Reddit.\n\nI’m on mobile currently so I’m sorry for the bad formatting. This might be a bit rambly so please bear with me.\n\nSo 8 of my friends and I have a Discord server, and we generally all have a good time and there’s no drama. But the night before last night, “Opal” went off on a rant because her mom had told her it was okay that she was bi but it was unsafe to come out, since we live in a very conservative town. This made Opal very upset and she started by ranting about how life wasn’t fair. Then, she started calling out me, “Liz” and “Andy” for having a satirical/sarcastic sense of humor. Liz and I were very confused because we are both always very, very careful when making jokes around Opal because we care about her feelings and knowing our audience is important. Plus, we never made jokes that painted anyone in a negative light at all.\n\nBut Andy made a lot of negative jokes about the LGBT community and this made Opal really mad. Andy meant no harm, but he should have been careful because what he was saying hurt Opal. He said that she was right and he apologized. Liz and I apologized profusely despite not knowing what we had done. All seemed well but then Opal left the chat. “Kyra” pmed Opal and asked her why she left. Opal then joined back and said that we were creating a toxic environment and she only joined back because she valued our friendship. We gracefully welcomed her back and promised to\nbe more aware from now on. Then she left again and blocked me, Andy, Liz, and my brother, “Tom.” \n\nBefore she blocked me, I had pmed with Opal for a bit and I honestly thought we had calmly worked things out and come to an agreement. I was so confused when she blocked me, especially since we had become really close. I asked all of my friends multiple times whether I had actually done something or not, and they all said they hadnt noticed me doing anything that would hurt Opal at all. \n\nKyra is Opal’s best friend, so she didn’t get blocked. Kyra asked what had happened and Opal said that we should all block Andy and that Liz and I don’t care about her emotions because we didn’t want to block Andy, even though he didn’t even get an invite to the new server we just made. Liz and I stood up for Andy and said we can’t just exclude him because you were offended, especially after he apologized and agreed to change.\n\nSo, Reddit, who’s TA here? Was it right for me to defend Andy and stand my ground or is Opal right to be angry with us?",

Shes a very selfish abusive person, even though shes younger than me. (abuse ive dealt with is mental, physical, and sexual) Shes done so many things in my past to hurt me, destroy any relationships / friendships ive had, and its gotten to the point I have a passcode lock on my door. I know im nowhere close to the perfect person, but I genuinely believe she has caused so many of the self worth issues and feelings I have today. I know shes lonely, and I try to be nice to her, but I find it truly hard to love her after all shes done to me (that's what this started from, an argument with my mom) She drives people away, and it makes my mom side with her a lot. I do feel bad for her, but I also know shes very manipulative (even if some people refuse to see that) so I don't even know if I should trust her in that sense. I feel bad for hating her, so AITA for not wanting to put up with her for any longer than I have to? ",

      "description": "Basically to lay the groundwork for the story I have to say that work for a recreational facility that hosts group retreats and the like— but it’s a full year 24/7 facility so a lot of us choose to live in staff housing on the premises to make our lives (and commutes) that much each easier.\n\nI had a coworker who was in charge of what we call the “challenge” components of our facility. This is stuff like a rock wall, a zip line, a giant swing— things of that nature. Last year she got injured and wasn’t able to really do the main part of her job which involves upkeep, staff training, and teaching these activities to people that come to us—  because of this her relationship with upper management became strained because she was living on the grounds but not really able to assist with what was her job (we have a small 5-15 person crew so this was a massive pain in the ass) \n\nThe relationship became so strained that recently, after multiple blow ups with upper management and the staff, they decided to let her go. (All of this was done legally) As she was packing up she handed me a laptop that belongs to the company that she claims she was holding onto because she found it lying around and didn’t want anyone to steal it— though the laptop has been missing for months and she never mentioned a word about it before that moment. She asked me to sneak it back into the office so that no one knew that she had it. \n\nThe next morning I walked into the office and placed it on my boss’s desk, telling her how and where I found it, ratting her out about everything with the laptop— and they were fucking pissed. \n\nWe were friends before she started spiraling at work and I feel kinda bad that I did that, though the people I’ve talked to told me it was justified because I didn’t want to get implicated in the situation later on down the line. \n\nReddit, AITA?",

      "description": "I met this guy on an app 2 years ago, to try to improve languages (English and Spanish). We both live in different countries at this time but we immediately get along. In general I don't text my friends everyday, more like once per month and he had some problems to respect this, he didn't understand why I wouldn't talk to him (I'm not a super fan of small talks and he's so talkative he would talk by himself). We texted, video chat, call etc. I enjoyed it but I have to say I found it very exhausting as an introvert, plus he's a troubled guy, he overthinks every situations and every little dramas is overreacted. \nAnyway recently he came to my country, moving in the capital, he wants to learn the language make money (my country pays more than his) but when he arrived he was so unprepared, he said he would learn the language before arriving or at last the basic and he did not. Which was extremely problematic because nobody speaks English here. He didn't look for a place to stay before arriving, so I had to host him a couple of days (which was fine I was happy to help) and spend money on a weekend with a girl he already tried and it ended up terrible. \nDuring this period, it was so tiring to help and talk to him, he didn't listen to my advice, he was living in the street for 2 weeks, the girl dumped him he was feeling depressed, called me to talk, so I can reassure him but I was so tired of his behaviour. He found a very good job right after and things started to get better. I found a job too and I was quite busy but he kept asking for attention, for long talks, for calls, he even asked about coming to visit me (I loved the idea, i just thought it would be better for him to save money since he just got the job). He got mad I refused, he said he felt further from me now we're in the same country. I didn't reply, I knew he wanted to start a fight. So from July and October we barely talked. One day he sent me a message saying he didn't feel comfortable with this friendship, he wanted to stop but still wishes me the best. After all I have done for him, I felt met down and used, but also relieved .... he tried to talk to me again  for new year's Eve but I  barely replied.",

      "description": "This is such a long weird story but i'll try to be short. \n\nI am fairly rich and I have some eccentric behaviours so my children are not quite \"designer babies\" but they are just about as designer as the technology today allows. I used a surrogate and with IVF I chose all their genders to be male, the eggs I chose were from a candidate with a 140 IQ and she came from money herself. I have no relationship with her and she was paid for her eggs and that's it. I have a girlfriend who is with me but does not take on any parental role in the children's life. I recognize it might be weird to raise a child as a single father willingly and it might cause a weird conversation with my 4 sons later in life. The surrogate stays on for 2 years after the child's birth to breast feed I currently have only 2 sons born 1 of them is on the way. Their ages are 3 and 1 with the other being born in early 2019 and another being born 2 years after that in 2021 if all things go to plan. I live a fairly simple life on a farm outside of my city, I eat food that I grow, I eat meat that I hunt, I drink water from my own source. I am very particular about germs and chemicals infecting my child both physically and mentally. What I consider a mental poison is music, TV, movies, news, pop culture any mainstream media. I have a couple nannies for help and we play with toys and stuff with them so it's not like they are in a prison it's just they don't consume mindless entertainment. They read books and play with toys and play with my dogs and other animals around the farm I have some donkeys. I am not sending them to public school or private school they will have a private tutor until 13 and they will be sent to a finishing school for high school probably a british boarding school, from there I hope they enter into a university. \n\nThat's basically how I am raising my child no mindless entertainment, natural foods, clean water, private education. \n\nI have not introduced any of my children to my family because before I even had children I suspected my parents were terrible parents but I gave them the benefit of the doubt because I had not been a parent so I didn't know what challenges raising a child brings. When I had my first son I realized just how bad my parents were. I became very angry and stopped speaking to them for about a year. My parents beat me, they fed me garbage food, they sent me off to shit schools and than when I got home they would sit me in front of a TV so I would leave them alone. They put me down constantly always telling me and my brother that we are useless and comparing us to other people. They would embarrass us in front of our friends and when we were at the park or something they would drive up and take us away for no reason they constantly said no to us hanging out with friends and I admit it probably did some lasting social damage to me because even now in my 30s I have no friends. I have a girlfriend who is nice but I feel I missed out on a lot of socializing when I was a kid. That to me sounds like a prison and it was life they didn't try to be good parents and they had no money to show for it. My sons are financially set for life my parents did nothing for me and I luckily \"made it\" in in life but my brother didn't he succumbed to drugs and overdosed at 25. My parents fucked up their 2 sons and i'm not going to allow them to influence my sons in any way. They are offended that I don't introduce them and quite frankly I likely never will even when they at the age where they are less impressionable. \n\nSo that's basically the gist of my story I can answer any questions to elaborate on anything. Am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "backstory, my ex (we'll call bitch, petty but i don't care), we hooked up for about 2 months before she dumps me and returns to her ex, which means i was played as a rebound. I'm a really nice person as a whole, and it's hard for people to really piss me off because i never take anyone's threats seriously but if you get on my nerves i become the most petty nightmare, and it never ends because you're officially put on the \"shit list\" for me.\n\nfor the year after the breakup i didn't talk to her, talk about her, do anything that has to do with anything remotely close to her... until a few weeks ago where she started talking about me behind my back.\n\ni tried messaging her, i was blocked... i messaged her best friend, she tells me that she's been spreading lies everywhere about the breakup and me lying about a few things... and thus, i got royally pissed.\n\nfirst, i established a close friendship with her best friend a her only ticked for a visa to a different country, and ended that friendship as her friend now hates her guts too.\n\nwent off to talk to another friend that she just made up with after causing her trouble too, now she broke that friendship too.\n\ni made a half-hour long video explaining everything including screenshots of texts and voice notes and call recordings and sent it to everyone that she knows and know her.\n\nthen i decided to fuck with her boyfriend's brain until he grew paranoid of her.\n\nher being an introvert means that she can't make friendships here, and me destroying whatever what's left of her friendships made me feel like an asshole, but a justified one.\n\nso, i leave the question to you, fellow redditors, am i an asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "Alright, so I'm not a very good writer so please forgive me for the terrible writing but the story goes pretty much like this: I've got this friend Nolan who's been a good friend of mine since 5th grade (in 8th now). We've hung out a lot and had multiple sleepovers and he's generally A great guy. About a year ago he came out as bi, if course no one likes him any else because of it but I feel like some things are weird now. Soon after coming out he left the school for some horrible disease I forget the name of but it's not infectious so there's no excuse there. Because of the fact he's been out if school we haven't seen much if each other since then but today he asked if I wanted to sleepover. I asked if we could maybe just hang out, he asked why, and I told him the truth. He then got really mad and kept calling me homophobic. I really hope we can still be friends but he's really mad. I'm really not sure, AITA? ",

This is my first ever written reddit post.\n\nSo me (22) M and her (19) F were talking last night and she told me her friend is coming back to town for Christmas. Me and her have been living together for 6 months now. Things have been good and we live together fine. \n\nNow the problem is her and her friend, which is a guy always seem to argue and not be friends all the time. They end up snap chatting eachother after and start talking again. On three separate occasions they have argued and didnt talk for weeks but made up after. They constantly bring stress on eachother and she always complains to me during the events. Last time they argued he was leaving town for school and they didnt talk since. After she told me he was coming back and they were friends again. I told her that I didnt wanna hear about him, and that she was putting herself in that situation to be upset again. She got upset and we didnt talk much at home. I am wondering if I took it too far by saying that. ",

      "description": "This is from a pretty long time ago lol but it's always played on my mind and I'm a fan of some anonymous judgment calls. It's also long-ish cos I can't tell stories in short sentences, sorry!\n\n\nSo I (F) was working retail in a team with 3 other guys, who I'm gonna call A, B and C for ease. I was fairly decent friends with all three of them but not drastically close - the kind of pals you get on with at work but never speak to outside of it, ya know?\n\n\nI hadn't been working with them that long (I was a talent transfer from another location, been with the company for years but recently moved to this particular store) when it became pretty obvious that A had a bit of a crush on me. I'm trying not to sound egotistical but he wasn't very subtle. He was a quiet, awkward kinda guy who never quite knew what to say or do, and the crush was blatantly obvious to me, and also to B and C. He was incredibly chatty, interested in my personal life, wanted to know all of my interests and tell me all about his, wanted to get coffee, that sort of thing. I also heard from the other guys that he'd mentioned wanting to take me on a date to them. \n\n\nI think I was pretty clear from the get-go that I wasn't interested. I made a point of saying in conversation that I wasn't interested in dating *anybody* right then cos my life wasnt in the right place for it. I also tried my best not to lead him on, didn't accept any invites to go out or anything that would give him false hope. But I also felt bad because we were working in close quarters all the time, so ignoring him would have been hurtful. I was friendly and spoke to him like a normal co-worker. I would say I treated him exactly the way I treated B and C, all the while being *very* clear that I was out of the dating pool.\n\n\nSo one evening, the four of us are at work after-hours doing a really menial task. The store was relocating to a new building so stock needed to be audited, so we knew exactly how much we had of everything. So we were literally just sat amongst stacks and stacks of stuff, counting and inputting data. By now we were all pretty close so it was pleasant, not the most fun task but we had good conversation. \n\n\nB was talking about a potential love interest in his life. It's important to note that B and C were both gay, so the three of us would chat about boys together sometimes. So B is telling us about a boy he likes and all 4 of us are pretty much just gossiping about a date he went on. Specifically he was talking about how, although he liked this boy, there was a particular trait the boy had that put him off entirely. A debate then ensued between us about whether it's valid to reject someone over one trait that you don't like. \n\n\nWe ended up having a conversation of, what's a deal breaker for you? What would make you definitely not date someone?\n\n\nMy answer was, I wouldn't date someone who smoked. I don't have any moral or self righteous issues with smoking, but my nose is very sensitive to the smell of cigarettes and it's one of those smells that bothers me so much it makes me physically heave. I physically couldn't be intimately close to someone who smelt of cigarette smoke without like, throwing up on their shoes or something. It's not a judgement of smokers or anything. My outlook is, you're an adult and you can smoke if you want, but I'm not gonna be able to kiss you for a while after. \n\n\nYou can probably see where this is going. A was a very, very heavy smoker. The kinda guy that can roll tobacco in two seconds flat and carries a tin of it at all times. I actually did know that about him too, but during this conversation I just didn't make the connection. I basically straight up said that I'd never date him cos he smokes, without realising I was saying it. It was not my intention, at all, to aim what I said at him or anything. It just came out when the guys asked me what my deal-breakers are, because it's true. \n\n\nBut as soon as I said it, it became blatantly obvious what I'd done. Both B and C turned to look at A with an \"oh-shit\" face, and A was super red and not looking at any of us. It dawned on me pretty fast, but I didn't know what to do or say, if I'd apologised would I have embarrassed him more? Considering he'd never explicitly told me about his crush, I felt like saying something would have been more humiliating for him. So I didn't say anything, pretended not to notice the reaction and changed the subject. \n\n\nA little while later, B and C pretty much chewed me out. Not in a bad way or anything, we had a good friendship and they were well intentioned, but they basically said I should have been more considerate of his feelings when I said that. I maintain that I didn't realise what I was doing when I said it, but they said it came off like I was rejecting A and I should have thought before I spoke. \n\nSo, AITA for not considering his feelings before I said what I did? And also, AITA for how I handled it after? Should I have apologised or acknowledged him?",

      "description": "I know how this sounds. I need some insight here, so work your magic please.\n\nThe general situation is we don't live together. He has his own flat and I live in a dormitory. So most of the time I will just stay at his place, dates will be at his place, most of our life as couple plays there.\n\nHere is the thing: it's HIS appartment. So if he decides to rudely kick me out, I will (saltily) accept that. He needs a fair amount of alone time, which is okay. If he is feeling down or sick or just wants me there, I will haul my pretty ass over there. I basically come and go as he likes it. It's his appartment and my opinion on any matter regarding that is just that, just my opinion (which doesn't feel nice, considering I spend so much time there).\n\nSo the past few days were challenging for me, to say the least. Save to say I haven't slept much either, but I still managed to be there for him, which he was grateful for (and I felt greatly appreciated, to be fair). Fast forward to today I had the most stressful day but I managed to get the thing done, so no more stress for just today.\n\nWhen I got home I just felt so TIRED. Yesterday and this morning my BF and I had talked about spending this evening together. So he has been looking forward to that. But beeing right next to my comfortable, warm bed, just waiting for me, the commute to his place didn't seem all that enticing. (And if I got there, i would have fallen asleep immediatly just the same.)\n\nI called him and told him that. He didn't seem to pleased, which was to be expected, so I said something along the lines of: \"I always roll with it when you need alone time, too!\" and he accused me of guild tripping me then and there in the middle of my sentence.\n\nI know guilt tripping is manipulative and I read up on it and that is apparently exacly what I did. I acted victimised and I said that (in the \"heat\" of the moment) to create emotional debt.\n\nI was and am quite offended at the accusation though, as I hate manipulative people and I couldn't stand to be like that.\n\nGive me your opinion!

I'm about 2 hours from the city so I catch public transport in, and so my friend offers to pick me up from the station to take me to the actual Cafe (10 minutes drive or so) so I don't have to walk there. She also picks my other friend up from somewhere else. We park, have lunch and come back and she has a ticket for parking in a no parking spot. It's over $200. I look at the sign and it clearly says no parking. She then says we have to split it 3 ways since we all used the car. I refused to pay anything towards it.\n\nShe hasn't spoken to me since and is adamant I was an asshole for not helping her pay it. Her reasoning is that we all took responsibility by accepting a lift from her, and that we all should have checked the sign. Since no one checked the sign, we're all at fault. My reasoning is that if I had have driven my own car I wouldn't have parked in a no parking spot. I also would have checked the sign and not expected anyone else to check it for me if I was the driver. I didn't check because I assumed that the driver would check before parking. \n\nI don't think I'm the asshole here but if I am then I'll help her pay it. ",

      "description": "Minor background: I’m having minor surgery in the beginning of January, and I was told by the surgeon that if I get sick (even a cold) within two weeks of the procedure , it would need to be rescheduled. The practice is busy enough that rescheduling could mean it being postponed for a few months, which would be a problem, due to cost and getting the sick-leave approved again.\n\nMy in-laws spent Christmas with us, and FIL showed up with a cold. I thought it’d be fine, we’re all adults and can mitigate germs spreading, right? Wrong. FIL apparently refuses to cough into his elbow and spent the weekend open mouth coughing on to every surface of the house - open silverware drawer and freshly washed dishes included. I had to bleach the kitchen multiple times because he kept wandering in to putter around (while coughing) while I was trying to cook. He’d also migrate around the living room, so there wasn’t a single couch cushion, armchair, or dining room chair that hadn’t been coughed on. Whenever we’d tell him to cough into his elbow, he’d give one obligatory cough into his fist, then revert back to the open mouth.\n\nI’m inclined to tell them that next time they visit, they need to stay in a hotel, because this was downright gross, and due to the disrespect for me needing to stay healthy. My partner thinks that that’s a drastic reaction. Am I overreacting?",

      "description": "My wife and I have been married for 10 years. We met in college, and she has been my best friend for almost 14 years now. She is beautiful, supportive, kind, classy, and all around amazing as a wife. \n\nWe went through a really rough patch about a year ago, mostly due to issues on my end. However, she told me she was pregnant. I was overjoyed. She told me she would only keep it if I was 100% in on the baby and the marriage, I said I was fully committed, and we kept the baby.\n\nAs time went on, I became increasingly insecure about whether or not the baby was mine. I did the math and thought it was unlikely it was mine, on top of having a gut feeling. I was internally agonizing over this for months, and after the baby was born, I could barely even hold him because I was so convinced he wasn't mine.\n\nI told my wife I wanted a paternity test. She was upset but told me to get one if it would ease my mind. The test comes back two weeks later and it says I am not the father.\n\nI'm absolutely livid. I had an out of body experience. I stormed into our house and just let loose. I felt like I couldn't stop myself, I was completely broken in that moment. I cried and screamed and asked her what I did to deserve this. I absolutely never laid a hand on her.\n\nThe whole time, she's just sitting on the couch, trying to comfort the baby. This made me even angrier for some reason, so I kicked her out right then and there. Told her to pack her bags and just get out.\n\nShe calls me the next day and tells me that I deserve to know that the baby is mine, and asks me to get a paternity test from another company. I figure I have nothing to lose at this point, and another paternity test can only help me in a divorce, so we get one at the company she suggested, and I sent a third to another company, just to be sure.\n\nI get the results from one and they say I am the baby's father. I wait a few days and don't say anything, then get the second set of results, also confirming I'm the father. I feel like the weight of the world has just been lifted off my shoulders and I can finally be the dad I want to be.\n\nI call my wife to give her the good news and she tells me she's not moving back in. She says she's disgusted with how I acted by asking for a paternity test and my reaction to the false one. She tells me I can come see my son, but she will be filing for divorce.\n\nI don't think my reaction was over the top for a man who thought he was being lied to about one of the most important things. I never showed any sort of violence and I was so emotionally broken at that point. I know how it must have looked to her, knowing that I was the father, but I don't think she's seeing it from my perspective. I'm planning on discussing it with her later and trying to convince her to work on it with me when I go see my son. AITA for reacting in this way to what I thought was an enormous deception?",

I'd hate to throw the relationship away over something like that, because otherwise, our sex life is great. \n\nMy girlfriend works retail and is on her feet all day. I was at her place one day, and she had to go to work (we are long distance, so I'm left to my own devices when she has to work). So there I was, at her place alone. I was pretty horny (not that it's super relevant, but there had been a bit of a dry spell due to a recent birth control method she got). My mind wandered over to her dirty clothes hamper and remember the sweaty socks she had in their from the day prior. I grabbed them, and they still reeked - it turned me on more than I'd like to admit. I jerked off and finished really quickly (but not into her socks), then put the socks back in.\n\nAm I an asshole for doing this? I know she would be really creeped out/disgusted if she knew, but there really is no harm at all here. ",

      "description": "**IMPORTANT:**\n\nToday, while I was hanging out after school with my friends, we were still near school (a place we always hang out). a girl (classmate) came to me and said ''your brother told me to tell you that he is waiting behind the school for you''. I swear I was about to get up when I realized that my brother can easily call me on the phone? I called my brother, he wasn't answering (he was at work). we asked the girl how the guy she saw looks like. She told me and everything she said was how my brother typically looks like. She also said that he was in his car. She said that she was leaving school and he called her. At that time I thought, maybe its him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends told me to go with all of us (we were 3+ that girl) it was weird situation, maybe it was my brother, it was just weird situation. I decided to go with them to see who that person was but there was no car anymore? I kept on calling my brother. Finally, my brother answered and he said that he never came to my school today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe girl was so sure that there was a guy searching for me because he gave her my name, class and he even mentioned the colour of my hair. The most suspicious is that the girl was my classmate too, I mean how did he pick my classmate ? how did he know she knows me and knows where I hang out? Also I am even suspicious of the girl, I mean why help him? but maybe because I am her classmate she helped him? I am confused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called my father to pick me up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, i thought **A LOT** about it and i started to get suspicious of:\n\n1: that girl that told me my brother was waiting for me. She can be a liar or messing with me, that psycho?\n\n2: It could be a guy i had arguments with. That guy is really a bully and all his friends are really absolutely thugs/bullies. They smoke, drink and do a lot of thinks. I will even expect them to kidnap people? he also asked me out but i rejected him in front of the whole school. He likes me since a long time but he is a trouble maker?\n\n3: my friends? i mean my best friends could do it but for no reason? a stupid prank? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad to be suspicious of them, really but i cant help but be suspicious. It was such a weird day, maybe they are all trying to harm me? my best friends would not but ? :(  i feel like an asshole when i get/think suspicious of them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? for being suspicious of them?\n\n**And Please if you think I am overreacting tell me, my heart was pounding the whole time, I am not that brave :(.**",

      "description": "The three of us have been friends for 10 years and they are both like my brothers. Let's call them X and Y.\n\nIn our University we have a way to graduate that you need to implement a project in a company and after a year you present the results to a committee of professors that evaluate if you are able to get the degree. The examination is very stressful and you need a public of at least 10 witnesses to be valid. So usually family and friends attend.\n\nA month ago Y's ceremony happened and I was there but there was no sign of X.\n\nI asked X what happened, because it's really strange that we all miss a big event like this. He said that he didn't wanted to go and I asked for his reasons.\n\nHe told me it was because we didn't attend at his ceremony last year.\n\n\\-Let's go back a year and a bit for a minute.\n\n2 months before X's ceremony he told us that he'll be telling us next week the day it'll happen. Me an Y waited for that.\n\nA week passed and we got no info. I didn't asked because I thought maybe he hadn't the info yet.\n\nMore weeks passed and his event was not in my mind at that moment and then I saw in Facebook some pictures of his ceremony. It didn't bother me, because I thought, well he had his reasons for not inviting me.\n\n\\-Coming back to the present in Y's graduation.\n\nWhen he told me that he resented for last year I got mad at him.\n\nMe and X discussed and we got to a dead point where he told me he DID told us the day and we didn't bother to attend, and I told him he DIDN'T told us and he didn't invite us formerly so we had no way to know.\n\nI quit the discussion and gave him the benefit of the doubt, but later I asked Y if he assisted X's ceremony and he told me that he was waiting for the info too and that his mom saw the photos on Facebook and asked him about why he didn't attended.\n\nI argued X a second time telling him how Y was also waiting for the invitation and the only response I got was \"If you both had care for me maybe you would have asked me in the following weeks for the info.\"\n\nI lost it at that moment and told him that was stupid for his part because he told us he was about to get the info and informed us in the following weeks.\n\nY is laid down dude and he didn't got angry to X for not going to his event, even though, it was really sad to see him waiting for X and he didn't appear. That's why I am mad to X because he got his ego before joining us.\n\nI know that in his point of view we failed him too, but resenting us 1 year and playing the resent card is not healthy for our friendship.\n\nMy wife's been telling me that i'm also putting my ego before and that I care more for an apology to Y than Y himself.\n\nIt's been a month from that and we haven't talked to much, only for recent important issues and I fear that our relationship will break if we just ignore the issue even more.\n\nI just need to know if AITA for expecting that apology to our friend.",

      "description": "I created a throwaway account to ask this question, since a recent interaction has made me question how I feel about this topic. I've included some back-story for reference, since I feel it's relevant. This is definitely a longer one, so see below for a TLDR if you prefer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Backstory:**\n\nI (25F) and my SO (25M), have been dating for 2 years, known each other for 8. We currently live together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth of us come from modest means; my parents were very successful, and his are comfortable, but struggled during the early parts of their careers. I'm aware that I've lived a life of privilege, and my parents raised me to be humble and grateful for my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI currently make more money in a more \"lucrative\" career than my SO; he is supportive and proud of me, and is breaking out in his own industry. I have no doubts he will be just as successful in terms of compensation, if not more so, than myself in the coming years. There have been a few instances in which I've covered something for him financially (car repairs, utilities, some groceries, etc) because things were tight, and we're a team. He'd do the same for me! But this isn't about him, it's about his parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUndoubtedly I come from a lifestyle much different than himself, and his parents. They have always embraced me like their own child; or as if I was already part of the family. They're lovely individuals. But I feel some resentment; maybe this is in my own head. His mother has made some remarks that have rubbed me the wrong way in regards to the car I used to drive, the clothes and purses I own, and my desire to go do things like travel with my SO. (Disclaimer: I don't hemorrhage money; I save for what luxuries I want, and I save for retirement and emergencies. I can treat myself reasonably!). The standard: \"Purses that expensive are ridiculous\" \"why would you waste your money on x\" etc, the usual. I've overheard him talking to his parents on speakerphone in the next room, and \"She needs to..\" or \"she needs to pay for x\", \"Why isn't she paying for x\", \"she has all this money why can't she do it \" have come up. My issue is with the \"need\" in that sentence; I help my SO because I WANT to and have the ability to do so. We're a team, as I said. My SO agrees this commentary is inappropriate, and of course hasn't told them I've helped him out. I, in those moments, was offended by the expectation I need to pay for something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The good part:**\n\nI recently received an offer for a new job, which I took happily as it's a fantastic opportunity for professional growth. I truly believe this job will change the entire trajectory of my career. Bonus: it effectively doubles my salary. My SO is thrilled for me and what this means for my career, and our future together. We have a fantastic relationship, and I'm so happy that I can jumpstart creating the foundation for a beautiful life together with this opportunity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut his mother will not stop hinting at the number. We've been avoiding answering the question like the plague. The coy remarks, prying for the information she really wanted; the salary. She finally asked me flat out \"How much money are you making?\" and I told her - flatly - that it isn't any of her business, and I would not be discussing my finances with her. I firmly believe it's my business only; but I discussed it with my SO since the nature of this job has me traveling frequently. I wanted his blessing that this opportunity was the right one for us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is completely bent out of shape that neither myself or my SO will divulge this information. My parents raised me that speaking about your compensation, or the things you have, is uncouth unless it's framed educationally. If a friend of mine (in the same industry) asked me if I thought an offer was on-par with our experience level or an industry average, I would absolutely discuss it with them. But asking for compensation as the means to a \"dick-measuring contest\" I feel is inappropriate; I wasn't raised to view the worth of others by  this. I would never look down upon someone for having less than I, so I won't judge another person with more. It isn't my place, and I value people by their character, not their wallet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI strongly feel that by telling her what I make, she will continue to throw it in my face and make hurtful commentary about what I should be doing with the money, or what I'm buying my SO. He completely supports me on this, as do my own parents. But his mother is vilifying me to his other family, and it has me questioning if I made the right decision by choosing to not discuss this with people who will hopefully one day be my family.  It's gotten through the grapevine that I'm \"a stuck up bitch\" for not wanting to discuss it with them, which is only adding to their resentment that I came from a different life than they did. I know it will turn into treating me like a cash cow as well, which isn't something I appreciate, but can see them doing.\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this is inappropriate? Am I wrong for feeling as if this has no value of discussing with her, or other family members prying?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Am I an asshole for not wanting to discuss my compensation with people, where the discussion adds no value? Only as a means of demeaning others or being nosey?",

      "description": "First preface, I'm completely biased against my dad.\n\nSecondly, context is key here:\n\nSo theres four of us children, all teens/early twenties, and my parents have been divorced for over 10 years for reasons related to my dad being a controlling ass.\n\nMy mother has had two long term relationships where we have met the boyfriend and is getting married in the summer to a nice man with a good job who she has dated for over 5 years.\n\nMy dad has dated at least 5 women that we met and moved in three of them without our approval. More recently, he got a girl pregnant after dating her for only a few months and moved her in, coupled with many lies along the way.\n\nMy father's actions have lead to my two older siblings and myself all moving out and essentially cutting him off. However, my little sister (15) still lives with him full time, along with my dads wife and baby, so we do have some contact for the purpose of her.\n\nMy dad is also taking his new family, along with my sister on vacation during our spring break. \n\nAnyway, enough back story, the current issue at hand:\n\nMy oldest sister attends university about three hours away and just had her birthday. On Monday, my mother decided that we should go visit her for the weekend, however I had work on Sunday, so we decided to just drive down on Saturday for a few hours. My mom put me in charge of informing the siblings and putting everything together as I am the only one who lives with her full time.\n\nTuesday, I make a group chat and inform everyone of the plans. \n\nToday, my little sister, E, texts me to say that she will not be able to come on Saturday as she has to 'get ready for and shop for' the vacation my dad is taking her on.\n\nKeep in mind, my dad does not have a full-time or real job and works a maximum of three days a week. So from my point of view he could've taken E shopping or whatever on literally any other day.\n\nDue to a recent fight between my dad and myself along with my older brother, I think that my dad must've convinced her that they HAVE to go on Saturday to spite us, something he has done before.\n\nAnyway, I want to call him out on him trying to keep E away from my siblings and I and just generally being an ass lately but there are some things holding me back:\n\n- it was somewhat late notice. I informed E on Tuesday about an event on Saturday \n\n- it may be E that doesn't want to go with us and would rather go shopping with our dad \n\nI dont really know because my overarching instincts tell me that this is all just my dad being a manipulative asshole.\n\n\nAnyway, WIBTA if I called my dad out on all of this?

      "description": "So I [M22] live with three other roommates, my gf [Sam], her sister [Elise], and our friend [Lana]. We all agreed when decided to live in a house together about a year ago that we would split communal cost like dish soap, toilet paper, bills, ect. \n\nWell Elise wanted to get new furniture when we first moved in, as she's big on interior decoration and artful things of that nature. So she bought her own couches that she arranged in the livingroom, tables, pictures, plants, ect. And she arranged these to her liking (asking us for input and if we were on board with how everything looked which we were. She is good at this and made the place look nice and the rest of us don't care as much about how spruced up the house is.)\n\nWell recently we had a leak from the washing machine, and instead of thinking to fix it we decided to try to find mats to put over the river of soapy water that ran to the drain in our basement. Well turns out that these mats would cost $120 and Elise wanted Sam and I to pay for them. I didn't object because I just didn't think about it at the time, but then I noticed that water was pooling and running off behind the washing machine as well, and I buckled down and took it apart to identify the problem. Now Sam and I have gotten into two arguments because I think we should've all split the mats (since the basement is communal and so is the washing machine) evenly like we agreed on. Money is no issue for any of us, the lowest wage earner in the house [Me] is $11.50/hr. Sam thinks I'm being ungrateful and discounting everything Elise has done like buying furniture and decorations for the house (which are all Elise's and she will be taking them with her when the lease is up.) And that we should just do it. \n\nI am glad and grateful that Elise lets us use her furniture, but I think that we don't owe her anything special since we didn't ask her to provide furniture. And if she hadn't insisted on getting her own for the living room to match her design taste then either Sam and I would have gotten furniture or we would have all split the cost of furniture and have people pay the rest for whatever things they wanted to take when the lease was up. \n\nMy big problem was being asked to pay $120 for mats that I know I won't use after we leave, and that wouldn't have fixed the leaking issue. Sam seems to think I have no appreciation for her sister, and that I have a problem contributing. I calmly reminded her that I have been happy to contribute my own personal things like solar lights or cord organizers for the household and have those be used by everyone (but they are mine and I'll take them when we leave), but that if it was like fixing a door or repairing a wall then I think we should split it evenly. She said she thinks I'm dead wrong and went to bed crying.\n\nWhere am I going wrong here, help me please?",

      "description": "Obligatory mobile formatting, Not doing a TLDR because it's a complicated situation. \n\nOkay so essentially I live with my SO in a very small apartment and I have begun getting frustrated lately with him. I work about 10 hour days with an hour drive between home and work. He doesn't work, gets financial assistance from his parents to cover his living expenses and is kind of a trust fund baby in that he never had to struggle, but his parents at least taught him the value of a dollar. He's holding out for a higher paying job or something that he thinks is worth the time he spent on his degree and I have supported him despite his parents often threatening not to support him financially anymore. I want him to find somewhere he enjoys working and wants to be there because he's not motivated to go otherwise. \n\nDespite it having almost been a year since we graduated, he still hasn't found a job. I'm not worried about it because I can cover our living expenses on my paychecks, even if his parents really do cut him of, but that would make paying of my own debt and student loans a lot more stressful and difficult. \n\nAnyways, I have recently realized that despite being gone about 12 hours a day, I come home to a house that looks exactly like it did when I left. This is only frustrating to me because he points out clutter or that we need to clean via text while I'm at work (What am I supposed to do about it??)\n\nI'll admit, our house is a bit of a mess. It's a very small space and we aren't the neatest people in the world. But honestly, when I get home I usually want to just watch TV or play a game after eating dinner because within 4 hours of getting home I need to go to bed. I'm not saying that I don't make a mess, because I do and  I'm really trying to become better about it, but is it too much to ask that he tidy up for 15 minutes while I'm at work?\n\nI'm not asking him to become our housemaid. I don't argue about it and I try not to let it bother me, but there's a lot of tasks that I feel I take care of because I'm a woman and he expects me to. The laundry only gets done on the weekends because he just wont do it, most of the time I'm the one who cooks, and if neither of us cooks I buy dinner, I tidy up on the weekends if it's starting to get overwhelming, though he has agreed that the bathroom is his responsibility (but cleaning is few and far between and I have a habit of washing the tub and tiles while I shower.)\n\nSo, I guess I just need to know, would I be the asshole if I got mad at him for not cleaning since it so clearly bothers him enough to tell me about it? Am I overreacting for being upset that he points out messes to me consistently but never cleans them himself? \n\n",

I often work about 20 hours a week for them for no pay although I do live at home.

I don't have the autonomy to decide what I want to do with my day off and tomorrow will be the same. I can't pursue hobbies in the evenings and I feel like my time is being robbed. \nAlso this commitment has meant that I commute over an hour to work so that I can come home most days and help out. \nI'm at my wits end.

      "description": "I am fairly new to Reddit and don't really know all the unofficial rules but here's an obligatory \"I'm on mobile sorry for the formatting\" warning.\n\nSome mildly important info - I do not have a driver's license, never driven above 20 mph and I only did that on well lit, still days last summer, I haven't driven or touched a wheel since then. This morning was very dark and drizzly where I live and only one windshield wiper works, the driver's side. \n\nMy sister asked me to grab the wheel. This isn't super uncommon but as I said, I couldn't see out of my side, I've never driven in the dark, the lines were worn down on the road and hard to see, and to top it off I still haven't driven since last year. I said okay (I couldn't really say no considering she took her hands of the wheel) but I swerved a little bit and didn't go in a straight line. She snapped at me and took the wheel for a sec and then gave it back, this had never happened for more than 6-7 seconds, so I wasn't doing to well and couldn't see what she was doing. \n\nYou want to know what she was doing you say?!? Well, she was changing her bra in the car and getting an inexperienced shitty driver to steer while she fixed a strap. I know from experience that a bra strap can be uncomfortable but I could've crashed the car!\n\nWe get to a red light and she STILL fiddles with her bra and it turns green. I look back and see a car coming towards us kinda fast so I yell her name. This is apparently the last straw and she starts yelling at me. I usually wouldn't mind but she looked away from the road to do this. It takes a lot to get me angry but she has been sooooo fucking bitchy to me this last week. \n\nI told her to please put her eyes back onto the road. I also told her while we were talking about her driving that she needs to stop texting and driving. A while ago we almost got in a wreck because she ran a red light due to texting. But she still fucking does it and I can't stop her. \n\nHer retort was so dumb I don't think it even counts as a comeback, she told me, that listening to a podcast, (something I do a lot in my free time) would be the same thing as texting and driving. So when I finally get my license I'd listen to podcasts, which is apparently the same as texting and driving, and I need to stop being a hypocrite.\n\nI will fully admit I act like a know it all. I know a lot of really random things. She told me that Im the smartest person in the whole god damn world and I of course know everything. I told her that I'm not the smartest person in the world but I was the smartest person in the car.\n\n(Then everyone in the entire parking lot stood up and clapped)\n\nI am damn proud of that comeback. After that lovely comment she told me she wouldn't drive me home (I ride the bus home a lot) and I'm gonna regret this. I don't regret this, she needed to hear how dangerous this was, but am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "My daughters are in a wedding of people they don't know as flower girls, even though both my wife and I don't want them to be. The reason for this is poor communication between my wife and her mother. The bride is the daughter of my MIL's friend and coworker, and the two of them came up with this idea and think it's a great idea. When given the chance to say no, my wife did this thing where all she does is express her reservations without actually saying no. Therefore, my MIL ran with the idea. So by the time I found out about it, it was a done deal as far as the people in the wedding were concerned.\n\nThis was months ago. Obviously, I could have said no, but it would have required a direct confrontation and cause tension between my wife and her mother. Part of me wanted to say no anyway. The whole situation makes me uncomfortable. I don't know anyone that would want strangers in their wedding, so I'm leery of these people that apparently do. I also feel like we're being taken advantage of. My daughters are essentially performing a modeling gig but receiving no compensation. In fact, we were expected to pay for their dresses (MIL took care of it). Lastly, and most or least importantly depending on whether you ask me or my wife, our alma mater is playing in a football game this weekend that I would only gladly miss for close friends and family. So, while I had plenty of reason to say no and would have been within my rights to do so when I first heard about all of this, I decided on balance, the best thing to do was to keep the peace. After all, it's only an hour on Friday night for the rehearsal and another couple of hours on a Saturday. Not that big of a deal.\n\nCut to this Monday, with the wedding a mere 5 days away, we get an invitation in the mail. Come to find out, the wedding is an hour and a half away. This is going to take away our entire Friday night and all of Saturday afternoon. Had I known this in the first place, I would have shut this whole thing down months ago.\n\nSo, WIBTA if, upon learning this new information, I cancelled the week of the wedding? On one hand, it's obviously wrong that we're just finding out about this. On the other, the poor communication is almost certainly not the bride's fault, and I feel like cancelling would cause her more stress than anyone.",

      "description": "So I'm travelling really far to a court case on Monday. Me and my brother are taking my ex step dad to trial for years of abuse. I've booked into a hotel with my husband as it's going to take too long to travel there and back each day. The town is where I grew up (the next town over is where the case is being heard). So I had a chat to my husband about how uncomfortable it's going to be for me to stay there (lived in the town ages 5-12). The court each day if it drags on will finish at 5pm and I have the whole night to do what I want. So I my husband suggested instead of sitting about in the hotel miserable and Mr overthinking and getting worked up about giving evidence etc why don't we find something to do.\n\nI remember sometimes in my childhood my mum taking me to the cinema so I googled it and fair enough they do have one in the town. My husband says: \"oh we didn't make captain marvel yet, let's go straight away after to see that!\".\nI agreed that it would be fun and slotted that into my brain calendar.\n\nso my friend came over today to support me and talk to me about how I was feeling. I mentioned that I was doing ok, and I've set some activities to do after the trial. I mentioned that I was going to the cinema afterwards. She got slightly annoyed, almost offended. She says that making these plans were \"below the belt\" and \"other people other than you will be experiencing trauma\" (my brother???) so I was to think about that before \"galavanting\" off to the cinema on a date with my husband like a \"holiday\".\n\nIs she is talking about my step dad's family ??\nMy brother?? \nThe step dad?? \n\n\nsurely she doesn't expect me to just sit and be miserable after experiencing trauma like that in a hotel room?? \n\nTell me? Am I being insensitive?\n\n",

      "description": "This is eating me up. About 3 weeks ago, I suggested I got out of town with my SO and my friend to celebrate as there isn’t much to do in our city. My friend was ecstatic and they said they would immediately start research. A few days passed and I heard nothing, so I listed a few cities. The only input I got was “no beach”. A few more days went by and I was researching more on the day after Christmas and texted them and they said “Yeah, choices are hard.” That apparently lit a fire under their ass and they started research themselves - and I continued. We decided on a city about a 3 hour drive that had free outdoor events and fireworks. The only issue is we have a dog...and our dogs daycare is closed, the only family we have lives in a 1.5 hour trip one way south of the direction we’re going, and do not have anyone near who can check on him while we go. I however feel like I made it clear that the dog had to come with us or something and they started to get mad about that and cancelled the whole trip even though we had a pet friendly hotel with a downtown view ready. They said he’s the best dog ever but he’s just going to be in the car for 3 hours, and left in a strange hotel. He’s not their dog to worry about, he travels constantly, and I’m the one who invited them to our plans. This was all my planning, my car, my paying etc. They also asked if my SO was coming, like he would stay behind on NYE/NYD to watch the dog for us.  The whole thing just put a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nSo the following day we discuss again and there are some events around our city that are astronomically expensive I feel like for it to be meh and no real food or fireworks. They wanted to go to these events and I said no, because I don’t want to pay that money for something like that in my own city. We looked around for free events before realizing that we had been invited to a massive house party by my SOs fraternity brothers. Kegs, fireworks, beer pong, a real throwback ha. They are friends with a few of them so I sent them the info and they responded with “I’m not really impressed by them and I don’t want to ring in the New Year with a bunch of strangers so I’m going to skip out”. I didn’t respond for awhile and they clarified that they didn’t mean it in a mean way, but they’re just socially uncomfortable so I responded by letting them know again they know people there, I don’t know anyone either, it’s be strangers if we did anything else and I wasn’t gonna let them talk themselves out of New Years and they’re an awesome person. I even said we could drive separately and you could leave whenever, or we could spend some time there and at a free event too. It’s been over 24 hours and no response. \n\nI know they’re going through some stuff right now, and I feel like I tried to be supportive but I really feel like a dick because I invited them along and it’s all fallen through. AITA? \n",

      "description": "Yikes. I'm scared to write this because I truly don't know if I'm the asshole or not. \n\nThis is a story about my last relationship. And I'm absolutely over it but I still think about it sometimes and it bothers me so I'm here to talk about it. I want to learn from it for future relationships. \n\nMe and my girlfriend we're 20 at the time. And we had been together for about 6 months. We had just gone long distance for the summer because she was working far away. First half of the summer went fine. We video called when we got the chance (internet wasn't great there) and planned a trip for me to meet her for a weekend, which went well. It was after the trip that things started to go downhill. I stopped feeling the love. She wasn't making as much time to call me as she was before. But at the same time she told me she was going out drinking with her work friends. I don't really have a problem with that I just asked her to please be safe as she wasn't a drinker before. It's just weird that she had time to party but not time to call me. \n\nBut now we're going full weeks without talking. Texting, yes, but I hate texting and need real face to face time. So I ask her often to call and she usually says she's tired or wants to go out with her friends, or there are people around (which I get, we were both very private people and I didn't like having intimate conversations w/ her  in front of people either). But the frustration is building at this point and I want to talk to my girlfriend. One instance that I remember in particular is when I wanted to call it had been forever since we talked and she said there were people around. I made the suggestion that she could step out side and sit in her car and get some privacy that way ( she lived in dorms, basically). She said that's weird. I said I don't think it's that wierd and that I would do it, but she wouldn't. I let it go.\n\n\nAll of this came to a head a couple times when I finally got her on the phone and told her how it was making me feel for her not to want to call me. She would cry and say she was sorry and tell me she loved me and I would break and say it's ok and we would just be sad together for a but and hang up. But things never changed. I got pretty insecure. And I told her that on occasion that I didn't feel the love and she would always apologize and say she would change things but never did. I still kinda feel like it's my fault for being insecure but it also makes me angry when I think about her apparent refusal to make time for me. IDK what to think. \n\n Eventually she was set to come back home and I wanted to make plans to see her when she got back and she said something that was really weird to me. She said she probably wouldn't see me for a bit when she got back because she wanted to see all her friends first.  And I don't mean that day I mean for a few days she said she wouldn't see me. At this point I was pretty much starting to check out of the relationship so I called her one day and ended it. She took it well and said if I didn't love her anymore that it was ok. She then said she still loved me and probably wouldn't talk to me for a looong time as she got over it. And that was that. \n\nSo my question is: am I the asshole for expecting her to make ways to talk to me? Was I asking her too much when I asked her to sit in her car so we should talk? Or for thinking she should want to see me asap when she got back? I know I was being insecure and I'm working on that but was I the asshole for putting that on her? ",

      "title": "AITA For being upset that my sister lets her boyfriend come over with very short notice?",
      "description": "I [18F] am starting to get tired of my older sister’s [F21] boyfriend coming over on very short notice. He will just text her that he’s on his way, or show up unannounced. Often times it’s after work or late at night, so I have long since rubbed my makeup off and gotten pjs on. He will sometimes stay all the way up to midnight and I feel like I need to hide in my room if I am not decent enough. \n\nSome background about the situation: My older sister and I have been very close our whole lives.  Growing up I never felt like I NEEDED friends because I would just go home and play with my older sister. Now that she has a boyfriend, I tend to feel jealous but I try to hide this to the best of my ability. I have gone out of my way to make friends with her boyfriend so that the 3 of us can hang out. He’s a cool guy, and I’d consider him my friend. Nonetheless I always feel hurt that she prioritizes him over me. I know that’s normal, but it hurts. We really don’t spend as much time together, and it seems like she’s changing as a person too quickly for me to bear.\n\nTonight in particular hurt. My sister got off of work at 6pm from her first day at a new job, and I was very glad to see her. I was feeling nauseated and wanted to lay down upstairs for a bit until the feeling went away. I was already anticipating what we could do together later that night.\n\nJust a couple minutes later she comes upstairs and asks me “Hey, can my boyfriend come over?” I’m surprised, and begin to protest, especially because I am feeling so low and don’t want her boyfriend to see me in this state. I express my concerns and feelings to her, but it doesn’t matter, because she just tells me “he’s already on his way.” \n\nI told her that I would prefer that we spent some time together, but then she uses the excuse that she has a lot of homework to do. She told me that she’d just talk to him for a little while and then ask him to leave so she can do her homework. Fast forward to 3 hours later and I still here them laughing and him playing guitar and singing downstairs. I am currently hiding upstairs still, trying not to lose my dinner, and I’m wondering if my sister lied to me in order for me to say yes. I’m angry and lonely and I wish that she wouldn’t use the homework excuse to not hang out with me, but then proceed to hang out with her boyfriend for 3 hours. \n\nMy older sister is drifting away from my family and seems to try and get out of the house with any excuse she can. It’s mostly due to tension between her and my parents, but I feel like it is starting to include me too. I am afraid that if I confront her she will move out and never look back. I just try to not rock the boat in hopes that we can keep our relationship.\n\nSo reddit, please answer me: AITA for having these feelings? I feel like I might be a bit immature. Please give me advice on what to do next that won’t destroy our relationship. I don’t want to lose my best friend! ",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I live in different cities, and we see each other during weekends, vacations and national holidays. She comes to my place every other time, and I go to hers every other.\n\nI love her very much, but holy *hell* the state of her apartment makes my skin crawl. She's very good at keeping the apartment clean, it's not a sanitation problem at all. However, the state of *disrepair* the apartment is in is awful.\n\nShe doesn't have a functioning shower or bath, what she has instead is a bucket and ladle we're supposed to douse ourselves with. The bathroom door doesn't lock, and she told me not to even close the bedroom door or it'll get jammed. The toilet seat is misaligned from the bowl. The towel hooks came off the door, so we just drape the towels over the door itself. The wallpaper is coming off in a few places, and so is the floor. The phone service she pays for isn't wired in, and she hasn't told the ISP.\n\nSeveral of the windows in the apartment do not fully close, and during windy winter days, it creates a huge draft throughout the house. One of the window panes is cracked. Water comes out of the side of the kitchen faucet in addition to where it's supposed to come out. One of her clothes drawers doesn't close, and it's always halfway out. Her couch wobbles.\n\nI've told her several times to get these kinds of things fixed, but she merely shrugs and says they don't bother her. However, this kind of thing bothers me immensely. I fully recognize it's not my apartment and I don't live there, but still, it's not like this doesn't affect me at all.\n\nThe last time I was there, I came down on her pretty hard after I scraped my toe with the bath bucket. I basically demanded she fix her apartment, that it's ridiculous that we bathe with a bucket in the middle of a modern city, that it's stupid that almost everything in her apartment is broken in its own special way and she just sits there like a happy camper. She said she'll talk to the landlord and fix things she can, but I kind of already know she won't.\n\nAm I the asshole? Did I cross a line?",

      "description": "I had this friend, we met in nursery school when we were three and then proceeded to go to the same primary school and high school. It was when we got into high school we became very close friends. We enjoyed the same music and films, we would go on  trips to get her and we went to concerts together.\nThe problem was with her jealous streak. I'm not a jealous person and I enjoyed hearing stories about trip she had with other people. I first noticed this steak when I become friendly with a new girl when we were 14. At first we would all hang out together but eventually, from no where she decided that she hated this new girl, which made matters awkward but I dealt with it because I wanted to be friends with them both.\nWe then both moved onto sixth form colleges which were different sides of town, we managed to still keep in contact. She made new friends who I was eager to meet and vice versa. I introduced her to two of my friends. The guy she got on with, but the girl she adapted an instant dislike. I didn't think anything of it because we can't like everyone in the world, but I thought it was unfair she didn't give her a chance. \nWhile I was at college I was give an opportunity to work in America, so I ceased this opportunity and picked up a part time job to earn some cash for while I was out there. Because she couldn't afford this trip I was doing she would shut me down whenever I mentioned anything to do with it, which in turn stopped me talking to other friends about it because I felt as if I was showing off.\nWhile I was over in America I had an hour every evening to Skype home and talk to my parents and friends. I would message my friends to see who was free however she never wanted to know and was quite rude to me a few times. 11 weeks pass and I hadn't spoken to her at all except from the usual 'hi how are you?' as she would answer with one word and try to shut down the conversation. \nFast forward 3 years and I get in a relationship. My friend met my girlfriend and they got along which was great. However my girlfriend said she got weird vibes from her if I left the room.\nThis friend of mine started getting insanely jealous of the time my girlfriend and I spent together, I always invited her out with us but understood if she didn't want to feel like a third wheel. I started inviting other friends out with us so this wouldn't be the case. \nSo recently a friend of ours got into a relationship with a guy who the jealous friend already knew. She said he's not nice and warned the girl getting into the relationship with Him about him. So this girl didn't take the advice and the jealous friend got really uptight about it. So I tried to explain it was nice you warned her however it was advice and sadly she didn't take it, but that wasn't anything personal.\nTrying to hang out with my friends became insanely hard as we had to work everything around her. If we invited her and she was busy she would get mad if we all still hung out. So in the end we decided to just do something even though she was busy and she's ignored us all since.\nI guess I probably done things wrong that I can't pinpoint none of us are perfect! I suppose I feel bad as we've known eachother so long.\n\n\nTLDR; I had this friend who would dislike most of my friends I introduced her too. She would get jealous of things I would do. She didn't like if our friend group hung out if she was busy. We have now basically ghosted eachother.  ",

I’m on strong painkillers, which have side effects that make me very drowsy.\nI’m also dealing with a number of mental health issues, one of which is anxiety about whether or not I deserve help/special treatment (this is relevant)\nSo last week, I had very bad cramps. They were so bad that while I was in school, I was curled up on the floor of the common room unable to move. I end up having to miss a mandatory assembly because I can’t move. My teacher is an amazing woman and is completely understanding when the situation is explained to her.\nI end up missing two assemblies, but that was last week, and I assume the situation is over.\nFast forward to today, and I’m having a really bad day mentally. I’m exhausted, and extremely self loathing, and I’m contemplating skipping lunch (also mandatory)\nI skipped lunch every day last week, which has resulted in teachers monitoring who goes to lunch.\nI tell my friend I don’t think I can go to lunch (I have an issue with food, and anxiety around people eating). She is usually very understanding with my mental and physical limitations, so I assumed she’d be okay with it.\nInstead, she rolled her eyes and said ‘oh yeah, like you skipped assembly last week’.\nI was rather taken aback, but I reminded her that I skipped because I couldn’t move.\nShe said ‘yes you could have, it wasn’t your legs, was it?’\nAt this point I’m starting to freak out internally. I’m thinking, if she (my best friend) doesn’t believe me when I say I can’t do something due to a physical limitation, what does everyone else think? I’m getting very anxious, and I go on the defensive.\nWe have an argument, and I say that I think she’s being very insensitive to my situation-I don’t enjoy having to miss out on things because of my period, especially since it’s for a month every week (I miss out on good stuff as well, I often spend whole days in bed when I can’t move)\nShe takes offence to this, and tells me about all the times she’s supported me with my mental health issues (which she has, brilliantly) and how ungrateful I’m being.\nI tell her that I’m extremely grateful for what she’s done for me, and I end up apologising for calling her insensitive. \nShe apologises too, but begrudgingly, and I can tell she doesn’t understand why I’m upset, but I don’t dare try to explain for fear she’ll get mad again.\nI know I should have handled the situation better, but it’s hard to deal with when I’m already dealing with a horrible, depressed day.\nShould I have kept quiet about her original comment?

      "description": "Hello everyone, I [21M] just issued an ultimatum to my girlfriend [22], Maria. We have been dating for just over three months and have been struggling to get over one obstacle; one of her exes, Sam. Please let me know if I am the asshole for how I handled this.\n\nBackstory of the ex:\nMy girlfriend dated Sam for just over two years and they ended up breaking up because he cheated on her three times. He cheated by sexting and dating other women. There was never really a period where they did not talk after their breakup (1.5 weeks) and they still keep in-touch almost daily. Before we dated or she knew I was interested in her, she bragged about him in passing. Once we were dating, she mentioned she was completely ready to marry Sam at one point. \n\nRecent events:\nMy girlfriend has done a few things that I see as possible red flags. The first thing that comes to mind is when she saw one of my female friends, Elaine, message me on Snapchat asking to get some Taco Bell (the messages from her kind of gave off booty call vibes). Maria asked about who it was and I told her; the Elaine was one of my exes, whom I did not talk to often. Maria requested that I stop talking to Elaine and even called up a friend to tag-team me on the idea of cutting-ties. I had dated Elaine for a year in high school and have known her for six years. I understood how this could be threatening to Maria and decided to cut relations with Elaine. Fast forward a few weeks and I ask if Maria still talks with any of her exes (she had previously mentioned she had four exes). She says she no longer talks to any of her exes and lists off three people. This caught my attention because she had previously stated she had four exes. I had noticed she exchanged a lot of messages with a guy named Sam and I decided to ask about him. He was an ex and she had lied to me about keeping in contact with him. Since then, I have been quite uncomfortable with them keeping in contact because of how she made me cut ties with Elaine and lied to me about Sam. I have been testing the waters for about two months to see if I would be okay with her contacting Sam, but I am not. I just issued an ultimatum: she must cut contact with Sam, and if she does not, I will breakup with her. \n\nAITA for issuing this ultimatum?",

I cant really get another full time job if im going to just dip in 3 months to go to a trucker school in Ohio, so i applied several places, and a group called Volunteer Palestine gave me an interview and liked me, and they would be willing to take me for the two months that i need to be there, but there is a 2000$ fee (Covers housing, 3 meals a day, insurance, and any potential medical stuff). I can raise some of the funds myself, by taking more days delivering pizza, and by selling my plasma, but i decided to start a Gofundme to help raise some of the funds, and posted it to my facebook. My mother and father are absolutely LIVID that i would do this, calling me selfish and saying that Gofundme is for people who lost there homes and need medical treatment, not for \"some boy who didnt save his money for a trip\". So its got me thinking, am i the asshole for using GoFundMe to raise funds to volunteer in Palestine?",

I always credit the creator (if possible). A good few of them have hit the front page. And while this is obviously a popularity spike for the person who appears in the gif, it also necessarily generates the kind of attention that a person might not want (like, not everyone wants to go viral, ya know?). I haven't had any complaints thus far, and one person did thank me for the boost, I still have very mixed feelings about the ethics of this practice.

So they wouldn’t have to pay for long term parking for 2 weeks while he and his girlfriend were on vacation. \n\nThe day we drove them down, my husband and I had made plans to visit a store near the airport after dropping them off. We made this plan based on the time they gave us as a departure. They ended up showing up about an hour late without even warning us they would be so by the time we dropped them off the store which closes at 9pm was closed. We didn’t get home until nearly midnight instead of 10 or so as we should have. \n\nWhen we dropped them, (on a Sunday) they said we’ll see you two weeks from today. \n\nSo we went about our day today (Saturday the 30th) and had plans to get up early tomorrow to go to said store we missed because of their bad planning and timing on drop off. This morning we got what we assumed was the check in text to make sure day ahead things were on schedule “you still picking us up?” \n\nWe confirmed and went about our day. \n\nWe then get a text. \n\n“We just landed”  at 4:00 \n\n\nThere was no “we just boarded” which would have fixed the initial fuck up of telling us the wrong day. \n\nSo husband and I had to drop all our plans and up and leave. \n\nOh, and the guys car is not starting.

      "description": "I've been playing videogames with my family every night for a couple years now, and it's been a great way to bring my family together. About 3 months ago, my little brother [13] made a joke at my expense and we all had a great laugh about it. Something clicked in his mind that this was finally the way for people to laugh at the jokes he makes, which admittedly usually fall flat. \n\nFor the past 3 months, every day, it's been joke after joke, and they've gotten meaner and meaner. Personal subjects he should only know as a brother, things that I find deeply offensive. I've talked to my Dad about it, but he says that he doesn't mean any harm and that I should laugh along, because he doesn't get much opportunities like this at school.\n\nHe has a pretty heavy speech disorder which has lead to some underdeveloped social and learning schools by the way school has treated him. He does not, however, have any specific disorder related to his actual mental state or demeanor. He thinks exactly like everyone else does.\n\nMy Dad's been laughing at these jokes as well, which I could understand as encouragement, after 3 months it's getting harder and harder to see as anything other than disgustingly cathartic to him. \n\nIt's been like this every day. For 3 fucking months. \n\nAnd it's getting really hard to feel any enjoyment when I'm at home, because I feel like I'm not welcome in my own house. I have a year and a half until I graduate high school and I can move out. I don't think I can wait that long, spending my time with the one brother I have who treats me with any kind of kindness.\n\nWhenever he makes a joke that doesn't sit well with me, I've told him, but he'll just say \"Yeah alright, sorry\" and then do it again ten minutes later. Last night he made a joke about my sexuality, which got a humiliating chuckle out of my father, the first person I came out to. I wanted to scream, but didn't.\n\nI want to pause the game next time, and fucking demand that he stops and everyone treat me with a little more respect, but I'm worried that I'll be being a dick for yelling at my brother, because this might be a coping mechanism for him.\n\nI also might be making too much of a deal about this, or it might be just be dismissed that way.\n\nWould I be an asshole for asserting myself and calling my little brother out on his bullshit?

      "description": "My friend “Tina” has been in an abusive relationship for years. It started out as emotional abuse, but escalated to physical over the past year. Her boyfriend “Todd” uses drugs (mostly crack). I’m tired of trying to help her when she doesn’t seem to get out of this relationship. \n\nIt wasn’t always like this. I’ve known Tina since we were kids. Her dad was abusive to her older brother, but as far as I know, not directly to her. She has always had issues related to this troubled upbringing, but she used to see a therapist and was able to have a “normal” life. She had a decent job, was able to buy a house on her own, was in a healthy relationship, etc. \n\nShe had been with Todd about five years when he started using crack. Things went downhill quickly. She tried to get him to stop, but he either couldn’t or wouldn’t try. Then he started selling drugs and hanging out with other dealers and prostitutes. He thinks he’s this badass gangster, but he’s really just a little twerp trying to be cool. \n\nThis was when he started hitting her. He has spent all of her money. She refuses to have him arrested. I suspect that she’s started using drugs as well, but I don’t know that for sure.\n\nThis has been over the past year. I live in a different state now. I’ve gone to see her multiple times to try and pull her out of this. She kicks Todd out just to let him back in later in the same week. \n\nShe doesn’t even talk to me anymore. I get all the information about her from a mutual friend. But this mutual friend has basically given up on her (as just about everyone else has, including her mom), and I’m basically the only person left to support her. \n\nMy husband and I have built a nice life. We make a good income, and I just found out I’m pregnant. Not only am I tired of trying to help this person that just gets worse, I’m honestly wondering if it’s even safe for me to put myself in that environment. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling like I’ve had enough? Would I be the asshole if I pull the plug on this friendship? ",

She started off as innocent and sweet, but then turned sour.\n\nFirst off, she would be begging for emotional support, but not care about if any of her other friends needed help. Also, her jealousy issues are horrible. Whenever someone dates any of her ex’s, she would trash talk them or physically hurt them. I even believe she lies about half of the stuff she says just to get comfort.\n\nOnto the story. Her and I love the game Deltarune. You know how Noelle likes Susie, we were talking about it. I’m not a big fan of the ship, but whatever.\n\nAnn then asks me when I think they are I going to get together. I told her I had no idea, and didn’t really like the pairing. She kept asking me why, and I explained I don’t like seeing extremely sweet people with assholes, but wouldn’t care since it’s just a game.\n\nShe then continues to bother me about how I’m wrong for thinking that. I tried to explain that it wouldn’t work about in real life, and that people shouldn’t be with abusers.\n\nTo my surprise, she said they should, so that they can “teach” the abuser to be nice. I claimed that’s not how life works. And she was saying how it was obvious I’ve never dated. Well, none of relationships never work out and none of them have changed. Just saying.\n\nI said how my mom dated, but didn’t get to explain my story with her. She told me to stop. I was gunna say that despite my mom being nice to her ex, he cheated on her.\n\nThen, she started to ignore me. This was four days ago by the way. I’m thinking about not being friends with her if she keeps this us. \n\nHer best friend told me to give her a week since she was having family issues. Fair enough.\n\nNow, Ann calling me annoying.

      "description": "Awhile ago my somewhat wealthy grandma passed away and left everything to my parents. I knew this was going to happen, but my grandma always mentioned that me and my sibling would have something and not to worry, but she didn't want to decide how to split her inheritance between us all and thought it would be easiest if my dad decided. I was never worried about it cause my dad was never selfish and I assumed I would get a fair share.\n\n As much as I loved my grandma and didn't want her to pass it was always a relief to think about inheriting a little money to help maybe put a down payment on a house, pay off student loans or just have something for retirement( I have nothing cause I've been paycheck to paycheck my whole life). Finances have always been stressful for me having lived in the poverty line my whole adulthood.\n\nI was surprised to find out my dad wasn't going to share anything with me or my brother. He basically said we'd have to wait our turn(for him to die). I don't know if My grandma ever communicated to My dad that she intended for her grandkids to have a share, but she told us we'd have something. My dad now has a million in assets and I struggle to get by. I believe my dad has more than he needs to be comfortable, but he doesn't seem to think so. I feel like my parents are going to use all the money on gambling and vacations and we'll inherit almost nothing. Are they the asshole for not trying to help their kids out with the money that they have plenty of? Or am I the asshole for feeling entitled to some money?  I don't want to be mad at my parents, I love them. But I struggle so much and suffer from terrible depression largely due to my finances that it would make a gigantic difference to have just a little help. \n\nIf it matters I also helped my grandma a lot. I visited her every week and helped do a lot of chores she could no longer do. But I didn't do that cause I expected an inheritance I did it cause she needed the help and was so lonely.",

      "description": "Let me preface this by saying I love art. \n\nDrawing, painting, photography, film, I eat that shit up. I'm a Junior in highschool and one of my classes is studio arts 2D, which is just pretentious way to say painting and drawing class for those of you who didn't know.\n\nOur upcoming project is about building a solid portfolio to help prepare us if we decide to pursue art after graduation. All of the pieces we're making are going to follow a theme of our choice and by the end of it, you should have a good number of thoughtful, impressive pieces. Stressing over this project is putting a strain on my mental health. Funny enough, my art class is very cutthroat and my anxiety is going through the roof. What if I'm not good enough, y'know? \n\nAnyways, one of my close friends \"E\" is cashing in a favor I owe her, by asking me to \"help\" her with her project. The favor in question was paying for my breakfast when I had left my money at home. I promised to pay her back but she said it was no big deal so instead, I said I'd owe her one.\n\nAt first, I was fine with helping her but the real problems arose when she started manipulating me into giving her my original ideas and doing the work for her. Sayings such things as \"You're such a good friend, you'll do this one right?\" and \"You're so nice, do this one pleeeease?\". I want to help her. I want to see my friend improve at something we're both passionate about, but she's not putting in the effort and It's frustrating. \n\nShe asked me over to help her with the project and the whole time she sat on her bed scrolling through her phone while I sat at her desk, desperately trying to conjure up some ideas and sketch intense dance poses.\n\n( side note: the theme she's settled on was about the struggle of being a dancer, I think?? That was of her own thinking. Not quite sure on what she's going for)\n\nAfter a couple weeks of trying to manage my project, as well as hers, I told her that I couldn't do it anymore. I told her that I wanted to help her but If she just lets me do the project, it doesn't really depict her own process and progression as an artist. I tried to tell her as kindly as possible but she got upset.\n\nShe told me not to make promises I couldn't keep. And tried guilting me by saying she's going to fail art class and not be able to attend a top fine art university. She's been giving me the cold shoulder as of lately and It makes me feel bad. My intentions were to never upset her but maybe I did fall through with my promise? \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Ok so I made a friend this year who is in many of my classes, and he has been really good for a while. I decided to buy him a gift card for the holidays. Soon after that, he started bothering me and pissing me off in any way possible. He also thinks he is helping me but he makes 1 minute things take 5 minutes. An example of all my issues with him is that I was walking to class and I decided to walk slow so I wouldn’t have to talk to him. I then heard laughing then I looked behind me and HE WAS SHADOWING ME THE ENTIRE TIME! I was not laughing. He had followed me from my math class all the way to my next class. It feels like an anchor I have to carry around every day that I can’t get off. He doesn’t think that he’s bothering me, but he has no idea how I feel. Would I be TA if I decided not to give him the giftcard? He doesn’t know I will give him one and he likely won’t be giving me one either. ",

So last time I saw him, it ended in a fight (shocker; I know) and when I left, I told him he had two options\n\n1) I will stop seeing him, and communicating with him outside of obligingly things.\n\n2) we get professional help to fix what I kinda feel is too far gone.

My mom and I took him to the ER around 330/4 and found out after an IV of saline and CT scan  he was not only dehydrated but his lymph nodes were infected. The ER doctor explained it could be an ear infection that drained to his lymph node and caused the swelling but all of them are infected he's dehydrated his white blood cell count is elevated keep him home for a few days get him a check up with his doctor to make sure everything is going okay he's getting better.\nCool okay. Glad he's alright.\nIt's about 730 when we get out of the ER.

My younger brother got sick of it and made a scene, blaming my older brother for a lot of things and also causing a bit of a scene, to the point he's saying he feels ashamed of his family. He then left, leaving the rest of us sitting around awkwardly, until we finished dinner and went home. \n\nStuff like this happens everytime to the point it gives me anxiety to think about my birthday coming up because there's always tension and an inevitable argument. I do not enjoy spending my birthday sitting around in silent awkwardness while two of my relatives are making a scene. \n\nThis year I'm planning on spending my birthday like any other day. No party, no dinner, nothing. It's coming up in a few weeks so I mentioned as much which angered my younger brother. Apparently it's not normal and I should organize something.

      "description": "I am the youngest out of three sons, and we all are very close. My eldest brother has been a great role model and a super fun person to hang around. The middle brother however... is... not fun to be around at all. He is 20 years old, living at home with us, not going to college, has a very minimal job that he works random 6 hour shifts in every other day, and has no money. Last year he got super depressed over something that he took way out of proportion (won’t go into the details) but ever since then he’s been in some sort of child like state of mind. He pouts and moans when something goes wrong, every time we try to come to a compromise on something as small on like where we are going to go eat he thinks we all gang up on him and screams “WHY DO YOU ALL HATE ME?” or even worse will just yell “OK OK OK OK OK OK OK STOP YELLING AT ME” when he is the only one yelling. I honestly think whenever something happens to go slightly wrong for him he thinks that the world should feel pity and revolve around him, for example my oldest brother is in town and we all went on a lil roadtrip to a small town, while walking around town middle bro slipped on ice and scraped his knee, he spent the rest of the day moaning and using a miserable voice like he has the hardest life possible, which really brings everyone around him down. He is really depressed and has gotten help, went to therapy has meds etc, but I am honestly done feeling pity for him now. He constantly asks me to play video games with him and when I say no he’ll slowly stomp out of the room with this super sad face on, and I’ve stopped caring. \nI know this isn’t really a specific situation, but am I an asshole for just not wanting to be around him even though he’s my brother?",

      "description": "Ok, so I know that I am not entitled to anything, but please hear me out. First a little bit of background: I am a schoolteacher and we just got a new teacher in our grade level recently. My team and I have tried to make her feel welcomed and include her in everything we do. We share resources, materials, and advice. She’s always polite but answers in one or two words. \n\nLast week we had to be at a meeting in another campus but had to be at our school first. She doesn’t have a car, so she calls a family member to pick her up instead of riding with one of us. She’s not comfortable with us yet. That’s fine. I totally get it. We ask her to go to lunch with us, but she declined. She did, however, go to lunch with teachers from another school (where a relative of hers works). All right, that’s fine, I guess.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to this week. It is the 100th day of school and kids and teachers celebrate big by doing 100-related activities all day. This year, our administration decided to have a “team spirit” contest. Basically, each grade level dresses up and best one gets a prize. On Wednesday, our team leader asked us if we had any ideas. New teacher replies “Oh, I already made myself a T-shirt” (we know she owns a cricut because of FB but has never mentioned it to us directly). I about lost it. I’m so mad she didn’t even offer or tried to ask us anything. I am not saying I wanted a shirt for free or anything. We all would’ve paid her for her time and bought our own shirt, but she didn't say anything! So when I went to the store to get our stuff to dress up, I didn’t get anything for her. And now we are not winning “team spirit” because she’s the only one dressed differently. \n\nI feel I’m being petty, so I don’t wanna let it get to me, but we all are tired of trying to include her and her not reciprocating, so AITA?",

      "description": "Ok now for some context cause I know that sounds really bad right out of the gate. I’ve been in a Serious relationship with this girl for about a year and a half and I love her to death and she has had some past traumas which make sex very difficult for her which I fully understand. We have sex from time to time but every so often we will go a very long time without any physical intimacy and I start to get very frustrated. I’ll make an advance and it’ll get turned down and I just accept it and sometimes it can go on for a full month and it gets irritating sometimes. I’ve never really talked to her about how I get frustrated about it and do my best to hide how I feel about it but sometimes the lack of physical intimacy can make me feel a little unwanted or disliked if that makes sense. Just to be clear when I get turned down I don’t throw a hissy fit I just feel like I’m an asshole for getting frustrated when she docent want sex",

      "description": "Obviously in order to be a doctor, you have to be smart, you have to be convincted, study hard, and you also probably have to have a talent for the feild of science already, and you should be mentally stable, be able to perform well under stress. I mean getting into med school is not easy, and being a doctor sure as hell isn't a cake walk, extremely so depending on the feild. My roommate is none of those things. At all. He says he wants to be a pediatric surgeon.\n\nWe are both freshman. He got all C's through highschool, but says that it's just because he didn't try. Now in college he's saying he doesn't study or try because this is \"just the basic stuff\" and he will try harder once he gets to the advanced stuff. I'm a bio major, so right now our courses have a lot of crossover. He can't do the homework, but I refuse to help him with it because he doesn't pay attention in class and never studies, the college offers free tutors but he won't go. He flunked general chemistry first semester and still isn't taking it seriously this semester. \n\nHe has anxiety and depression and is very far from a mentally stable person. He's moody and says he gets panic attacks over small tests, again not a trait for a CHILD SURGEON. \n\nHe says he loves the feild, but he spends all of his time watching make up videos, he never ever seems interested in his studies in the slightest. \n\nThis semester, we learned that he is only taking 11 credits and working 10 hours as a cashier. He complains all the time about how busy he is none the less even though we know it's all bullshit. \n\nHis parents are from a culture that makes them want for him to be a doctor, his friends are all dumb so they encourage him with no thought behind it, the college only wants his money, I am the only person who I feel is being honest about what is extremely evident. This guy will never be a doctor, and pretending like he will be is just costing him hundreds of thousands of dollars and waisting his time, and I worry about what he will do when he comes to this realization.",

      "description": "Every year, my girlfriend and her friends participate in this big event at a gym, hosted by a hospital, to raise funds for cancer research. The participants ask their friends, family, and coworkers for donations to “sponsor” them as they cycle on a stationary cycle. She has asked me to donate as one of her sponsors.\n\nNow, I take issue with this for two reasons. First, I had a childhood friend who passed away from a very rare form of cancer called adrenocortical cancer. In his memory, I donate a substantial (to me, at least) amount to fund research into that particular form of cancer. Part of me feels like I already do enough charitable giving to not feel like a selfish asshole for the year. That’s my first complaint. \n\nSecond, I don’t want to donate because I flat out do not like her one friend who got her involved in this. In short, her friend is the most selfish, conceited, and overall worst person I’ve ever met in my life (and I’ve met several politicians and lawyers). The friend only participates in this one charitable event. I know this for a fact because every other weekend this girl is either drunk, or traveling on her fathers dime. Furthermore, this girl signs up all of her friends for this event, sits on the cycle for 10 minutes, and then asks other ppl to cycle for her. While other ppl cycle, she will loudly laugh about how she doesn’t want to cycle and jokes about tricking ppl into doing so for her. She is the type of girl who will say something bitchy, acknowledge that what she said was bitchy, and then be proud of how big of a bitch she is. \n\nSo, I don’t want to donate for two reasons. One, I think that I already do enough other charitable works (separate donations and my career requires I do X amount of “free work” for ppl a year), and two, I hate the person the got my gf involved in this charity.

      "description": "So basically what happened was tonight I stopped by my friend R’s house for a bit to buy a sack of weed. R and his wife have been good friends with me and my husband J for a few years now. We’ve been to their house many times, hung out with them and their kids, and gone on double dates. R has never been out of the way or inappropriate with me ever.\n\nJ was working late so tonight I went over alone to pick up as I have a million times. R is a heavy drinker but tonight he was fuckin plastered. I went in his house and we were talking quietly and making the transaction because his wife was in the other room asleep with the door open. When I turn around to grab my purse I feel him touch my butt. I turn around and I’m like “Wtf was that dude?!” \n\nHe was like “Omg I’m sorry I’m sorry idk what I was thinking. I’ve never done that before I’m so sorry!” I was like “Don’t do that shit, man!” And he was like “I’m so sorry I’ll never do that again. I’m just fucked up I’m so sorry!” \n\nTbh I’m pretty blunt and I definitely would have went off on him more if it would have made me super uncomfortable. It didn’t make me feel really upset or anything. Not because I have feelings for R or I liked it or anything. I love my husband and I have and wouldn’t ever cheat on him. It’s just because \n\nA: R was *super* wasted and I’ve never seen him be inappropriate before, AFAIK I’ve never even seen me check him out or anything and \n\nB: he didn’t rub my ass or linger or anything, it was really just a honk. Like I was just confused more than anything. It really just seemed like a super drunk dude acting without thinking?\n\nI’m just torn on whether or not I should tell my husband. R said “I’m really sorry I did that, if you tell J, I understand, I just feel bad I possibly caused a problem between us.” \n\nI just don’t feel like it’s a huge deal. I know R loves his wife and has never been weird with me or indicated he has feelings for me, it seems like he just made a mistake and immediately apologized. I don’t want to start problems with his wife, too and potentially end all of our friendships over something that was basically harmless. But I also don’t want to hide things from my husband.\n\nWIBTA if I don’t tell him? ",

      "description": "I was in a pretty dead-end job, and was actively searching for new work. A recruiter reached out to me, and told me about a position that was open at company number 1 that was looking for someone with my experience. The position was in the same field as my previous job, but I was willing to give it a shot, as the company seemed pretty cool, and I really needed to get out of what was at the time my current job. I went through multiple rounds of interviews, and did pretty dang well. It should be noted that this place was quite a ways away from my apartment, and commute by car would look like 2 hours worth of travel daily (unless an accident would occur on the freeway, a common occurrence in California).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile this was happening, but well into the process of interviewing for company number 1, I was contacted by a friend who told me they had an opening at the company he was working at, company number 2, for a position in a different field than the one I was in currently. I told him I was looking for work, and he gave my resume to the company to consider. I got an interview with that company, which was located in a city that was about a 30 min commute daily. I did well in the interview.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFast foward a couple days: I hear back from company number 1 saying they are offering me the job, and they give me a week to decide on whether or not to take the job. It's a reasonable offer, and one I would happily take, especially to get out of the job I had. I reached out to company 2, but they still were interviewing other people at the time and still were making decisions. At the end of the week, I decide to take the job at company number 1. While I would rather work at company number 2, I wasn't hearing back from anywhere else, and I needed to get out of the current job.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFast Forward another 2 weeks: I am starting my job at company number 2. The work is fine, the people are nice, and the company is a good environment. The commute, however, is miserable. I am doing my thing, then I hear back from company number 2, they are offering me the position with higher pay, but not by too much. I would rather be at company number 2. I decide to accept their offer. I meet with my manager at company number 1, and he is discussing with me and commenting how this is \"pretty bad\" that I accepted the offer, already had gone through on-boarding, and was now wanting to leave. They matched the salary offer from number 2, but I told him it was the commute that was the big deciding factor. He was pretty upset by it all, but I don't think he took it out in any sort of unreasonable way.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter all of this process, I do wonder, Am I the Asshole for leaving a company after only working there 1 week? I recognize this isn't normal or ideal in terms of company policy, but does that make me an asshole for doing it. If you do think so, I'd love to hear your advice at what I should have done. Thank you in advance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTl;dr: Needed to get out of job, got offered a job, took it, but am leaving after only working there a week to a new job because of commute. AITA?",

      "description": "I workout at Planet Fitness. I always start my night off by doing 45 minutes on the treadmill. About 15 minutes in a guy comes up on the treadmill right next to me. I was literally the only person on the treadmills at that time so there were at least 20 other treadmills available. Slightly annoying when this happens in general - but no big deal. As soon as he starts running though I keep getting hit with this really strong smell. It’s not body odor - I probably wouldn’t have noticed BO. I don’t smell cute when I workout. But it was like a cologne-y/incensy smell and it was STRONG. He smelled like he had doused himself with White Diamonds by Elizabeth Taylor and then went to mass in a Catholic Church before hitting the gym. I can’t imagine that anyone would put cologne on before going to the gym so all I can think is maybe it was his deodorant putting in overtime. I tried to put up with it for about another 10 minutes but after I hit 25 minutes I got sick of it. I kind of abruptly got up, cleaned the treadmill off &amp; immediately moved to a different treadmill in the row behind us. Should I feel bad about this? If it were any other situation (like work for example) and if both of us didn’t have headphones in, I might have politely said something But there’s no tactful way to tell a stranger they smell strongly. I also didn’t want to say anything because planet fitness has their no intimidation rule and I have no idea how this guy would react.

      "description": "I saw a cute girl and had mutual friends help me to talk to her. Eventually we talk for a but but ultimately she doesn't feel the same way I do. In all fairness, she'd just moved into the country and had only a handful of friends and was sad about leaving her friends in her home country. She might not want a boyfriend, probably just a friend is how I rationalized it. So I keep talking to her as a friend. The following conversations of me explaining how I'm stressed during those days was always met with flat out \"you have no reason to be upset\" responses. I told her my brother's leaving for the Army: \"It's not that bad.\"; Lot of college work: \"Stop worrying\"; etc. Its not like she was trying to tell me that I'll be fine in an encouraging way, she practically commanded me to stop complaining. Besides that, there are no other conversation starters that I could think of, very little mutual interests. I just didn't want to speak to her at all after that. She was just so detached. Then our mutual friends kept asking me why I stopped talking to her in the following months and that she doesnt know anyone so I should stay her friend. Am I the asshole??",

      "description": "AITA\n\nSo I matched with this girl on tinder, from her profile she seemed like a pretty fun person. She messaged me first, which doesn't happen often for me on tinder. She opened with a joke and we chatted a bit, just jokesy banter. So the tone of the conversation was pretty comical. Anyway I send her a message and she doesn't respond. A day or two go by and no reply. Usually I don't message again in that situation, I figure the ball is in the other persons court, I feel like I deserve more than having to convince a person to be interested, either they're into me or not, and I'm fine with both. But I really liked talking to this girl so I decided to message her again. I send what I belived to be a harmless little quip that fit into the previous jokesy conversation and the context that is tinder. I sent \"so you're not gona hit on me anymore? (Crying emoji)\" . The joke did not go over like I'd hoped. She answers \"What kind of guilt trip joke is this? Am I supposed to feel sorry and apologise?\" I was a bit surprised and explained that I just meant it as a joke, she understood but said she lost all interest to keep talking to me. Like I guess I can see where she is coming from, but I still kinda feel she blew this way out of proportion. In hindsight it's not a good joke, but did it really warrant that reaction AITA?",

      "description": "I work on a team for a semi-large computer networking firm. My team comprises of me and about 7 others including our boss. This team is one of the \"Upper\" management teams. All of us have masters in comp sci or computer engendering with my boss having his doctorate. We pretty much have final say in anything related to the network and oversee most of the workers and the day to day operation of the network. This is where Brian comes in.\n\nabout 3 months ago Brian was hired out of nowhere and brought onto the team. Quickly we found out that the kid was a fresh graduate from college with a bachelors in electrical engendering who was related to one of the owners. This already put him on the outs with us. Almost all of us had at least 4 years experience when we were hired or went through a rigor's hiring process. Outside of him needing his hand held for the first while or so, I tried to be optimistic and friendly with him. Tried is the key word.\n\nHe's gotten on almost everybody's nerves and has made sure to make himself the odd one out in every situation. He act's as if he's better than everyone else and makes you know that. This would be bad enough, but he quickly started to complain about how we talked too. In the office when it's just the team, we try to be casual with each other and most of us will swear or make \"inappropriate\" jokes. Well, soon after he was hired Brian went to our boss to try to get us \"reprimanded\" for, as he puts it, \"Inappropriate actions\". My boss pretty much told him to calm down but Brian has made it clear that he doesn't like it and we need to change. Whenever he hears us swear he gets very passive aggressive, making sure to \"fake swear\" with us (you know how like kids will?) and direct it towards the person he has a problem with.\n\nThere are multiple other problems with him as well like his immaturity and and weird views on the media but those are not my concern. Well, with everything that's been going on with him, me and my coworkers slowly decided to simply ignore him. When ever he would try to talk to us we would ignore him unless it was work related. We stopped eating with him, we stopped allowing him to join in on conversation with us, and we pretty much ignored him unless we needed to talk to him. Apparently this hit him hard. From what I understand he's called the heads crying about this multiple times and has complained to hr who refused to do anything. Along with this, without us constantly helping him he's taken a huge hit in performance. Apparently even though he's only been on a few months my boss says the heads are looking into terminating him due to his lackluster performance.\n\nI do feel a little bad here, we did pretty much stop associating with him abruptly and we are his coworkers. But he shouldn't have been hired here either and he's extremely pushy with his views so I don't know. No one on the team want's to talk about it so I'll just ask here, Are we the assholes here?",

      "description": "I was sitting my car this morning, after parking in a parking garage to eat my breakfast. I get to my work way early to take advantage of our in office gym. So there are plenty of spaces available, but I get to chose a prime spot since I get here so early. I watch another driver attempt to park between myself and another vehicle, and they chose to park elsewhere after a few attempts to get straight. I supposed because it was a tight spot between a column and a wall. I park by the wall, since it makes it easier to get in and out. They get out of their vehicle and are staring at me, they make a nervous smile and come to my window. \n\nI was a bit confused, but wanted to be nice nonetheless since I work with these people. She is pleasant and polite, of course I reciprocate. But, what she says bugs me. She says: “Can I ask you a favor, if you park here again in the future?” Which threw me off since I park in the same spot nearly everyday. \n\nShe proceeds as I continue to stare in confusion after uttering a questionable “Okay”. “Well, if you can try to park as close to the wall as possible, it would allow bigger vehicles like mine more room. That way it’s easier for us to get in and out.” Which sounds reasonable, so I say “I’m sorry, I didn’t intend to take up more room than I should. Am I not in my space?” Which she replies, “No, you are in the lines. Just that it would make it easier for me and other bigger trucks. You don’t need all this room. You can park closer to the wall.” This, to be honest, irritated me immensely. I did not argue, and I was not rude. I just said “Okay” as nicely as I could without giving away that this seemed “asshole-ish” to me. \n\nI feel as though this person was being the asshole, but I have come to learn that more often than not, I am the asshole. Help?\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not caring/doing anything when I was asked to give more room in my spot to the parking spot next to me in a parking garage, so SUVs can use space in my spot. ",

      "description": "Two years ago there was an incident where my wife became extremely physical during an argument. I don't want to go into the details because it was very violent. I know the subreddit rules say that I need to go into detail, so if that's a requirement, please reply to this post and I'll include the order of events.  \n\nAnyway .. I defended myself, and when it was finally over, she lost two of her fingers.\n\nHer left ring finger and her left pinky. The ER wasn't able to re-attach either finger.\n\nThat was obviously a horrific wakeup call for us. We worked hard not to let our fights escalate to that level ever again. She has turned he life around, which I know is extremely difficult for her. She diligently attends anger management even today. Our families are extremely supportive of us and are very proud of the fact that we have never ever gotten physically violent with one another after that night.\n\nMy problem is that I took her wedding ring from her after that night. I told her that when I gave it back to her, it meant that I was ready to fully trust her again. December 12th will be the 2-year anniversary of the night she lost her fingers and I believe that she is expecting her ring back that day. Problem is that I don't want to. I'm not ready.\n\nAnd this has me thinking... why am I not ready? It's not like I'm scared of her. It's not like I think she'll attack me again. I just don't want her wearing the ring. I don't want to go back to calling her my wife. She's spent the last 2 years trying to rebuild my trust and all I can think about is the fact that she should never wear this ring again.  \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I live in a dorm with 3 other guys. We have one bunk bed and 2 desks in 2 connected rooms and share a bathroom. I picked the roommate that sleeps below me, and the other 2 were randomly assigned to us. They’re nice enough, but not people i’ll probably stay in contact with. \n\nAnyways, our building supplies this awful toilet paper and I definitely think its worth it to buy 2 ply at target. Since we share the bathroom, we share the toilet paper. My roommates don’t really shop much off campus much so I would go buy it which didn’t really bother me.\n\nUntil I realized one of my roommates either takes massive shits or uses an absurd amount of TP each time he wipes. Last week, I asked the 2 that I was randomly assigned to if they’d be willing to pay for toilet paper, because me and the other roommate always bought it. They told me they didn’t want to spend the money and would rather just use the free stuff the building provides. They’ve had no problem using the stuff i’ve bought all year, but whatever. \n\nI bought more toilet paper and assumed they would pick up a roll at the front desk. Except they didn’t. After a week, I got annoyed enough to get a little petty. I got 2 rolls when I got back to the building this afternoon &amp; put them on the non-paying roommates desks, to which they were... not thrilled. They think i’m being unreasonable for having 2 rolls of toilet paper in the bathroom (they’re not on a roller or anything) and I think they can either chip in or not use my stuff. \n\nso... am I the asshole?\n\ntl;dr: roommates won’t pay for nicer toilet paper, but are mad that I want them to use the free stuff",

Small venue, nothing fancy. She had never heard of the guy until I mentioned that I wanted to go see him, and that tickets would be a great Christmas gift, it was cheap and something I really wanted. \n\nFast forward a couple weeks, she split up with me, and a couple days later asked for the tickets back because she wanted to sell them. I told her no because they were a gift, and I still planned on using them. She got mad, and it turned into a pretty big argument, that ended when I asked for one of her gifts back so I could return it and get my money back if she was going to sell the tickets. She didn’t like that idea, told me to keep them, and just go to the show. I made plans with a good friend of mine to go with me, and that was that.\n\nFast forward to today, she asked for just one of tickets back so she could go with some of her friends. Again I told her no that ticket was now being used, and she got mad which again turned into the same argument as before. I told her that if she wanted to go, that she would have to buy another ticket because I already gave it to my friend to go with me.\n\nAITA for not giving her at least her ticket back since she didn’t plan on using it until after I had promised it to a friend?

      "description": "I'd like to preface this by saying I would never justify the colonialist ideology. They viewed the natives of the lands they colonised as sub human, no sane person today could see that as ok.  \n \n\nThe thing is, in my essay on Shakespeare's, The Tempest, at no point did I mention that I didn't agree with the colonialist ideals the play reflected. This is because I thought my grader would just assume I didn't agree with them. Every time I mentioned an aspect of the colonial ideology I made sure to say it was an opinion of Shakespearean society. However, I did talk about it very objectively because I thought that's what you do in an essay.   \n \n\nI was marked down for demonstrating an, 'uneasy acceptance of the colonialist ideology,' to paraphrase my grader and, in their exact words, I went from, 'discussing the Elizabethan colonial ideals to sharing them.'   \n \n\nMy own grandfather is from a former French/British colony, I'd never justify the atrocities of the colonialists. Of course I was tempted to write things like, 'the portrayal of Caliban clearly reflected the ideology of those fucking colonialist bastards,' but I've always been told not to be emotive in an essay.   \n \n\nThe biggest reason I think I could be the asshole of the situation is a line I wrote in the essay; 'There was a growing fascination with the bizarre peoples who populated the new colonies.'   \n \n\nIn the context of the essay I was talking about the way the Elizabethan society viewed the native peoples and figured it was clear that this was their view and not mine.   \n \n\nTo put it simply I don't like the implication my grader has made, but I'm concerned that it's justified.   \n \n\nTL:DR Wrote an essay on the colonialist ideology in a Shakespeare play and got marked down for talking about it too objectively.   \n \n\nSorry for the rant-like nature of the post and my apologies if this doesn't fit the sub, just wanted to know if I'm up my own arse here.   \n ",

      "description": "I'm 15. On mobile, late at night.\n\nRecently my mom went through my phone while I was sleeping with a code I didnt know she knew. It was the PIN number I use at school so I dont know what I expected. She found some messages I didnt want or need her to see between my friends and I. She searched my gallery and uncovered a whole story of an ex I never told her. I got extremely angry and felt I had been violated. So I changed my password. All I did was add a 1, and it worked.\n\nWell not quite. Last night I got violently awoken at around 4:45 by a very angry woman demanding to see my put in my code. I told her no, I value and am entitled to privacy. Her response was. \"You're a teenager. You dont deserve privacy.\" I began to explain (at 4:45) that I am allowed to keep things private from others. She was not having it and responded with such phrases as, \"why do you need privacy,\" \"You arent entitled to Jack-shit if I dont say you are\" and my personal least favorite, \"You don't know a God-Damn thing about privacy enough to want or need it.\" \n\nI told her I refused to let her see anything until she gave me some aspects of privacy in my life. She agreed. I got scammed. She went through whatever she didnt see in the past week and a half and demanded to know my new passcode. This was about an hour later now and I was just done. I agreed and told her I added a 1. She told me privacy was nothing to me, and I dont deserve it with the comments and jokes i made to my friends (some contained rather inappropriate themes). \n\nSo AITI for changing my password to prevent further snooping?\n\nTL;DR: Mom snooped around last week, found interesting info. Went to do it again and was greeted by me having changed my passcode. She went apeshit and said I dont deserve privacy as a 15 year old boy.",

      "description": "Sorry this is really messy. I’ll try and condense as much as possible. \n\nMy girlfriend and I have a friend, we’ll call him Jim. Jim is older than us and recently divorced and since then has been having what can only be described as a mid-life crisis. We both know he’s been down and making bad decisions but we generally only hear about the bad by his housemate and when we see him he says life is good. Every time we see him we do try and get him to open up and make sure he’s okay. \n\nRecently he’s been hanging out with a much younger woman, a ‘model’ who “has a lot of issues” which, fine, who doesn’t?\n\n The issue is that a couple of weeks ago my girlfriend suddenly froze and silently showed me her phone and there was a message from Jim saying “can’t wait to rape you so bad”. I immediately took a picture of her phone and text Jim myself saying “what the fuck is this” and he was very apologetic (to me, weirdly, not my girlfriend) and said it was the girl he was with and that he was furious and she was drunk. We had a brief conversation where I basically let him know that if he wanted to associate with someone who would text that to one of his closest friends - under the guise of it being him - is a real dick person. He then sent me a bunch of messages about how sorry he was and how angry he was at the girl he was with. \n\nSince then, we’ve kind of distanced ourselves from him. She’s not replied to any of his messages and while  I’ve replied to a couple, it’s a very limited interaction. I do know he’s having a hard year or two though and I can’t help but feel bad when he sends texts that are obviously feelers to check were all still okay (group message). \n\nAm I the asshole for being annoyed at him? I know it wasn’t him who sent the message - so he said - but I don’t feel like it’s really our responsibility to condone the behaviour of someone he repeatedly defends. There have been a few instances with this girl that have left him in a really bad way but he refuses to acknowledge it because, frankly, she’s young and hot and I think he probably likes the attention.

      "description": "Backstory - quite frequently I sleep walk/talk and do things that are very absurd and make no sense because I’m asleep. To be fair I am seemingly awake, but after 8 years and many episodes of this my husband is fully aware. Normally we just laugh about it the next day when he tells me what has happened.\n\nSo the other day we went to a party and came home fairly drunk and I passed out on the couch. I woke up in my bed and came downstairs in the AM and my husband was PISSED at me. \n\nHe told me that he had tried to get me to come to bed and that I had yelled at him to “get the fucking kidney out of the fridge.” And gone back to sleep. He then tried again and I told him “YOU DO KNOW WHAT THE KIDNEY IS, GO GET IT!” The third time he tried I said to “JUST GO TO BED.” And whacked him hard with my arm. \n\nHe seemed mad and I said I was sorry, he said that I can’t hit him again and I’m still accountable for my actions when I’m drunk or asleep. \n\nThat’s fair, I should definitely not hit him, but I told him I cannot promise him it won’t happen again because I was ASLEEP and I can’t control the things that I do when I’m asleep and that maybe next time he should just leave me alone.\n\nHe continued to be angry at me for the rest of the day. I understand he’s going to react however he reacts, but he was acting like I punched him in the face in a drunken rage or something! I thought it was a bit unreasonable to let it drag on for the entire day when clearly it was a sleep incident that I can not control. \n\nIdk. AITA for not promising it won’t happen again? ",

      "description": "I \\[19F\\] am in a predicament with one of my best friends \\[19M\\]. He is currently seeing a lovely girl and won't stop telling me about it. I'm glad that he's happy, but it is nonstop. He sends me screenshots of the mushy texts he sends, tells me that he writes her erotic poetry, shows off the hickeys she gives him, and describes their hookups in grotesque detail. Not to mention that this girl is also my ex.\n\nShe and I never formally dated, but had a sort of \"situationship\" until this November. She told me that she didn't want anything serious with me, ever, and broke it off. The next day, she asked my friend out on a date. This friend of mine knew the whole history that I had with her and went anyway. They started hooking up frequently afterwards. I am never one to bite my tongue, so I told him that he'd hurt my feelings and going on a date with her was kind of a dick move. He said, \"Way to make everything about you.\" We moved on from it.\n\nAfter a few months, I started talking to this girl again and we repaired our friendship. We now text frequently, talk on the phone for an hour about once a week, and write each other letters every so often. I know that I will never have a relationship with her but I still harbor some romantic feelings. She doesn't make mention of my best friend often but said that she thinks that she'll start dating him seriously. \n\nTo be honest, I don't see any reason why they shouldn't. They're a fine (albeit strange) match and I like them both. They're going on a trip together next week, though, and he will not stop talking about it. His talk of her has only gotten more and more frequent and intolerable. I had a few drinks last night and I texted him to tell him that I still wasn't over her and it hurt me to hear about this relationship. Nevertheless, he persisted in sending me more screenshots of their texts and gushing about the trip.\n\nBoth parties are looking forward to talking to me about the trip and how it goes. I can understand from the girl's perspective--as far as she knows, I'm over her and we have always enjoyed gossiping and talking about our personal lives. I'm confused as to why my guy friend thinks this is okay, though. I'm getting more and more irritated with him.\n\nThis brings me to the question: AITA for telling him multiple times that hearing about this relationship hurts me (a.k.a. making everything about me?) And WIBTA for asking him to not tell me anything about the trip? I want to remain friendly with both parties, but I am going to lose my damn mind.",

      "description": "my (25m) gf (23f) got doagnosed with ptsd 2 yrs ago, we’ve been together a month under that. we used to be best friends and soo close and now she’s like a different person. I know what she went thru and it doesn’t seem that bad??? she had a couple abusive bfs and her mom used to hit her, but ive had abusive gfs and my gpa (I was raised by him, rents not in the picture) popped me on the jaw a couple times when I was in hs and im fine. its really weird too bc she’ll seem fine for a few days and then just have a meltdown over nothing and then we have a fight about it bc there’s no reason for her to be freaking out lol (it happens around friends sometimes and it’s really embarrassing) and then shes fine and happy for a couple days and it happens all over again. sometimes later she admits that she wasn’t actually upset about what she said she was upset about and it was something “ptsd related” and then I get madder and we fight again bc she’s lying to me about what’s actually wrong and that’s pretty manipulative imho, and she gets more upset and starts yelling about brain changes and other stuff that doesn’t make sense and how im not listening and then cries for like hours. I try not to give in to her attention grabbing bc she needs to grow up but fuck. she does kinda shitty things sometimes and told me she tries to keep her actions in check but doesn’t “have a lot of control over her perception of reality” right now or something. seems to me like just an excuse to be immature and throw temper tantrums over basic shit and get away with it. i love her and all but its honestly driving me away, seems like there’s always something wrong with her and its soo frustrating lol. I wish she’d just talk openly with me and actually be honest bc there IS something wrong with her that she needs to get fixed but it always ends up being confusion and fighting and im sick of her games. she just refuses to get over her shit and chooses to stew and bitch. I keep telling her to chill and stop thinking about it and watch some fuckin tv or something and she’ll try that then have yet another meltdown and makes all these excuses about how taking her mind off it somehow makes it worse lol? she couldn’t get therapy for a bit after diagnosis bc she was waiting for work benefits to kick in but she’s starting soon, and that also kinda seems suspicious? as soon as shes diagnosed with this very convenient thing where people let you do whatever you want without consequences she has to stop the thing thatll get her fixed?? she says all thats rly expensive but all she had to do was ask me for help and she didnt\n\nAITA for thinking either ptsd isn’t that fucking bad or my gfs just a brat? maybe both? I miss my girl but I feel like she just faked the beautiful, hilarious person she was when we started going out. im very hurt by all this.",

If you have a review you'd like me to post, say \"hey, can you write us a review on yelp/facebook/yellowpages/google/whatever. Thanks!\" I'm still not gonna do it probably, because I'm not actually shopping there, I just happen to be there, but I'll lie to placate you.

      "description": "First time making a post instead of commenting in this subreddit. So this is a little bit of a story so bear with me.\n\nI've been on dates but I've only dated two people for any length of time. The first guy was when I was a teenager and it was online. We did the normal long distance relationship thing, and met him in person twice. After meeting him I completely 100 percent lost interest and just stopped talking to him. We eventually got to the point where we started talking again and became friends, but still I felt he deserved to get a formal breakup. He was 16 and I was 17, so I sort of chalked it up to being immature.\n\nCut to 7 years later. Hadn't dated anyone seriously at all, in fact had probably only had 2 or 3 dates in that length of time. Not for lack of opportunity, but just complete apathy and lack of interest. Started dating a co worker. I know, I know, this was a terrible idea and will never happen again. He seems nice, and I wanted to give dating him a shot. For me it wasn't anything serious, very casual just two people having a good time.\n\nHe became extremely clingy, extremely fast. Texting all hours of the day, constantly wanting to hang out. I'm an introvert and need my space/alone time which I explained but was ignored. After 6 weeks of dating, he told my coworker that I could be The One. I barely had any interest in dating him in the first place, and it came to a point where I found him just annoying.\n\nInstead of breaking it off, I started ignoring him. Ignoring his texts, calls, and avoiding him at any cost. I had found a new job by that point so it wasn't that difficult. I remember thinking, \"ugh can't he take a hint?\"\n\nEventually he stopped, never spoke to him again.\n\nI had an informal date a six months ago from high school. I felt 0 attraction to him though he was nice enough, we went out separate ways. Gave no indication I was interested in a second date. He keeps sending me messages every few weeks asking me if we can meet again or how my week is going. Can you guess what I did? Yeah, ghosted. I could just tell him I'm not interested but something in me literally doesnt want to make the effort.\n\nSo I need some help Reddit, am I the asshole? Or are my exes just way too clingy which caused me to run for the hills? ",

My partner (20M) and I (21F) just moved to a new flat and had just found jobs, his dad killed himself back on a different island to us. The travel  back and forth cost us a lot (ferrys being £85-£100 return). The funeral cost us around £4.7k because there is only one place on the island and they have monopoly. Obviously we weren't the most financially stable, so this has hit us hard. We've borrowed round £3.5k from my family and a couple grand from his side (causing them all fall behind). My partner is pissed off that this has all happened. \nWe have possession of all of his dad's things, including two cats (of which I'm allergic), I'm torn as our new home is just filled with his dad's stuff and the cats. We were supposed to get another tenant but we can't with all his dad's belongings. Yes we're trying to sell a lot of furniture off. I guess I'm annoyed that it's knocked us back.

      "description": "I met this woman while doing some volunteering for a club I am a part of at my college campus. I had seen her around before, but I had been informed that she had a boyfriend a year prior. Whilst talking to her i jokes about my own relationships, of which I had none and was single. She remarked that she was also single by 6 months or so. I found out that her ex boyfriend dumped her.\n\nAfter the volunteering we toured a little fall festival on campus and hit it off quite well. I got her number and we made plans for an outing soon after in the week. Ended up going to a fast food restaurant at her behest. I brought a bouquet of flowers which she accepted readily and seemed to really enjoy.\n\nA few days later I wanted to meet with her again so I messaged her about going on a “date”. She replied that she really enjoyed hanging out with me as well as my company and that she would love to go out with me, but only wanted to be friends and not go out on dates, just friendly outings. \n\nI replied that I was not interested in remaining just friends and that it would probably be best if we parted ways. (I tend to catch feelings quick, and it does not help that I spoke to this woman due to the fact I knew she was single, otherwise I would have been more cautious.)\n\nShe ended up getting offended and ranted at me through text saying she didn’t understand why I wanted to part ways when she was “just being sincere about her feelings toward me.” \n\nSo, am I the asshole here? I’ve asked friends and it’s been pretty split by gender. Most Women say I’m the asshole and that I should have remained friends, and most men said it was alright to move on because I’m looking for a relationship, not more friendships.\n\nTL;DR OP met a woman, went out with her, then was told she only wanted to be friends. OP did not want to be friends and decided it would be best to cut ties.",

She’s rude to customers and staff, flat out refuses to serve customers when asked, is never working where she should be, wanders aimlessly to avoid customers and has a terrible attitude. Unfortunately she’s the only one willing to work as late as the store closes (unless we hire someone new). \n\nI spoke to my direct manager about this. She was infuriated as she’d received a verbal customer complaint and we’d had a contractor complain about her too. My manager was ready to fire her but needed someone to replace her shifts. That manager has now gone on indefinite leave. \n\nThe store manager, who I’ve also relayed this to has already spoken to Marie about her constantly coming into work late (I was unaware of this) but hasn’t been taking anyone’s complaints about her seriously. \n\nThe one thing the company does take seriously is customer complaints online. They have to go though the management chain before they reach our store so higher up managers are also aware of the situation. I’m at a loss for what else to do but I cannot work with Maire anymore, knowing she’s been spoken to by management about her attitude and work ethic but won’t change. \n\nHowever I’m quite conflicted about possibly ruining a girls career and impersonating a customer to do so but I don’t really know what else can be done to get managements full attention.

      "description": "The standard: on mobile so formatting or autocorrect may be wrong. And TL;DR at the bottom. \n\n\nSo, a bit of background to this. I currently live with my girlfriend and she's expecting our daughter in a couple of months. So before I get into it, I KNOW smoking is bad for me and a baby (not to mention anyone else) so spare me the lecture, I'm not an idiot - I don't smoke indoors and I always use peppermint oil to mask the smell (trust me, it does mask it, my girfriend has admitted it) so I'm not an intrusive smoker. I'm respectful and I try not to let this affect anyone else's life. She's mentioned previously that this is NOT an issue in the relationship one little bit. We regularly joke that I'm almost a 'secret smoke' as I often completely disappear, have a cig and then come back smelling of peppermint. \n\nAnyway, I normally come home from work at about 7pm and need to have a cigarette after a stressful day, it helps me relax. My girlfriend knows my routine and she goes about this unaffected normally. \n\nToday however, she gives me a hug as normal when I get in and, without me knowing, goes into my pocket and steals the cigarette packet out of my jacket pocket. I'm a man of habit so they're always in the same pocket. She goes into the bedroom and I pour myself a drink of water in the kitchen. \n\nAnyway, I reach into my pocket so that I can get a cigarette out and go for a smoke. Of course, I couldn't find them. I KNEW they were there when I was walking from my train as I always check whenever I get off the train and do the 'four pocket tap': phone, wallet, keys and cigarettes. Next minute, my gf comes down with a wry smile on her face and says \"you'll have to find them\". \n\nAt this point I get pissed, in the infancy of our relationship, she used to do this ALL THE TIME but after many times of telling her that it wasn't funny because it stresses me out, she stopped. However, for whatever reason she decided it would be funny to do today. No idea why. \n\nNow, I'm visibly getting stressed and I go upstairs to try and find them and couldn't. Obviously I'm mad at this point because I hate people ruining my routine, even little things like this (I know it's stupid, but she knows this). I see her phone on the bed side table and hide it on the top of my wardrobe (out of her reach). She eventually comes upstairs for her phone. She asks if I've seen it and this is how the convo goes: \n\nMe: yeah I've seen it. I'll tell you where it is when you tell me where my cigarettes are. \n\nHer: That's so childish. Just give me my phone. \n\nMe: Not until you give me my cigarettes. You know full well I hate it when you hide them. I've had this issue with you before. So I'm taking something YOU'RE  addicted to until you give me them back. \n\nHer: You're a fucking horrible, spiteful person. \n\nMe: No, you're just being a childish bitch. Just tell me where they are and you can have your phone. \n\nAnyway, eventually she tells me where they are (they're in her top drawer of her bedside cabinet - which I NEVER go in). I give her her phone back and to me, the issue is resolved. However, she keeps saying how much of an arsehole (asshole) I am and won't let it go...so AITA? \n\n\nTL;DR Gf stole my cigarettes and hid them when she knows I normally go for one, so I hid her phone until she told me where they were. To me, the issue was resolved but she keeps telling me I'm an arsehole. ",

      "title": "AITA for standing up for myself at work against my trainer?",
      "description": "I am between changing careers and started working at an office as a temporary worker a couple of months ago. The person who trains me is a 50ish year old Chinese lady who I have to share a cubicle with. She was really nice at first but over the weeks have become quite nasty to me.\n\nAt the risk of looking like I am trying to persuade you on my side there is quite a bit of context so I will have to go into some personal details.\n\nThis lady’s cubicle habits include burping like Homer Simpson at least 5 times a day; ripping loud farts and acting like nothing happened; cackling like a witch at anything she finds amusing and this includes a minor typo someone made in an email; and smelling like sulphur at any given time of the day by snacking on what seems like boiled eggs that have gone bad. I do not say anything to her about these habits but no doubt they contributed in how I see her and lowered the level of tolerance I am willing to give out. I find these habits quite repulsive.\n\nWhile she is a wealth of knowledge of her area of expertise as she has been there for 7 years she is not good at explaining things. She also talks really fast when she explains things because it comes naturally to her. While I am trying to decipher one sentence through her accent she’s already said a paragraph. Of course she will act completely surprised when you don’t understand her. Almost right away I asked her to slow down because it is hard for me to understand what she is saying and I believe she took it as a slight to her English. Since it is necessary for me to understand her I did not feel bad.\n\nDuring the first day of training she mentioned that everyone at work is jealous of her. When asked to clarify she informed me that she had been accused of not pulling her weight by her coworkers who work in nearby cubicles and have gotten talked to by management about this issue. I shrugged it off and didn’t think much of it. More on this later.\n\nAs time went on she started acting quite controlling and strange including telling me what exit to use out of the building to leave on particular days for reasons I can’t comprehend. These are not time saving tips for me but rather more like feng shui tips which she constantly reads on her computer at lunch time. They do not make sense for me to take so I just smile and ignore them. She also insisted that I lock my computer when I walk away which is a good advice but she says someone has been messing with her files whenever she goes to the washroom. I know for a fact this is not the case as the one time she didn’t log off when she went to the washroom she accused me of messing with her files. She says someone has been doing this for months and months and she is baffled they are not satisfied. \n\nAs a person who is being trained I believe it is fair of her to get me to do a variety of tasks for exposure but as time went on I noticed that she was not doing any work except saving and archiving her emails. All the while delegating all the work onto me. This went on for the first month. When she pointed out a minor mistake I made which is the same mistake she makes all the time (a part of my job is going through her old files and updating them with new documents) I told her I feel pressured since I am being asked to do a lot of work and that we should start sharing the tasks so I can take my time to make sure I am not making mistakes. I said this very politely but she did not like this one bit as her face turned flush red and her voice dropped like she was brewing in deep madness after a shock. She did not speak to me unless it was necessary that day.\n\nThe day after she started speaking to me in a very annoying hateful tone that sounds like a screechy whiny yelling session. I cannot stand these yelling sessions so I tend to cut her off in mid sentence and say I got it. Then she does this thing where she says the exact same thing but in slightly different words so I have to cut her off again. Now it was quite obvious to me she enjoys telling me off over a mistake so not 3 minutes after I pointed out a mistake that she made which I happened to be looking at and told her that she needs to be careful as well. Further I went on to tell her I see her mistakes all the time but I don’t point them out instead I fix it for her because we are a team and I don’t want to point out every single mistakes because there are a lot of them. By this time we are not on speaking terms unless it is necessary for work.\n\nThe day after she seemed enragedover a mistake so I told her the truth. I told her that she needs to better explain things because this was not something we went over. She then proceeded to yell at me about how when she first started she had to learn on her own so I should try to learn on my own as well. I yelled back at her I am giving her a feedback so the next person she trains (meaning I won’t be there) will be better off. She then proceeded to yell at me more about how she had to learn on her own so I told her okay. I descalated the situation by telling her I don’t want to get into an argument with her and that I was there to work and not fight. I also said I want to enjoy the place I am working at and I can’t do that if I am not getting along with people. She said that is the reason why she keeps rocking herself at work because everyone is jealous of her. I put on earbuds after this and I told her to get my attention if she needs me. This is a way for me to cut out all chit chats and keeping all exchanges exclusive to work. This was just yesterday. She asked me a question one time, I answered her then she tried to make the conversation about something else so I immediately looked away and put the earbuds back in to tune her out.\n\nThe management at work noticed I am a good worker since the piles of documents that were on her desk started disappearing since I started working there. The piles of work we get in the mail, she does not like me doing them and always tells me not to worry about them although it is just as important. I personally believe this is because she wants other people to see how much work she has to do. Since I started working 3 piles of 2 feet stacks have shrunk down to less than 10 pages as of this week. I was hinted at a full time position offer in about a month by management but the last couple of weeks I have not been enjoying my time because of her. \n\nAm I the asshole? As a temporary worker should I take the power trip with a good smile and do the work quietly? I admit I have no filter in situations that I feel strongly about and should have more tact but the way she yells at me now is more than what I am willing to personally take.",

      "title": "AITA for being upset that my parents gave my wedding fund to my sister to freeze her eggs?",
      "description": "I want to preface this by saying that I’ve been 100% financially independent from my parents since the day I graduated college. I know they don’t owe me a dime and I’m grateful for everything they’ve given me in life. \n\nI have a sister who is about a decade older than me, and my parents promised each of us a set amount of money towards our weddings. My sister used this money to have a big, beautiful wedding and I’m happy my parents were able to help make her special day like something out of a fairytale. Now it’s my turn to get married, but my parents have admitted to me that they gave away the money they had saved for my wedding to my sister. \n\nMy sister, a mother of one, had a series of health problems and had to freeze her eggs if she ever wanted to have another child. She didn’t have the money and only had a few weeks before her hysterectomy so she asked my parents for the $13,000, which they obviously gave her. My sister was absolutely devastated by her health issues and scared, and because they’re great people, my parents were willing to do anything to make her feel better. \n\nI know I sound like a selfish, vapid bitch for prioritizing my wedding over her fertility, but she was 36 when she got the diagnosis. There was no telling how long it would take for her health to recover, and it would be years before they could even afford supporting another infant, let alone the tens of thousands a surrogate would cost. I knew she would never have the means to use those eggs before she was 40, and she has made it very clear that she wouldn’t want to have an infant at that age. In my opinion, she acted in panic and wanted a safety net that she knew she would never use. I don’t blame her for being scared. I would have been terrified to. \n\nBut I’m still upset that now I won’t be able to have much of a wedding because I had been counting on the funds my parents had promised. I’m not so much upset that they gave it to her, but I am upset that they gave it to her *knowing* nothing would ever come of it. That they traded my wedding day for her brief peace of mind. My sister has confirmed already that she and her husband will not be having another child. \n\nWhen my parents told me there was no money, they were obviously stricken and apologetic. I couldn’t hide my disappointment. I really tried to reassure them that I understood, but they could tell I was hurt. My sister called later and told me that it sucks I can’t have a ‘fancy wedding’ (like hers) but basically I need to grow up. Which seemed hypocritical, since she made such a big deal out of her wedding needing to be extravagant. She said she’s sorry, but at the time her future children were more important than one day in my life not being as nice as I’d hoped. \n\nI know this isn’t the end of the world. This is dumb and petty in the grand scheme of things and I feel ridiculously shallow for being so upset over losing my dream wedding. I’m still getting married. My wedding won’t compare to my sister’s, but I’m still marrying the love of my life and it will still be an awesome day. \n\nThanks for sticking with me through the story. I know plenty of you are rolling your eyes over the dramatic bullshit that comes with weddings. So, am I overreacting? AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "TL:DR at bottom\nI met this girl over a year ago and she was one of the sweetest people I'd ever met, we instantly became friends and she became very dear to me. After about 2-3 months she just disappears for 3 entire months. No explanation, didn't respond to any message, just gone. This made me think the worst had happened but then after 3 months she just comes back like nothing happened. No explanation then either, just starts a casual convo. However, I learned just before she disappeared, she had shared some really personal things about me to someone else without my permission, which I was understandably annoyed about.\n\nI'm a bit angry but ultimately glad she's okay and I ask her about it to which she more or less avoids the question. After a while things were normal again, and she does it again. Mid convo just disappears for 2 weeks. The convo we were actually having was about some tough shit I was going through, so her just up and leaving that convo after offering to support me, pissed me off. (But I do understand she may have been uncomfortable because of the topic, either way I wish she didn't just up and leave) She comes back and tells me shes sorry and how she promises it won't happen again. I explain to her how this causes me a lot of worry and stress and she then tells me shes depressed (but hasn't been diagnosed) and as someone who has been dealing with mh issues for 10 years, I do understand how it messes with you. I'm usually a really forgiving person but this kept happening. It happened 8 times. It could be months or weeks I never knew! One of our mutual friends cut her off before I did because of this and as I discussed this with a friend they said it felt like she kept doing it to toy with me as she knew I would always accept her back into my life. But I don't think she was manipulative like that.\n\nEvery time I would explain to her this upset me, she would say the same promise, tell me shes depressed and everytime I would explain how I understand but to please let me know when she wouldn't be active for a while. She never did. About a month ago I was talking to her like normal and mid convo she stops replying to me, however remained active on social media. (I fully understand I'm not entitled to anyone's time and I'm okay with that) but this had been a full 2 weeks of her not responding to me even though she knew I was extremely worried as I expressed that to her. I guess I hit a breaking point and I just blocked her. She messaged me on Skype a few days ago and I fully explained why I did what I did, she seemed to understand but I still find myself thinking I was a bit over dramatic despite the fact I was extremely hurt and she knew it caused me stress.\n\nTL:DR a close friend kept disappearing for weeks/months and would consistently make false promises and didn't listen to me expressing how this upset and worried me, I snapped and blocked her after 2 weeks of being blatantly ignored, explained over Skype why but she understood.",

      "description": "Disclaimer: I include a *lot* of details as I initially felt they were relevant to the point, but I only just realized how much I rambled.  TLDR at the end, thank you in advance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some background info, I've worked at a grocery store deli for about 6 months.  There's a variety of personal drama with these people, but that is a whole other can of worms I could rant about.  Anyways, 2 of my (21f opening shift) new coworkers (19m &amp; 20f closing shift) are kinda dorky and are easy for me to be around, as they're so chill and don't play games as other people do.  I am definitely more mature and experienced than they are, but it's refreshing being able to act my age and just enjoy myself.  We've hung out a few times outside of work and have a group text going on, and we all live with our parents, me being the only one to have ever moved out and been \"on my own\" before (lived with other roommates.)  Now, we've all gotten pretty fed up with being adults still under our parent's rules (and other reasons in my case), so we've been talking about getting a place together before the start of next summer.\n\nI for one, am super thrilled about all the perks of having roommates again.  BUT, there is a huge ordeal going on at work where no one closing shift (including these 2) will do anything properly, going as far as wasting massive amounts of food and leaving trash and food sitting out all night long.  These 2 aren't part of the older worker's drama where they deliberately leave stuff and half-ass everything, but they are very slow workers and do a poor job of cleaning things, and are generally not very knowledgeable about, well, anything.  Keeping it at work alone is pretty frustrating cus that's 8 hours a day I have to deal with it, but I'm not sure I can trust them to be clean, responsible, and accountable for their actions if we are to be roommates.\n\nMy first thought was to write up a contract and/or set of rules that we can all discuss and compromise on, which I'm sure isn't too out of the ordinary.  However, my experiences with past friends/roommates and the present work situation are making me go into crazy strict detail about what living together will be like.  I want to go as far as agreeing on the consequences for breaking rules (maybe not on this first meeting though).  We are meeting tomorrow to sit down and hash out some of these details before we start saving our money and searching for places in the upcoming months, WIBTA if I brought in a serious attitude and list of my requirements?  I know that isn't fun and not exactly something many people would want in someone they live with, but I don't want to get myself stuck in a living situation that I can't stand being in, as I've been there before.  I certainly feel like I am going to come off as an asshole, but is it ok to be TA in this situation?\n\nTLDR, my coworkers/new friends are inexperienced kids and want to be roommates which is what I want, but I can't trust that they will be reliable and have been in bad situations with other friends/roommates in the past.  WIBTA if I held them to a strict set of rules when living together in a shared rental property?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So, I [23f] have a boyfriend [25m] who constantly ignores to do his basic hygiene routine such as brushing his teeth, using deodorant, changing socks / dirty clothes, ignoring the fact that he needs a haircut or it's time to trim his beard, or that the hair between his eyebrows grows as well, and maybe he should take care of it too, etc... \n\nWe've been dating for almost 2 years and we live together so I pretty much notice all the things that he doesn't do, so I decided to tell him that it would be nice if he took a bit more care of those small things. His reaction was fine, he said that he was sorry and he would do that now. It's been two months since we talked about it, and he seems to ignore it again. Now I feel like and AH for 1) asking him that again, because I don't want him to think that I'm less attracted to him or whatever, 2) making him do things he doesn't care about because this is *HOW I* want it, and that I'm indeed don't enjoy a smelly partner. \n\nHe's not in depression whatsoever, he's perfectly capable of handling all the other things in life, that's just the way he was raised I guess. \n\nSo, is it okay to ask for some basic things like that, or AITA?

      "description": "So i have a friend, let's call her Anne. She's a trans woman, recently came out to her parents, and they're very, very transphobic. They make passive aggressive comments towards her appearance, deadname her, use male pronouns, etc. they're also just incredibly awful people in general, they berate her for being stupid (which she's not, she has bad grades in school due to mental health problems) make fun of her anxiety, and i've even seen her get slapped for hyperventilating during a panic attack. I am a lesbian, and grew up with abusive parents, and because of it, seeing and hearing the way they treat her is very triggering for me and gets to be too much to handle. but she insists they're not really that bad, theyre only like that because she's their only kid and they're just making mistakes, parenting is difficult, they'll come around eventually. \n\nI've offered advice, because she agrees their transphobia is wrong, but if i dont tiptoe around her and play devils advocate while i try to help, she gets mad and tells me i dont know what im talking about.\n\nAs much as i care about Anne, her family is too triggering for me and the way she continues to defend their emotional abuse, despite her knowing about my past, is stressing me out. if i end my friendship with her over this, am i being an asshole?",

      "description": "Hey everyone, the issue is this:\n\nI sold an individual a drone through one of the major buy/sell online marketplaces. As it was unused for some time, I charged it up and tested it the weekend before the sale to ensure it was working properly. It flew fine, but I wasn't able to fly it for too long due to the high winds that weekend (which eats up battery like crazy). \n\nWhen we met up later that week for the sale, he mentioned that it was for his son. I'm a big softie for good parenting and I offered to lower the price to which he accepted with thanks. I then offered to fly the drone to prove it works (as standard for any pricey sale), but he said it was fine as he has other drones and \"I seemed trustworthy\".  Of course I was flattered, but this isn't a cheap drone and I offered a second time. He said the same thing, to which I asked \"are you sure?\" and he replied with a yes.\n\nI sold him the drone and we parted ways.\n\nAbout a month later, he messaged me saying that his son had only used the drone \"two or three times\" while under his supervision and the drone is now failing to fly. He asked for a refund (later changed to a partial refund) saying I had sold him a defective drone. We exchanged quite a few messages, but the gist is: \n\nI refused because it was working when I owned it but I did feel bad, so I said I would be willing to purchase a replacement motor (that seemed to be the issue) or refund him a small amount. He said that he should have tested it out that day (which is true, but I did offer) and that he thought I was trustworthy (which hurt, because I like to think I *am* trustworthy). \n\nIn the end, there were no more messages and I assume the drone is still broken. \n\n---\n\nAITA for not accepting the drone back and giving him a refund? \n\n",

When he talked about it being his dream school the next day, I became a little worried, because I thought the chances of him getting in were little to zero, and I didn't want him to be disappointed. I say this because we go to a private school together and this friend takes zero AP classes as a junior and has never taken an honors class, his GPA is a 3.2 and he's not on honor roll. Three months ago, he took the SAT and didn't even break 1000. He plays soccer but is nowhere near recruitment, he's not a starter and hardly on varsity. His other extracurriculars are also very weak, nothing special or unique: science club, understudy in the musical, and that's it, no music either.\n\nTo show him the caliber of students at Cornell, I showed him a video of an accepted student's stats and activities, and recommended that he aim for a better fit and not just somewhere elite.\n\nHe claimed that I was being unsupportive and his parent's think that I am a bad influence since I don't support him in his dreams.\n\nAITA for telling my friend to aim lower?\n\n  ",

      "description": "So before I begin, I'll give some background info. My girlfriend is from China, studying in the United States. I am a domestic American student. This seems to be part of the problem. Whenever my girlfriend is having troubles with the school (dealing with different departments, or trying to ask questions/get help) she often will get frustrated and come to me for comfort. While venting, she often uses vast overgeneralizations that don't make me feel good and she expects me to agree and say similar things to help. \n\nBecause of this I'll lose my willingness to be supportive and help because I don't agree with these overgeneralizations. For example, she'll start ranting about how, because this one person in the one department wasn't able to help her right away, \"everyone in this country is just so inefficient, if this was China they would be fired.\" It annoys me mostly because from what she's told me, China is also very inefficient with many things and it feels like she's just criticizing my country while comparing to hers. I'm not some ultra patriotic person, but when she expects me to agree with everything she's saying, it makes me a little annoyed, especially since if I don't I'm \"not being supportive of her\" and \"arguing is not what [she] needs right now, it's not the time for [me] to talk about my opinion, I just need to be supportive\". \n\nThis problem also stems to other areas. For example, I introduced her to some of my friends, a girl and her boyfriend who I'm close with. We hung out with the boyfriend for a little bit while we had to wait for the girlfriend because she was stuck in a floor meeting at her dorm. Eventually she was done and we hung out for a little bit so they could meet and then we left. Afterwards, my girlfriend was annoyed and ranting how it's annoying that she (the girlfriend) made us wait so long. I tried telling her that there wasn't much she could do because she couldn't skip her floor meeting (otherwise the dorm wouldn't let her sign her boyfriend in to visit later that night). But she just told me she was annoyed that I wasn't taking her side and she just wanted me to criticize my friend to make her feel better (which I didn't want to do because I'm not about to bash my friends behind their back when they didn't do anything wrong in my eyes). \n\nSo AITA? My first relationship (right before this one) was extremely abusive so I have a lot of trouble figuring out if I'm wrong or if I should stand up for myself, so I'm really not sure.",

I try not to talk a lot as most people aren't very social. I am an extremely social person so I've felt a little awkward at work sometimes. The other interns and I are all in the same room and don't talk a ton. One guy is very quiet and I felt like maybe he didn't feel comfortable around us since we are all girls. We finally we're all talking as a group today just about hobbies and what we do in our free time. I was finally relaxing a little around my coworkers. The guy was talking about how he loves hunting and guns and goes every summer hunting deer and elk. I said something along the lines of \"oh that's cool, I've never been hunting, but do you like to go shooting like do you have a concealed carry permit or anything?\" I got a look of discust from him and another girl said that I was really insensitive and it was really in appropriate to ask that. I said I was sorry and I didn't realize that was not okay. They then went off on how he could have a gun at work right now and that's like I was asking if he was carrying right now. I said I didn't mean it that way I was just trying to make conversation. He seemed really ticked off and the other girl was like yeah that's something super personal like asking someone's salary. You never share that info. I feel like an idiot and I really wasn't trying to pry into their personal lives. I was just trying to make friends.

      "description": "So for the last two years I'd ask this girl if she wanted to meet up and go out. In fact, a couple of times she'd ask me herself to let her know when I'm free. Every time there was an \"excuse\" like \"I'm looking for a job at the moment, not the best timing.\"  \n\n\nBasically, her excuses always depended on something external, i.e. that I am not the reason she doesn't want to meet. I always assumed she did want to meet. So I asked her, like every 4 - 6 months for a period of 2 years.   \n\n\nThen I'll admit I lost my temper a little bit and asked what's your issue lady, if you don't want to meet up with me just tell me, what's all this \"not right now\" nonsense.   \n\n\nAnd her answer was something like \"/u/promoso I am very busy these days and I have other friends I'd like to meet up with and I have to make time for them, I don't have time for you\"  \n\n\nAnd I said \"THAT'S FUCKING FINE! Why didn't you just say that!\"  \n\n\nAnd she's upset that I got so upset over it. Not talking to her anymore.   \n\n\nSo yeah... AITA",

We've had two short but very nice dates where we've agreed that we'd like to have longer ones at some point. We also talk (text) everyday, where we've also agreed that we'd like to spend more time with each other. Well today she had off from work and I got out of work at 3pm. Plenty of time to make plans and do something. As I was leaving work I asked her if she was free and she said she was doing something quick with her bestfriend, but she would get ahold of me. I decided to wait at home by just playing video games; three thirty came, four o'clock came, I started feeling drowsy and took a quick nap. I woke up and it was 6:30pm, still no message from her. I asked her what she'd been up to and she said \"Oh just hanging out with (best friend) still.\" I'm kinda upset by this, but I'm not really sure if it's justified.",

      "description": "So this morning me (M22) and my girlfriend (F26) got into an argument. About 3 days ago her grandmother passed. That day me and her called off and sat at the house together and everything was okay. Yesterday she went to work and said everything was fine (other then her hating her job). \n\nSo today I had a day off and she tells me she doesn’t want to go to work, I ask why? She just keeps saying she “doesn’t want to work” and “hates work”.\n\nSo I tell her that she should at least try and go in to get some of her work done for the month so she’s not weeks behind after everything else happens. The morning continues and she starts to get ready for work.\n\nAs she’s going to walk out the door she starts complaining that I’m forcing her to go in. I tell her that she can call off if she wants to, to which she rebutted “the only reason you’re saying that is because you don’t want to get bitched at”.\n\nShe ends up leaving and slamming the door behind her and I give her some time to cool off. Throughout the day she was constantly blowing up my phone at one point was saying “after everything had happened I can’t believe you made me come to work.”\n\nI want to make this clear I told her why she should go I did not force her to leave. As well as she keeps saying that I should be more “sensitive” to her right now, but in the same breathe she said that “I can call off now and not worry about it because my boss feels bad! I won’t be able to do that in February!”\n\nI’m just baffled we’re now sat silent while she tries to pack my things to move me out. She says that I’m unsupportive due to me making her feel “bad” about calling out.\n\nI’ve tried to explain that if she needed to take a personal day due to her grandmother I understood but she shouldn’t just skip work because she hates it, especially when she’s called out once already this week and will have all next week off.\n\nAt this point I feel like she’s just being lazy in her life and using whatever excuse she wants just so she doesn’t have to go in (this has been an issue).

      "title": "AITA Treating my stepfather like air (/r/amitheasshole)",
      "description": "First, to clarify, what I mean by treating him like air is a. not talking to him, b. not making any contact, c. not reacting to anything he does, d. not answering his questions/remarks directed at me as if i didn't hear it\n\n**Context:** I am an unplanned child between a young woman and a married man. After some other drama not relevant to this story happened, my mom became a single mother until she became serious with a guy let's call Stepdad #1. This guy ended up just using my mother as a sex relief and paid her for her 'services' making my mom feel like she's a prostitute so she broke up with him. Then this guy, Stepdad #2 came into our lives swooping in just in the nick of time to *\"save\"* my mother from #1 because he threatened he wouldn't stop pestering her till she gets married. And that's how my mother got married to this asshole within 2 months. Or atleast, that's how my mother told the story to me.\n\nAt first, he was an okay dude. Worked a menial job, provided some financial support though my mother was the bread winner because of her high-paying job. After 2 years(?) of jumping from one menial job to another, #2 decided to not work anymore because we can live off of my mother's salary. My mother tried really hard to make me like him, to see him as the father figure she thinks I have needed all my life (I was 9 or 10 when they got married) and being the understanding supposedly mature daughter that I am, I played along. I did try to see him in a good light, but it's just, this dude is, I have no words for him. He should be doing some chores around the house or doing something productive in order to compensate for his lack of financial support for the family, but he just stays in their bedroom all day, watching TV, only coming down to eat. He doesn't even voluntarily do the chores that men should do, like fixing the sink and some other hard labor sh\\*\\*, leaving the mess to be done by hired workers (which cost extra money!) or my mother who also knows her way around those things. He even has a history of stealing from us, the occasional jewelry, cash, even my fuc\\*\\*\\*\\* PSP. The only slightly good thing he does is when my mother gives him errands (he can't refuse my mother's direct commands) and taking care of my mother, albeit begrudgingly, when she's really ill with her chronic pains and endometriosis. My mother also hints that he loves her. Like, really? I don't in one second believe that he truly loves my mother for anything other than for absolute necessity because he has nowhere else to go because his family has already forsaken him (no surprise there).\n\nAnd now, more than a decade later, we are still in the same position as we started only with some differences. My mother is no longer the bread winner as she got unjustifiably removed from her high-paying job. There are 3 people working a little above minimum wage in our family; me, my mother, and my cousin who we treat as sibling and son. #2 is still jobless and lazy as fuck. My mom and I have already fought many times over the years about his presence in our family, now more than ever, since I am gaining some independence and influence in the household due to my financial contributions, and after all that sh\\*\\* about him being useless is not even half of my problem with this motherf\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*.\n\nMy mother absolutely hates fighting. My grandmother who lives with us who was and still is an abusive mother always gives her sh\\*\\* about her useless husband. My grandma is not only verbally and mentally abusive, she's also quick to violence. There has been several times in my childhood where I had to hide from their fighting and sometimes even resulting to ER visits due to injuries.\n\nBasically, 99% of the fights are; #2 does something or intentionally does things to annoy me and my grandma (he knows we don't like him one bit) &gt; my grandma blows up, fights stepdad &gt; mother tries to stop their fights because it's stressful for her &gt; grandma then turns all her anger to mother &gt; stepdad hides somewhere else &gt; grandma and mother fight &gt; fight settles down but nothing is resolved &gt; rinse and repeat. Basically, anything that could spark up a fight is a big no-no for my mother that is why I'm staying quiet (most of the time). This asshole knows how much me, my mom, and my cousin hates fighting because we're tired of it and uses this to his advantage, manipulating my family into being silent about his bullshit all this time.\n\nNow, I know this is a novel, but me and my mom just had a fight where she keeps asking and begging me to treat my stepdad better. She doesn't like the way I treat my father like air, never looking at him, never reacting, never answering his questions (unless redirected by my mother). I keep telling her that this is the best way I could treat him, because I know that once I take notice of him, I will just get angry.\n\nOn the other hand, I do know that this situation is also making her suffer. I think she is madly deeply inlove with this asshole to the point that her only child's opinions and ruined childhood doesn't deter her from wanting this family to become peaceful and loving *with this man*. I also want that to happen, but I know that I can't do it, not with this man in our family. I love my mother so much that I have put up with this until now, and I think it's just a matter of time I make her choose. The last thing I want to do is to hurt my mother, that's why we've been stuck in this status quo and cycle for more than a decade now. I have considered things like leaving the house, forcing her to make a decision, abusing my stepdad to try and make him leave the house, or just straight up murder him. I've done none of those because of one and only reason; I don't want to hurt my mother.\n\n**TL;DR Am I the asshole for treating the man my mother loves like air because of his history of being an asshole to our family, even though I know that I'm hurting and causing stress to my mother in doing so?**",

      "description": "Im self employed in a very physically demanding job and often have to work weekends usually 5am while 6pm so I'm flat out exhausted a lot of the time. My friend \"E\" organised a suprise party for her boyfriend on a Sunday which I took time off for. I and a bunch of other friends attended and we had a great time. \n\nThe following weekend was E's birthday but because I'd had time off for the other party I was unable to see her. (I don't own a car, I lease a vehicle from the company I do a great deal of my contract work for and I pay next to nothing for it as long as I don't use it for non work purposes). Anyway they live a 40 minute drive or 2 hours by Public Transport away. Instead I sent her a nice little birthday message and we chatted about the weekend away we always have for her birthday gift (It's in a couple months). Everything seemed fine and I had plans to head round to E's house the following weekend to see her when I receive an invite to a group chat for me and a bunch of E's friends and a message in it from her boyfriend \"M\".\n\nM wrote that it felt we didn't put much effort into her birthday and she always goes to great lengths to organise stuff for us and that we are drifting away and abandoning her like a bunch of her past friend's have. That we didn't wanna spend time with her and we'd rather be anywhere else when we are with her. That he was very angry because of how heartbroken she was and wants to hear our perspectives on it. \n\nI'm personally furious over what he's saying. I've done my damnest for E over the years. From loaning her money so she could move out of a bad living situation, sacrificing my limited free time to spend time with her and help her with her depression. Taking her for weekends away for her birthday/Christmas present. Dealing with her shithead ex's. Mediating between E and M when he went through her phone because he was \"suspicious\". On top of all of this both E and M know I'm working crazy hard to be able to afford to buy a home of my own (trying to get out of my own fuckfaced living situation). \n\nI know it must be upsetting for E to not feel like we care and I know she does a lot in return and i really wish i could have spent time with her on her birthday but I just feel like this is a major overreaction on both E and M's part. \n\nSorry if this is a mess and please tell me if I'm the cunt here. I just feel awful about this whole thing and I'm terrified that I've done something to fuck up here and I've not realised it. ",

      "description": "When I was younger up until a couple years ago I was on a ymca swim team. There were twin girls that were daughters of one of the coaches and we were good friends, I’m also good friends with the coach. I am no longer on the team, and the twin girls go to another school nearby. They are very nice people.\n\nOne of them texted me asking if I could go to her school’s prom with her. I haven’t responded yet. Part of me says yes, you should, it’s her senior prom and you’ve been family friends for a long time. \n\nHowever, another part of me doesn’t want to. I’m introverted and going to another schools prom where I only know probably two people in the group scares me. I also have a track meet that day, and would be coming from that. In addition, the month of April is packed full of activities for me, including some music performances that I need to prepare for. I also have a lot of extracurricular activities and am in rigorous academics so would have a lot of homework.\n\nWith all of this known, it makes me nervous to tack on a prom in addition to my own the following weekend; I’m worried I’d get behind on my music and studies, and that it’d give me more time to prepare for myself if I didn’t go.\n\nI can’t decide, as I think saying no would be a healthier choice for me, but I know it would probably hurt her feelings if I said no. I think I’d feel bad either way; bad for her if I said no, and bad for myself if I said yes. I’m very nervous about this whole thing and don’t know what to say.\n\nSo, Would I Be the Asshole if I said no to this girl’s prom proposal?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to talk politics with my girlfriend?",
      "description": "My girlfriend and I are both liberal in almost every sense of the word.  We have never disagreed about anything you could call a political issue.  \n\nI've always been more reserved in expressing my political opinions for a lot of reasons (some for professional reasons, but mostly because it's never comfortable).  \n\nFor the last two years, for obvious reasons, politics had become a bigger part of our daily life than I'm okay with.  So I tend to not respond to her attempts to start conversation, or I politely (as politely as I can) tell her I'm not in the mood to talk about it.  She knows it makes me angry and uncomfortable and if it's all the same I'd rather leave it out of my day. \n\nThings came to a head tonight when she convinced me to watch the Netflix documentary \"Get Me Roger Stone\" and I couldn't finish it.  I was getting too angry, I've got work tomorrow, I can't be dwelling on things like this while I'm trying to run a small business.  \n\nTo her credit, she said she understood and was happy to switch it to something else.\n\nBut when I mentioned, in passing, that I was recommending the doc to my mother (who has the same views and outspokenness of my girlfriend), she began to start the same usual rant about the state of things and was upset I didn't finish it.  I politely told her I still wasn't in the mood to talk about it but wanted to share that I was passing along her recommendation to my mom.  She got pretty upset, telling me that it was important for people to be politically aware, and that, since her entire family are far right wing, I am the only person she can talk to about this.  I told her I was aware, but didn't want that awareness to derail the little free time I have, especially with her, and wanted to stay in a good mood.  And that there's no use in discussing if it's just to an echo chamber.  We'd be angrily agreeing with each other for hours.  And that I didn't appreciate her insinuation that I was blissfully and intentionally ignorant to what's been going on for the sake of my own comfort, I just didn't want to talk about it.\n\nShe lost her cool and stormed off, because she was getting angry and uncomfortable, even though I was willing to keep discussing it, at least to explain where I was coming from.  I didn't want to point out the irony in any of that, because that might have made me the asshole.  And I was happy the topic was being dropped.  But now we're sharing an awkward silence and I'm worried that I may be selfish and calloused to her needs due to the discomfort that usually prevents my own family taking about political or religious topics.  Or that I'm selfish in considering my own comfort over her's.  But nobody's comfortable getting increasingly upset about this kind of stuff, even if it is an echo chamber. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

They speak a lot on social media, and I do too but I don’t use it much so I don’t talk as much. \n\nThis Christmas A bought R a fancy watch &gt;$100 and decided to post it too which would’ve cost a lot too. He didn’t get me anything, and if I hadn’t seen him lately, I might understand. However, a few weeks ago R and I went to watch A’s cricket game. In a group chat we’re all apart of plus some other people, A announced him and R had finally seen each other after a long time. It had been longer since he’d seen me but there was no mention.\n\nI felt left out because I’d made an effort to come and support him (bearing in mind this was about 5 days after surgery) and he didn’t say thank you or really acknowledge that I was there too.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?

In West Coast Swing, usually females start off as follows but start learning to lead once they become more adept in their dancing—vice versa for males. There’s this Level 1 follow who is very good in her movements but tends to anticipate what the lead is going to do and as a result dances ahead of the lead—which isn’t uncommon, but it shouldn’t happen. I told her “wait for me to lead you.” Once I told her that she started taking her time. It feels very awkward for the lead when the partner’s steps aren’t in sync. I just feel really bad for having been the one to tell her... I didn’t say it in a rude way, but I feel like I should’ve left that to the instructors. AITA?\n\nJust to even out both sides, it’s also very awkward for the follow when the lead throws in some complex patterns that aren’t in sync with the song.",

      "description": "My husband (32m) and I (31f) have had issues with his hobby for the last few years. Without getting into specifics, it takes up the majority of his time when he’s not working and he has invested tens of thousands of dollars into it (not sure exactly how much - he hides it from me). We fight about it often as I feel like myself and our daughter (3 yo) always come in second when it comes to the hobby. If I try to plan things on weekends for us to do as a family I have a rare shot at actually finding a window that works for him. It’s also been a long snowy winter for us so our daughter has been cooped up inside. The last family outing that wasn’t just a dinner or visiting family was in October. \n\nHe’s been away for the last week for work and will continue to be gone for another week. While talking on the phone tonight I mentioned taking our daughter to a really good museum a few hours away the first Saturday he’s back. I figured I had a good shot of that Saturday being free as he would have worked the previous 2 Saturdays so he shouldn’t be on call. He informed me that he had a competition related to his hobby that Saturday and I needed to pick another day. I refused to pick a different Saturday (museum is closed Sunday). He then said that I should pick another activity that’s open on Sunday and I refused to do that as well. \n\nThe reason I refused is because we’ve played this game before. If I move the plans to another day - something always comes up (work or hobby related) and then it gets pushed again. And again. And again. Until we just never do it. And I really want to take our kid to THIS museum. It hits all of her current interests and she will have an amazing day. And she deserves it after a winter of playing inside and doing well in school (she has a few delays so she was able to start the special ed preschool a few months ago and has been making huge strides). I’m still planning on taking her, and told my husband we will just go without him. He got upset with me that I wasn’t willing to budge on the activity or the day. \n\nI know he wants to go and do things with us but I feel like if we were really a priority that he would pick us more than he does. I’m getting tired of us pushing everything in our lives back to make room for his stuff. I get that he’s made a commitment to this competition but he’s attended more competitions this winter than days he’s spent with his wife and/or kid. I feel like giving him a firm ‘this is the day we are doing this - come or don’t come’ is plenty fair. \n",

      "description": "Yesterday, I worked retail on Black Friday with a really dry throat and cough.  I brought water to drink throughout the shift, but ran out of water early on.  As a result, my throat got really dry and I resisted coughing in front of customers as much as I could.  At the end of the shift, I  lost most of my voice and also got a cold while walking home from work as well.  I was feeling pretty horrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to Saturday morning and I was feeling worse.  My coughing and voice got worse, and had a nose that wouldn't stop running.  All of a sudden, I get a message from my coworker (lets call him anon) asking me to switch shifts with them (meaning I work tomorrow, or Sunday).  Apparently the manager had put anon on Sunday, even though anon made it clear they couldn't work that day.   Being sick and all, I declined, telling anon that I've lost my voice and that I have a really bad cough; I told anon I was really sick.  Yet, anon kept asking me to switch shifts, and I would say no every time.  I even told anon that I also had a midterm to prep for, and anon fired back saying that I would have time to study at night.  In the end, I held my ground and anon finally left me alone.  I was kind of relieved that the argument was over, but at the same time I feel like I really pissed my coworker off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

One of them is extremely messy and the other there aren't so bad and two of them clean up after the filthy one constantly. I clean up all of my messes as I go and don't tolerate cleaning up after other adults. I also buy all of my own living essentials (Toilet paper, paper towels, food etc) and keep almost all of it locked up in my room because the filthy one bums off everyone else. With the filthy one gone, the others told me that I'm the only one that doesn't clean anything or \"supply\" for the apartment. I don't use any of their stuff and I clean everything as I go like an adult. Am I in the wrong here?

      "description": "My BF's father died really unexpectedly last Friday. I left work early to come home and I told my manager I probably wouldn't be on for my 4.5hr shift the Saturday after and that I would probably require additional days off for travel to the funeral (it's a twelve hr drive both ways) and obviously mourning because a person is dead. \n\nMy manager and coworkers are regularly unreliable and slow to answer anyways. My manager asked me to tell them they would have to cover it if I couldn't. I was a bit pissed because of the circumstances and him being the managers I figured he would let them know. So I'm telling them to contact me asap about whether or not they can take my shift because I need to know so I can take care of things for my bf and help him with everything. My one coworker doesn't even reply and instead I have my other one telling me she's not sure, I should tell the other one and my manager and can I ask them if they have figured it out and she's busy with her other job. I finally got fed up and told her they could figure it out and tell the manager themselves and that I don't have the patience or energy to handle trivial shit like who is picking up my shifts.\n\nI feel rude for being so terse but honestly I am just baffled that I tell all of these people I'm dealing with a dead parent-in-law and I have to take care of my spouse and they expect me to figure out everything for them. Manager is perfectly capable of delegating shifts, it's his job, I would expect people to be more understanding that I don't have time and energy to focus on who's working while I help my spouse deal with the death of his fucking father.",

      "description": "Hi. On mobile, hopefully this works out.\n\nI am a volunteer for several dog rescues, from fostering puppies , volunteer transporting, supply gathering via secondhand stores and yard sales. Most of my time, when I’m not working for my paycheck job, I’m doing rescue things. This leads to my circle knowing I’m a go to person when a dog or whatever needs a new family.\n\nI have a relative who is tentatively looking for help to rehome a year old pupper. Aside from the breed, which is tough to find a place for due to the sheer numbers available, it’s an unaltered male with little training or socialization. He’s a perfectly nice dog, but he’s starting to show his teenage attitude and hormones, and my offered advice was pretty much ignored. Also , this is the second dog being dumped, the first lasted less than a year. \n\nAm I an asshole for just not wanting to perpetuate this behavior? I REALLY want to help the pup, but don’t want to risk my liability by placing a dog with this shaky a background. I could probably get it into a rescue, but it would costly to vet this pup for me right now. I feel guilty , because I’ve rehomed a couple dogs into excellent homes in the period since the family members reached out and ...inferred?... I should help get this dog into a new home before it hurts a child.  Honestly I just don’t want to, knowing another will take its place in a year or so. I just don’t want to.  I know the family is irritated with me, and they see the successful pictures I share on FB, and we all know I could do this.  Ugh. \n\nFeeling pretty guilty and kind of like an asshole here.

I have always liked things to be equal in a relationship so I would never make a man do everything in a relationship. If it matters, we’re both 20 and I’m a female.\n\nAnyways, I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years and in the entire 2 years that we’ve been together, I have been paying for almost everything including food and even sometimes stuff for him. I never had an issue with paying for food or even buying him stuff because I like to treat him. However, I noticed that he would never do the same for me. He never really offers to pay or buy me anything (not that I expect him to). When I try to compromise and say we can take turns paying for food, he always complains about being broke even though he makes way more money than I do and doesn’t spend money at all?? And when he does spend money, he always spends $100 or more which irritates me a bit because if he’s so broke then why is he spending so much money? And yes I have called him out on that many times before. \n\nSo AITA? I feel so greedy when I think about this so I try to let it go but it keeps bothering me. Even when he suggests to eat out while I prefer to stay in, I still end up paying and it doesn’t make sense to me. And when he does pay, he always nags me about “owing” him when I have never once asked him to pay me back.",

I pay rent.\n\nSo my 3 year old and I (33f) are in the kitchen, listening to music on my phone and making dinner together.  She was actually helping which was pretty cool.  My parents come in and start making their dinner.  So they're puttering around and my dad says \"you want to shut off the noise?\" not in a mean way, but not particularly politely either.  I have had a few confrontations with him in the last year and I've asked him to be politer to me than I otherwise would've bothered in order to set a good example for my kid.  I said \"I'm happy to turn my music down if you can please ask politely\" I was looking for a please or at least referring to my music as music and not noise.  He says nothing and goes back to what he was doing, obviously annoyed, but just as obviously not planning on doing as I ask.  \n\nA few minutes later he says \"seriously time to turn the noise off\" and I replied \"please ask politely, my music is not noise.\"  My mom chimes in at this point asking him why he can't ask nicely and also pointing out that I was using the kitchen before them.  My dad is getting more and more obviously bothered/frustrated.  So then he says to me \"well if you're going to be that way I could just turn on my own music on my stereo that would blast this out of the water.\"  To which I responded \"I'm just asking you to please ask me politely.\" And then he stomps out of the room.\n\nHe then comes back in and says again \"it's time to turn off the noise\" to which I reply \"I will gladly do so once you ask me with respect.\" At which point he stamps over to his stereo muttering about how he's going to fix me and play his music really loudly.  I say \"is this really the example you want to set for your granddaughter?\"  He doesn't even respond.\n\nMy mom goes over and tries to explain that I'm being reasonable and he's acting childishly and if he just asked me nicely I'd turn it down or off.  At this point he's full blown pissed off, slamming him hand on things and spluttering with rage.  \n\nSo I look at my daughter and I tell her we're going out to dinner in town because Grandpa is being unreasonable and disrespectful.  He turns on the music and blasts it and as we're getting ready to leave she says \"Grandpa the music is hurting my ears.\" He didn't even respond (I don't think he heard her tbh, he's hard of hearing).\n\nBut we left and now I'm feeding my child pizza which I can't really afford.  I never yelled or raised my voice or spoke disrespectfully.  I just asked him to speak more politely and respectfully to me in a calm voice.  \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway.\n\nI'm on the audition committee for a speech and debate program at my university. At the beginning of this academic year, we accepted a freshman, call him A. Due to the nature of the program, auditioning people is a rather difficult task, because it's hard to capture what a competition environment is like, and it's hard to get a read on their ability to adapt to direction long-term, internalize concepts and use them without a script, etc. However, the committee is usually very good at finding good people.\n\nSo A joins the team, he had an ok audition, not the best but not the worst, but we needed one more person. Now, ever since he joined, I've felt that we made the wrong decision with him. He still does not understand some of the basic concepts of debate, he constantly re-asks questions. He will take some direction when practicing in front of others, but the next practice all advice will be immediately forgotten. Nobody can figure out how to get through to him. He has improved over the year, though very slowly - much slower than what is necessary to perform well.\n\nI think the worst part, though, is his social ability. He was a bit awkward/shy during the audition, which I personally chalked up to audition nerves. But that awkwardness only ever got worse. No one in this program wants to be around him. And even though this is mostly an individual competition, teamwork is important, and so is the social well-being of the club. This guy acts like he's a freshman in high school - I realize that almost everyone changes a lot over freshman year, maturity wise, but A has not.\n\nNow here's the part where I might be an asshole. Every year all members barring those on the audition committee re-audition - mostly so the committee can see what a good audition looks like before looking at the newcomers. No one is guaranteed to return - they still must have a good audition. Almost always, returners will get a slot. But I think we should remove A. From a purely competitive standpoint, it would be optimal. He's been in this program for almost an entire season, he consistently does average-to-poor, with very slow improvement. And it would ease social tension.\n\nNow, I don't know much about A outside of the program, but I don't actually know if he has made any friends since coming to school, and I think he might have some issues or something from his past that influences the way he acts - not like autism, but maybe some sort of upbringing thing. On the one hand, none of us are therapists, nor are we meant to be. But on the other, if we're the only people he ever hangs out with, then it'd be pretty terrible to kick him out - even if it's no one's responsibility to be friends with him, or tolerate him more than necessary.\n\nI know he wants to come back next year. He wouldn't know why he wouldn't be able to return, other than someone had a better audition than him - which will almost certainly happen anyway.\n\nWIBTA?",

      "title": "AITA For Getting Into an Argument with My GF's Racist Dad?",
      "description": " \n\nWe're both 26 and been dating for 5 months, she wanted me to officially meet her parents as I only met them once before when we ran into them at a mall. So last night we we went over to dinner at her parents place and before we went over my GF reminded me that her dad can be mildly racist and not to take it too heart or seriously. I'm brown and have a Islamic first name even though I don't practice and my GF and her family are Italian. \n\nNext he starts going on about how amazing Italy is and how italians have shaped western culture and have amazing cultural exports like cars, food, fashion etc. I again nod my head and continuing watching TV, my GF was helping her mom in the kitchen at this point and didn't hear this. He asks me what my country has produced for the world or if people like going there, I shrug my shoulders and say nothing and he laughs and is like hahah damn right.\n\nWhen the food is ready we sit down at the table and my gf's mom asks if I want some wine or a beer I opt for a beer and her dad stops me and is like woah slow down there I thought you're not allowed to drink? I just say I'm a neo-muslim and we are allowed to drink and smile and reach for a bottle of Stella. Then again when when he's telling me what his wife cooked he's like theirs pork in all of these dishes so you can just have the sides with a smile, I tell him I love pork and my GF gets me a piece of lasagna and a piece of porchetta which was amazing btw. By this point the tension in the room could be cut by a knife and I was trying to stay calm and not beat my GF's dad's ass back to Italy. He finally cut the shit for awhile and my gf and I spoke about how we met, then about sports, vacations we're gonna take and normal stuff. Then somehow we start talking about the education system here in Ontario and how he thinks there shouldn't be Islamic schools here, I rebutted saying if there shouldn't be Islamic schools there shouldn't be Catholic schools either nor any faith based schools funded by tax payer dollars. He got super mad at this and said called me \"Muslim Boy\" LMAO, I laughed and said ok and tried diffusing the situation but I was really mad at this point. And was ready to leave, my GF begs me to stay and I did because she drove here and I needed a ride back.\n\nWhen we were having dessert he stars blabbing about immigrants not assimilating properly here and not knowing english and how all Italians assimilated so well into Canadian culture. I was so annoyed at this point and told him to go back to Italy if he likes it there that much. He started laughing and told me to get out of his house I put my boots on and tell him he's lucky his my GF's dad and wait outside for my uber. My GF is calling me an ass and crying and said I should have just put up with it for 2 hours and not argued with him as now he hates me etc.\n\n \n\nTL;DR: GF has racist dad, makes racist comments throughout a dinner am I an ass for not taking his shit and arguing back at him?\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to be around my brother?",
      "description": "So, my brother has a long history of being an angry, abusive alcoholic. He has physically and verbally abused every girlfriend he has had (4 different women). He has been arrested and has done jail time for this, and was in jail for the last 3 months for his last attack (drunk and choking his girlfriend). He drunkenly punched my ex boyfriend 4 years ago which resulted in this boyfriend having to get surgery on his jaw and eat only soft foods for a month. It was incredibly hard for me to forgive him and be around him after this. He ended up doing jail time for this as well. On top of all of this, he's gotten into multiple drunken fights and drives drunk consistently. \n\nIf he was not my brother, I would never ever want to be around him. He has 2 kids and to be honest, has always been a good dad to them (which is the one thing he has going for him), but I think he's just a horrible role model for them and has put them through a lot being in and out of jail and abusing their mothers. \n\nAfter all of this and being increasingly uncomfortable around him the past few years, I have decided I don't want to be around him anymore. I've made this clear to my parents. I've basically stopped asking about him since he's been in jail. I opened Facebook today and saw that he updated his profile picture and one of his friends tagged him in a photo. \n\nI already planned with my parents that my boyfriend and I would come stay with them for the weekend after Thanksgiving. I'm super excited about it since I haven't spent time with my family in a while (we live 3 hours away). I texted my dad and asked if he my brother had gotten out of jail. He said yes. I asked if he will be there next weekend and he said \"I assume so.\" I told him if he is, we aren't coming and I'm sorry. He said he hopes I reconsider and my mom will be completely heartbroken. It upsets me that every time he does something like this it is completely swept under the rug and he is welcomed back with open arms. \n\nI'm upset because they didn't tell me he was going to be there (likely staying with my parents the whole weekend) but I also feel so awful because I don't want to make my mom sad and I was so looking forward to seeing my family. I don't know how to feel about it. Am I just being a baby? Should I just suck it up and go? I feel like I'm the only one in my family that feels so strongly about it. \n\nAm I the asshole for cutting ties with him and for not wanting to attend my family Thanksgiving because he will be there?

      "title": "AITA for ditching my friends last minute with my SO?",
      "description": "A year ago I met my SO (lets call her Nicole). She's a sweet and loving person, also really shy. When we began dating I introduced her to two of my closer friends (who are siblings) but for some reason they didn't seem to want to talk with her very much and preferred to talk to our other mutual friend present. By virtue of being shy she found it hard to start conversation, and my attempts at trying to initiate conversation between them was in vain. Later they told me that my SO seemed distant and \"unfriendly\" even when I told to them that its hard for her to meet new people.\n\nThey kept this coldness towards her and I have no idea why, but then a week later I was invited to hang out with them at a park and they let me bring Nicole. They specified that we should meet at 9AM, it opens at 9:30AM. I pick up Nicole and we get to the park on time.They weren't there, and half an hour later they still hadn't texted or shown up so we went to a nearby starbucks. Come 11AM I still hadn't heard from them after many texts and a couple calls to their phones, and we had been in starbucks for nearly two hours. I tried calling again, then Nicole and I started going home.  I assumed something important came up, so I wasn't mad. I was a little annoyed, but if something happened to where they couldn't text or call me then it must've been an emergency. \n\nOn my way home I got a text saying they were on their way. I called and said we had been waiting for hours with no response from either of them so we had left. This completely set them off. One of them started accusing me of leaving so I could go \"fuck my girlfriend\" and I was ditching them \"for that slutty bitch.\" Keep in mind, they never took the chance to even get to know anything about Nicole yet they were saying this. I told them it was unfair that we showed up at the time agreed on, and we were out for nearly three hours waiting on them without any response from them. They said I shouldn't have left without telling them but then I pointed out all the times I tried getting in touch. This kept going until I started ignoring their texts since half of it was just insulting Nicole. I showed her the texts and we just wondered why they pinned it on her when it was I that drove there and I made the decision to go home.\n\nEver since, they've been cold towards her. I've brought up how shitty they are to my SO and they shrug it off, saying that they don't have any obligation to like a person. What pisses me off is that we all consider ourselves family, and I always supported them and treated their SOs like a part of that family so they'd feel included. They never make attempts to be nice, and only ever blame her as to why they're so mean and exclude her from events. I really hope this doesn't sound like a SHP because its as dumb in my mind as it might be in yours. AITA for what happened??",

      "description": "Last night we had a party, some of my work friends, some of my fiancées work friends and my best buddy drove a few cousins and friends out here for the night. \n\nLast night was a blast. We had video games hooked up to 2 TVs in the living room, a table for card games, and drinking games in the kitchen. Everyone had a great time not an issue, not even much of a mess to clean up. \n\nToday everyone woke up happy not a issue. We all agree to head to Denny’s to get breakfast before we go to a small Star Wars convention being held in my town. This is where the real story starts. \n\nMy cousin (26F) we will call her Betty, she thought it would be funny to try to pants her boyfriend (31M) in the parking lot of the Denny’s. I was instantly annoyed that I had to even tell my 26 year old cousin not to try to pull down her boyfriends pants in a public parking lot of a restaurant in front of windows where family’s are eating breakfast with their kids. I told her “stop acting like a Jackass! I work in the community and I visit this Denny’s often while working. These people know me so just act like an adult.” She was obviously pissed that I said something to her in front of all our friends. \n\nWe finally get into the restaurant we’re sitting down ordering food. The waitress walks away and we’re all taking having a good time. There are 7 of us at the table. All feeling the pain from the night prior now they we all are over or close to 30. \n\nMy cousin Betty randomly reaches over and pinches her boyfriends nipple. This wasn’t a cute pinch. She grabbed ahold like her index finger and thumb was a alligator feeding on a snack. Her man let out a screech. It was unexpected and uncalled for. Instantly I’m enraged. I already had to ask her to not act like that outside and now she’s abusing her own boyfriend. I instantly started to aggressively talk at her. \n\nMe “What the fuck is wrong with you! Why can’t you fucking stop! Your 26 and I have to tell you to not pants your 31 year old boyfriend in the parking lot and now you’re doing this stupid shit” \n\nBetty” Your in your community stop talking to me like this!” \n\nMe “Yes we are in my community these people know me I visit here all the time and I don’t care any more your acting like a fucking bitch to your own boyfriend! Your tried to embarrass him outside and now you caused him pain to the point he screamed. If you were a man and doing that shit to a woman I would have beaten the fuck out of you! Your being a fucking cunt for no reason!” \n\nAt this point she storms out of the restaurant and doesn’t even eat her food. Everyone else stays and eats their food. We all pay the bill and leave. Betty goes up to my buddy and demands that they dive a hour and a half home right now and miss the convention they all originally came out for. My buddy not wanting to have any more conflict complied. We drive back to my house we all get out of the car and I can’t keep my silence anymore. I yelled.\n\nMe “I can’t believe we’re all the way back here what a fucking waste of time and gas to come back here because my cousin wanted to abuse her boyfriend” \n\nBetty: “This is your neighborhood don’t yell”\n\nMe: “This is my neighborhood! And I’m disgusted that my cousin treats her own boyfriend like that at 26 and doesn’t see a problem with her fucking actions! Now get your shit out of my fucking house and leave!” \n\nI walk in with Betty and my fiancée. I go upstairs to use the bathroom while Betty gets her things from the spare bedroom. I hear my front door slam closed and I go back outside. My buddy already left. No one even said good bye. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for getting mad at my cousin?\n\n\nTL;DR my cousin was abusing her bf and causing a scene so I said shit to her",

      "description": "It's more complicated than the title. Let me add some context for ya. \n\nMy (32F) boyfriend (34M) have a great relationship. He did cheat on me once early\n in our relationship but I've let it go and moved on. He's NEVER once since given me a reason to ever suspect him and he's been the paragon of honesty and love and openness since.\n\nThat being said, since we've moved in together I have admittedly gained 25) pounds (which I have been openly aware of and have already lost 3 of the 25) which has caused MY desire for sex to wane because I feel gross. He has been patient and wonderful and never pressures me, but because of the cheating i get hard in myself when it's been awhile since we've had sex and internally freak out. \n\nIt came to a head last night when he had a special event (don't want to get too specific for anonymity) and I had a shit cold so I ws feeling like a shitty girlfriend already and we hadn't had sex in almost two weeks because we've both been working 50-60 hour weeks with obligations on the weekend.  After a mini breakdown from me, I felt a lot better and we fucked three times before he left for this event.  I fell asleep before he came home and woke up to him sleeping next to me. \n\nI woke up before him, as is usual, and when I go use the tv I see he has porn left on it from the night before. Normally I have never had an issue with porn. I KNOW he masturbates and honestly, I look at porn, too. But for some reason this made me feel SO shitty. We had already had (what I thought was fulfilling and awesome sex where he came thrice) sex and, yet he needed to come home and jerk off? I feel very inferior and like my sex wasn't good enough. I don't want to porn shame him and when we go through period of dryish spells I want him to feel free to get off but... I don't know, man. This just hurts a lot.\n\nShould I say something or am I overreacting?",

      "description": "Brace yourselves, long background story (names changed for obvious reasons):\n\nWe're 3 friends: Jane, June and me. We've met at the University but Jane and June know each other since high school.\nI've considered both of them my closest friends, until June fucked up (explained later).\nBoth Jane and June left to different countries for work after school. We have a message group where we talk at least once per week and we've always met when they came back to our home city.\n\nSo June fucked up by not attending my wedding, she was invited a year before the actual date and she said she couldn't get a leave (as her leave requests were closed). BUT later the same year she attended a wedding of another friend from the uni (I considered them party friends, not that close). For this wedding she was able to get a last minute leave ( invitation came waaaay later than mine) and fly 6 hours plus 5 hours train to the other corner of the republic... for a weekend. Where's a will, there's  a way.\nMultiple times I've learned she was in  our hometown from FB /IG. She did not let me know.\nWe grew apart, she later apologized and we're fine, but a bit more distant.\nRecently she quit her job and is now back in our hometown for good, looking for  a job.\n\nIt's now Tuesday, June calls me hysterically that Jane has her phone off and does not reply messages since last Friday. She is 2 hours away  by plane. Everybody's freaking out. I don't want to go into the details and to cut the long story short, Jane is in trouble and not able to come by herself back home.\nAt this point June is on the phone with Jane's family and they plan Jane's pick up (the family had June's number). I only talk to June and get all information from her.At one point the decision is done that June and Jane's family would go to pick Jane up. I tell June I'm not able to get a leave from work but I can help in other way (financially or so).\nThey bring Jane back and she is admitted to a hospital.\nWe agree with June that she will ask the family if we can go for a visit and  that we will go see Jane together. The same day suddenly June tells me she is going for the visit with the  family and that she didn't want to ask them if I could join through the  phone and that she will ask when she meet them.\nLater that day I'm told that they don't want visits and that only family will go visit. Anyway June goes visit every time.\n\nThankfully Jane is much better now, but she doesn't have access to her phone. I'm told she's happy that I write her even if she can't ready it and that she says hello.\n\nStill I feel like this a sort of revenge for not going with them for a pick up and that June miscommunicated with the family about my position. I know every detail of what was going on, so its not like I will be dragged into this family matter. I was in the situation from the beginning, but talking to June only.\n\nAITA for thinking this is not fair?\nAITA for not going for a pick up?",

      "description": "She’s been out of work for awhile and I guess now her roommates are threatening to kick her out for not paying rent.  She came to me and asked if she could stay with me in my studio apt if that happens.  I asked her why she couldn’t move back in with her parents and she said that she has a really bad relationship with her mother.  I told her that she should go to social services and see what they could do to help her.  She just said thanks a lot sarcastically and left.  \n\nI feel a little heartless about it, I don’t want her to go homeless.  We’re just not that close and I don’t know her all that well to want to live in such a small place with her.  It’s a big leap to go from spending the night together a couple times a month to being around each other constantly.  ",

      "description": "So, I've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. But basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.\n\nI've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control.\n\nWell, it didn't stop. \n\nAnyway, since I'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, I've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them out of my window until I kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.\n\nThe noises are kind of, like, SKREEEEEEEOOOOOOOASH! SKREEEEASCCHHHHH!\n\nSo far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what I'm doing downstairs. I brush it off like it's no big deal and I really don't know what he's talking about. His audibly loud gf seems able to stop her moaning and screaming whenever the first floor Gargoyle makes an appearance.\n\nAITA for making gargoyle noises to ruin my roommate's mood because he won't respect my wishes to not have audibly loud sex in the middle of the night on weekdays?",

I was general asking about her idea on the paragraph structures. The argument spiral it out of control. And when we arrive at her doorstep (bottom of building as we usually depart there) we tried to conclude that we have different definitions on Sustainability, short term and long term. But what she said was \"you got the wrong definitions that's why our entire conversation is meaningless\" then I tried to talk back about how long and short is relative and ask her to point out where am I wrong.* \nShe argue I didn't check the dictionary beforehand (and she's better at English than me) , so I agree and tried to check with my phone but it ran out of battery. I ask for hers and she refuses. Normally we walk close to each other but she keep on distancing herself in this conversation. After I bunch of asking for it she replied with \"NO. This is my phone and that is your assignment, I have the right to choose what I do with it so go home to check it\"\n(Now that I type it out, I think it makes more sense than I heard it so I'm probably an ducking ahole)\nAnyway, it triggered me a lot as (rest of paragraph are contribution whining ) *I lend her a lot of my devices wherever I can, help her do her assignment despite I have basically zero knowledge and she didn't give me clear instructions and expect me to reach her standard perfectly , stay up late to collapse at 3 or 4 while I need to wake at 7 for 8 hours of class and still get blame for never staying for her. And rearrange my schedule for her thousands of times (disclaimer some of them are dates and I enjoy them)*\n\nAnyways the thought that she can distance herself from us to me made me very angry so I reply with then I will search at home and leave (with a few subtle pause in hope she will catch up)\n\nP.S. I know I shouldn't care so much about who do more I just don't want to get distanced so easily (or I don't want rejection?)\n\nP.S.2 let me know if you want more details\n\nTldr: we got in an argument and comes down to a definition on a word , my phone died and she refuses to check or let me check. I ask for it, she told me to go home for it , so I leave without a word",
