      "description": "Here's the deal:\nI have been friends with this one girl since 8th or 9th grade and now we are both seniors - this is mostly thanks to me, because for the past three years I have helped her study for her finals so she could pass since she is literally one of the worst students ever (not for lack of intelligence, just for lack of will). I helped her even with subjects I did not have or knew myself, so that means I studied before I studied with her.\n\nIn January, during our school break, I had been planning a backpacking trip across my family's state. I had invited her earlier, believing her mother would never allow her to come. I was partially right, but then literally midnight before we got on a bus, she told me she was going. My fwb was not so excited because he felt excluded whenever us three got together, but he couldn't do anything about it. So alright, then. Let's go.\n\nOur first day was incredibly nice. At night, when we went back to our hostel, we decided to all lie down on the double bed to talk and then maybe sleep. Earlier we had decided that me and her would share the double, and my fwb would take the single, mostly due to the hostess at the hostel that just suggested it. I rolled with it, even when my friend asked me if I wouldn't rather share the bed with my fwb. I told her it was all fine. I didn't mind it either way.\n\nAround 1am, we had all fallen asleep, but my fwb woke up and felt the need to go to his single bed since it was less crowded. I did not notice this, since I am generally a heavy sleeper, but I know that when I woke up around 2am, I was no longer hugging him. Instead, I was facing the ceiling, and my friend's hand was underneath my shirt as she was tracing my nipple with her fingers and playing with it. I was immediately shocked and I did not know how to react, but when she suddenly reached for my other boob, I turned my back to her, thinking she would get the message.\n\nShe did not.\n\nShe came closer to hug me from behind and put her hand underneath my shirt again, and I had to physically push her away. I could barely sleep for the rest of the night but did not make a move because I did not want her to notice I was awake.\n\nThe next day, I talked to my fwb about it and texted a couple friends about the incident. One of them answered me promptly and called it \"sexual assault\". That term scared the living shit out of me. No way, she's my friend, right? It was just... stupid. Right??\n\nI finally had the guts to bring it up when we reached the next town on our trip, later that same day. And I did not want to make it overly serious, so I just told her it was not cool. She didn't look me in the eye, and uttered \"sorry\" twice.\n\nFast-forward a week or so, and I am still friends with her, trying to put this past us. I am going to start volunteer teaching and it is my first time with a class of 20+ students. I was super anxious and told her I needed someone with me that day. She told me she would come, she just had to talk to her mother. Except she doesn't talk to her mother. Instead, she goes out drinking and smoking weed with my fwb and when I call her at 6.30am the next day, she doesn't respond. I call my fwb and he picks up, and I tell him I feel extremely sorry for asking him so out of the blue, but can he please show up for my class? He did so, and then told me where he had been, adding he was sick from the weed the previous night and had been puking his guts out and that he did not think my friend had gotten that drunk or high.\n\nOkay.  It sounds like my friend really does not give a shit about me.\n\nI confronted her about it a few days later. She told me I blew it all out of proportion. She told me I did not want to accept her apologies (is it an apology if you just say \"sorry\" without even looking the person in the eye?). She told me I pushed people away for no reason all the time because that's me. I let her speak. I didn't care about her words. However, that did piss me off. So a couple days later I decided I wanted her to truly think about her past actions, especially regarding that night she decided to touch me while I was asleep.\n\nI created a WhatsApp group with me, her and other random 13 people (my fwb and 2 other close friends of mine were there, though they already knew) and sent a text message detailing what happened that night. I left the group and let it be. She tried calling me and I did not pick up. She called my fwb and cried her guts out and said she was done in. She felt like she could kill herself right there and then, but she had no proper means to because her balcony was not high up enough (she has attempted to commit suicide before).\n\nHow did that impact her life?, you may ask. Or, what did the people in that group think? Well, most people in that group were from our school, and now all seniors and half of juniors know about it. And nearly all have sided with her, because I have a bad reputation among my classmates. They all believe I blew it out of proportion and that I am the monster for speaking up about something that happened. They have all voiced their support for her though made sure to do so when I wasn't in the room (my fwb told me about it).\n\nTL;DR: My friend was playing with my boobs while I was asleep and never properly apologised for it. When I realised she really did not care about being a good friend to me, I decided to expose her in a WhatsApp group with 10 people from our  school who consequently told others from our class. Most of them have \"taken her side\".",

      "description": "I've known the friend for 21 years. After university I worked, got some more qualifications and saved up and got my first place. She's travelled the world coming back periodically.\n\nOver the last 10 years she's become increasingly negative about me, saying I'm boring, flat is not very nice etc and about other people around her. This weekend I'd arranged for us to go out because she'd gotten upset about not being thin at the gym. On the way out I asked her if she would mind if I dropped her off at the train station because I had to pop and see another friend.  I'd pay for the train ticket etc. She then refused to to talk to me for the rest of the journey. When we arrived she told me that I was selfish and make every about me and she's always the one that makes effort in the friendship.\n\nI'm really hurt by this and feel it's really unfair. I've spent the last few years fielding her calls etc when she's down, organising days out and I've joined the gym with her so she didn't.  In the last year she's rarely been free at the weekend, she's busy with work friends etc.  So I've started to go out more with other friends and picked up a few  hobbies. I've had to rearrange some stuff recently with her due to illness and work stress but thought she understood why. She also didn't come to birthday (at weekend) because while she read the text I sent she didn't reply for a day and a half and I needed to book ASAP. I didn't think it would be a big ask for her to get the train as she'd previously said that's how she was going to travel that day. I feel the outburst is just the latest in a long line of emotionally draining interactions. I don't want to throw the friendship away but equally I've spent the rest of the weekend feeling so down and this isn't the first time. If I called time, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Ok so before I begin, I should probably explain my issues with my coworker. She is almost always 15-20 minutes late to work, forcing one of our other people to stay longer. She is dissrespectfull to everyone, including other coworkers managers, and even customers. I have seen her throw a knife because she was not allowed to take a break in the middle of a rush, I have seen her yell at a child for dropping his meal on the floor, one time she even walked out during a rush leaving us with no cashier and forcing people to stay late so the morning shift would not be behind on prep. Also before anyone comments it, several managers and nearly all our employees have complained to the owner about her, but she refuses to do anything about the sittuation. Now for the actual good stuff.\n\nToday she came in 25 minutes after her shift started, and everyone was already pretty mad as it had been a long day already. Before she had even clocked in she was telling us about this new brilliant buisness she has been selected for. Im not sure which MLM it is but basically she would be selling hair extensions on instagram after paying for a startup fee. She seemed on the fence about the idea still, and she was worried about the 500 dollar start up fee. This is where I began to try and influence her descision. I made up storys about how my aunt used to do stuff like that and now shes rich, I said a bunch of stuff about investments to make it sound like a good idea, basically I did the MLM recruiters job for them. What it all boiled down to was her getting overly mad about the other cashier, she said a bunch of stufd about how \"she doesnt need this money anymore\" and \"how much better she is since she has been selected\", and she sent them the money on her break.\n\nYeah thats really all I got, sorry for formatting im on mobile, let me know what you guys think.",

      "description": "WIBTA for treating her as her behaviour dictates? \n\nI don't think I'd be the asshole here, but I'm being treated like I am. Wall of text on mobile, please forgive me for any errors. \n\nNote: I say MIL but my partner and I aren't married. Been together just over 4 years and thinking about it, but her behaviour makes me want nothing to do with her, only her son and our family.\n\nSo our eldest child's birthday was in November at a local park, had his mum (partner's ex who I get along with well, no issues there with them and kids) there as well as friends, good day had by all. Until we get home and realize that my partner (henceforth called E)'s mother put up a rant on FB saying how she was so hurt that we purposefully left her out of her grandsons birthday, didn't even ask if she wanted to attend, etc. E commented, basically telling her it was just up the road from her house (less than 100 meters), she didn't bother to contact us asking what was planned, communication goes both ways, and we're sorry that we'd thought she'd been invited by the host and didn't contact her because she's usually at work.\n\nMIL then decides to out my pregnancy to everyone on her FB while calling us immature, all of this in the same status as before. I hadn't announced to anyone by that point except her and a few close friends, because I was at moderate risk of losing it (23 weeks on Saturday so going well!) That went over like you can imagine it would, and it hurt me a lot that she took that from me. \n\nBasically get the cold shoulder until earlier this month, when we have the Sex Reveal. She turns up and makes a comment about how she's surprised she even got an invite considering the birthday, which I ignore because eff it, this is our day.\n\nShe behaves somewhat (apart from some very nasty comments about the gender (male) and that E doesn't have a daughter because ex couldn't keep it - traumatic miscarriage), but when the kid's mum is packing up to leave she did the whole \"see you when I see you\" which is normal, right? Well MIL jumped on that and decided to say that she'd probably not see us at the next kids birthday (this weekend) as we'd probably \"forget\" to invite her again!\n\nI've since told them what MIL said as she said it while they were out of the room (everyone else heard it though!), and we decided to invite her this weekend to prevent another bitchfest. But she's basically invited herself to my baby shower, and I no longer want her there because of all of this that she's dobe, and have stated to the others that if she can't behave this weekend she's uninvited. She got wind of it and drama has been unfolding since. \n\nWIBTA? I don't think so but she's spreading this to other people in the family and twisting it so I am. ",

Hopefully) but I still made the effort to remain her friend and I'd like to think I did a good job. Every once in awhile we'd chat about something, and before long I noticed a pattern. Every conversation would im some way wrap around to a problem of hers, be it about boys or friends, I mean I aided her rapidly decaying relationship with her mom. Its been awhile since she's even talked to me and frankly I'm bitter, she doesn't owe me a conversation or friendship but goddamn, I feel used.\n\nGirl 2 is to a much lesser extent, but the two girls are friends and I've had to help them stay that way before. She snaps me everyday several times a day, and even askef me how her prom dress looked last night.

      "description": "This might get complicated so bear with me. Also on mobile so sorry for any formatting errors. \n\nI (22F) have a friend, we’ll call her Emily (26F) that has an annual New Year’s Eve Party. We are somewhat new friends, and last year was the first year I was invited to/aware of this party. I have been dating my boyfriend, Adam (24M) for almost 5 years, so I asked if he could come with me as I had shared every New Years kiss for 4 years with him. Now, Adam is an ex-addict and is completely sober, and doesn’t participate in large social events a lot. Emily vaguely referenced this in her response to me, and essentially said that “she wouldn’t want him to feel uncomfortable” and “she wouldn’t want him to just be sitting there” and “she wouldn’t want him to have no one to talk to”. Despite my assurance that I would obviously be interacting with him, these were her responses to my requests that he come. I took this as her telling me she didn’t really want him to come without REALLY saying it, so I decided I would not be attending her party (and subsequently did nothing for New Years that year, as it was cutting it close to the holiday). After the fact, Emily made a comment to me about how she “wasn’t sure if I would act different around Adam”.\n\nFast forward to this year, she’s having her party again and invited me. I did not respond to the Facebook event, and made other plans for New Years that are actually gonna be at my house with my roommates, as I had felt like my boyfriend was made to feel unwelcome last year and where he is not welcome, I am not welcome. I recently introduced my best friend for over 10 years, Amy (22F), to Emily. Emily invited Amy to her New Years party, too. Amy has known about the situation with me, Emily, and my boyfriend, and said she would be attending my party at my house instead of Emily’s, but responded to Emily’s Facebook event saying she would be attending. \n\nNow, a few days before New Years, Emily reached out and asked me why I wasn’t coming to her party, and I explained what had happened last year, which resulted in a discussion where she denied ever have saying any of the things that I clearly remember her saying, and apologizing “if whatever she said made it seem like that”. Ok fine, agree to disagree. \n\nBut now Amy has informed me that she will probably end up going to Emily’s party, as she’s going to another party beforehand that will be closer to Emily’s party than it is to mine. Now, I understand if she will be far away from my party, she absolutely does not have to go. I don’t have a problem with that at all. However, I find it kind of hurtful that she would still go to Emily’s party after knowing I was hurt and specifically choosing not to attend. I don’t really understand why she couldn’t just stay at her initial party, or go out to the bars or something instead? I also looked up the drive between the initial party and Emily’s, and it’s about 36 minutes. Not that close. Idk. I sent her a short text encouraging her to enjoy her New Years and explaining that I am not expecting her to come to my party, but my feelings were a little hurt.\n\nTyping all of that out it just seems super juvenile. Whatever, it’s her New Years to celebrate, so maybe I am the asshole tbh",

      "description": "Hi, I would like to share my story with you all.\n\nTwo summers ago, I had been riding bikes with my friends. For privacy reasons I'll call them F1 and F2. We'll call the scary mom SM.\n\nOur town was large, but our usual biking area was small. We were riding when F1 and F2 went down a grassy hill. It lead to another hill. These hills were very steep and I couldn't see the house of SM's because of trees. I was newer to the area than them, so I followed behind. F1 and F2 were standing there, beside the house which was on another hill. Again, this hill was steep, so I pushed my bike up the hill after them. By this time, they were waiting on the street and had left my veiw.\n\nThis is where the poop gets squished.\n\nWhen I get to the top of the hill, I am met with SM.\nShe was screaming about calling the cops and me, F1, and F2 about killing her kids. I tried to apologize, using polite pronouns. (Ma'am)\nShe yelled saying \"don't ma'am me! You could have killed my kids!\" It's not like I was riding a motorbike. And, her kids weren't even out in the back. They were peeking out of the door, wondering who their mom was yelling at. However, I still trespassed, and being a softy, I cried, fearing that she'd actually have the cops on our tails. She even had the phone in her hand.  She then let me go along. It turns out, F1 and F2 were just talked to. Not even once did she raise her voice. I guess I was the last straw. I didn't even know her house was there.\n\nAm I the asshole for accidentally trespassing?\n",

      "title": "AITA for cutting Mother-in-Law out of my life or at least have nothing to do with her?",
      "description": "I am pretty reasonable guy and family is extremely important to me. So for me to even consider cutting Mother-in-law out of my life is a pretty big deal.\n\nTLDR; Mother-in-law is unreasonable, self-centered, manipulative, toxic and more… Whenever she opens her mouth, only negative things come out of it. Verbally and mentally abusive to my wife and I am tired of her crap and have cut her out of my life. Currently, wife and baby are still interact with MIL.\n\nA lot more information about Mother-in-law (MIL): she likes to complain about everything, selective hearing, dismissive, extremely defensive when one opinion differs from hers, every thing should be done her way or it’s the wrong way, constant need for attention, demands appreciation for anything she considers helping, will call my wife to complain for hours about irrelevant things. \n\nStory time:\n\nAfter a year of marriage, the wife and I decide to try for our first baby.\n\nMIL decides to move to Florida to be closer to us so she can help out with the baby. After a few months, she turns around tells us that she is not happy here, feels abandoned by us and upset that we made her move out here… \n\n(We never asked her to move out here, wife talks to her everyday for hours and spends a few hours with her on the weekend – unsure where she has been abandoned or forced to move here)\n\nMIL gets a puppy to fill the void of being abandoned by us. Good puppy, poorly trained – poops and pees in the house, jumps on people, etc… \n\nEventually, we get pregnant and MIL seems to be trying to help in her way, which is the only right way to do thing. At about 6 or 7 months, MIL has an emergency and needs to speak to wife. She drives out to my wife’s work with her dog (private gated property – no pet policy) and wants to go on a walk to talk. As usual, the emergency is to complain about someone or something and during the walk, the dog gets excited, and tries to jump on a random worker walking past them. Person is clearly not comfortable with a dog trying to jump on them and wife says something along the lines of: ‘probably should not have the dog out here due to work policy and I need to get back to work it’s been over an hour’. MIL gets extremely upset by this and makes the following comments: \n\n1. Again accuses my wife of abandoning her and only the dog is supportive of her (makes no sense, because wife is clearly taking time out of her work day to make sure she is okay after stating it was an emergency and after finding out it is not an emergency still spent time with her). \n\n2. Then tells my wife that she is a horrible daughter and will be a horrible mother… \n\n(This is the point where I decided that I am done with her until she gives an apology – who says that to their pregnant daughter? Seriously)\n\nWife decides to take a break from talking to her mom and a week later MIL messages wife like nothing happened. No mention of the incident or apology. Eventually she gave a half-ass apology like ‘I am sorry that you were hurt by what I said’ (not an apology).\n\nI am going to fast forward to after the baby is born. We decide to do daycare as we both work during the day. MIL thinks we should hire a nanny so that it is convenient for her. She hires her friend, X, for an insane rate for a nanny with no experience. I’m no expert, but for $20/hr, we could hire someone with experience, cpr certified, baby education experience, the works… MIL agrees to pay for half of the fee and we begrudgingly accept to appease the MIL.\n\n2 months later, MIL has a falling out with X and the shit hits the fan. MIL fires X without consulting us, the parents, on a Wednesday morning. She then calls wife at work and says come pickup the baby, I fired X and I have yoga, doctor’s appointment and some other plans for the afternoon so I can’t take care of the baby. (I am so pissed off when I hear this – it really takes a certain type of person to be this inconsiderate)\n\nI start calling local daycares to find something ASAP and most are full. As a last resort, call a friend who runs a daycare (that was full 2 months back) and they know the situation and gladly make room for her. (Cheers to awesome friends)\n\nMIL calls wife later that night and asks when she would be bring the baby over so she can take care of her. We tell her that we found a daycare and we will be taking her there in the morning. She gets upset that we found a daycare and did not consider her in this decision.  (I wanted to tell her tough shit, baby had plans to go to yoga at daycare in the morning – but wife gave me the death stare). Wife sugar coated the situation and MIL accepted it.\n\nFew other events to note:\n\nMIL called my wife a bitch for not siding with her regarding X.\n\nThen when wife demanded an apology: ‘I’m sorry that you are unempathetic’\n\nMIL has decided to diagnose my wife as having a personality disorder and a hoarding disorder.\n\nThis is funny to me because I work in the mental health field and neither of these diagnoses applies.\n\nMIL has decided our house is unsafe because of wife’s hoarding, cat litter box, and the security cameras I installed since having a nanny. Refuses to enter our house and demands we bring the baby to her place if we want help with the baby. \n\nAll of this plus more\n\nI have come to the realization that MIL is toxic and I do not want to be around that. \n\nAITA for wanting to cut that out of my life? I refuse to interact with her and have left the decision for cutting her out of our life to my wife. Currently, Wife and baby still interact with MIL, but if things keep up – would not surprise me if wife cuts her out too.",

      "title": "AITA for getting upset with my husband for not hanging out with me at the gym?",
      "description": "So my husband and I do indoor rock climbing a few times a week. Some background: he has been climbing since he was in middle school and is really good at it. I hadn't ever really climbed before I met him, and neither of us had climbed in several years until we decided to get back into it a year ago. He's still a really good climber, and even though I'm still relatively new to it, I like it a lot and feel like I've improved a ton in the past year, but I'm still not as good as him. Also, the only type of climbing we do is bouldering, which is on 15' walls and requires no harness or ropes, i.e. you can do it yourself without a partner belaying you.\n\nWhen we first started climbing we stuck together more, because we were both new to bouldering and starting at the same level. But since he had previous experience he got good again way faster than me, plus as I got more comfortable climbing I didn't need him to be my cheerleader for every route. So now whenever we go, we both do our own thing (since the stuff we each want to climb is usually not on the same wall) and maybe check in with each other a few times over the hour or two that we spend there. This has actually bothered me for a while but not enough to say anything about it.\n\nThe breaking point was last night at the gym; I was on one side of the room climbing stuff at my level while he was off somewhere else. I saw something funny happen and went to go tell him about it. He was climbing with a couple other guys working the same problem, and I tried to tell him the story, but I felt like he brushed me off to keep hanging out with his new friends. For some reason this really upset me (I think in part because I was already having a not great day of climbing), and I left to go digest my feelings by myself and then talked to him in the car on the way home about how hurt I felt that he didn't want to spend time with me. He said he'll try to stick closer to me in the future, but I'm posting here because I still feel weird about the whole thing. \n\nSo it basically boils down to:\nI feel like he doesn't want to spend time with me, even though objectively I know that's not true because he says all the time how glad he is that I climb with him. I told him last night that I go to the gym for 2 reasons: to climb and to hang out with him, so when half of that doesn't happen it makes me sad.\n\nBut I can see his perspective too, he's a much more social person than me, plus since he's a better climber he wants to talk to people who he can get beta from. He and I are very different sizes (I'm petite, he's tall), so we have very different climbing styles. He can't learn a lot from watching me climb and vice versa, which is why he likes to hang out with other dudes there — they have more similar builds, climbing styles, and skill levels, so of course he can learn a lot more from hanging out with them.",

      "description": "A couple days ago I got a new cat. It’s a black kitty that I found roaming around at night. It’s definitely a stray and not a wild cat because it was very sweet and had no problem brushing up on a stranger. Don’t be alarmed, I’m not planing on keeping it if it’s owner shows up. I’ve posted it on several local missing pet Facebook groups to see if I can find an owner. \n\nAnyway, this is the second cat I have with my boyfriend along with a pug. This cat is very clean and doesn’t shed at all. Tonight me and my boyfriend got into a fight because he doesn’t wanna sleep in a bed with a cat. This just completely baffles me because we have slept in a bed with the other cat who is more outdoors and is much more unkempt. She sheds and is a little smelly but he has never noted a problem sleeping in a bed with her. We both have allergies to cats but truly I haven’t seen him have a flare up from the cats. \n\nThe argument consisted of him telling me that he can’t sleep with me if the cat is on the bed because it just grosses him out so much that the cat is near the pillows (not touching). He has brought the dog up onto the bed on multiple occasions and I am extremely allergic to dogs. I never complain because it makes him happy. Now once I get a new sweet kitty, it has to be a big deal. At the end of it he told me I had to choose to sleep with him or the cat and after hearing him yell at me and look down at the sweet little kitty I told him he can go sleep alone.

      "description": "We play boardgames at my house, and we've been playing frequently the past month. Today I can't play, and a friend of mine asked me if he could borrow the game to play in his house. I said no, and he didn't take it very well. \n\n'what's going to happen to it?' he asks, 'whats the problem?'. \n\nAnd the problem is 1) that he has borrowed things from me before and not taken care of them (to be fair it happened years ago), and 2) he is inconsistent with his word. This means, when he says he will give it back tomorrow,  I don't really believe it. \n\nThe thing is, I feel bad for saying no. Its probable that nothing will happen to the game and he will give it back no problem. And Im afraid being 'an asshole' about it may have repercussions in our relationship in some way. \n\nNonetheless, I don't want to lend him the game. Does this make me the asshole?",

      "description": "I feel like I should preface that we are in Canada and he is a white male with a warrant already out for his arrest. There is no risk of him being killed by the cops.\n\nI’ve lived in this house for just over a month and every damn day he is screaming at his girlfriend and I’m pretty sure he’s hitting her. I’ve heard stories in the past from other roommates that he has given her a black eye. \n\nRecently he’s been accusing me and my boyfriend of stealing. For example he came knocking on our door yelling that we must be the ones stealing his roaches because we were the only ones home at that time (not true) I told him we literally just bought weed off him why would we steal his roaches.\n\nOn top of him accusing us of stealing I know he’s stolen from his girlfriend but it happened the first week we where here so it didn’t seem my place to tell her as I was just happy not to be homeless anymore and didn’t want to rock the boat.\n\nNow, our stuff has been going missing too. Stuff left in the living room. Cigarettes. Food out of the fridge which sucks extra bad because we have the flu and can’t work to get money for groceries and someone stole the only food we had. I’ve thought about it and he is the only in the house who is unemployed. His names on the lease but we pay all the rent he lives her for free so to me it seems logical that he would be the one needing to steal.\n\nI’ve just gotten really sick of the abuse towards his gf,  the yelling accusations and stealing. I just want him out of the house for a bit and if the cops find him he’ll just go away for a couple months. I’ve debated calling Suicide watch on myself so the cops come to the house, waiting till it’s loud and calling in a noise complaint, or calling in a domestic next time they fight. \n\n\n\n\nTL;DR My roommate is accusing me of stealing which I’m not but I think he’s the one stealing from me. He’s constantly verbally abusing his girlfriend and rampaging through the house. He has a warrant out for his arrest and I’m thinking about getting the cops here so he’ll get taken away for a couple months (he’s told me that’s how long he’d go away for if caught) \n\n\n\nWIBTA for calling? I know it’s pretty serious to send someone to jail even though I’ve heard Canadian jails are pretty cushy but there’s already a warrant out for him so it’s not like I’m personally responsible for him going to jail I’m just speeding up the process. I don’t know for a fact that he’s the one stealing from us which also makes me doubt if I should call but regardless if he is the accusations and verbal abuse are too much I just want to live in peace.

I had my gun drawn because I had just been in a fight but I was watching this deer just roam around very peacefully in a very violent (and very fun) game. I accidentally hit the button on my controller to shot and I shot the deer. When I shot the deer I felt bad, my heart sank a little. I was actually a bit sad that this deer died, this fake deer that is really a line or two of some code. \n\nEarlier today I saw a fight at my school. One guy (guy 1) was punched in the nose because he confronted another guy (guy 2) because guy 2 unplugged the Wii the guy 1 was using. Guy 1 was bleeding and might have had his nose break. I was a witness to this but I didn't feel as bad as I should have about guy 1. I just didn't feel bad, I was more concerned about the blood on the ground and making sure it got cleaned up than him. \n\nI think I felt worse about the fake deer than my classmate who was actually hurt.

She said that she had somewhere really important to be tonight and was basically preparing herself to take the f, when I offered to write it for her. It was on Huckleberry Finn, which I've read a bunch and really love, so it would be a piece of cake for me. She says \"thank you so much\" and all that and everything's cool.\n\nLater that night, before I start the essay, I check snapchat and see that she's on a date with another guy I know. I got super pissed off that this was the \"important\" and \"urgent\" thing she had to do. So without telling her, I just didn't write the essay. And the next day at school, she had the nerve to get angry at me for not doing it like she wasn't on a date. Am I the asshole here?\n\n",

There was some form of threat made to my company by a worker or ex worker of the company and they were concerned enough to go to the police who said they weren’t really concerned by the threats. My bosses went around locking the doors (you can go out but can’t get in) and put up signs saying so. They didn’t tell anyone why they were doing this so I went and asked our front desk lady and was told everything was okay and my boss walked by while I was asking and just had the meanest look on his face, I said I was just really concerned and instead of offering me any words just glared at me as I met his gaze. It honestly unsettled me even more. \n\nAfter a bit they call everyone to the break room to tell us about the threat and how the police weren’t really worried but they were taking precautions by locking doors, understandable but at this point I’ve already had a panic attack in the bathroom because I could tell they were lying when they told me “everything was okay”. \n\nEven though no one really seemed all that concerned even though we never lock the doors like this I couldn’t shake my anxiety and uneasiness being there with how many shootings happen now days. I’ve been stressed and I couldn’t handle it, I ended up going home for the rest of the day. \n\nI was pretty certain of my decision but I know people are gonna talk shit on me leaving tomorrow and my own mother said it’s not what she would have done but she didn’t have to deal with the risk of shootings like we do now. I just couldn’t stop thinking about how I didn’t wanna die at this job is that’s what I was risking. I’m still gonna go back but I just didn’t feel safe being there today, am I the asshole for not staying at work even though they said it was “safe”?

      "description": "Throwaway account\n\n\nI am a 24 year old man who dated a 20 year old woman for over a year. For the last three months of our relationship i was no longer in love with her. \n\nAfter a year of being together, my own mental state and money issues were at all time lows. At this time i decided to no longer emotionally support someone else in my life. My ex GF (who will now be named \"sarah\" for amoninity) is an amazing person to speak with. One of the reasons i fell in love with her initially was she put so much energy into her hobbies and talent. With those highs of energy she had very bad lows, we shared each others fears of being left alone or bad experinces with others in school. This made me feel close to sarah, but this was getting into what made me happy. \n\nI feel like im always running out of time in my life. Esspecially in the last 6 months i stopped doing things for myself that made me happy. Things like my writing and editing were not being done, cause i wanted to spebd more time with sarah. Thinking the only solution to solve these issues was to step away from the relationship after her birthday in late october. \n\nRight before I was planning to break up, her parents fell behind on rent and within the week she was getting kicked out of her place. We disscussed on sarahs short term plan to stay with me for two weeks, then helped her move all her stuff out in the coming month. With the first 2 weeks at my place we did not have sex, just lots of playing games and talking things out. During those 2 weeks she asked me \"with me being kicked out of my place, do you still love me?\". I lied and said that i did, that sarah getting kicked out didnt effect how i felt about her. \n\nAfter 1 month she found a place with a roommate and with the help of my brother we were able to move all her stuff from a storage locker, to her new apartment. Her mother then starts having more heart problems, and i delay telling her i wanted to break up for another month. About a week before chistmas is when i decided to break up with sarah. She seemed calm at the time and we didnt really communicate since late december.\n\nOver the month of january i moved some of the last things she had at my place. only getting messages from her about getting rides to work from my brother, or just times when i can drop off boxes of her stuff. Then tonight when she picked up a box, was the first time i seen her afraid of me. Im not a scary looking boy, but that woke me up to write this down. So looking for dissucussion so i can figure out how to move on, i still dont want to lose talking to her. But getting back together as partners is something i dont want right now.\n\n\n\nTLDR Was going to break up with sarah, didnt after 3 months, lied to her the whole time\n\n",

There’s 5 of us in our friends group, 2 girls and 3 guys, two of the guys are currently going to two different schools while me and the other two girls attend the same school. It’s difficult to have a group hangout, we usually do a group hangout on the weekends due to distance. The two girls would hang out more than often without sometimes telling the rest of us. I love each and every one of them and we love each other unconditionally. So a friend that went to the same school with just me and guys a few years ago wanted to do a reunion to catch up. I suggested a boys night out as boys night only happens once every few months.... but the thing is the person from a few years ago is a girl and one of the girls in our group is upset that we’re excluding them. All of this was my plan, the guys decided that whoever comes is fine, and I also subsequently agreed to a group hangout. Am I the asshole for just wanting a boys night with a girl that we haven’t seen in years?\n\nTl;dr - girls in our 5 man group do their girl hangouts occasionally, a girl friend wanted to do a hangout with the guys, one of them girls is upset about the exclusion ",

      "description": "I go to the same salon every time I get my hair cut or colored, but this last appointment I decided to try a different stylist because she was supposed to be very good. Because she’s good, she’s hard to book with so I had to make an appointment several months in advance. Today the day finally came, and at first she lived up to the hype.  Very courteous, nice, talkative, informed, etc. \n\nAfter she had applied my color she set me down to process and I noticed she took a lot longer to come back than she had said the color needed. Same thing happened with toner and treatment. At this point, it’s a little annoying but okay. I’m not upset or anything.  By the time I finally get set back down to have my hair dried and cut, I’ve already been at the salon for 2.5 hours. My hair is shoulder length so there’s not a lot there, so it’s taken longer than it should have already. \n\nAfter she sits me down at her station again, she lets me know some clients of hers from out of town had asked if she could squeeze them in and she had said yes. This explains the long wait times earlier. Again, annoying, but I’m not up in arms over it or anything. As soon as she sits me down, she says she needs to give the walk in a quick trim and she will be right back. \n\nI waited for 45 minutes before I finally lost my patience and went up to the reception. I told them I wanted to pay for my hair color and leave at this point, which was hard for me to do to begin with because I hate confrontation. The receptionist told me he wanted to go speak with the stylist, and he’d be right back. When she came back with him, she was really nice and apologetic and told me she knew it was wrong. It was sincere. She gave me the color treatment for free and only rang me up for the hair color itself. I was still really upset and didn’t tip her. Now I feel kind of bad, so AITA for not tipping her after she discounted the service?  \n\nShe did also offer to cut my hair for free but I was upset by that point and just wanted to leave.  I will say, she obviously didn’t learn her lesson about squeezing people in because she told me to call her any time and that she would make time for me. \n\n\nTLDR: Hair stylist ditched me for a walk in, I complained and received a discounted service. I didn’t tip. AITA?",

Recently, a coffee shop opened near my school, and I've taken to going there a lot (almost every day I'd say). It's really peaceful and atmospheric, and is a nice change of pace from school. i like studying there (and I get a lot more done there than at home), or just hanging out.\n\nI'm thinking of going there later today to do my homework, but I don't want to buy anything. I've purchased something every other time I've gone there, but as a high school student (no job) this obviously isn't good for me money-wise.\n\nI'd feel bad for not buying anything though, because they are a business in the end, but I don't want to spend money. \n\nWIBTA if I went there and didn't buy anything?",

      "description": "Today I was running a few final errands for Christmas. My last one of the day was to drop off a purse my boyfriend's mom gave me to a coworker. I didn't like the purse, but it was a really nice one, so I wanted to give it to someone who'd like it instead of tossing it. My work parking lot is a shitshow, and well known in my town for being poorly designed. Mix that with all the new discount retailers that opened up there and the fact it's the holiday season, and the lot was an absolutely crowded mess. However, I got in the lot fine and gave my coworker the purse. She thought it was great. Cool and good. I pull out to leave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main entrance/exit for the shopping center is a 3 way stop. Entrance traffic does not stop, but exiting traffic in all three ways do. Both the left turn and the straight stops were backed up a while, but I pulled right up to the stop on the right turn side. People going straight just kept going straight, not letting anyone else in. In California, the person to the far right would have the right of way at such a stop (after all incoming traffic). But, it's So Cal, everyone thinks they're the most important person in the world and that everyone else comes last. A lot of people in my suburb have a first come, first serve mentality when it comes to stop signs. Finally, some incoming traffic drives in with his left turn signal on, so the people going straight have to stop. Because this guy is turning left, the people waiting for the left turn can't quite go until he's cleared the intersection. This lead me to believe I was good to turn, so I started my right turn as soon as I see him start his left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat happens next is a loud honk, right behind me. I look in my review mirror and a car is right up my ass. I guess the lady turning left to the exit had started her left turn as the guy had started his, instead of waiting. So we both ended up turning at the same time! And of course, the light to get out of the shopping center takes forever and she's right behind me, glaring, the whole time. I know technically the rules of the road say she was in the wrong, but from a nonlegal perspective, am I suffering from the same mindset I described before? I know she was probably tired of waiting to turn, but I still think she's kind of a bitch for turning when the other guy hadn't even cleared the intersection, and for nearly rear ending me and then honking at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I am the asshole, I accept that. I used to have to drive around in Los Angeles and the SF Valley, and I've learned that you have to balance offensive and defensive driving if you want to get anywhere. That being said, I try to stick to defensive in my little suburb. Though...... I've almost been hit so many times at this intersection (whether I'm the incoming traffic or not), and I'm starting to wonder if I just suck at driving....",

      "description": "Bit of a long story, we never officially dated because when we met we were studying abroad together and she had a boyfriend back in her home country. By the end of our time abroad we'd pretty much been a couple for several months in terms of how things were when we were alone together. When we were around friends though it changed and everything had to be kept a secret, which took a significant toll on my mental health. \n\nAfter our time abroad she broke up with her boyfriend and went back to her home country in Europe and I went back to Australia. She didn't want a label but she wanted me to come visit her around my exam time and when I told her I couldn't she got nasty saying that I would never achieve any of my goals because I couldn't follow through with little things like travelling to see her. This was one criticism amongst many that she had including criticising my choice of engineering discipline because it showed disregard for the environment, as well as for the political affiliations of my friends, not being vegetarian and a few other things.\n\nThe constant criticism hurt me, I felt very depressed at this point, a lot due to me not re-adjusting to life at home after my year abroad, but the relationship didn't help either. Before she met me there was another guy she had feelings for who left because of her boyfriend. Hearing that she was then single, he came back into her life and they started travelling together and I felt very uncomfortable with it, and despite the fact she promised that it was me she wanted, I didn't feel I could trust her. This was the point where I had enough and I stopped responding to a lot of her messages. She ramped up the scale of the abusive messages she'd send and at times she'd hit a nerve and I'd respond. \n\nFor about 6 months this carried on until she called me out for being an asshole who didn't ever care for her and was too immature to hold down a relationship. I did know that she was also struggling with depression as much as I was, but I felt so much better not talking to her so I just couldn't bring myself to respond, or really communicate that to her. I know I should've tried explaining that to her but I found it too difficult at the time. \n\nWhen I finally got around to explaining that I left because she was hurting me, and apologised for not communicating or ending it in the healthiest way, she told me that I was just trying to make myself out to be a good person when I'm not by apologising and didn't believe I was genuinely sorry. She believes that me handling breaking it off by not responding to messages was much more harmful than anything she ever did to me and that I'm the asshole here. I find it hard to objectively view this situation, please help me Reddit.",

      "description": "Okay, so let me explain... I met a guy last November on Bumble and we hit it off immediately during our first date. The chemistry was insane and we ended up seeing each other at least twice a week since then. He would always plan really fun but expensive dates whenever we go out. He insisted on paying for everything even though I wanted to split the bill multiple times. The sex was also amazing.  However, I  don't really have a high sex drive, so we'd have sex but not all the time.  Thankfully, he never forced me to have sex when I didn't feel like it.  The weird thing about him though is that he transforms into a completely different person when we aren't together. He would be cold, detached, and uninterested when we talked about how our day was going, any random topics, etc. He explained to me that he just doesn't like texting &amp; I understood that, so I never forced him to text me daily. What I don't get is why he only likes to talk about sex when we do end up texting and why he would always send me dick pics at night even after I told him that sexting is not my thing. I tried to engage in sexting twice to try to please him and I did enjoy it. I just didn't want to repeat it again and again. He still didn't stop. He said that since we don't see each other as often as he wanted, he has to express his sexual needs in another way.  It really made me question his real motive of dating me. He assured me that he would never go on \"real dates\" with someone if his intentions were purely sexual. The fact that he also brings up spending so much money on me also rubbed me the wrong way, even though he said he was only joking. It made me think that he felt entitled to have sex with me because of how much time and money he spends on me. Two weeks ago, I've had had enough of the dick pics so I decided to not reply to him anymore.  I still like him a lot but it has been extremely exhausting arguing about this on almost a daily basis. I'm posting this today because he texted me this morning and I accused me of treating him like shit and for not exerting effort to make our relationship work.   \nSo am I the asshole here for not pursuing this relationship any further? I don't want to explain myself anymore because I feel like he knew this was coming and we will just end up fighting again. Honestly, I think we are better off not dating each other because I am unable to satisfy his needs. I feel a little guilty though, since I can't deny the fact that he has done so much for me.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnglish is not my first language btw, so apologies if made grammatical errors. ",

I earn a bit more than my parents do, who are both into their late 40s.\n\nThey recently brought up that they want to purchase a good piece of property which is just adjacent from our family home. The catch is they want to get it through a bank loan that would probably sum up to 58 grand or more – which they would apply under my name. \n\nWhen I asked why, their explanation was straightforward: They think it's a good investment, I earn more and have cleaner bank records they don't have the best financial history around. \n\nI haven't given them a clear answer yet regarding this yet, but the moment they asked, it was immediately a no for me. \n\nI don't want to sound selfish or ungrateful towards my folks. They're good people. But getting that loan would put a lot of pressure on me. They've made bad financial decisions in the past and if they don't meet their monthly dues with this loan, they know I'm going to be forced to pay it to keep my credit score on the good side. There have been times when they've borrowed significant amount of money from me, but have failed to give it back. \n\nI suppose I should also mention that I still live with them (they refuse to let me move out because they think if I do, the money I contribute to the family bills will lessen), I pay for our car (which they wouldn't let me drive because I'm not yet \"a very good driver\"), and I help with other expenses at home like my younger siblings' tuition fee in school and the groceries. \n\nI'm frugal enough to say that I have ample savings for myself, but I know that a huge chunk of what I make has always been channelled to the household for the past three years. \n\nAm I being an a-hole daughter for not wanting to lend them a hand with their loan?

      "description": "A friend of mine I've had for a decade now and I just recently started taking a college course for a programming language and we're about a month in. Though we both find the class difficult, the friend is struggling a bit more than I am with the class as a whole. \n\nSo far, I've helped them quite extensively with all of our assignments, homework, and classwork. I've also made several suggestions on how to perhaps get better with the language (these include methods that I've been using to try and get better) like studying their vocabulary, practicing by creating random useless programs that pertain to what we've learned, researching things they don't understand or asking me, etc. \n\nWell, this past week we were assigned a pretty difficult assignment that was about four times in length (in terms of workload) compared to everything we've been doing thus far. I offered them three different opportunities to work with me over the week/weekend (scheduled ahead of time) on the assignment but they kept saying they were doing other stuff every time one of those opportunities came up. \n\nWell, I decided to push forward anyway and start working on my own during the third opportunity. It took me roughly 12 hours to finally complete the assignment and the day after my friend asked me if I could just send them the code \"to use as a reference\". I offered to just meet with them on Skype so we could just talk and I could help them whenever they had a question plus I could see their screen and point out any issues they might be having. They refused and said it'd be easier just to have the code as a reference and I said no, I would not give them the code. They said that I was being a jerk for not helping them the way they thought would be best and that it's a shitty way to treat someone I've known for so long. Am I the ass hole and should I just give them the code? Should I have handled this a different way than I did?",

      "description": "I'm M22, she's F23. She's going to graduate with her masters in a few months and has never had a job before. Her family is pretty well off, her dad is a dentist and mom is an accountant and she lives with them where they provide her with around 1k+ a month in allowance. Now she wants to move in with me, I rent an apt by myself and said she'll pay half the rent. I'm ok with this as we've been together for almost a year and talking about this now seems like a good step. So when I asked her about how is she gonna pay for rent and bills etc she said her allowance from her parents will cover half the rent and bills and then she's going to expand her instagram (she has like 8k followers) to get money through affiliate marketing. I was pretty against this and told her she needs to get a job and go into the real world like an adult and make real money. I told her that with her parents allowance and her working anywhere even for min wage full time she'll have a good monthly income and be able to save and buy things instead of struggling month to month. Also she doesn't realize that she'll have to struggle month to month, after bills and rent she'll have only a few hundred dollars left and I think she expects me to pick up the tab which I'm not going to even though I'm on track to make 70k this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all this and how if we were to move in she'd need to get a job and move into reality where people work and don't just go to school for no reason. She got upset by this and said that she can make some money off IG from posts but I don't think she can make that much from posting pics of her ass and tits (even though they're nice). I also told her its because of her friends not being in the real world like her she hasn't real seen it, all her friends have wealthy families and live off them and just go further into school without ever having a job.\n\nAfter all this was said she was really sad, and said I made her feel like a bum and that I'm an asshole, dick etc \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this?",

The new year rolls around and he still hasn’t gotten them and it’s to the point where the passenger side one is falling off halfway.\n\nWell I had owed him aroun 40$, so I went on amazon and looked up windshield wipers and for his car they happened to be the exact price of what I owed him! Sweet! So I give him this offer: do you want me to buy them, or do you want the cash? He quickly declined in the most rude way possible and freaking out on me that he couldn’t afford it. I called him out on his behavior and he turned it into a full blown fight right before he had to go to work for the day.\n\nNow my question is this, am I the asshole for offering? I feel like if I just chose to buy them for him as a way of paying it back, I’d be the asshole, but in this case I feel like I’m not. Thoughts?",

The guy I went to school with was kind of a dick to me in a couple different ways through out the years and never really spoke to him. I didn't know he was gay till that point but didn't really care that much as long as my coworker was happy. After work that same day I was hanging out with a friend I also graduated with and mentioned that so-and-so from school was dating my coworker. \n\n\nThe next day I get about 10 long Facebook messages from guy from school telling me that I was spreading rumors about him and that he wasn't out of the closet yet and now a girl he hates from high school knows and will use it against him. Apparently my friend told their friend (girl who hates him) about former classmate being gay. I honestly thought classmate was out of the closet since he was openly dating a man who was telling others about their relationship.\n\nMy other friends think I should have asked former classmate's permission before telling anyone about him dating my coworker. Should I have asked for permission? Am I the asshole for kind of outing him?",

I had a long day, so I pull up in my usual spot, when I notice 2 guys hanging around the corner of the store. It’s dark, but they seem to be pretty young, I’m guessing below 18 for reasons apparent in a bit.\n\nBefore I even leave my car, the taller one approaches. I’m a 5’2 girl, so this obviously intimidated me a bit. I give him the side eye and he backs off, but when I get out to go in he confronts me and asks me to buy him and his friend a Dutch. I’m not a smoker of weed or tobacco so I’m clueless when it comes to things like this- admittedly he had to repeat it like 3 times before I even knew what he was talking about. I said no- he gave me a look. \n\nWell, I told the owner of the convenience store. It’s dark out, on the edge of a neighborhood that isn’t so great. I don’t think they have any ill intent, but it’s kindof trashy.\n\nHe presumably sends them away and I get my monster energy. As I’m leaving, the two guys yell “Fuck you, bitch!” in my general direction. I’m a little heated after a long day and respond “Go make some money!”, and flash my lights towards them. \n\nNow that I think about it, they were probably just too young to buy tobacco and not broke(their clothes were pretty nice), but I’m literally going to school for a criminal justice degree. Not gonna buy cigars for potential minors.\n\nI do still feel bad about my outburst but feel justified at the same time- AITA?",

      "description": "In March 2017 I was scheduled for an abortion after an unexpected pregnancy. I decided I would try to keep the baby last minute and told my grandfather. He called me to yell at me that I should paint my face black and stand in the WIC line because if I keep my baby I'll be a welfare queen. He said I have nothing to offer a baby. Those are the two things that stand out specifically after time has passed but there were other, hurtful things as well. I told him that I was under duress and did not appreciate him yelling at me, said goodbye, and hung up. He texted me to have a nice life.\n\nI don't hear from him or his new wife (married one month after this incident) until two months after I have the baby. He shows up at my mom's house while I was there and I was very civil. \n\nIt's been about another year since I heard from him. My mom is urging me to let the past go. I refuse. He says he will not apologize because \"it's how he felt.\" I'm not asking for an apology for his feelings, I want him to acknowledge that what he said was hurtful, racist, uncalled for, and untrue. Then I will talk to him again.  Additionally, i dont want my daughter to develop the same relationship with him that I had - he was very harsh, critical, and judgmental. Not a person that I'd consider nice. Not a person my daughter needs in her life.\n\nMy grandfather and his wife requested that I send the baby up to his house with my mom today to collect Christmas gifts. I said no. My cousins, brother, aunt, and mom went up to do Christmas.\n\nWhen they came back, my family (except my mom) said that my grandfather's wife called me a bitch when she realized the baby wasn't there. They gave the couple a framed portrait of all us grandchildren for Christmas and my grandfather's wife said she needed to cut me out of the picture to be complete.\n\nNow, my mom said she needed to video my daughter opening the gifts to send to them. I said no, that I have no obligation to allow them to see her. I told her if my daughter was only allowed gifts at the expense of seeing them, then we don't need the gifts. I will not accept bribes or mistreatment. All of my life my grandfather has told me \"I will give you x, y, z if you do a, b, c.\" His love was conditional and had to be earned.\n\nI don't believe in conditional love of a child and I dont want to perpetuate this with my daughter.\n\nSo am I the asshole? My husband agrees with me and I feel just, but I dont know if I have tunnel vision from a hurt I should have let go. ",

I’ve told her that she can travel with him all she wants but that I want no part in it. This obviously pisses her off but I really want to stick to my guns on this one principle. \n\nSo, am I in actual fact, the asshole?",

      "description": "My friend and I are playing Age of Empires. I've played the game for much longer and therefore I'm also a lot better at it than he is. Problem is he thinks very negatively about himself. \n\nWhen we play against each other he looses and gets frustrated because he never wins. I feel for him, always having to lose and I've tried to play dumb just to let him win for once, but he noticed and didn't like that I did that. So we kept playing and he kept losing and kept geting frustrated, but now we get to the point.\n\nIn the game there's a way to activate handicap for players so it gets easier to play. So I activated it for him but not me and lo and behold; he actually won.\nThis made him real happy and proud, he rubbed it in my face and I acted along. I thought I did good, I just loved how proud he was. \n\nNow later on, I'm starting to have this moral debate in my head wether tricking him to make him happy is actually worse than keeping it real and letting him get down when he looses.\n\nSo am I the asshole for tricking my friend?\n\nP.S: Sry, Im bad at keeping texts short.

      "description": "So I’m using the word friend in the title but in reality this person is more of an acquaintance; I’d help her move house if she asked but couldn't tell you her address off by heart.\n\nFriday morning I was out and about shopping in town when I saw this girl. We chatted for a couple of minutes about life and moved on. The last time we saw each other was a month ago at a mutual friend’s birthday party, and don’t chat over text. I was staying at my boyfriend's that night, where I have a couple of changes of clothes as well as loungewear I usually change into when I’m there. I did exactly that when I got there about an hour after being out and coincidentally seeing this friend, and we stayed in all day.\n\nThe next morning I walked home via town since I needed to pick something else up. As ‘luck’ would have it, I saw this friend again (she wasn’t in any uniform and I honestly couldn’t tell you where she works so I don’t know if she was working nearby or something). The crux of this is that I was wearing the same trousers, shirt and jacket as the day before when I’d last seen her. This was because I frankly saw no need to wear another shirt or pair of trousers when I’d literally had them on for around 2 hours in total the day before, and they weren’t stained and didn’t smell. She didn't mention this during our 30 second ‘oh hello again’ chat.\n\nThe day goes on, and in the evening I get a message from a friend asking how I was and specifically if I was good for cash. I have a steady job and pay my rent and bills on time, and have never asked friends for money. I said I was and asked why, and was told that the girl I’d bumped into had put a message into a group chat she was in with a couple of others saying she’d seen me and I looked rough, specifically mentioning how I’d worn the same set of clothes twice in two days.\n\nI wasn’t seething, but I was annoyed. I’m not a gossip, but don’t really like to be the topic of conversation in such a way, especially when there’s nothing to talk about. I sent the girl a message saying that I’d heard that she was worried about me, but there really was no need to be. I don’t like JADEing, so didn’t tell her about the fact I was in a different set of clothes for the day after she saw me. I got a reply from her saying that she was here if I needed her, and our friends would rally around me if I was in financial distress - she totally ignored me. I sent a message back being firmer and saying that there was no reason to be concerned, and that I’m a big girl who can handle herself, not that I needed to. I never got a reply back, but my friend who initially told me about it sent me a message about an hour later saying that the girl had only been concerned and I was out of line for slamming her down like I did.\n\nIn my biased view, I don’t think I was wrong in this situation. However, since I have a conscience and someone’s already reacted negatively I want to know if I am wrong and need to apologise.",

      "description": "Hi Reddit,\n\nSo yesterday I pulled up near the bus stop where I usually catch the bus to Uni. I checked my phone to see my messages and two of my female co-workers in our work group chat asked if anyone was in the area I was in and heading to uni (for context there is a group of around 20 of us that are pretty close as we are all early 20's and spend a lot of time together at work). I said that I was and I'd help them out with carpool (our uni has a three for free parking policy) that way I wouldn't have to catch the bus as it's usually pretty unreliable. \n\nI didn't hide this from my girlfriend and I told her straight away and she seemed a bit off at first but didn't say anything so I didn't really think much of it. Later that night we had a massive conversation about how that's just not something that you do and that it can be seen as weird. I explained to her that I would never cheat on her or anything and that I was just helping out two of my friends but she still didn't feel good about it. I tried very hard to understand her point of view but I am still unable to see how it is a big deal. I asked if she was upset because she thought that I would be unfaithful or something and she said that it wasn't something that she was worried about. She just see's it as a guy shouldn't do that with girl kind of thing (she explained how she would find it weird if she did that with two of her close guy friends) where as my parents raised me in a way where I see no difference between guy friends and girl friends. \n\nAm I the asshole here? Am I being insensitive? I don't just want to not do something because my girlfriend would get mad at me (she also stated that she doesn't want me to do this). Thanks ",

You know, enjoyable to be around, fun to talk to, gave a shit about things. The reason we broke up actually stemmed from the fact that our personalities didn't really gel (I was/am a pretty sad person and she wanted someone who paid more attention). Anyway, she had been on medication for depression and it has caused her to gain some weight over the past year and a half or so. One day she kind of up and out of the blue asked me if I wished she was skinnier.  I didn't think that there was any other option, and so obviously I said no. The thing is, I kinda did. I'd never tell her that, as its her body and she can do whatever she wants, but that didn't mean that it wasn't how I felt. AITA for thinking this super shallow thing and not putting enough emphasis on the other parts about her that I liked and were unarguably more important? I think so, but I want to know your opinion.

We live together almost from the start of relationships.\n\n2. His mom works in another country and visits him twice a year. She has a flat in different city, so when she arrives, they meet and live there for the whole period.\n\n3. His mom arrived yeaterday, and we both went to this city to spend some time with her.\n\nThe initial plan looked like that: we spend december 29-30 with her, then december 30-31 we go back and celebrate anniversary&amp;New Year. After that he returns to mom for one more week, then she leaves.\n\nToday it turned out that we stay.\n\nHe knows what an antisocial person I am. I can’t even have eye contact when talking to people, not mentioning absolute nonsense that comes out of my mouth in the minute of stress and willingness to kill myself when people in the room are too loud (that scares me a lot). He knows that tomorrow there will be 8 guests, and that’s a fucking lot for me. He knows that his family will never allow me to sit silently in the corner. He has really loud family.\n\nSo, when today I mentioned that we should leave, he gave me the sad look and said “but I had so little time with mum”. And then started to convince me that we should stay, because “I can’t do it like that, I can’t leave her in the New Year’s Eve”. With eight guests around, I bet she will feel so fucking lonely.\n\nI cried the whole evening. I wanted to leave by myself, but he didn’t let me. Eventually, he agreed to leave with me, but I refused. I told him “anyway, the celebration is 100% ruined for me. Be with your family, and I’ll just wait for this to end”.\n\nNow I feel like bitch, because I’m gonna totally demonstrate that I FEEL BAD HERE and he is the only reason why. I don’t want him to have cozy celebration. I wanted that day to be ours. I didn’t want to spend it in fear and loudness around. Still, I understand how hard is to say “no” when your mom looks you in the eyes and begs to stay.\n\nAITA for blaming him and behaving like sad shit while I actually CAN emphasize and will not die because of one loud evening?",

      "description": "So my bf (26) and I (23) have been dating for a little over 2 years now and there has been this one girl, C (23), who he has been friends with for 4 years. They met through work and I actually worked with her briefly before as well, before me and my bf were dating. \n\nInitial impression of her was that she was a little ditzy but super friendly and spiritual (as in horoscopes, crystals, tarot cards, etc.) I kind of always had a flirtatious vibe from her when it came to my boyfriend, but since she's so sweet, I figured it was just me and if I befriended her, maybe I'd see that is just her personality- or even better, she'd see her flirtatiousness bothered me and sorta just backed off out of respect. \n\nWell, as you can guess, that's not the case and it's only gotten worse. \n\nIt started on my birthday. My bf and I ended my birthday night at her house because she was watching our kitty.. since it was so late, we (for some unbeknownst reason) spent the night. My boyfriend and I on her bedroom floor, her in the bed and my kitty at the foot of her bed. In the morning, my bf woke up and moved over to my kitty and cuddled with him -- ya know, what ever. But then I noticed she woke up and was just... gazing at him. She didn't see I was awake yet but she just kept looking at him with this stare that made me uncomfortable. As soon as she saw me, she jumped a little, got out of bed and offered to make breakfast.  \n\nI pushed it aside. As i tend to do with internal conflicts. I went out to get drinks with her, just the two of us, to try and bond (which she brought her friend with her to). Then she moves to Portland- YAY! \n\nThen her birthday comes along and she invites my boyfriend to stay with her for a week in Oregon to visit. To be fair, I think we were both invited and planning to go ; however, something came up at work and I was unable to go. \n\nHe still did though... and the whole time I felt super uncomfortable. But I shoved it down and kept telling myself I trust him and it'll be a quick week. This made me uncomfortable because they had previously hooked up about two months before me and my bf started dating and I had already told him she makes me feel uncomfortable with how flirtatious she is towards him.\n\nHonestly, the week was fine. I got through my anxiety and its over with now.. but then she moved back (cue the eyeroll). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo make things quick, I'll just start listing the other things: \n\n1. She came over my house at 1:00am when I was sleeping because she needed to \"Vent\" to my boyfriend. He never woke me up, he informed me through a text message that I woke up to at 2:30 am -- where he still wasn't in bed yet so I knew she didn't leave much before I awoke. \n2. My boyfriend and I got into a fight. He told me he was going to \"grab a drink with a few ppl from work\" when he got off at 6. Instead, I saw on her Instagram story that they were playing pool , went bowling, an he came home around 1 am. We got into a big fight about this after and during that fight he told me that if I think he's going to stop being friends with her for me, that I'm really mistaken and he's not making me stay around. \n3. Last night we got into a stupid argument (truthfully I don't even know what about). He left the room, and about an hour later, I went into the living room and he's just chatting away on the phone with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat last one is really not a big deal.. but he knows that I don't like her, I don't trust her and I've had numerous times where I've expressed this to him.. I know they were friends for two years before we started dating.. but they were really just work friends besides that one time they hooked up and now she just randomly pops up. He has so many friends- guys and girls, and I just don't understand why he has to hang out with her and chat with her all the time. If they passed by each other, I'm not saying ignore her... but I just feel like their relationship isn't just friendly on her part and it really does make me uncomfortable. \n\nAfter two years, I would just think he would .. idk put my feelings first? I've tried befriending her and I just feel like she takes advantage of it and I really have this gut feeling of her bad intentions. I really don't like her and I don't know how much longer I can stand seeing/hearing her name pop around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting him to cut ties with her ? And what advice do ya'll have for me? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading everyone ",

We miss each other dearly when she's not able to go, and it gets harder and harder to leave. \n\nThe problem; Next spring, I have the chance to study in Spain for half the semester. This is something I have always wanted to do. It's corny, but northern Spain has an almost mystical status in my mind because most of my family traces its roots there. I've been before, and the study abroad will be in a place where I've stayed (Oviedo, in Asturias). I meet all the requirements to go and it'd be an amazing experience.\n\nWhen I told my SO, she was against the idea. She said that it would be a really long time away from each other and she hates the idea of me being away so long, as well as that she would worry for my safety. I agree with her and that I'll miss her, but this is an opportunity for me to spread my wings and experience what it would be out in the world as well as return to a place I have a lot of connection to. She says that she doesn't agree because I travel a lot anyways so I shouldn't go on the study abroad, and that I've already been. She's pretty adamant about not wanting me to go, but included that she does not want to stop me from going and will fully support me if I decide to study abroad.\n\n(*Note:* I know it's common for couples to worry about cheating during trips like this, but neither of us are worried about that. We believe that it is our own intentions and willpower that matter, nobody else's. This is a level of trust we have built from scratch as we both came from really awful relationships).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I'm torn between studying abroad for half a semester and staying home. My SO doesn't want me going because she'll miss me and feel lonely. I'll miss her dearly, but this is something I'm drawn to for the historical, educational, and cultural/familial value. WIBTA if I went on this trip? ",

      "description": "Okay so it’s a bit of a long story.\nMe and my boyfriend are in the same friend group, there’s another girl in the group who ill refer to as Ellie from now on (not her real name). \n\nBefore me and my BF we’re going out he went out with Ellie for about a month, their relationship was pretty secret for most of it. I had a crush on him since before they were dating, but as soon as I found they got together i backed off, not wanting to hurt Ellie. I was still head over heals for him and it hurt a lot seeing him with her. After the news that they had broken up (A mutual decision as i was told) part of me was happy, the other part obviously not happy.\n\nEllie had known about my crush and encouraged me to try again, so after a month or two I decided I would. Me and my BF has always clicked and it didn’t take long before we were going out. I asked Ellie 190000 times if she was definitely okay with this. She insisted she was.\n\nNow, nearly 6 months later I found out that while Ellie and my BF were talking, she had called him cute, and she suddenly wanted to hang out with him a lot more. Soon after I found this out, my other friend Lara (again not real name) told me that Ellie confesses to being jealous of how different her relationship with my BF was to mine.\n\n\nNOTE:Ellie also has a BF but they have recently been fighting a lot.\n\nAnyway I just feel really uncomfortable about them being so close, they’ve been friends for years and I obviously don’t want to come between that. I haven’t said anything to either of them. \n\nWhen my BF told me about the convo where Ellie called him cute, I tried to brush it off quickly but I think he could tell it was bothering me and I feel like i’m being entitled.....\n\nAm I being an asshole? \n",

      "description": "This happpened sometime ago, and since then it has been ''resolved'' trough both my SO and me meeting in the middle, but I was always really curious about wether his demands were reasonable or plain selfish\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring highschool I made a group of friends (five guys and three girls including me and SO), they were also his friends since we all met in high school and went in the same classroom for three years. At the time I had a now exboyfriend (who was not part of the friend group) who was completely okay with me hanging around with my male friends, the ocasional hug, or meeting up for lunch etcetera, so I never percieved my behavior or 'closeness' to them as something wrong, we broke up before high school was over and a few months later I became romantically involved with my now SO who was part of our group of friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all went to college , luckily we live in a college town so nobody had to move away, anyways, one of my male friends had applied to the same one as me so we were again, in the same classroom on med-school, he would ocassionaly give me rides home or we'd get together to study and it was all fine and dandy until I noticed my SO become more and more angry at whatever mention of him or our other male friends hanging out with me, keep in mind is not like we could've hung out together instead since he was very busy handling architecture school. He started telling me that although he trusted me, he did not trust his own friends, and that he did not want me to hang out with them anymore, I was shocked and flat-out refused which caused a lot of tensions on our friend group from there on, so much so he drifted away and refused to treat our friends the same way as before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been three years, I didn't completely cut comunication with any of my friends but we went from getogethers every week to every two weeks or even every month, my SO skips them most of the time and won't treat our friends the same, he has given up on telling me to do the same but is generally annoyed when I bring them up in conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for not cutting out my previous very solid friendships for my SO?",

      "description": "\n\nContext: About a year ago I was taking a study in Rock at a peoples college, and one of our classes was basically the teacher arranging bands and we learned a song to perform based on a theme. \n\nThe theme for this particular project was \"Glam\", and it was a theme I had been looking forwards to since starting the semester, because I was looking forwards to playing \"One way ticket\" by the darkness, wich we ended up choosing after a meeting with one member not there, but he agreed over facebook messenger. Being a band of only four members, a drummer, a vocalist and two guitarists, it was kinda important for people to actually show up for practise, especially since our bassist had abandoned us for another group without telling us.\n\nWhen we started practising the second guitarist was a no show, so I took the lead guitar role, since I already knew how the song went and how the solo went. The first session went pretty well, and everyone seemed fine with their role. The next session rolls around and the second guitarist decides to show, ready to play lead after having been misinformed that I didn't actually know the somg or the solo. I responded something along the lines of \"what? Who told you that? It's the opposite\" then I played the solo. \"Besides, you wasn't even here last time\". He reluctantly agreed to play rythm. That session went ok too, other than the fact that the second guitarist looked really bummed.\n\nLater that night I was standing in the cantina to get myself some supper, and thinking that I should apologize to him for being harsh and for being kind of assholeish about wanting to play lead, as he HAD been moved to rythm and bass a lot recently. I was planning on saying something along the lines of \"Hey, I'm really sorry for how I've been acting, but this is a song I've been looking forward to playing since starting here. Can't I just play lead this once?\" when suddenly my teacher walks up behind me and pokes my shoulder and says \"Second guitarist really wants to play lead guitar on this, you have to play bass.\" and without letting me come with my side of the story he walked away. That move right there, going to the teacher to lick me off lead instead of actually bringing it up, when he hadn't shown up for band meeting or the first practise sessions made me just not want to appologize at all. I decided to be the bigger man and play the bass without complaints.\n\nNext practise rolls up, with the deadline fast approaching, and I'm there playing bass. The guitarist didn't show up. The deadline comes up. Guitarist is a no show. We get it post poned, and he promises to come, but surprise surprise, he's a no show.\n\nTL;DR: A band with four members, one doesn't show up for meetings/practise, I was a bit of an asshole to him for pushing for a song I liked, he agrees to play rythm, then goes to the teacher to take lead, pushing me to bass, then doesn't show for the rest of the practises.\n\nMy question is, was I right for not apologizing? Or did that make me even more of an asshole to him?",

I have my first competition in January, though, and it just hit me that there is a chance I will get a lead less adept than I.

      "description": "\nSo I’ll give you some context. I am a depressed kid that goes to middle school in the middle of nowhere, my depression is reasonably severe and I have got to the point where I harm myself and this has caused me to have some scars on my upper arm. Now I my friends have overheard me talking to someone else about this and they found out about it and instead of hiding it I just told them because it was easier. Now where I live it is hot all year round and I have to wear a jumper to hide the scars and today it was really hot and I had to do physical education out in the middle of our oval which was in full sun. Now you may see the problem, quick recap I have scars on my upper arm, my friends know about this and I have to wear a jumper it hide them.\n\nSo at the start of the lesson I was talking to one of my friends about this and he was making jokes like”why have you got the jumper on? Why don’t you take it off? I am very awkward around people even my friends and so I don’t really do anything about the teasing. The lesson goes on and he talks about how it isn’t a big deal, to me it was and I was trying to explain to him that I am very anxious about people finding the scars. We eventually get to the topic and he says “why don’t you just stop? It’s not that hard, just be active go outside!” And then I started to explain to him it was an addiction because it releases endorphins ( as far as I know, don’t quote me on it) and it was my way of coping with my family member recently dying. Now we go on and we get into an argument about this and I get quite mad because he starts being really disrespectful and I say “who knows more about this? Me or you?” I feel really bad for saying it because a while ago I realised that you can never know what people have gone through and I feel really bad about saying this and then he goes on about how he knows better and that he had fallen off bikes and skateboards and so he knows about scars and stuff.\n\nI feel really bad for saying it but I feel it was provoked by what he said. I don’t mind what answers i get, I would really appreciate any perspective anyone has on this. Thanks\n",

      "description": " \n\nSo me and my friend are trying to boost our mark with a make up extension for the course. It consists of 5 parts, which I would rank in difficulty as 5, 3, 2, 4, 1. I did my part of 2 and 3 well before it was due, while my friend was studying. On the last day we had with our teacher, I went and asked them to help with four and five, and for some reason even they weren't able to figure it out despite working it out for a solid hour. At last they dismissed us and told us to finish at home despite not helping whatsoever.\n\nAt this point me and my friend were freaking out, a day till exams and this stupid assignment that we had no clue how to do. We called for 3 hours trying to solve it, and at the end we finished it by my friend telling me to work out part 4 and 5, and check his first draft of 1. Of course this was unreasonable, we have the same exam on the same day and he was putting an unfair amount of work on me so I declined. He got very angry, and blocked me after I told him to quit it and just submit what we had for partial marks. That's not where the issue was. About 4 hours later my friend contacts me again and says hes done the rough draft of part 4 and 5 and 1. He just needed me to check it out. Now the issue arises. As it is 10 and I have about 1 day from then to study I told him I would do it later and worked before sleeping. In the morning I studies and worked, but not on the makeup extension. I simply didn't have time and didn't give it priority of my exam studying. However, the whole day I didn't do it, making it clear it was simply not a priority and that I needed to study. The problem is, he definitely spent at least an hour working the project out on his own, despite his need to study, and since I declined, the work would go to waste. With only hours left, he has been pestering me to finish it, and looking at it, it seems a mess, although I did have the whole day to work on it. I can guaranteed he spent a lot of time. After me complaining about how messed up it was, how he gave it to me just a day before exams and how hes asking me to redo it to make it neater, he has blocked once again saying all I do is complain.\n\n​\n\nI originally thought I wasn't the asshole here, but thinking about it, the guy spent an hour on the project while he needed to study, while I gave up quickly. Also, I did tell him I would fix it in the morning, despite never doing it. I definitely could be in the wrong here, and I only hope to learn from my mistakes and understand who is in the wrong.\n\n​\n\nThank you to anyone who can help.",

      "description": "My mum and I (20m) have had our own little place, a 2 bedroom unit to be exact, and for about two years my Aunty and cousin (19m) have had to stay with us, not exactly the most comfortable living arrangement. \n\nMy cousin and I sharing a room with him on a mattress on the floor, and my Aunty on the couch, whilst our living situation hasn’t been pleasant and plenty of arguments from time to time, I still have to share everything with him and gotta be relatively mindful of each other, as I work the most hours I chip in for most of the rent and my Aunty pays for her and my cousin, which isn’t too fair on her so I get him a job with me to maybe make some of his own money and ease it on Aunty, long story short he basically quits after 4 months and lives off his Mum again, which is incredibly annoying because it now means I can’t buy food without having to buy him something as well, drinks and cigarettes I gotta share as well (which is pretty expensive in this country) and he lives an easy life playing PlayStation all day, leaving his rubbish everywhere and basically trashing in what’s supposed to be my room \n\nHe manages to find another job which also long story short he ends up getting fired from and we’re back to square one, never having money, never helping out with chores despite having all this free time, not even remotely worried about another job, and me sharing what I can with him. Well one day we have a drama and ends with me being too uncomfortable to share a room with him so I just start sharing a bed with Mum for a couple nights just til I can bare looking at him again, only to find out he’s rearranged MY room to how he wants it and assumes that it’s now his room, I don’t have it in me to put a fight with him so I let him take the room and now share a bed with my Mum which is of course not ideal at all for either of us\n\nFast forward to last month, my best friend found him a job, a really well paying job, $2000 a week kinda money, which is great for him but I’m fed up of having to share this two bedroom unit with two extra people who were only supposed to stay here temporarily, I suggested he could find him and his Mum somewhere else to move, which they don’t want to do for some unbeknownst reason to me, living so cramped is ideal for nobody nor are we saving money like what was initially said prior to them moving in as we would be splitting bills, which turned out not to be the case finding out my cousin only has to pay $100 a week; gets the same ammenities, the bigger room and does nothing at all to help out around the house (I started taking photos of messes he makes and leaves for everyone just as proof to show him he does shit all) \n\nUpon hearing how much he has to pay in retrospect to my $300 a week on a MUCH lower pay rate than his, Ive told him I want him to pay equal to what I pay as I feel like I’m getting the short end of the stick by miles, we haven’t come to a resolution but some reason he and his Mum are seeming to kick up a fuss about this, AITA?

      "description": "My sister, her husband, and their two kids live with me right now as they just moved here from another state. It is a temporary situation until they can find a house, but it is likely they will be living with me for several more months. My husband and I have a 7 month old baby and though we are not complete introverts, we are not the type of people that frequently have people over and we are often exhausted from working long hours and taking care of the baby.\nI came home one day to a random girl in my house, and my sister said, \"Hey, this is 'friend'! I invited her to come hang out. I hope that is alright!\" The girl was super nice and sweet, but it just made me mad that my sister invited her over without asking. I decided to let it slide, but this girl has started coming over more frequently and my sister has made mention of potentially inviting others. They are never loud, but she has slept over about 2 times now because she drank too much and while I would never want anyone to drive intoxicated, I wish she and my sister would make plans so she could get back to her home at the end of the night.\nMy home is large (5 bed, 3 bath), so we don't feel too cramped with 4 additional people living with us, but it bothers me that my sister doesn't understand that inviting people over is an imposition. I don't know if I am being an asshole because 1) as I mention this girl is super nice, and 2) I want my sister to be making friends in her new city.",

      "description": " \n\nSo we have been renting our basement to Nancy.Nancy is a friend of my wife's and they work together. Nancy asks if her husband Dale can move in with their dogs for a newly negotiated rate. This was a few weeks into the tenancy. We agree on a rate for the increase in utilities, and Dale moves in with the dogs.It is noteworthy here that Nancy works contract positions all around the country. Generally, Dale will stay home while Nancy does this. In this new arrangement, Dale will continue to live here for the newly negotiated rate when Nancy leaves to do her next contract.\n\nNancy has some trouble with her car, I help to fix it, but she insists on taking it to the dealer instead. For three weeks I help Nancy out with rides to work, its a minor inconvenience but it works with my schedule so its not that big of a deal. For the last week, my wife and I suggest that they borrow our third car that we have been trying to fix up and sell. Its a great car, just has some oil pressure problems we've been working on diagnosing, so I make sure Dale knows what to do. They get the car back, and we ask them if they want to buy our car for about a third of KBB. It's taking up space and costs of insurance so we want to get rid of it. They indicate they do. From this point forward, Dale borrows our car frequently to run errands. They haven't made any downpayment and we still pay the insurance for it.\n\n2 months later, we ask them if they are still serious because we are considering selling it. They say they are, but they don't have the money, and tell us to \"do what we need to do.\"\n\nWe decide to list it on Craigslist, this was 4 days later. I ask Dale for the keys and tell him we are selling it. They are surprised. Nancy is upset and tells us that she thought the plan was that she was going to title it in her name, pay insurance, and make payments to us. I didn't know this, but she had a conversation with my wife where Nancy suggested this plan and my wife told her \"We can talk about it.\" Needless to say, we don't like Nancy's plan, and indicate that we would rather just sell the car, payment in full, and be done with it.\n\nNancy then tells us that Dale and the dogs will need to move out when she goes to her next gig because the arrangement was contingent upon us furnishing a vehicle for him to drive while he stays with us, since they were going to buy our car. Additionally, he needs this vehicle because they have a dog with a serious medical condition and he needs to be able to take this dog to the vet. I was unaware that the terms of their tenancy were dependent on us providing him with a vehicle, and personally I feel manipulated. I also think its sick that they would hold the well being of this dog over our heads like some bargaining chip.\n\nAm I(we) the asshole(s) here? Ask away, I had to omit some details due to character limits.",

      "description": "I reconnected with someone from high school recently and I’ve been to their house a few times since then. He has a dog that’s a little over a year old that’s crazy (runs around, jumps on people, and teethes on people all day). I’ve seen him kick (not too hard) hold the dogs mouth closed for like 20 seconds to the point that it whimpers, and fake like he’s going to smack it and that’s in my very limited time around him recently. My old friend says it’s because the dog is so crazy and he has to teach it, but my opinion is that dogs are crazy when they weren’t trained, and it’s no ones fault but his. I can’t trust anyone who treats an animal like that, so I told him I won’t be around anymore. He said that I’m ridiculous for choosing his dog that I have no connection to over a friendship. He, and other friends, think I’m being an asshole, but I disagree with them ",

      "description": "First of all, sorry if I'll be hard to understand in certain parts, english isn't my first language and I'll try my best to write understandable sentences.\n\nNow, every time my mother (let's name her Nina for this post) calls me over to help her on any kind of tech related topics, there is always a wave of reluctance coming over me.\n\nTo note, Nina is always a really loving and caring mother, and isn't too slow on learning things. Not for tech tho. She's actually one of the most tech illiterate person I've seen. For a more recent example, she asked me to help her transfer files and settings from an old smartphone to a new one.\n\nIn the beginning, everything went smooth. I've downloaded the transfer app on both phones, connected them and started the transfer while my mother was watching. So far, so good. She understood everything and started entering her data into the text boxes, but afterwards the frustrating part for me started. \n\nShe began to get confused on every single bit of text boxes that popped up. When I try to answer her questions on what those are she constantly snatched the phone out of my hands to click on buttons herself. And after she clicked on something that sets settings in a way that she doesn't like, while not reading anything properly, she starts to get frustrated.\n\nWhen I told her to slow down and listen to me, she only got more frustrated and claims that I'm either not explaining anything properly or the phone is at fault, while clicking on anything more frantically and wondering why everything isn't working. This got me more frustrated as well, where afterwards I told her that this always happens and this isn't fun for me. I also told there that I'm considering to not help her with tech anymore, whereas she responded that she has a right for help from since she always helped me in anything for free in life. After we finished this small fight I continue to wrap up the setup of the phone and move on.\n\nNow, this was a rather specific example, but this is how it goes on any tech topics in general, may it be a computer, TV or router. Also, it isn't fun how she simply expects me to do things for free. I don't really expect any big compensation, but having the feeling that she is actually thankful for my time would be nice.\n\nBesides that, Nina is always a loving mother and I really don't have any problems in helping her. But if it goes about tech, I really don't want to help her because of how I know it will go.\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to help my mother with tech?",

      "title": "AITA for getting pissy over feeling like a live-in maid for my parents",
      "description": "Me and my sister are 20 (almost 21) and 22 y/o. We still live at home with our parents and 2 younger brothers (13 and 11). I pay rent every month to live at home since i no longer attend school (even when i went back to school briefly they insisted i continue paying--theyve come to rely on my rent payments for income), my sister is in school full-time and does not.\n\n\nTLDR HERE BECAUSE I RAMBLED IM SO SORRY: parents are forcing my sister and i to clean up after them and our brothers, despite contributing nothing to their mess. We went along at first but then they started complaining. Weve been asking our brothers for help the odd day and now theyve given us shit for that as well. We feel like were being treated like shit and like live-in maids. Our dad who does no housework is the one complaining of our efforts the most and now, after nearly a year of constantly hearing his complaints, were at our wits end and ready to snap. AWTA for feeling this way? \n\n\nSo, over the summer, my parents decided my sister and i dont help out enough around the house. We dont help out much because we honestly just sleep here, we dont hang out, cook, nothing. We just need the beds. We dont contribute to the mess in the house any since when we are home, were in our rooms. They told my sister and I were responsible for the kitchen (the messiest area of our house since its the Local Dump for everything) 2 days a week each (4 days combined). At first i was like, fine, i can do a load of dishes and wipe down the counter, thats fine. Their house, their rules. They gave us a basic list to do (dishes, counter, sweep). Fine. I got it done as did my sister. \n\nThen they started complaining. We didnt do the recycling. We didnt take out the garbage. We didnt stay home all day to keep doing multiple loads of dishes. We didnt wipe down [insert counter area thats not part of the main breakfast bar]. Theres crap on the table. The floor wasnt swept.\n\nRecycling has always been my youngest brothers job, that hasnt changed in like 5 years. The garbage fills after dinner and we arent invited to dinner 9 times out if 10 so we dont check it at 7pm at night. We sweep but then my dad and brothers walk through the house with their shoes and boots on and track everywhere. The crap on the table is shit we dont even know what to do with like homework that needs signing, old assignments, rep baseball notes, and bills.\n\nThats when my sister and I started getting pissy. We're their daughters, not their maids. We're cleaning up after everyone BUT ourselves (their main arguement for us helping out is that 'some of the mess has to be ours' and like i said earlier, we really just sleep here). We're being treated like shit without even a thank you (something we always give our mom if she even just passes us something we accidentally dropped like a sock when were doing laundry). Im paying rent AND CLEANING THEIR HOUSE. We go for MONTHS at a time without groceries so i dont even get the perk of 'well theres food'--and its not because they cant afford it, they cpuld afford ordering in multiple times a week to avoid grocery shopping, they were just too fucking lazy to go to the grocery store thats a 5 minute drive from ohr house. I even offered to go for them, they could deduxt the bill from my rent and they said no. \n\nWhen they do cook they coincidentally only ever make enough for themselves and my brothers, not me or my sister (id understand if it was something i didnt like, like tacos. But they made pasta one night and thats the EASIEST THING TO MAKE EN MASSE. I do it and when i do, out of my own pocket, i feed fuckin EVERYONE IN MY HOUSE. Then i clean up after myself. My parents? Nope. Including the clean-up part.). The odd time there are leftovers, if my sister and i dont run to the kitchen like vultures then everything gets claimed for somebodys lunch the next day. If we eat too much (read: enough so we arent hungry again an hour later) then theres been times weve been yelled at for eating somebodies lunch pre-lunch claim. \n\nMy sister and i jointly decided that wed do the dishes once (full load and unload--and we can pack that bastard tight!) plus load anything else thats lying around, but if the washer isnt full we arent wasting water to run it. Clean off the breakfast bar (includes scrubbing the counter everyday to get bits of dried food off it). And if the floor needs sweeping, then sweep it. We have a mini recycling bin under the sink, all recycling goes in there until our youngest bro takes it out at some point (he often forgets though). We arent maids, but we will help out because if we dont then it ALL falls on our mom who works 2 full time jobs (my dad gets home from work and goes to the basement, resurfaces for dinner, then back to the basement. He doesnt lift a finger around the house and is very old fashioned that 'girls are in the kitchen and do the indoor work, men do the hands-on work and outdoor work'--which gives him leeway in the summer when hes fixing the house, mowing the lawn, whatever but its winter right now and we have a mini plow, he does our driveway in 10 minutes if hes slow. If he actually broke up the ice on our driveway once a month then, fine, more leeway but he doesnt. We have at least an inch and a half of ice and compressed snow (which will turn into ice very soon). He wont even buy ice salt! My point being the jobs he does do, he half asses.) \n\nNow,theyve given me and my sister shit for asking our brothers to help. We never give them 'big chores' (ie loading AND unloading the dishwasher) and we usually do it if we're busy, extremely tired (my sister stays up late studying (last semester of pre-law), i get extreme fatigue from my periods), or not feeling well. The exception being if they made a big ass mess from their breakfast, we dont deal with that and tell them to clean it up on their own (since they shouldve that morning). We dont ask for help every week either, maybe twice a month for a high guess. Then my dad drove home the point as he, my mom, and my brothers, were eating dinner that, once again, they didnt make enough for me, that its an all-day thing. I looked around and saw a mess that was NOT there when i had ALREADY CLEANED THE KITCHEN and just said fine and walked away.\n\nMy sister and i are beyond pissed that theyre treating us like maids--honestly, worse than that because at least a maid gets PAID! I do the OPPOSITE of getting paid! I dont even get $5 off my rent for doing a 'good job' (something i know does happen irl as my friends and former coworkers have had such tiny discounts at rental homes). Were ready to storm the damn castle.\n\nAre we TA for feeling this way? 'Their house, their rules,' we feel can only excuse their treatment for so long. ",

      "description": "I was good friends with a guy for a long time. He was the one who pursued me for months and kept saying he loves me and that I was his \"dream girl\", but I was very hesitant to date because I had bad dating experiences and wanted time to heal, plus I didn't want to potentially ruin a good friendship. He insisted he would wait for me, even though I didn't know if I would want to date him in the near/late future.\n\nWhen I agreed to date, he turned me down because all of a sudden he thinks he might want kids (he always said he never wants kids) and I didn't, then went back on his word in the same day and said he felt depressed and suicidal because he didn't want to lose me. I ended up agreeing to give things a go with him anyway.\n\nOne week later, he broke up with me over text because I had one super bad day at work and sought support from him, which he said made him feel depressed and helpless and he couldn't cope with this. I reiterated it was just one bad day, but he began to focus on lots of smaller things about me as a person (things he was always aware of) plus he brought up my traumatic past and said he can't put up with that (I have nightmares about it sometimes).\n\nSo, we had only been together for one week. It sucks but not worth grieving over. I met someone very shortly after, we went on a date several days later and one thing led to another and we had sex.\n\nAnyway, me and the ex, if you can even call him that really, were catching up the following week (because we are meant to be good friends after all) and he asked me what I got up to over the weekend and I was 100% honest. He was not happy one bit, questioning me how I can even move on so quickly, and claiming that he had been having regrets all week and was considering taking me back. Plus he ultimately felt betrayed as I'd had sex with someone a week after we broke up, and sex is a big deal and something special to him, and now it will take a very long time, possibly years, for him to get over this and be able to trust another person to be intimate with. However, I myself do not see sex as massively special and have had sex with 30+ people (guys/girls) over the past ten years, which again he was always aware of.\n\nSince then, he has grown quite distant, and when I message him, he will sometimes reply a week later, but remains friendly in his messages. However, because of his reaction to me going on a date etc, I have kept that side of things very private. I have continued to go on dates and be intimate, but have kept that completely out of conversation. This has me feeling quite conflicted because this is meant to be my friend so I should be open with him, but at the same time, I feel like it hurts him hearing about this part of my life and I don't want to face another outburst of his either. So, AITA for moving on so quickly from my ex and also for omitting the details of my love life so as not to upset him?",

      "description": "Ok ok, I know you all think that I am. But here's some context.\n\nMe and my gf were dating for at least 9 months before I had enough. I've had enough because of the fact that she always wants advice from everyone about her \"depression\" and would usually tell us that it didn't work even though she doesn't do it. I'm always the one being blamed by everyone because of how she always is. She acts super depressed when she thinks nothing goes her way. Sometimes, she'd even threaten to kill herself just for me to intervene and find out that she wouldn't do it. I've tried to make her stop it, but she would never listen. The fact that I actually have depression and am going through therapy is not helping. So, I broke up with her.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This happened yesterday night with my roommate. A person with whom I've shared a lot of my life for the last 11 years since we met. \n\nWe were having a talk over dinner about a podcast she had heard during the day. It was about how a sychiatrist had taken advantage of a young woman coming to him for help with her ilness. She had gone to the police and the national sychiatrist association and nothing had been done about it. \n\nTo this I of course said: \"Oh my god, that's horrible\", but I also said that those kinds of stories where becoming extremely exhausting. She took that as me saying, that the fact that the stories were being told were exhausting me, not that the things happening were exhausting. I told her that stories about men abusing their power towards women is becoming so common place that we're not even surprised anymore, and that makes me very sad.\n\nHere comes the question part... \n\nShe says that because when I ( 27m)  was 20 years old agreed with someone that grabbing a womans ass is not that bad, she doubted what I meant, and that she has the right to doubt it, because she has experienced physical sexism time and time again, so naturally she is sceptic.\n\nThis made me pretty mad, because I saw no reason for bringing that up at the moment. I don't remember it, but I believe that I said it. It sounds like 20-year old me. I am not trying to excuse it, but I definitely don't think it as a fair argument for believing the worst from what I said, to bring up something I said apr. 7 years ago. Since then I have of course changed dramatically as we all have, and I have a radically different opinion on that subject this day. This I feel like she should know.\n\nWhat that makes me feel, is that she was gatekeeping feminism and general good behaviour, and that the fact that I am a man automatically sets me in a position, where I have to prove that I actually think it is a good thing, that stories like this are published. It makes me feel like, she sets her agenda over her friendship with me and (if necessary) having to apologize. \n\nI can see her point when it comes to strangers, but we have been very close friends for 11 years plus. \n\nI am cincerely asking, and I want to know... AITA? \n\nPlease ask questions if there are things, you feel like I left out or forgot. Sorry if I'm rambling a bit...",

I want to clarify that I ask her in this kind of tone - “Do you wanna go for a run?” Or “Hey I’m about to go workout if you wanna come with”. It’s not a direct order.

This alarmed me a bit, and I simply said, \"Sorry, I can't help you\" and walked toward my car.\n\nAs I approached my car, a second man got out of their car and started walking towards me, yelling \"Hey!

      "description": "Ok some back story is needed on this post. My dad owns and runs a sub shop that can get really busy and if there is ever a worker who can't come or a big convention comes around, I'll usually help out. I also work on the weekends every now and then to earn some spending money. Now the story starts out when I tell my dad that this weekend I don't want to work because I might go out with friends. He seems to have no problem with it, and usually if there is a convention or if there is a urgent need for me to work he will make that clear. This morning I woke up to my friends having other things pop up which made things unclear to if they could go and do something or not. I was at home lounging on my couch when my mom comes back from running errands and tells me to go help my dad at work since I'm being lazy and not doing anything. I tell her that I still might go out with friends and want to stay available and tell her I don't want to work. She then proceeds to get on the cameras at our work, and tells me without showing me that they are really busy. My mom has this habit of helping my dad out even when my dad doesn't call her in. If things get too busy, he will eventually call either me or my mom in to help, but there was no such call. My mom then gets worked up about how all I've been doing today is sitting at home doing nothing and that I should go help my dad since I told her that some friends might not be available to go anywhere. She also told me to go and work for an hour or so and be done with. The problem is, this wouldn't be worth my time making the trip to work and back which takes about an hour total. I tell her since there wasn't any call, it would be fine and I wouldn't have to go.  She then proceeds to blow up on me , calling me lazy and selfish not helping my dad out when he 'needs' help, and that she'd go instead since I won't go. After she had gone full ballistic on me, I tell her that if its that big of a deal that I would go but she refuses telling me to stay home and that she'd do it herself if, \"going to help your father is less important than having fun.\" \n\nAm I the asshole for not helping him out?",

We lived together and shared a car which is on finance and we both paid for out of a joint account.\n\nSo, we both moved back into parents houses etc. And as the car was registered and the finance was in my name I kept the car to which she agreed.\n\nRoll on a few weeks and I get a text from her asking for the money that she paid for the car. I had recently found out that she had cheated on me from a very reliable source (she doesn't know that I know). I told her I'm not giving her anything because legally I don't have to, plus when we had the car she used it way more than I did, she would drop me off at work and I would then get a lift home from a work colleague. She was also really bad with money and would only put £20-30 of fuel in a month whereas I would put that in per week, I also paid for all of our food shopping whilst she was spending her wages on stuff that wasn't needed i.e clothes, makeup etc. I did pull her up on this and she said I didn't have to which I found very selfish of her when I spent a lot of money to make sure we had everything we needed and I was really struggling to make ends meet. \n\nAnyway, she asked for the car money and I said no I don't have to pay you anything and explained my point to her, which then led to a series of abusive texts on her behalf.\n\nTL;DR- AITA for not giving my ex any money from the car we both paid for even though it's in my name?",

      "description": "So this was a few years ago now but still at times eats me from the inside. \n\nSo through my family I met this guy who I became friends with really quickly due to our many similarities and common interests. I soon had a huge crush on him and it seemed like he did too since he flirted with me very obviously and was very familiar with me. So one night me, my bestfriend and crush decided to spend the night at my place. I slept on one mattress my bestfriend on another and crush on the couch. \n\nAfter my bestfriend had already fallen asleep me and crush were still talking and lowkey flirting and after a while we ended up in the same bed and making out which eventually led to sex. \n\nWe had previously discussed relationships and the fact that neither of us really wanted to get into one, but before our make out session led to sex we made a promise to eachother that even though we weren’t in a relationship we wouldn’t sleep with other people.   \n\nLater on we also tried discussing the realtionship part but we didn’t get anywhere with it so we just continued on being friends and having sex. I would say that it was just friends with benefits if it weren’t for the fact that he told me he loved me numerous times and I felt the same for him. \n \nSince I have always struggled with voicing my feelings and affections I kind of felt like it was my fault we didn’t get into a realtionship and only talked about it once. \n\nCue to like about 5 months in to our whole “thing” I got sick and had to stay in the hospital for a week. During that time I had a lot of time to think about things and figure myself out I guess. So after getting out I decided to have “the relationship talk” again with him only to find out he’s in a relationship with someone else. Also I found that out a week after I got out of the hospital and not from him but my stepfather. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for being mad at him that he got into a relationship and didn’t tell me about it? I was also very cold and ignored him after the whole ordeal. \n\n(Sorry about any mistakes or stuff being worded oddly, english is not my first language.)",

We grew up with an alcoholic and somewhat abusive father and all of us have different mothers who have more or less never been in the picture. Growing up wasn’t easy and all we really had was each other. Four very different brothers all with our own philosophies on how to get through life. \n\nAs the youngest of the bunch I had the most support from my brothers. Adam, as the oldest, felt very protective of me and would do anything to keep me “on track”. This included beating me up if I did something I shouldn’t do. I have always loved my brother, and his “rough” ways have kept me off drugs and out of a criminal career. My two other brothers are both struggling with addiction and wrap sheets.\n\nNow Adam has a 13-year-old son, Trevor. History repeats itself and his mother is off doing god know what. Adam is really trying to make a life for him and his son and I am proud of how he has changed his life to support his kid. However I recently caught Trevor shoplifting from a local store (the owner is a friend of mine and gave me a call rather than the cops). I picked Trevor up and let him crash at my place for the night and I have not yet told my brother about what happened. I know he only wants the best for his son, but at the same time I know how he treated me when I would do something like this as a kid. At the same time he is his father and should know when he is fucking up.\n\nAITA for not telling my brother that his son is shoplifting?",

While closing the door he gave me a look like I truly betrayed him, he’s definitely hurt by this. I need some sleep though. Am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my sister I think she's lying about being raped?",
      "description": "So, most people who read the title probably amuse I'm an ass already, but please, hear me out. My sister recently has come out to the family claiming she was raped. She's been crying and saying it's the most traumatic thing that ever happened to her. I don't believe her and told her that to her face in front of our entire family.\n\nHere's the thing, my sister is a compulsive liar who makes up stories for attention. She is in her mid 30's and ever since she was a teen has constantly made things up for attention. When I say this I don't mean it lightly either. She has been successfully sued multiple times (twice for slander, once for libel) because she has lied about events that cause other harm.\n\nMy sister has gotten in trouble with the law multiple times because she has lied about what has happened to her. She was charged with filing a false police report when she was 19 because she claimed that a roommate of her's attacked her with a knife when in reality she stabbed herself and called the police. She got lucky and didn't serve jail time. She was kicked out of college 2 years later for claiming a teacher tried to force himself onto her when in reality she was caught plagiarizing and tried to lie to get it covered up.\n\nThis is only scratching the surface of this issue and I don't feel like I need to go into every detail about it. Now, I understand that despite these things, my sister *could* have been raped. Rape is an awful thing and a very touchy subject and I understand that these claims need to be taken seriously. Here's the big issue though, her story reeks of the same issues her other ones do.\n\nAt first she claimed she was raped in a park by 1 man, the next day it was 2 men who kidnapped her at a park and forced her to take them home with her where she was raped. Along with this, she has refused to tell us when it happened. At first it was \"in spring last year\" but now it 2 years ago in December. I've pressed her for these details and she changes details every time. Along with this, she is refusing to go to the police. Saying she \"Doesn't think it will work\". I've been afraid she was going to do this for some time now too. With all the stories in the news of people coming forward about sexual abuse in Hollywood and politics she has become a little to interested in them. \n\nMe and my family have put up with these lies for so long I'm just tired of them. So last night my sister was putting on a show and crying in front of family who were visiting, telling the story to them. After she was done, I stood up and told her and everyone she is lying. That this story was different than the one last night and one the night before. I told her this is the same bullshit she has pulled for years and this time if she's not careful she'll get actual jail time.\n\nWhen I said this my family freaked out. Some agreed with me, some didn't. And in the end my sister has refused to even look at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to second guess myself honestly. She's pulled this shit so much that I pretty much have decided she's lying. If something tangible comes out I'll apologize but nothing ever does in her stories. Was what I did wrong? Should I maybe have told my family in private instead of how I did? I honestly just need some second opinions.",

      "description": "So long story short, my little brother (27) has not spoke to me in a couple years because during a family Christmas party he was complaining that he couldn't get a job because he is gay, no one likes him, because he is gay, and  he would be condemned to hell, because he is gay. I finally had enough of listening to him complain and explained to him that no one cares that he is gay and that his problem is he is lazy as shit and smokes pot all day rendering him anti-social. I explained to him that if he like to (suck dick) then own it and don't blame your problems on it. Needless to say he started blaming his problems on me and told me that my dad and I treat him horrible and  he never wanted to see us again. That was literally it, I didn't condemn his gayness or tell him he's going to hell, or any bull shit like that. So question is, am I the ass hole for not buying into his pity party?",

      "description": "The title makes me sound like an asshole, I know. I should just get on with it and wear it for one day, but hear me out please. \n\nSo my dad is getting married (for the third time) in a few weeks, he only booked the wedding a month or so ago despite being engaged to his fiancée for 7 years and nobody knows why they’ve suddenly booked it so quickly. \n\nFirstly, he’s only invited 12 guests and hasn’t even invited his own sister or niece which has upset me as I barely know anyone there.\n\nSecondly, I’ve never met his fiancées daughter, husband or children, but we’re expected to act like happy families for the day. I did actually bump into her daughter at their house a few years back and she completely ignored me which was awkward. \n\nHere’s where the dress situation comes in. As you can see from above it isn’t really a traditional wedding. I was asked to be bridesmaid along with my dads fiancées daughter and I was hesitant, but agreed on the stipulation I can feel comfortable in the dress I wear as I have some insecurities (I’m working on these). I wasn’t invited to go dress shopping at all and things were ordered without consultation that neither I or the other bridesmaid liked. They sent a photo of one online that looked okay, but when it arrived and I tried it on it wasn’t at all flattering. I know this isn’t just in my head as I’ve asked a few close friends and they’ve all agreed. \n\nTherefore, I told my dad that I really didn’t like the dress and could I maybe look for something else for us two to wear. He replied that the other bridesmaid liked it and that was that. A few messages later he said if I could find something we can switch the dresses. I found a lovely dress that everyone around me agreed was so much nicer, I tried it on at my dads tonight and his fiancée said it was ‘too revealing’ and looked horrified, but really I don’t think she would have liked anything I’d chosen at this stage. \n\nIt’s ended up with a stalemate situation, his fiancée was rude to me and ignored me the whole evening after I drove an hour there and back and now I feel like a bad person for causing drama and not wanting to wear the dress, wishing that I hadn’t agreed to be bridesmaid in the first place. Equally, I feel like they haven’t handled the situation very well. \n\nAITA for not wanting to wear the dress? ",

He is a very nice guy but extremely pushy. Fast forward, I do the event and cash out. Then he starts getting these ideas of projects that he wants to do and to do a podcast of some sort that would benefit him and his organization. He asked me to be on it with him, which I think as a way for him to get through not paying me and just being able to use my gear and tech skills. He comes without notice and pounds on my door at the worst times possible. Once I’m with my girlfriend at 8:30 PM in our jammies watching a movie on a Saturday night and I get banging on my door with him there. He will usually want to talk for forever like legitimate hours. This has been happening and he just did it again. The good thing about him coming this time was to offer me a gig. I just feel like instead of physically showing up without any notice he could just pick up the phone and call me. He chooses not to text and ignores any text sent to him so that is not an option either. AITA for getting upset at him and his ways of going about things with his horrible timing?",

Nothing is going right. I stop by to help a bit. When I leave, Carol still has not shown up w/the couch. Dad says we will go out to dinner shortly after 7.\n\n7:45 I text ys &amp; ask if we're still going to dinner. Yes. A minute later she texts back \"Dad said no cuz the weather's getting bad\"\n\nMonday, doing laundry at my parents. Dad says he owes me dinner. I say not to worry, we didn't go cuz of the weather. He says, \"It had nothing to with Carol. We just got so busy &amp; we were going to come home so ys could take a shower but we didn't. We went straight out to eat &amp; I forgot to call you.\" Huh?\n\nYs &amp; niece come over to get more stuff. Ys says they're on a schedule because she has to pick bf up from driver's ed (My dad paid $300 for him. His mom didn't allow him to get his license.) She asks me to move my car out of the driveway, which doesn't make sense but I do it. I'm pissy. I come back in &amp; she keeps talking. I'm aggravated &amp; yell \"I moved my car. You'd better get going since you have a fucking schedule to keep.\"\n\nI gather up my stuff and started ranting:\n\nYou're all fucking lying pieces of shit. The fact that you hid buying the house from me meant you knew you were doing something that would hurt me. That was my plan with you &amp; you went behind my back. This is bullshit. Then you fucking lie to me about dinner last night. What was the fucking point of that? &amp; no one gives a shit about what's going on with me &amp; my stuff. Nobody asked how my doctor's appointment went at (city an hour away). Nobody gives a flying fuck. &amp; when ys was having her mental breakdown &amp; you were out west who took her to the doctor? Who helped her unpack your whole house while you were out west? (Parents moved, left all their stuff in a mess, 2 days later go out west). She promised to help me clean &amp; organize my house for a couple of hours 1 weekend but any time I asked her she never had time for me. She forgets who was there for her when she needed help. I'm sorry that I'm such a 2nd class citizen to you. Oh, &amp; just so I don't get accused of anything (I then take off the spare key I have &amp; throw it on the counter)\n\nDuring my rant ys ran upstairs. Mom chased after her. Dad sat in a chair looking at me like I'm an idiot.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway as i believe she might see this.\n\nSo my friend and I have know each other for the better part of a decade. We met though work and although we have had our ups and downs we have been close friends for most of the time we've know each other. For the sake of this lets call her Asuka. So Asuka had been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and PTSD and was taking medication. Long story short she had a horrible thing happen to her a few years back. \n\nAbout 4 years ago we decided to start a music duo together as we were both musicians and had been in previous groups together. The previous groups we were in, she was the singer and had a habit of being difficult to work with due to not showing up, being late, being unprepared, and just not working well with the group. When this group started i was aware that this might still be an issue but i decided to try anyways. \n\nAt first things were going okay. I was doing most of the work but since we worked on covers she seemed come prepared and we were able to get through rehearsals without much trouble. However as soon as we began working on original songs we would run into issues. At the time i was not the greatest songwriter but i was open to criticism. I would show Asuka the song i had been working on and the responses i would get would be that it didn't sound right or it needed to be fleshed out some more. I would ask for suggestions or if she would like make changes and she would simply say it needed to be worked on but would not try to sing it and would not make attempts to change it. When i would push the subject she would begin to get frustrated and would simply lie down on the couch and say that it was stressing her out. While i found this annoying i always remembered that it might be that she was acting this way due to her condition and i would forget it and move on to something else. \n\nAs the years went by the same issues would arise along with some new ones. She would show up to rehearsal completely unprepared and we would spend most of the time figuring out her parts. She would show up several hours late and the times i met her at her place she would sometimes refuse to work and just lie or on the couch. Again i was very patient and would wait for her to come around which would normally take a few hours. After rehearsal she would be upset as she stated that she was terrible for wasting rehearsal time. She always state she would change but it was always the same issue. She lived an hour away from me so meeting up was difficult enough without her being uncooperative but again i assumed it was because of her condition and i would let it go.\n\nDuring the final year of our group it became common for me to talk to her after rehearsal and tell her how i felt about her attitude. She would usually cry and apologize for being that way. I asked her several times if she even wanted to continue in the group as i had now begun to do literally everything in the band from book shows, write songs, schedule rehearsals and run them. She always stated that she did want to be in the group. I always reminded her that we would be friends even if this group ended but she always said she did not want to end it. \n\nThings came to a head when we were supposed to meet up to record a song and Asuka decided to cancel several times in a row over the corse of a few weeks due to her and her BF not being able to plan their weekends which frustrated me as they were failing to communicate with each other and i was suffering because of it. We finally recorded the song but when i sent it to her she did not like one part. I suggested she record it from her house and send it to me. I never got a rely. 3 weeks passed and i could not believe she would blow me off like that. She had been recently calling me after work here and there and that stopped as well. It was as if she was avoiding me all together. When she finally did message me i was pretty much fed up with the way she had been treating this group and treating me, her long time close friend. If this was a full band she blew off it would probably not have been such a huge issue with me but because it was just me it was very personal. She had been doing this for most of the 4 years we were a groups when things got hard she would cease all communication and then get a hold of me several weeks later. I felt that i had given everything to this groups despite her push back and the difficulty working with her. I decided to end the group and called her the day following the text she eventually sent me.\n\nI was so nervous that day because despite my frustration over the years she was still very dear to me and i wanted to continue being her friend and the thought of losing her made me feel terrible. When i called her i explained that i wanted to end the group and her response was completely unexpected. She sounded annoyed. She said \"Umm okay why?\" like this was out of the blue. I felt like a complete idiot as i had been stressing about it all day and had practiced talking to her by myself and her response wasn't understanding but rather as if i was over exaggerating this. I kept my cool and told her that we had not been progressing at a reasonable rate. I told her that i felt that i was in a one man band due to her lack of communication and was no longer having fun. She responded with \"I didn't realize we were on a time line but okay if thats what you want\" in an equally annoyed voice. I just said \" Okay ill talk to you later\" I was so upset by our call. I expected her to be a little sad that this group of 4 years had ended but she had the \"I don't give a shit, do whatever you want\" attitude towards it. Its now been almost a year and we haven't spoke since then. We are still friends on social media but other than that have ceased all communication. I feel like i tried my best to be understanding and be patient because i did enjoy the times we hung out and the times we worked well which there were plenty. Im always wondering if i could ave handled it better. In the end i always tell myself that i did the best i could. Am i an asshole? Should i have been more patient?",

      "description": "A slight preface to this; I’m 15F and all others are under the age of 21. Need outside opinions as many have been a mix of YTA, NTA, and ESH.\n\nAround a month ago I got into a disagreement with friends due to me feeling left out and feeling as if there was a double standard present. I was unable to do something without them, yet they all did it without me. I originally responded very immaturely, vague posting on social media (all of which I have deleted now) instead of talking it out like a mature person should.\n\nI got called out on being selfish (which I was, and I’m pissed off at myself for behaving like that), and that I was hypocritical for going to my other friends for advice when I go to them for advice when I have issues with these other friends.\n\nIt took me a while to respond, even though I should of responded earlier, because I was extremely anxious and not being able to deal with it properly at the time. I ended up seeing a professional I haven’t seen for a few months now and they gave me advice on what to do, which helped a lot.\n\nI sent a message back around 2-3 weeks ago, apologising for my behaviour, how I handled things and that I should’ve been more aware of their feelings. A friend got vagued about by their ex and seeing how upset she was made me even more disgusted at myself that I could do that to people I care about.\n\nI have gotten one response, which I haven’t responded to yet, but knowing that they are up to trying to work things about in a more amicable setting means a lot to me. I received it shortly after my message but I am yet to respond due to anxiety and feeling physically sick a lot.\n\nOne other person though sent messages before I sent my apology, essentially saying that I would probably never respond, and it felt like they didn’t want me to respond so they would never have to talk to me again. I felt as though it’s hypocritical that they say that when they haven’t responded to my message. \n\nSo AITA for just wanting this entire thing to be over and also thinking this person is being slightly hypocritical?",

      "description": "Hello, before I start I want to apologize for my terrible grammar and story telling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend rejected me when I first told her that I liked her, I moved on and hung out with another girl. Now I'm the bad guy for not letting her friendzone me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend, let's call her Liz, rejected me when I first told her that I liked her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, don't actually know where to begin, I'm fairly new to opening up and asking for advices. More than a year ago, I met Liz. We had a mutual friend(Let's cal her Jan) , I had been friends with Jan for 6 years and Liz was her new roommate. I liked Liz a lot and we got close pretty quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the following couple of months we started going out almost every single evening, and ended up talking about stuff and drinking beer in my car near her dormitory. At that point I was 100% sure she liked me too, we spent hours every single day, just the two of us. But since I'm a coward I've never had courage to make any move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, I grew some balls -thanks to alcohol - and told her I lilked her so much. She told me to \"go home\" .\n\nI insisted, asked if she wasn't going to say anything. All I was asking for is either a \"I like you too\" or \"I don't feel the same way\" . She said the same thing, \"Just go home.\" I took that answer as \"I don't want to lose you, but I don't want to be in a relationship with you either\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a short amount of time, I started hanging out with some other girl, but shortly after I realized she was kind of toying with me, and told her that I wanted to stop seeing each other. And since Jan was a close friend of mine, we talked about that girl now and then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurned out Jan told Liz what I told her. After some time Liz called me and wanted to hang out. We started seeing each other again and eventually, one day, I kissed her. Didn't give her a chance to screw with me this time. Kiss me back, that's a yes. Don't kiss me back, that's a no. There was nothing between. She kissed me back, and we started dating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been more than a year now, and in our recent fights she always brings up what happened after she rejected me.\n\nAlways says, if you really liked me you wouldn't have gone after some other girl literally after a day you told me you liked me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that just seems unfair to me, don't even bother to tell me you don't like me but expect me to stay loyal to a hope(?) of you someday giving me a chance? I told her that if she didn't try to friendzone me like a stupid kid, I wouldn't do that. But things only got worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do I do with this situation? I don't want to make her upset but everytime she brings this up I lose my temper, I remember the days she wanted me around, but as a friend. Knowing that I liked her, but not saying anything. Always leaving some hope for me stay but not actually being honest and telling me she didn't see me the same way as I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce again, I know that's a terrible storytelling and I apologize for that. There might be some unclarified spots, but I believe I expressed the situation and what I feel about it. Thank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Fast forward to today and my wife is 9 months pregnant. Her boyfriend came to an event he was not invited to and I asked him to leave because of what happened. I was raised to never hit a woman and to really never have a reason to hit a woman. Her mother got angry because I asked him to leave and I really don’t care. I then told her he is to never ever see my daughter alone with her or do anything my daughter related. Am I the asshole for this?

      "description": "There is more detail in the [/r/relationship\\_advice post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b0wu3v/i_reached_out_to_my_abusive_ex_was_it_wrong_to_do/) and the chance to give advice if wanted.\n\nI had an abusive ex who believed I was cheating on him with a friend, and then turned verbally abusive. After breaking up I wound up being with that same friend as he helped me heal. However, my ex had sent me into a spiral of despair and depression that made me miss class and eventually lose my eligibility for my scholarship.\n\nAfter learning I lost my funds to attend school, I turned hysterical and immediately blamed my ex for it. I sent an email blaming him for essentially ruining my life. To my shock, he replied in the same day and we exchange a few emails. We then called on the phone. He apologizes for everything, says what he did was undeserved, understands why I would blame him and says he had been going to therapy to reform himself. However, he still thinks I cheated - I don't argue it. The call ends on a good note, including the agreement to never speak to each other again, and it felt as if I had gotten real closure.\n\nI immediately tell my BF what happened (a policy of keeping our feelings open in order to prevent history repeats). Understandably, he needs time to think. We don't talk for a night, but in the morning he says he consulted close family and trusts that this was a good thing, even if he felt hurt that I contacted my ex instead of him. But, he had already forgiven me and is happy that everything turned out good.\n\nThis happened months ago, but it came up again recently in conversation with friends.\n\nMy friends say I'm an asshole to my BF since I reached out to my ex. They believe I had severely hurt him since talking to an ex is one of the worst things to do in a relationship. I agree with them and feel guilty that I had hurt my BF by not thinking of him for support first. My very weak argument is that the stress of the situation clouded my judgement - I wasn't thinking right. But in honesty, I am very glad the call happened as it answered many questions for me and gave a little solace in the wake of knowing I can't complete my degree.\n\nI haven't told my BF about this conversation yet, and in the months that passed between that call, nothing has felt different. He has continued to be loving and he never hinted at being unhappy or disappointed at what I did. However, considering this is a LDR and that there are things that can't be conveyed through text alone, I could be missing something. I plan to speak to him and ask again if he is honest so we may have the chance to open a conversation.\n\n**tl;dr:** Blamed abusive ex for sending me into depression and making me miss classes that eventually lost my scholarship. BF knows I reached out and forgives me, along with thinks this was a good closure. Friends do not. Did I mess up?",

      "description": " Let me give you some context. I've been friends with this person for 6 years now. We met in middle school and we've been friends ever since. But for the past 2-3 years, our friendship has turned into toxic shit. And what I mean by that, is we always try to out do the other, we comment about any little thing that either of us do wrong (at home or in public), he tries to make me look  bad when he says \"it looks good\". We just don't go well together. But we usually do most things with our friends. We've only done things together like once in a blue moon. And still, the same thing happens or there's just a negative vibe. Recently, it's come to my mind the way we act and how annoying it is. We usually talk together online through Discord. And I can't go 2 seconds without hearing \"fuck you\", \"you're shit\", and other toxic stuff. Now, I'm not gonna sit here and act like I don't say it back. But, he usually start's it. I could be minding my own business watching a video or playing a game, and all I hear is \"fuck you\" or \"rot in hell\". I know he doesn't really mean it, but it's gotten to a point where I've noticed that he only talks to me like that. Not to any of his other friends (who I'm also friends with).  Another thing about my friend is that he always acts like he's right all the time. He could be totally wrong in a situation but never admit it. Which is annoying, but that's the way he is. Today I decided to not talk to him at all, and he got mad about it. He called me \"fake\" and told me I was acting like a baby and wouldn't explain why I was doing this. Even when I told him on Snap Chat that we aren't compatible and we have a toxic friendship he just said \"LOL\" and \"Get a life\". Plus, we've had fights in the past where it's made us not talk to each other for days or weeks. I'm just tired of it and idk if I'm being an asshole or not. Sure we've been friends for 6 years, but it's not fun anymore. He always wants to see me do bad in life and I just hate it. I could keep going on and on about it. But, I'm gonna let you decide for me.\n\nTLDR:  My friendship with a person who I've known for 6 years has been toxic  for 2-3 years and don't know if I should cut ties with or not.",

      "description": "I sew as a hobby and make a lot of my own clothes. It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. \n\nMy sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. \n\nI told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. \n\nShe got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as \"a few seams on some fabric.\" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. \n\nIn the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the \"dress of her dreams\" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. \n\nThen she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!\n\nSo honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?",

      "description": "So for context, I broke up my ex a year ago and we were together for three years. It was a pretty ugly break up but we meant a lot to each other and are colleagues in an online company, we both live across the continent so seeing each other is not an option.  \n\nMy new girlfriend is very upset I still talk to her, while our talks are about work or just a catch up, they are nothing and I have reassured her.  She even talks to all her ex's herself and I said we both do it, but because mine was more serious (she has had longer relationships) so it's ok.\n\nHere comes an important part of the story, she is helping me get my dream job, I work in a very competitive industry. My girlfriend says I am pathetic for trying to beg use my ex for a job, that I can do it myself. But this is an opportunity that feels once in a lifetime if it's legit. Another aspect is my and my girlfriend live in different continents, this job would mean I would be one state away in America, and the same timezone. I've told her all of this, I talk to my ex as a friend but also a a colleague and as someone who is doing this for me.\n\nI bought her a flight to Europe for Christmas and new years. On new years she gave me us matching rings. She then got drunk and messaged my ex on Facebook saying really horrible stuff, it took my ex days to calm herself down. I said that was out of order, to apologise. She took it as a sign of me choosing my ex, my ex called me crying and threatening to tell our boss and other things and I wanted to calm her down. My girlfriend proceeds to run out the bar and in the street, trying to jump in front of a bus then crying on a street corner. All the while I was in a panic calming my ex down cos she works with my only source of income, the income I used to take her to Europe.  \n\nAfter she cried all night and, let's say it damped the trip. Since then she is adamant I shouldn't talk to my ex, my ex blocked my on social media except our work email because my ex is scared of my girlfriend doing anything worse.   \n\nAm I an ass hole for talking to my ex for practical reasons, while my girlfriend talks to hers \"rarely\", but I never mention when I see her talking to both of them? I say I feel there's one rule for me, one for her with this but she downplays herself and says I'm pathetic and shouldn't talk to her at all. The future and current job as well as her being a massive part of my life are big factors but it seems to be an obstacle in my relationship. ",

      "description": "As the title says I may or may not have caused one of my friends to end a potentially horrible relationship. I (M) have been friends with C (F) for around 4 years and I have been friends with her new boyfriend T for the same amount of time. T hasn’t had the greatest track record when it comes to relationships as he can be extremely manipulative of his partner and will emotionally abuse them if they don’t do what he wants. Me being a friend of both parties, (I’m no longer T’s friend at this moment, as you’ll find out in a bit) I support them both whole heartedly. But with me being C’s best male friend, I decide to inform her of T’s past and tell her to set boundaries and make sure T knows what she wants from this relationship in order to keep her from getting emotionally harmed. T finds out what I have done and proceeds to say that I have to leave my best friend alone and stay out of her life (not knowing that I’ve been with her through some very hard times and I’m basically her rock) I tell him no and he has no right to tell me to do that. This infuriated him and he said he was going to tell C that I am lying to her and that I don’t care about C and only feel pity for her, whatever. I then tell C about this and tell her that if she wants me leave them alone I’ll do it, she then tells me she needs me more than she needs him and doesn’t want me to leave. As of now she’s now deciding whether she wants to risk herself to see if it’s truly love or if he has ulterior motive. (He actually does and just wants to get in her pants but I don’t have the heart to tell her that) \n\nTL;DR - I may have ruined my friends first relationship in years by exposing her boyfriends terrible past\n\nP.S. this started around the first week of February and has seemingly concluded today\n\n(Please be nice this is the first time I try to do this.)",

      "description": "Buddy of mine ended up dropping out of college due to poor grades when he was around 21. Since then, he hasn't done anything except stay home. I've tried to help him, like giving lists of open-to-public exams. He hasn't taken a single one. I've also got him to write resumes to places I knew were hiring a few years ago, but after there were no call backs (probably due to lack of things to write on there), he's been down more than ever and has given up searching for jobs or doing anything productive. \n\nHe turned 29 a few weeks ago, and he started complaining to me how he's just getting older and older and not knowing what to do. I got tired of it and told him how he's almost 30 now without having done anything and needs to grow the fuck up and start looking for a job and how he's being a burden to everyone in his family. He hasn't contacted me since then.  \nAITA for trying to wake him up to reality? Was it too harsh?",

      "description": "My sister is 18 years old and a senior in HS. For years she’s been mentally ill. In terms of diagnoses she has anxiety, depression, and recently been told she has borderline personality disorder. I don’t doubt that. Anxiety and depression run in my dad’s side of the family. I have them too. \n\n\nHowever, she’s next level lazy. It’s disgusting how lazy she is. All she wants to do is smoke weed and sleep. The weed apparently helps with her mood. Alright, fair enough. She’s significantly more pleasant when she’s high. But, when she’s high she’s also tired, so she goes back to sleep. It’s a cycle, and it seems like a tradeoff. Do I want a tired and lazy sister or a raging monster?\n\nThe last time she had a job was around the end of 2016(?). She went to inpatient for 5 days or so. After that, she went to inpatient again for another few days a month or so later. That was a rough time for my family and I, and obviously, terrible for her. \n\n\nChanges were made to her medication, schooling, etc. and things seemed to be improving. But, she remains jobless, doesn’t help around the house/clean, and is extremely rude and entitled towards me and my parents. It’s frustrating, because I can tell my mom is also bothered, but she defends my sister whenever I yell at her. I don’t get it.\n\n\nObviously she feels terrible mentally. I don’t doubt that, but I can’t tell how bad it is. She goes out with friends and gets high multiple times a week. She asks for money for food and weed and juul pods. But, cleaning up after herself is apparently too much to ask. Or being nice. Or doing some simple chores. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for being resentful and doubting the extent of her illness? I love her, and want better for her. I want her to be able to move out and get a job and have a healthy social life, but currently, I’m too irritated to be super nice about things. I’ve tried that in the past. I don’t think she’s consciously taking advantage of my mom’s patience, but it sure feels that way. Yes, my mom is an adult and can look out for herself, but it pisses me off to see this happening. ",

We had a very bad relationship and she also wasn’t very religious. It was my father (who she hated up until his death) got me into religion. So lots of tension. 6:30 masses.

She was also sitting when we were kneeling, not saying prayers etc.\n\nI bring up with her how she’s being pretty disrespectful and she didn’t have to be here if she didn’t feel comfortable.

      "description": "The day before yesterday my wife went for dinner after work with a (female) friend of hers while I was at my regular's table. She told me beforehand that she'll be back home around 8pm.\n\nOur table finished earlier than usual and I called her to tell her that I'll be home sooner. She didn't pick up. That's not too unusual, so I didn't give it a thought and drove home. Upon arrival I noticed her car not being there. A little bit worried, but not overly concerned. Called her again, no response.\n\nGot home, did some housework, sat on the couch, watched some TV.\n\n10 pm. Wife didn't call back yet. Sent her a text asking when she'll be home (I actually asked her in the afternoon that I need her to revisit some paperwork with me that must be turned in the next day, she didn't reply but message was marked as read).\n\n10:30 pm. Still no sign of life. Since we both have to get up very early we usually go to bed at 10 pm\n\n11 pm. Called her 2 times. This has not happened before without any notice, so I'm getting nervous. My wife is a strong woman and can help herself out, but it's a big city and anything can happen. So I opened the laptop and went to android/find. If it's a familiar place I can relax.\n\nIt was, luckily. I thought everything was fine and since I've tried this feature on my account and never received a notice that my phone is being located I thought that she wouldn't find out. Unfortunately, she got one and is understandably mad at me. But I was genuinely worried and couldn't see any other option...\n\nShe came home at 0:30 and was all grumpy yesterday because of the lack of sleep and blamed me for not trusting her...\n\nIs this an asshole move or just stupidity?\n\nNot sure if this is more of a TIFU now that I've typed this...well, whatever\n",

      "description": "Female, 30 years old. \n\nOver the past few months I have been ‘struggling’ with a luxury problem. I have come to the realization that in my lifetime so far, I have managed to cultivate 5 friendships with 5 different women. I have known them now between 8-24+ years. These are the people I genuinely consider to be my friends. Anyone outside these 5 are either in the category family or acquaintances.  \n\nWhen it comes to friends, we are there for each other for ups and downs. We know each other intimately and really care and love each other.  So when it comes to big life events like graduation, relationships, moving into a new home, promotions at jobs or things like death in the family I am there for them and I genuinely want to be (and vice versa). Acquaintances to me are just people I happen to know that I can do drinks with or watch a movie, but the level of intimacy is shallow and superficial and I prefer it that way. If an acquaintance would ask me to borrow money or sleep on my couch for a month because they are suddenly homeless, I would find that strange and wonder where their friends or loved ones are, since I don’t think of them that way. \n\nOne example is this girl that I happen to know 8+ years who used to be my neighbor. She struggles with bouts of depression and other psychological issues which probably makes it difficult for her to make and keep friends. When I first met her she would occasionally have really negative moments where I did not enjoy being in her company. But over the years I must admit she has made improvements with regards to the negative energy she used to exude and seems to be in a better place. If we meet up (max 3 times a year) it is always on her initiative because I never call/text her. If I would never hear from her again I wouldn’t really mind because I see her more as just an acquaintance anyway. However I can tell she probably does see me as a friend, or if not that she wants us to become closer friends. However I really don’t feel the same way. And I know that making friends as an adult is hard, especially if you don’t have your core group as I’ve managed to luckily cultivate. And it’s not just her. If I would meet the most awesome person in the world tomorrow, I still wouldn’t be interested in becoming friends because I feel that in that regard I’m good. And in general I notice that I am really conscious about not giving anybody that I newly meet the impression that I am their friend (or interested to be) and that they can have these expectations from me that I’m supposed to be there for them. \n\nAITA for actively not trying to develop anymore friendships even though I can tell that some people may be lonely and would likely benefit from it?

When my mom gets home from traveling she checks hers and dads credit card balances. She sees we paid 60 dollars for a meal and starts asking questions about who we went with.\n\nI lied to her knowing I'd get in trouble if I told her the truth. And she asked dad. He told her that we went with v and her boyfriend. And she proceeds to start screaming at my dad for being untrustworthy and me for lying. I start getting pissed off and she keeps yelling and saying that I'm a liar. She yells at me asking why I lied.

      "description": "A disclaimer: I have multiple friends groups that I rotate between and am a person who tries to put a lot of effort into relationships. I have no problems with my social life. \n\nThis is one exception! For months now, I've been feeling left out from a small group of friends I made in my first year (I'm at the end of my third year now). The relationship has always been a laughy, jokey, meme-filled one, and we've had some good times, but I always felt left out. This is amplified now. They act clique-y, talk over me, only care about themselves, and only take, take, take. They try to one-up my stories, never ask me about my interests, and always try to take the higher moral ground...and I stay silent, because they're otherwise nice and I don't want to start drama.\n\nThey're also incredibly sensitive and love to complain, and if you go against their hive mind, they attack you. As a result, I developed this weirdly fake persona around them. I'm this \"happy-go-lucky\", \"meme-y\", \"goofy\" person with them all the time because they can't handle any deep conversation. It's exhausting.\n\nRecent events have been strange. My sister had a fight with a friend from the group because he never gave her any effort while she put in a lot. Three of them broke off and made a separate group chat and try to hide it. There have been more lies and weird stuff going on that's too much to explain here. It's gotten sketchy and I can't handle this bullshit. \n\nIt just so happens that I recently quit my retail job and have been on a journey to stop being a people pleaser and doormat. So today, I mentioned a joke on the group chat that offended one of my friends (it was a picture from the Bikini Bottom subreddit, the one about \"when you roast the sensitive friend in your group\" and Patrick and Spongebob are trying to fix Squidward's art) and I just went OFF. I said they never value me as a friend, they never put in the effort, they're too sensitive, they're childish, they need to act like adults, etc.\n\nMy friends were responding by taking the higher moral ground (ex. I said \"I wish you asked me how I was and delved into my interests sometimes\" and she said \"I will only change for my Mom and God\"), however what got to me was that a friend said I was terrible for doing this during exam season and that I was an asshole for stressing them out when they were already stressed. That's when I left the chat.\n\nI feel really bad about it guys. The feelings were strong and I felt so much lighter after finally sharing what I felt, and I knew that if I waited I would convince myself to stay silent again, but I really didn't want to hurt them during exam season because it's such a hard time mentally for most students. They're not inherently mean people (but they are self-centered).\n\nAm I the asshole for venting my feelings during this difficult time?",

I didn’t want to move in but my spouse convinced me this would be the best for our savings, so we sold a bunch of our furniture and moved in, since she didn’t get a storage unit like she said she would. 5 months later MIL comes back for a two week vacation, only that’s turned into two months, and now she’s saying she might not go back to the other country at all. Now my spouse and I are going to have to move out, in a worse financial position than we started, and hardly any furniture. \n\nAnyways, she’s moving all of my things around, not helping to clean at all, and I don’t think we should be paying the entire mortgage and utilities while she’s here too, but my spouse doesn’t want to upset her and keeps saying this is “her house” but it’s my home, I’m essentially paying to be here and I wouldn’t be here if she hadn’t asked.

On many occasions I would stop and talk with him, I’ve consulted him and helped him learn and do things to advance his career.

Tom came walking through the area and stopped and joined our conversation. Him and I began to kind of trade jokes with each other. One of the people there stopped us and said “calm down guys, no need to be like that.” Tom replied “Oh, we do this all the time.

      "description": "This happened a few months ago, but it's still not settled. Here goes:\n\nMy friend, who we'll call Beth, left town for a week to attend a funeral and some kind of memorial service thing that was a few days afterward. I didn't personally know the deceased, who we will call Sophie, but Beth was good friends with her before Sophie died in a car accident. A third friend in that circle who was close with both Beth and Sophie, who we will call Nick, also attended the funeral. \n\nBeth tells me that Nick left after the first funeral service, saying that he wanted to visit his girlfriend, instead of attending the memorial thing. \n\nI don't know really know Nick except from a few common social events. I didn't know Sophie before she died at all. So I can't presume to know what Nick was thinking or exactly how close he was with Sophie. So all I know is what he said to Beth before she told me:\n\nBeth gave me the whole enchilada to eat at once and asked my opinion. She said that she texted with Nick after he left, that he replied in short sentences with little information or sharing, and that she told him he was letting Sophie's memory down and saying that he cared more about getting laid than about his dead friend. After she said these things to him, Nick stopped talking to her for good.\n\nBeth said that Nick was being a huge asshole who was throwing away a friendship she thought was special. I said that he might be an asshole, but she was definitely too harsh with him if she wanted to remain friends. I said to her that accusing someone of not caring about their dead friend is enough to drive someone away, whether it's true or not. \n\nBeth thinks I was being an asshole for saying that, making excuses for bad behavior. Beth believes what she said to Nick was justified and that he's the asshole for cutting her off. \n\nAITA? I hope I explained this clearly enough. ",

      "description": "The first time i saw my little sister i was confused, after 12 years telling my parents that i needed a little company, i didn't feel very comfortable with it. My mom had 2 lost of the embryo by doing excessive force in my house, she did it by his own, and i and my dad didn't know bout' it.\nNow, i think my parents are educating their daughter horrible af. She knows how to handle YouTube so see the videos she likes (Yeah, that horrible ones that are supposed to be for the kids. Elsa and Spider by example) She does it with extremely precision on the tactile of the mobile, changing one video to other and skipping the ads. BTW she gets angry every time we take it out, maybe screaming very loud and stuff, everywhere &amp; anytime.\nShe's irritable too, she treats me bad and then my parents tell me I'm a bad brother, when she had a accident 2 days ago i was on the garden and she almost crushed her fingers with the wooden door. My parents yelled at me saying why the fuck i was not there.\nTime to time, i started getting soooo tired of the situation, thinking that she's the favourite and I'm a dumbass that stays in the house for no reason. (I'm 13 Y.O)\nI don't like to be with my sister, only when I'm the only one in the house and i need to take care of her. We don't do anything together than eating at the night. She looks a bit disappointed of my behavior with her, apparently my parents don't give a fuck while i don't do something bad to her, and i will not obviously.\nBut i don't like to stay with her in ANY situation that doesn't requires my presence 100%. No hugs, no love each other. Nothing.\n\nThen i start to think if I'm being an asshole doing all this stuff even after what my mother did to give me a company in this shitty life i will live. I'm not to worried about it, just when i think that, when my parents die, who will be my only company then? Yeah, she will be.\n",

      "description": "Throwaway because my coworkers browse reddit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: In middle school I was a smaller kid, and my family wasn't well off to boot although my parents were always able to provide for me and have a roof over my head. At one point, the big thing at school was RipStiks. All the cool kids had one and if you didn't have one you were lame. Since my family wasn't really well off, I never got one even though I constantly asked for one, which is totally fine. However since I didn't get one I was always tormented, and I remember one particularly bad experience with the cool kids riding them they would go in circles around me and then one by one the bigger kids would rush at me on their boards and push me around. It was a pretty traumatic experience at the time. Which leads me to now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk a few miles to and from work, and in the middle of my journey is a park with grass and a bit of a skater area. A few days ago there were these two kids riding around on ripstiks and I got kinda nostalgic and looked at them for a second. I then turned and kept walking, but the kids took it badly that I was there for some reason. One of the kids started skating towards me and circling around me saying stuff like \"What the hell are you looking at old man?\". At one point he skated a little too close and I freaked out, reliving my traumatic experience in middle school and I pushed him off his board and he landed in the grass. Then I picked up his board and smashed it a few times against the sidewalk, and it broke into pieces. I saw the kid about to start crying so I ran the rest of the way home hoping he would forget what I look like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeeing them ride around made me want to live the childhood experience I lost out on, so I ended up buying a ripstik of my own from walmart so I could maybe ride it to work. It ended up being harder than expected to ride so I kind of tossed that idea, but when I was telling my coworker about my new board he asked why I bought it and I told him the story above, and he called me a fucking asshole. He wouldn't let up even though I explained that I have some childhood bully trauma and those kids reminded me of it, so I'm here asking if you guys think I was justified in what I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I’m a 35 year old man.  i live in my brother’s home.  I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend’s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?

      "description": "Ok, so yesterday I went out to the lake with my family to give my baby (3 months) her first swim of the summer. \n\nThere was an event on at the front of the lake so we went around the back. My parents, brother and his son took a separate car. My partner, daughter and I took our car. Everyone was parking on the side grass area and I told my partner to go to the main parking bit. \n\nOur daughter was getting upset at this stage so I told my partner to park in one of the 10 empty parks. There was a mini bus beside us and the driver was telling us to move (it seemed so they could just drive straight and get out). I was out of the car getting my daughter out and I told the mini bus driver to just reverse, I was getting my baby out. \n\nAnother lady then came over and was telling us to move. I said no that we wouldn’t move and the mini bus could just reverse and go around us. She said something like “so you expect the runners to go around you just because you have a baby”. I just told her to “fuck off”. She then walked closer to me (at this point I had my baby in her car seat out of the car, and she said to me “what’d you say” (I’m 27F and she would have probably been 50F). I said “I said fuck off”. She then said “I’ll punch your lights out”. I told her that if she did that I’d phone the police. \n\nMy partner wound down the window and said “did you just say you’d punch my baby”. I don’t think he heard her properly.\n\nAn older man came over to move the lady away from me and diffuse the situation. My dad also ran over and happened to know the older lady so he told her to calm down. \n\nMy partner eventually moved the car to another spot as none of us realized that the event was a running event and the runners were running through the parking lot. I told the lady to put up some cones if people were not to park there, not just assume that people wouldn’t park in an empty space. \n\nSo, AITA for telling this lady to “fuck off” when she was trying to make us move for what seemed like no reason at all?

      "description": "Hi. My friends and I are in high school (I don't know if that matters or not) and there is a guy that we all think of as a friend. We'll call him John. John is kind of annoying. He's always yelling and when we play video games he screams at us and the other team. We ask him to stop and he says he will but he never does. It's not always like this though. He also has good moments where he's calm and quite enjoyable to be around.\n\nThis has been happening for months and we've all gotten tired of it so a week ago we decided to remove John from our group chat for a third time. He's been messaging some of us saying that he's sorry and that he won't do it again, but that's what he said the other two times. I feel bad because when he's not yelling he's really nice.",

      "description": "Throwaway in case anyone I know is on here.\n\nI'm currently in college and I dated my ex back in junior year high school. I had asked her out early in the school year, and the relationship lasted a little past our school's homecoming (2 months). She was always adamant about being honest with each other, so when she broke up with me saying she just needed a break, I trusted her, and believed we'd get back together.\n\nMove forward a few weeks, and I got a text along the lines of \"I think I want to get back together, but I'm not certain\". Even then as I was blindly wanting to get back together with her, I knew that the text seemed like the kind of thing that could be setting me up for failure. After a weekend of silence from her, she says that she didn't want to get back together. I asked why, and she said that she didn't want to date someone who wasn't a practicing Christian, something that she knew I wasn't for years. I asked why it was suddenly a problem, and she said that it was why she dumped me, and that she'd been thinking about breaking up for several weeks before doing it. That time included our homecoming, a night that I once thought was the best night of my life. When I asked why she never told me this when she was preaching honesty, she said something like \"I didn't want you to think you didn't have a chance with me\". \n\nOver the next few months, I received texts like \"I miss __, __, and __ from when we were together\", \"seeing other couples makes me wish we were dating again\", and eventually another \"I think I want to get back together\", while switching between not minding if I'm not religious, and it being a deal breaker. She knew that I still wasn't over her, but she sent those texts and got upset if I mirrored the sentiments. After all that, I was finally done, but she wasn't; she insisted on going to junior prom together, despite saying that she had zero desire to date me again just a few days earlier, amongst other things. \n\nI eventually realized she was only making my depression worse, but by this point in time, she was a part of my friend group. Everyone seemed happy to have her there, so I never told anyone from that friend group about what she put me through. Last semester, many of my college friends (none went to my high school) had me talk about this relationship. They said that I should cut her from my life entirely, so I deleted her on social media, her number, and the conversation history.\n\nA few days ago, I get a text from her questioning if I'd deleted her from Facebook, and forgetting I'd deleted her number too, asked who I was talking to, which upset her. She asked why I did it and I told her she had tried to build a friendship on lies and empty promises, that the friendship was toxic to me, and after a time it just collapsed, plus she wasn't making any effort to stay friends. She hasn't responded since, and I'm feeling like I was too harsh. So, AITA?",

      "description": "Last night my GF and I were walking to the grocery store from Goodwill next door as we are on the sidewalk I hear yelling and see a tall fit guy in his thirties running in our direction with two women in pursuit (one older Salvation Army bell ringer and another woman who was short and overweight). \n\nI see a frantic look on his face and the SA donation bucket under his arm. As he runs by I grab him by the backpack strap and yank him, throwing him to the ground. The bucket rolled a few feet away. As he jumped up his attention was fixed on me, starting to rush me. I could tell he was willing to fight for the money instead of cutting his losses and running away. \n\nI took a step back to improve my range for a counter if needed (I am a bouncer and have a enough boxing and Jiu-Jitsu training to handle myself; not much but enough). He decided to just go for the bucket and run off instead of attacking me. \n\nI didn’t stop him. \n\nI could have, maybe. But a few thoughts went through my head as soon as he went for the bucket instead of me. \n“I won’t have the element of surprise the second time”\n“There are no other men around to help if things go bad.”\nAnd\n“Best case scenario: I’m the hero for rescuing $50 worth of quarters that don’t really belong to anyone except a massive non-profit.”\n“Worst case scenario: I get stabbed in front of my girlfriend for trying to rescue $50 worth of quarters.”\n\nIt wasn’t worth it. \nAnyways, back to the asshole part. The two women catch up as he runs off. The short overweight one sarcastically mentions something about what a Good Samaritan I was. I say “excuse me?” hoping that I misread her tone. She then scoffs at me again blaming me for letting him get away. \n\nI reply stating that I wasn’t going to risk getting stabbed over a few dollars. \n\nTo which she says “this is the reason I’m going into the [police] academy! Because of guys like you not doing anything to help!” \n\nI yell back “Fuck you!” and nothing more. She didn’t like that very much. She said “say it again! I’m on the phone with the cops!” Which is when we decided to leave. \n\nThis happened last night and I’m still wondering if I should’ve done more and cared more, and if she was right to call me out. My girlfriend thinks I did the right thing and so did my boss (who is an ex cop) but part of me still feels like Peter Parker letting the robber who then murdered his uncle get away. \n\n\n",

      "description": "Okay. Before I get into the story.\n\n1) I do think I could've handled the situation better.\n\n2) You're going to need some information on my fucked up family tree.\n\nMy mother has 5 kids. My father has 1. My mother's ex husband is my mother's sisters now husband. Meaning my Brothers and Sisters father is my Uncle. And my Cousins are my Brother and Sisters, Brothers and Sisters.\n\n(I am aware that they're my Half Brothers and Half Sisters but it's already confusing enough.)\n\nNow. My brothers and sisters are all older than me. The youngest being my sister who is two years older than me at 20. \n\nAnyway. Into the story.\n\nU/G/ME = My Uncle/Groom/Mothers Ex\nA/B/MS = Aunt/Bride/Mothers Sister\nMe = Me.. Obviously.\n\nEarly into the year a few years ago my A/B/MS and my U/G/ME announced their engagement. My mother is completely fine with this. My Siblings are fine with this and My father is fine with it. I'm fine with it. It's not like we get to dictate who they marry. We all get along reasonably well. Apart from U/G/ME and my Father. The two have always had slight 'rivalry' because U/G/ME Dislikes my Father referring to my siblings as 'his kids' even though he raised them. It's not like he doesn't allow U/G/ME To call them 'his kids' either and my siblings call, U/G/ME Father, not mine, which makes perfect sense. Because of multiple arguments and the occasional fight spurred on by careless wording at house parties my Father, who knows fine well that he struggles with drinking, has decided not to attend the wedding. Although he's congratulated A/B/MS on her marrige and personally gave her her gift. \n\nAnd y'see, this is where I come in. U/G/ME doesn't particularly like me. It's not like he's outright horrible to me. He just has a distaste for Me, and I assume it's because of my Father. Now, when we were invited to the wedding, the invitation stated that, '(Mothers name.) (Sibling) (Sibling) (Sibling) and (Sibling)' we're invited, not me or my Father. My Mother asked if this was simply a mistake, and A/B/MS said yes. However, and this may just be me being paranoid, but I can't help feel like it's a subtle hint that were not wanted.\n\nSo, the previous night at Dinner, (And looking back, a family dinner may of not been the best place to announce this.) I'd announced that I didn't want to attend the wedding and I'd much rather stay at home and keep my Father company. This did not go down well, my Father, who supporters idea, was the only one who remained calm. My Mother told me I was going and that I should be so: selfish, expectant, ignorant. I informed her that I was happy for my Aunt and Uncle, I'd congratulate them and send a card when I could, but would just uncomfortable in such a situation. \n\nMy siblings aren't speaking to me and I'm torn. I can see why I'd be the asshole but I'd like some outside opinions. \n\n~ Kudos. ",

      "description": "Ok, so I know your about to say \"no sweetie, toxic people in your life aren't good for you\" but read the story first bc this is more about them than about me.\n\nSo I have had this school friend for about two years. We met when she first came to the school and I, being the extrovert who likes to befriend introverts (at the time), went up and said hi. I kind of took her under my wing as I had been at that school for much longer. She was great at first. We became so close that we became a package deal. For the first 6 months of our friendship, we were absolutely inseparable and loved each other (platonically) a lot. At that time she was one of my few friends because most of my friends moved away. All the other friends in my life have been popular people who I just kinda hung out with or friends who I didn't have a chance to grow with bc they moved so having someone who actively wanted to hangout with me probably made me blind to some red flags. It wasn't until last year that I finally started seeing it.\nShe has a lot of good tropes but also a few too many bad tropes as well. (I really want to paint her personality here  so I don't make her seem like a monster)\nSome of her more prominent bad tropes are: she is extremely clingy and has gotten in the way of me making some friends, she is extremely sensitive and cries over extremely benign things, she is extremely judgemental over people, is quick to make judgments and is very narrow minded about things, brings up past memories that are distasteful to put you down, won't stop bringing up different things eg: omg you so owe me bc I introduced you to ______, makes it a point that you should do things for her bc she got you into something or did something for you out of the \"kindness of her heart,\" does something for you and says it's her treat but then suddenly expects you to pay her back even though she told you earlier that you didn't, only talks about a few topics over and over again, over does jokes ALL the time eg: wouldn't stop singing the I'm already tracer thing which ruined it for me, makes jokes at the wrong time eg: anytime you say hard, wet, long, thick, deep, big etc, laughs AT you when you make a mistake, no matter how small eg: voice hitches when I sing and suddenly it's the funniest thing in the world (i have told her nicely to stop but she still does it), is the victimising queen eg: I was telling her to stop attacking a person in a group chat of ours and suddenly it became about how shitty her childhood was???, makes excuses thinking it will fix the situation or starts crying to get people to favour her, tells other people your personal details without your consent eg: I was at comic-con and a guy was getting a picture with me and asked her to take the picture and she legit told him that I was gay??? Like who tf does that... (I told her off for that), acts extremely childish and whines A LOT eg: I was at her house the other day and her dad was showing me his work shop and she suddenly got all pissy bc I wasn't showing her attention for like half a minute, doesn't have any aspirations in life and expects to ride off her parents, is rude to her parents, is rude in general, can sometimes act like she owns you, you do what ever she wants to do even if it doesn't make you feel comfortable but as soon as you want her to do one thing that isn't even that hard/scary she backs out bc she isn't up to experiencing anything new (grew up sheltered and spoiled), refuses to do most of her school work, 98% of the things she talks ab is just her \"tea\" against people, every time we meet someone she has to point out all of their bad attributes eg: said guy mentioned earlier with the personal info, she immediately labels him as a pervert bc he liked my cosplay and wanted a photo with me, a lot of her opinions are fake bc the moment I say I disagree with them so we can get a conversation going she immediately sides with me and sure for the most part that would be good but I really enjoy having some friendly banter.\n\nSome of her good tropes: is extremely passionate ab the things she loves, has gotten me into a few different things that have changed my life just a little bit, has a similar sense of humour (most of the time) to me, has been with me through my tough times, is always available to hangout, will just sit with you and chill, shares answers to stuff and helps me with my work, is encouraging when I share my stuff with her, always has my back, has helped me vent, knows exactly what I need, similar likes to a lot of things, same music taste that we can talk ab, let's me fangirl to her even though she has no idea what I'm talking ab.\n\nNow both of these lists are incomplete and if I thought about it for longer both would expand. The thing is, she isn't a monster. She is very manageable but the problem is, is that if I spend too much time with her at once she starts acting less nice, more judgmental and flat out clingy. Now you're probably thinking that maybe I'm rubbing off on her and I'm probably being horrible and for some part of that, you're right. I was an asshole back when we first me and I was judgemental but I had an experience that led me to stop doing that as much as I could about a year or more ago.  But now she does it without any prompt from me or anyone for that matter. Other people have told me (as I'm the only one who is really close friends with her) that she insults a lot of people at school just bc they aren't friends with her and I've observed it too. \n\nI love making friends myself, and having many people to talk to and hangout with but I have been flat out told by people that the reason they don't hangout with me at school or don't like hanging out with me in general is because they don't like her vibe. I didn't know what that meant at first but then I finally got explained that they didn't enjoying having someone who is listening to our conversations but not joining in at all and doesn't even sit with us (sits at the table next to us and eavesdrops) that she gives off a vibe of not liking them, and since she's always around me, they can't stand being around me bc of her.\n\nThis definitely made me mad at first bc of the whole \"how dare you insult my best friend\" sorta thing but I definitely started seeing it more myself and realising what they were saying.  \n\nNow I need to tell you that she IS NOT a horrible person and I still love hanging out with her and being friends with her but it feels like I'm her parent and she's my bratty child more and more with every passing day. Sure, she is the only person that I can talk to about a lot of things and she saves me from being alone during lunches but I feel like she's bringing more problems in my life than she is bringing in good things.\n\n(I just wanted to add that yes, she does literally bribe me to be her friend. Every time I feel like our friendship isn't working, she randomly buys me food and tells me that I'm her only friend, guilt tripping me and also making me seem like a bad person if I drop her bc if I do it would seem like I'm just using her for her money. I have tried to get her to stop spending money on me btw)\n\nThe biggest conflict I have with this whole situation is that, it's true that I'm the only person that's genuinely close with her in general. Of course she has other friends but she has made it a big point to me that her only best friend. \n\nI don't want to hurt her but when (because it will happen, unless she cleans up her act, which is UNLIKELY)  I drop her I will.\n\nshe's a genuinely good person under all of the bad but for me there is too much bad to deal.\n\nI hate hurting people but at the same time I need to take care of myself and not just the people around me.\n\nTL;DR The whole situation to me is like an addiction. For a short amount of time it's good/enjoyable but the substance is doing more damage than good and will continue to worsen if I keep doing it but I'm scared of the withdrawal symptoms if I stop doing it. even though the moments where I do it are great, once I come out of it the whole situation is just harmful and slowly ruining me. But I am the one who got me in the situation so I am responsible.\n\n\n\nSo, people of reddit, I have presented my case and now it's time for you to judge: AITA for wanting to drop my toxic friend?\n\n\n",

      "description": "For context, my mom has been a single parent for around ten years of my life. My dad passed away when I was very young, and she took care of me with minimal to no support from relatives until she married my stepdad.\n\nI'm 20, female. I live in a country where it is acceptable to live with your parents until you finish college and get a job. Actually, it's acceptable to live with them even after that. Usually until you get married.\n\nAlright, so a few months back I got in trouble when my parents got to know I was sexually active with my boyfriend. Again, we live in a country where this is frowned upon.\n\nSince then, she has kept too close of a watch on me. She reads my texts when I'm asleep, she screenshots pictures that I have and she uses both of these against me, because I don't conform to what she thinks is a good daughter. (Which would include not going out too much with friends, like twice a month, getting back home before six in the evening, not wearing clothes that show even the slightest amount of skin, or tops that don't cover my butt.) \n\nI'll be honest and say I'm not that kind of a person. I love wearing clothes that make me feel sexy. I like going out with friends, and I feel like I'm old enough to decide whether or not I want to have sex with a person. But all that is considered taboo by my parents, and the society that I live in. I've been slut-shamed for the past few months, and they've asked me to move out if I can't live by their rules. Any time I mention going out with friends, they refuse to let me out. Unless I spend a few hours arguing with them about it. This used to happen before the \"discovery\" too. As I mentioned, a good daughter wouldn't go out too much or come home later than 6. All that. \n\nEvery time I bring up a conversation about boundaries with my mom, she brings up the past and uses her struggle to bring me up to guilt me. She also refuses to acknowledge that she's being controlling. Her argument is that I should go by her rules as she's struggled a lot for me and this is something I would do if I loved her. \n\nI feel guilty that I'm hurting her. She HAS suffered a lot for me, and I'm thankful for that, but I'd like to have a life of my own, where I make the decisions. I feel like I'm old enough for this.\n\nAITA for asking her to stay out of my life? \n",

      "description": "I've been working a new job for the past five months, and while I don't have much to do right now, I still have to sit at a desk for 9 hours every day and be attentive. My mom has been in her job for a year and recently she has been talking about this woman who causes a lot of drama in the office, a woman that everyone in the office wants fired.  \n\nI'm still living at home until I can save more money to move out (I'm 23, just graduated). Most days I'm fine coming home and talking about our days at work, but then I like to move on to something else non-work related because I like to have a life outside of work. She tends to bring her work home with her, and will talk to anyone who will listen to her problems. The past few days have been really bad. She mostly talks to me about work, maybe some of her friends will come over and she'll talk to them about it, and when they leave she comes back to me and talks about it again, most of which I have already heard or we discussed from the past week. I feel like she is talking at me and not to me.\n\nLast night I finally decided to tell her that I don't mind talking about her problems at work, because I do care about them, I just can't do it all night every night of the week. She literally started crying and said I don't care about her problems and that she just needs to vent sometimes. How I am spoiled and live off of her money (her idea for me to stay at home and save), and that I don't have a real job. I told her that I want to hear about her problems it's just that I get drained hearing about it for hours every night. I feel bad because I do still live with her, so I feel like I owe her. But at the same time it is very exhausting and overwhelming to be at my own job all day, just to come home and hear more complaining about work. She tells me that I'm just an assistant, and she is a manager, and one day when I have a real job I will understand. So AMITA? Should I let my nights be consumed by the drama because I need to support my mom, or am I somewhat justified? Or a mix of both?",

      "description": "I'll try to write this out in a way that makes sense, ah. Sorry for the length but I feel I need to give as much backstory as I can to this.\nI'll preface this by saying I have diagnosed mental issues (won't specify past they're behavioural for privacy) and they affect my behaviour at times. My ex also has diagnosed mental issues, but not the same as mine. \nWe were together for about a year or so, where a lot of things happened to us both, making us both quite unstable. We were both severely dependent on each other and sacrificed a lot of time just to be with each other in fear the other would kill themselves or worse would happen if we weren't with each other. They broke up with me a few months ago, saying they couldn't handle my instability on top of their own and their own life ect, which I can't blame them for at all. I'd have a lot of breakdowns in which they'd be afraid for my safety, to the point they'd not go outside or focus on school as much as they should do. I want to stress I NEVER asked them to do this, it was never me telling them to drop everything and comfort me. They did so without telling me how badly it was affecting them and I was somehow unaware they were sacrificing so much. I did the same as well, admittedly, us doing this fucked us both up even more, and I think it was a massive contributor. Neither of us wanted to admit anything was wrong or break up at the time. Them keeping things from me, even incredibly important thing was a long trend as well. I knew them well enough to tell they were hiding things, but they'd insist nothing was wrong. \nTo the proper point of this, after the breakup and enough time for me to be calm about it and be able to speak to them and be alright, they told me they still wanted to be friends, which I was fine with, saying how they wanted to travel with me in the future, planning all sorts of things, ect. When they're not making all these sorts of promises they're completely ignoring me even when I'm asking them about very important things, which I don't take very well to from anyone. This pisses me off, because I feel like I'm being thrown around and played with.\nI've asked my close friends about it, but I neglected to mention how I also felt messed up from the relationship. I feel like I've been an asshole and that its all my fault, but my friends for some reason tell me I'm not. Either its obvious I got messed up too from how toxic it ended up being or god knows what.\nSorry for this mess of a post, rip",

      "description": "So I am a junior in high school and the course that I am attending is quite a challenging one. Due to this reason, a couple of my friends and I created a facebook group where we can ask questions to each other and such. The group expanded with the majority of the students taking the course being in the group. Now the problem is this: A sophomore student joined the group. Keep in mind it was a group for just some questions and general help. This student, for some reason, thought it was a tutor group or some shit. An average member in the group would ask a question or two per month or none at all. This student legit spammed the shit of our group with personal basic questions that were quite stupid and useless. They were questions about basic concepts that teachers went over in class and it was absurd. And it got annoying. The student would post around 10-12 questions per day and the majority of the members started to stop answering her questions. Now this would be a hint, right? Nope. She reported this to the teacher and the teacher gave us a talk about including everyone and not excluding people. So most of us in the group are pretty fucking annoyed with multiple people just leaving the group. Out of frustration, on one of her posts, I sent a clear message. \"\\[Student's name\\], please try to avoid asking multiple questions that could be answered by a simple google search. This is not a replacement for a tutor, but merely a small community for us to help EACH OTHER. Thanks\". All hail went loose. I got reported to the office, got a talk about verbal abuse and yada yada yada. Some people thanked me. Some people glared at me. Now, I personally thought it was one of those cases where \"someone had to do it\". Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I’ll start by saying I don’t feel like I come between friends in a malicious way or with bad intentions, but I’m always drawn to those situations. \n\nI’ve never had a solid group of friends, I’ve always kind of drifted between groups. I don’t like drama and I find it gets real old and boring fast. So I’ve always felt better just ignoring it and moving on with my life. No need to get involved and dig myself a grave if I don’t need to. \n\nRecently I’ve realized I’m always in third wheel situations. Whether it’s with two girl best friends, or girl and guy who are “friends”, I’m always the extra one. \n\nWhen it comes to the matter of two girl best friends, I’m always somehow never able to become friends with “the other girl”. I also end up feeling left out most of the time because my friend always seems to be more close with their other friend than me. \n\nThis type of situation happens often with different people. Part of me feels like I’m always that friend who other people talk about all their other friends to, and it’s like everyone has this line they won’t cross with me. Like I’m only allowed so far into friend groups and friendships because people know if I get too far they won’t be able to talk to me the same way about people.. it’s a really weird feeling because sometimes I feel like I’m always the toxic one and that’s why no one wants to really be my friend. \n\nI don’t feel toxic as in, i talk about others  behind their back. But I’m toxic like I’ll tell someone the truth if I need to. If someone feels comfortable enough with me to ask if their friend talks about them, I’ll tell the truth. \n\nIt seems like in the end the two friends end up against me as if lied to tried to cause an unnecessary situation, but to me it seems both are just lying to each other because neither trust me. \n\nI’m tired of unhealthy friendships and situations. \n\n\n",

      "description": "So my company is working on an outdoor event, we had the whole venue to ourselves for two days leading up to the event, and the whole team was having dinner at the venue. And slowly everyone left the table and it was only me, my boss's GF and a friend of hers. She walked away with her friend, and expected me to take care of her bags.\n\nI was never asked to care for the bags nor did she ask me if I'd be willing to just be there until she comes back. I didn't realise her bags were there and I walked away. We run into each other after five minutes and she asks me where her bags were and I realised it then that there were bags and she expected me to look after it. I told her I can't be responsible for her things and so she walks away to find my boss. \n\nHe comes back in a rage, yells at me in front of the whole team and says I can't say 'everyone is responsible for their own things, as a decent human being I should have been bag-sitting' \n\nAnd I told him yes, saying everyone should be responsible for their own things is shitty, but it's the truth. To which he started saying I haven't been doing any work, started assigning random work (for the event) to me that's no where close to what my skillset is. And tells me not to come in to work after this event is done. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So my now ex-boyfriend is a big believer in love and symbols, specifically wedding rings I guess. We were in a pretty committed (yikes) relationship at the time, and the subject of us getting married someday came up. I wasnt opposed to the idea of getting married, but I was pretty set on not having a wedding ring or at least not wearing one.\n\nWhen I told him I didn't want one or I wouldn't wear it he got pretty upset and I just could not understand why. He said the wedding ring is a symbol of our love. Plus if I never wore it how would people know I'm married, especially if I went out and someone tried to hit on me thinking I'm single. He also mentioned he worried I'd cheat or something because there would be no proof on my hand that I'm married.\n\nI had a few reasons of my own. 1. I have never enjoyed wearing jewelry in my life, especially rings. It honestly makes me uncomfortable to have something around my fingers like that. 2. I dont need a ring to prove I love someone. 3. If someone tried to hit on me why can't I just TELL them I'm taken? Either way it's not like everyone looks for or respects a wedding ring anyway. 4. I'm not going to cheat.\n\n My biggest fear though was number one. I don't know why, but I just can't stand to have rings on, every time I'd try I'd get anxious and be unable to focus. He said it's something I can get over if I tried, but I dont want to get over it honestly. I would rather just not wear jewelry, I don't like how it looks anyway so it's not holding me back from anything. Plus I was honestly a little offended he didn't trust that I could go out on my own without proof that I'm not single. I also felt like he was being a bit possessive, I don't think like I should need this physical symbol of him on me at all times.\n \nHe would say it's okay and I dont have to wear it but then he'd say he'd be very upset if I didn't. Made me feel pretty guilty and I just don't know. So am I the asshole for not wanting a wedding ring?",

      "description": "Me (20) and my now ex girlfriend (21) have been together for about 6 months. We both go to the same college and are in the same friend group. This is also both of ours’ first not abusive/manipulative relationship. The sex was alright on my side, but very good for her. Most times she would finish 3 or 4 times and I would MAYBE finish. There was a month span where I didn’t come at all during sex. \n\nThings go great for the first couple months. But then we start arguing a lot. I tell myself that it’s normal, couples argue all the time. But then the arguing didn’t stop. She would pick fights over small things that didn’t matter. \n\nThe last month or so was absolutely terrible. I have no doubt about it now, I was emotionally abused. My roommate told me every night I came back, my mood would be terrible. Maybe 1 night a week I’d be okay. There were even more arguments and one time I asked her if she was actually mad, or if she was taking out her stress. She told me she was taking it out this way. I told her I couldn’t do it anymore if this continues. That my mental state would collapse. So I expected at least some change. \n\nNothing changed. If anything, if got worse. She stopped listening to me about really important things. She had a medical problem that could be very serious if not treated, and when I advised her to go, several times, she didn’t want to. She didn’t want to call and schedule.\n\nOne night all our friends confronted me and said that something has to change because I’m unhappy all the time. It opened my eyes and showed me that I wasn’t crazy when I thought all this about my girlfriend. So a couple days later I broke up with her. And we stopped contact for a couple days. \n\nAbout 4 days after the breakup, we see each other in class. She asks if I want help writing my essay, and we end up going back to her room. We talk about the break up. She’s still in love with me. But I didn’t know how I felt. I watched the person I love whittle me down to nothing consciously; I couldn’t do anything about it either. We both consider FWB and agree on it. I told her, maybe there’s some way I can look past this, and we can work out again. \n\nWe have sex that night. After a while, I tell her I couldn’t do anything romantically with her. Ever. All I could see is the person yelling at me. The person getting angry over nothing. The person lying to our friends about our arguments, twisting it on me. She tells me that I played with her. By telling her that maybe we could work out, but retracting that later. \n\nAITA for sleeping with her and telling her I can’t look past the situation?\n\ntl;dr: My emotionally abusive ex and I talked and I told her we could maybe work things out. After sex I retract my statement, because I couldn’t look past it. She says I played her. AITA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Let me start this by saying I love my wife whatsoever and other than this, we have no issues whatsoever.\n\nMy wife frequently gets home later than I do, simply because I start work before she does. However over the past year there have been many times where she won't come home until well past dinner time, and usually won't let me know that she'll be late until well after I would expect her to come home.\n\nI started asking her several months ago to tell me in the morning what time I could expect her home, and that if she would be late then all she has to do is let me know at some point during the day that she would be late. This hasn't worked out very well, though. She is pretty bad at estimating when she will be able to leave work - often times she will text me saying that she will be able to leave in 15 minutes, but then not leave for another hour. Sometimes it's because she is working on a project that has to be completed that day, but oftentimes it's because a co-worker or student comes to her office to talk to her (about work related things).\n\nShe has responded to this by instead not giving me an estimate for when she'll be home, since she's so bad at doing so (even she admits this). But I would much prefer that she just ... give me an estimate, and stick to it. She has told me that it seems controlling of me to do this, but honestly I just want to be able to plan my day and not knowing when she will be home makes it very difficult to do so - and my argument is that she is not respecting my time. On top of this, we will often be late for engagements because of this behavior.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

It’s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It’s nothing super over the top, but there’s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she’s injured herself several times (she’s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I’ve seen to CPS. They’ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it’s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n",

      "description": "I met a girl at a meeting for a club at my uni that neither of us ended up joining, but I got her number and we ended up hanging out a few times and eventually hooking up at her place. There was clear verbal consent on both ends beforehand so that was fine. I tend to get performance anxiety when having sex with a new person for the first time, and I didn’t maintain a full erection while we were having sex. I told her beforehand that sometimes I get nervous the first time with someone so even if it seems like I don’t want to, I do. We eventually stopped and neither of us finished, and I went home because she seemed a bit distant and said she was tired. I texted her a day or two later apologizing and saying if she didn’t want to hook up anymore that’s fine and I don’t mind staying friends. She agreed and I explained better my issue with performance anxiety and how even if I’m really into someone it might not be apparent, and that I wanted her to know it wasn’t anything to do with her. The conversation was going fine but right in the middle of it she stopped replying and then ghosted for 2 months. There wasn’t anything I think I said at that time that could have prompted that, and I was bummed for a few days but got over it. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, she texts me out of the blue saying hey and apologizing for not replying, but otherwise acting like nothing nothing happened. We talked for a bit and I asked her why she texted me, to which she replied that she just forgot and realized when looking at old messages. I didn’t really buy that because she ghosted in the middle of a pretty important conversation, but I still suggested we could try hanging out as friends again or I wished her the best and she agreed to hang out. We discussed when we were free and suddenly she tells me “you are the one who said you needed to hang out, not me” it seemed like a really odd thing to say, but it was kind of a miscommunication because she interpreted my earlier text as “let’s hang out or good luck with your life” even though I worded it nicely and didn’t mean it that way, so I told her that and apologized that it came off that way. She said she just wanted to be on speaking terms again and didn’t necessarily need to hang out, and I replied that we were never off speaking terms and she was the one who ghosted. She said she realized that but she was also the one reaching out again. I didn’t reply.\n\nAITA?\n\nI feel like maybe I put her in an uncomfortable position because she didn’t think I wanted to have sex and I probably didn’t explain it well beforehand\n\nOn the other hand, I think she handled it immaturely by ghosting me halfway through the conversation after\n\nSorry for all this rambling but I felt like it was all pretty important context.\n\nTL;DR hooked up with a girl, didn’t go super well, she ghosted mid conversation afterward and then reached out a few months later, and after talking for a short bit I didn’t reply",

      "description": "Currently my fiancé is in graduate school and does not work. We are living with my parents since I do not make enough to support both of us living on our own. One of the main reasons for us to be living with my parents is that I can continue to save money so we can move out in about 6 months once I have enough saved and she has a job. Right now I pay for everything, pilates, food, dates, birthdays, etc. and give my fiancé about $400 per month in walking around money. Her parents also give her some money as well, but I do not know how much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe currently spends $180 once every 2.5-3 weeks to get fake eyelashes. Normally, this wouldn't bother me, but this is a time when are we trying to save money and this charge seems so unnecessary. I don't mind her getting them before pictures or the wedding events, but it seems kind of pointless when she spends most of her time at her internship or home. Also, to note, I don't spend money on anything, but stuff I actually need at the moment just a gym membership that is about $75 cheaper than her pilates class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked her if she could cut back on getting them and she basically got angry with me and told me she could spend the $500 I gave her every month on whatever she wants. I said okay, I totally understand the need for pampering yourself, but she made me feel like an asshole for bringing it up - so am I? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, side note is that she told me that I have to pay for my wedding ring (only $200) it bothers me little bit that she couldn't just skip the eyelashes once and buy my ring for me as a gesture. Overthinking or AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I don't think I've done this, but the offended party thinks that's the case. All names changed.\n\nI hosted a game night with my husband, inviting four of our friends. It was semi regular, every other week or once a month at the same time due to some of the participants work schedules being tough to work around except for this one night every other week. Larry is my husband's best friend from childhood and earned the first invite. He brought along his girlfriend, Jessie, who has since become a good friend of mine, and also invited his co-worker, Rob. Our friend Ella also attended.\n\nWe had lots of fun! It kept up for a good year and a half of camaraderie. It's become one of the few things I enjoy during my week (I'm a newish mother of a 1 year old and struggle making new friends). I genuinely credit this game night with friends with part of my healing with my mental illness.\n\nThen, Larry and Jessie broke up. It was nasty, with lots of hurt emotions, shouting, and the like. It had lasted almost three years by the time it was done. (For the record, they're better off broken up; things had gotten so toxic for both of them.)\n\nLarry took things especially hard. He was clearly worried he was going to end up socially isolated, and myself, my husband, and Rob did our best to assure him he was our friend no matter what.\n\nBut then game night came around. I wanted to be fair, so I invited Rob and Ella and sent a separate message to Larry and Jessie, explaining they were both invited but if they wanted to come they had to commit to being civil with the other party. If they weren't comfortable doing that, we would hang out some other time.\n\nJessie said \"Yeah, I'm okay with seeing him, I can be polite.\" Larry said, \"I don't want to see her,\" and I replied, \"okay, I'll make sure we grab lunch sometime this week to make up for it.\"\n\nLarry believed he should have been given some kind of preference because he's been my husband and my friend longer than Jessie. He complained about feeling abandoned. And even when Rob decided he would go over to hangout with Larry one on one after game night, Larry bitterly remarked that it was a 'pity visit'.\n\nJessie is disabled on multiple fronts and has very limited opportunities for socialization, plus I had genuinely become close friends with her - she's my daughters godmother. I couldn't just invited Larry and not her; it wasn't fair.\n\nBut part of me wonders if I wasn't fair to Larry by basically hanging out with his ex while he sat at home alone, even if he was the one who decided he didn't want to see Jessie.\n\nIt's been about four months since this went down, and not knowing if I did the right thing has eaten me up inside. I've stopped hosting game nights entirely because I feel so conflicted. Help me out so I can finally move past this and maybe get back to having fun with my friends...",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I are both seniors and have been together for almost 2 years. We both got rejected from a state school because we barely made the top 6% requirement for auto admission and beyond that its really hard to get into. They let you appeal but there is a slim chance it'll get turned around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI appealed in time because it was quick to write and my boyfriend wanted to submit one too. He's not that great of a writer or I was unsure if he could write it well/professionally I said I would help him. Side note: we had two months to appeal before the deadline. However, I'm a super busy person or forget things often. In those months, I was also trying to write scholarship essays, get into programs, etc. He reminded a few times before but it was way before the deadline so I thought I had time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo weeks before the appeal roll around and I remember it but was still really overwhelmed with everything to worry about to graduate. I thought I would just do it when he would remind me, however he never did and so we never did it. **Two weeks after** the deadline he remembered about the appeal after his friends bugged him about whether or not he is attending it and asked me if I ever did it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was top 6.5% but the school only accepted 6.1% and so he thought if he appealed he would have a  good chance. He accepted that it's also partly his fault because he didn't remind me or remember himself but I can tell he's mad because I said I would help but I didn't. I see his point but although I'm trying to resolve it, I feel like he's always going to resent me. I just felt like if it was so important he would have remembered too. I honestly don't know how to fix it or talk to him so that he doesn't resent me so if you have advice on that that would be nice too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both got into another good state school, not the best, but I can tell when his friend's nudge him about the school he was going to appeal to he feels bad. He always expected to go there and his friends always talking about going there hurts cause it makes him seem lesser. He is so smart and I love him so much but I am scared it'll drive a wedge and resentment in our relationship and it'll go downhill from there. He's not super expressive and keeps it all inside so I never know if he's truthful and even if he admits he is resentful how am I supposed to fix it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for forgetting?",

      "description": "I’m a college student currently home on break. The other day I hung out with a friend of mine who I haven’t seen in a while. We smoked some weed together and we didn’t want to go back to either of our houses, so we went to a local diner. \n\nIt was around 4pm and they were not very busy, however the whole time we were there there were at least 2 other tables with customers. I ordered disco fries and my friend ordered an omelette, not a ton of food but it’s not like we split a small side of fries between the two of us and just took up space. \n\nThe part where I’m worried we were assholes is that we finished our food pretty quickly but hung around for a while just talking and drinking water after we were done eating. In my understanding, diners are the place to do this, I feel like that’s part of diner culture, but our waitress seemed kind of pissed at us. She dropped off the check without us having asked for it, which isn’t that weird, but just in general she seemed in kind of a hurry to get us out the door. I’m worried we were maybe being assholes by taking up a table in her section and not allowing her to serve more people/make more in tips? That’s the explanation I thought up in my head, but maybe the internet has more insight. \n\nSo, was I just paranoid because I was high? or AITA for sitting at a diner booth for an extra half hour?

( he says i grabbed a mug he said stop then i grabbed the two plates.) this caused a pretty significant fight between us in which i said well if you can just keep the forks in your room then i should be able to keep some in mine and grabbed the five remaining forks to bring to my room. he said thats ridiculous after a couple seconds i returned the silverware to the drawer and he said if he was \"digging through his room i would lose my mind\" i stupidly replied i wouldn't if i brought you in there and pointed to the dishes and only said stopped once you picked them up, and you are loosing your mind. he replied if anything i am loosing my mind yelling and slamming drawers open ( when he said that he slammed the fork drawer open to reenact that). well when he did that i moved my hand to shut it and i put to much weight on it and bent the drawer down. he lost his shit at me for it and at this point i was just exhausted and i said look can we just go do something else for a couple minutes alone and he said no i just want you to go away. i said i cant just go away i have to fix this i would meet in the middle and both leave if that works and he said no you can just fix it later. i ended up laying down in the cupboard to fix it for a while and when i looked out he was just staring at me fixing it. i asked if he can leave its awkward fixing this while he is there and he said no i'm waiting for my pizza. i replied ok and just focused on fixing it. once i fixed it he was still staring and i was still upset so i said this needs to stop its been like 9 days of constantly fighting when you get home on the smallest things i do you call me a dick. and he said well look at it on my side every night i come home and your a dick.

The mom pushes the kid from behind two or three times. I watch.\n\nThey get to their car. Kid waits for mom to open the door... Mom hits her a couple times, kid cowers, mom opens the car door and hits kid with it, grabs something from inside the car, slams the door and raises her hand to hit the kid again. I watch.\n\nKid scurries behind the car, mom follows and this time has both hands balled up and is seriously hitting the kid. I open my car door and just stand there, 20 feet away and yell for her to quit.\n\nThe mom seemed shocked that anyone saw her and moreso that someone was saying anything back to her. She quit hitting the kid, they walked back toward the store but she did have additional words for me. What I was able to make out was \"its my kid, i can do what i want\".\n\nThe only reason I'm asking AITA is because i do believe parents have the right to discipline thier kids... But the number of hits and then it turning into closed fists, i wasnt just going to watch any more.\n\nThe \"best\" part was that the car had a bumper sticker for a catholic pro life \"are you pregnant? Dont abort, try adoption\" hotline... Cause she can beat her kids in public if she wants but will tell you what you should do with a baby on the way.\n",

      "title": "AITA for telling my Aspie friend that his word shouldn't be taken at face value?",
      "description": "I have a friend from high school who has never dated. He once told me that he was diagnosed with Asperger's, and remembering him from school, I can believe it. He was the shy, awkward kid who kept to himself at lunch. He insists that his case is mild (if he \"even has it\"), that he's usually not much worse at social interaction than other people, but I personally think that he lacks the self-awareness to be an effective gauge of that. I mean, he *must*, otherwise he wouldn't be a diagnosed Aspie.\n\nSo anyways, the other day he confided in me via Facebook about a situation between himself and a close female friend of his who he likes. He told me that he's liked her for years, and that he thought she was flirting with him via texting - but as it turns out, she had a boyfriend, and didn't tell him for a year and a half. I told him that he probably misinterpreted her social cues on account of his Asperger's, and that she probably didn't say or do anything that would cause an ordinary person to believe that she was flirting with them. He then offered to show me copies of text messages between them, listed out other things that gave him the idea that she liked him, and asked me if I thought it sounded flirty. I told him that I can't say one way or the other because I don't have enough context to go by - and again, this ties into his Asperger's because most normal people are able to instinctively figure out whether something *sounds* flirty vs. actually *being* flirty. He got all defensive, asking me if this means that he shouldn't trust his own judgement (which he obviously shouldn't - it's a fact of his biology), and told me that a few other people he showed it to thought it sounded flirtatious - blah blah blah. I told him that he asked for my honest opinion, I gave it to him, and it is very entitled and disrespectful of him to argue my point when he was the one who wanted to hear it in the first place. He insisted that he wasn't trying to argue with me, but I said, \"Then why is it such an issue? If you don't want people's honest opinions, don't ask for them. I'm not interested in having an argument with you over something so stupid. Let it go, please.\" His response was a sarcastic-sounding \"Well, thanks anyway.\"\n\nAsperger's means that you're​ not capable of reading other people like ordinary human beings. A woman compliments you or is extra friendly for some reason, you think she's​ attracted to you. That's what Asperger's ***is***. Does he have a right to argue with me when I took the time to answer his fucking question in the first place?\n\nI bring this up because he told another friend about our so-called \"disagreement\". I know this because she shared a FB meme about mental health labels not defining people, and he was the only one who liked it. Clearly, he's only interested in getting people to tell him what he wants to hear. I really don't think I'm an asshole for not being his sycophant.",

      "description": "I like to wear a sports bra top when I do a running workout outside (weather permitting). My husband would prefer I didn’t, and wore a shirt over. AITA?\n\nTo support his opinion: To be fair, I am from the US originally, but we have emigrated elsewhere. There is not so much a workout/fitness culture here, and in all honesty, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone working out in just a sports bra...maybe once or twice in 10 plus years? The usual attire is a more covering top, and even shorts without leggings is relatively rare. It’s not for religious reasons or anything, just the local style is kinda more modest on top in general.\n\nThat’s fine too of course, but I’ve always worn a sports bra and shorts unless it’s too cold and I’m outside, and it was much more common to see in my old country. In my defense, I get hot really quickly, and I feel like I do my best workouts and get my best times when I’m cool (I’m the weird person wearing shorts running when it’s freezing out). I feel way more energized and more comfortable with less clothes rubbing against me. \n\nI don’t run like in the middle of a busy city or anything. I run/workout on a sort of more rural area with a trail, where it’s mostly runners and walkers anyway. \n\nPlus, again being honest here, I’m proud of my body, and I kinda like showing off some skin. I gave birth to our five kids - the fact that I have abs is something I feel very lucky about. Exercising and staying in good shape has been pretty key to keeping my own sense of self instead of getting lost in parenting.\n\nMy husband’s discomfort stems from my choice of clothing sticking out and being unusual and being more revealing than usual sportswear. I don’t believe he’s trying to be controlling...? He’s made similar remarks when I’ve gone outside in camisole type tops I wear as pjs/house clothes in the past, which again is incredibly unusual and never seen where we live.  I’ve actually stopped wearing those out because even I have come to feel kind of uncomfortable. But I persist in my sports bras, because I have a lot of cute and expensive ones I love, and again for all the reasons I listed above.\n\nOn all other accounts, my husband is a great guy, I think I’m a pretty good gal, and we respect each other and communicate and compromise well. But I feel stubborn and don’t really want to compromise on this one. \n\nIf my husband asks if I’d put on a shirt when I’m heading out to run, AITA for saying no thanks and going out in a sports bra instead anyway?

      "description": "First, sorry for the mobile formatting :(\nContext: I've lived at my place for over three years now, and just a few months ago a new family moved in next door, wife and husband with two kids. They're quiet and nice so we lived by each other pretty nicely. \n\nJust last week they got a new dog, and it would seem that they'd get a \"typical\" dog, for lack of a better word, but it was completely atypical than you'd think. They had gotten a sort of young pitbull/German Shepard mix. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but the dog seemed pretty beefy. I don't understand exactly why they'd need a guard dog, as we live in a safer area of town.\n\nThis brought me some worrying, as I have a smaller Chihuahua/mini pinscher mix that theirs could easily tear apart. They seemed to be attentive to it and understanding about the situation, so my nerves were calmed. However, yesterday while I was letting my dog outside, they began to bark at each other. I didn't have much time to think, because Beef Boy instantly jumped the wall and went after my dog. I was yelling and pulling him off while my dog, until mine ran into the house. I rushed back in as soon as I let go so that Beef Boy wouldn't chase into my home, and then I shut the door behind me. All while this happens, the neighbor jumps the wall and comes after his dog as well and takes him back over. I was  certain to myself that I wouldn't be so gentle with their dog the next time, because it was so close to killing my own that it scared the shit out of me. \n\nBut to think it would happen again, THE NEXT DAY, was unthinkable. The owners had done nothing about it, as if it was some normal occasion. I was still attentive of my dog, but this time Beef Boy didn't need barking, and leaped over my wall and got on mine again. As I ran closer, I could see that it has its mouth around my dogs neck. So I kicked it. It wouldn't budge, so I kicked it again. Harder. He finally let go and my dog got inside, and I did the same routine as before. The neighbor watched it all go down in the exact same way as before, and told me sorry. Not that he was going to help, put it on a leash, or teach him. Only that he was sorry. I walked back out and let him know that if the dog tried to hurt mine again, I'd be sure to either call animal control or kill it. And that if he trespassed on my lawn again I would be sure to do something about that as well. I made sure he understood that I made that clear.\n\nAfter it's been said and done, I feel I might have overreacted on something. Am I the asshole for threatening his dog for attempted murder, and him for his apathy?\nSorry if this seems hard to read, it just happened an hour ago and I'm still shaken up by it a bit.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for getting angry at my sister for asking whether I'm still bi because I'm dating a guy?",
      "description": "Title says it all and is basically a TL;DR, but to give a little context, I came out in 2014 as bisexual after my parents saw Facebook messages I had sent to my former youth minister about me coming out. I originally was hesitant to say anything about it but once the secret was out I thought I had nothing to lose. Plus if I came out, I thought that would stop people from constantly asking me \"Are you gay?\" and whatnot, as growing up I was CONSTANTLY asked that question by peers, some of their parents, and others (it gets old really fast).\n\nApparently, this didn't sink in with my immediate family, as when I got a girlfriend later that year my dad asked if I now (at that time) were straight again now that I'm dating a girl. Obviously as someone that identified as bisexual I explained to him that's not how it works and hoped that would be the end of the discussion. 5 years after coming out and my sister, while the most LGBTQ-friendly of the fam, will still ask me these questions, despite telling her I don't date based on gender and that while I mainly date guys I've been attracted to girls before and it's more who swipes right on me on Tinder (I have it to match with both men and women but 95% of my matches are guys).\n\nThe most recent incident has got me asking if I'm making this a bigger deal than it should be or whether I'm reacting normally. Earlier this month, I matched with a guy and we've gone on 2 dates so far in addition to texting each other quite a bit. I really like this guy and if things work out I wanna see if I can turn it into something more. So I proceed to tell my sister that I'm seeing this guy and that I really like him, in addition to some surface-level info (school, personality, etc) so she gets an idea of what he's like. Her first question?\n\n\"Wait, so do you only like guys now, I'm confused? And like who's the \"man\" in the relationship?\"\n\nI proceed to get really angry and tell her off for asking that, as it feels like she's invalidating my bisexuality by asking if I only like guys in addition to asking who's the \"man\" as if one of us has to fill that role when in fact I just care if we compliment each other and if he's nice to me. What mainly angered me, however, is this isn't the first time she's asked these questions and I'm really tired of having to explain myself and have that be the first questions about him asked. All my friends that I've told have generally asked what he's like and what he does for a living, but apart from that I've had no one ask me whether I'm still bisexual or not barring my family. It frustrates me that whenever I have an update in my love life the first questions I get asked have nothing to do with how he makes me feel but instead are regarding the current status of my sexuality and whether I'm now gay.",

I was stupid to go back to her but I did anyways. Cut to a few months back, we meet up and hang out. We ended up kissing, our first kiss, or so I thought. Later that day she said she just wants to be friends so I was like ok whatever. I was willing to put in the effort to be a friend. But I threw that out the window entirely when I found out she lied to me for the last time. Apparently she lied to me about being her first kiss. Apparently she had kissed a bunch of others before me. Now that doesn’t make me mad itself, I could care less if she kissed dudes before me, but what Infuriated me was the fact that she lied about it, at least 10 times (not an exaggeration by any means I swear) i decided that she had lied to me for the last time. I finally confronted her, on what happened to be her birthday (I forgot it was her birthday) and I said you lied to me so many times. I told her I wasn’t going to be an asshole on her birthday and rag on her, but I did just flat out say good luck with your life and goodbye. \n\nTL:DR Girl lied to me too many times and I refused to be friends with her\n",

      "description": "Okay long story but I’ll keep it short. \n\nBack when Toys R Us went bankrupt my husband and I went to go look and see what stuff was on sale. We bought a few things but more specifically bought a pretty expensive stroller that was like 75% off even though we had no kids at the moment. We had been talking and making plans to hopefully get pregnant in the next year or two and we both conceded that buying the stroller was a good option. \n\nFast forward a few months and I found out I was pregnant. I was super excited and happy but he immediately acted a little off. We talked and he said he wasn’t excited about the timing but happy to have a baby. We told our friends and family and shortly after I had a miscarriage. \n\nIt’s been approximately 7 months since the miscarriage. We still have the stroller and it’s sitting in the closet. Yesterday would have been my due date. We were at a party and some guy who knocked up his gf, who we know but aren’t friends with, was at the party. All of a sudden my husband yells across the room in front of 15-20 people “HEY CAN WE GIVE THEM THE STROLLER? WE HAVE NO USE FOR IT SO WE MIGHT AS WELL” I didn’t want to be seen as a major bitch so I simply said yes. \n\nWell today we got into a huge fight about it. Not only did he put me in the spot by not consulting with me but I feel like he’s completely disregarding everything we had talked about previously. It’s like he’s completely oblivious to the fact that one, I kept the stroller because I’m hoping to put a baby in it soon, and two he doesn’t care about how I feel during this time. \n\nI blew up and told him I felt like he didn’t care, he stayed silent the whole car ride, walked inside the door and immediately headed for his PC and didn’t event apologize. Am I being an asshole and over reacting here or is he being a fucking douche? ",

      "description": "Throwaway since a couple of people know my main account and this is a sensitive issue and I don't want to violate my friend's privacy.  \n\nSo Lily (not her real name) and I have known each other since high school, but have only started getting close as of last year, since we're the only two people from my hometown who go to my current college and it was nice and comforting to hang out with a familiar face. We aren't exactly best friends, but we are pretty close and I'm her usual go-to for venting. At the start of the previous summer, Lily confided in me that she was bulimic and that she has been struggling with the disorder for sometime now, she even shared with me her side Instagram and Tumblr accounts that were filled with things such a thinspo and texts detailing her feelings, thoughts and struggles with the disorders. I, in turn, revealed to her that all throughout high school I was diagnosed with and struggled with Anorexia Nervosa, but was able to beat the worst of it and am on the path of recovery. I didn't do it as a \"woe is me\" or \"I have it worse\", I just thought that maybe her knowing I used to be in a similar spot (albeit not the exact situation) would be comforting and that she would know my advice comes from a place of experience. Her response was that she was actually jealous of how thin I was in high school, and that she didn't need professional help because she was doing fine. I figured that she was still in the denial stage and that me trying to force her to do anything would not work, just as it didn't work with me. \n\nFrom then on, she would send me detailed posts about the episodes she went through and it made me uncomfortable, but since I was the only person she could talk to about this I put my discomfort aside and tried to be there for her as best as I could. But then it got worse. Her posts became more and more detailed, and some of them became very triggering to me: mentioning purging, how great fasting multiple days was.. basically all things I used to do and am still trying to recover from. I've asked her to stop, since this was leading to my mental health degrading and the urge to do those things returning. She stopped for a while, but then started doing it again and this time sending me pictures of extremely unhealthy skinny people with their bones poking out or tagging me in posts talking positively about EDs. I've confronted her about it for a second time, thinking that maybe this was some way of coping for her, and described how badly her actions made me feel in detail. And then she did that stuff again, going as far as to send me my own junior yearbook photo, one taken during probably the lowest point of my life where i weighed 80lbs (40kg) and had sunken cheeks and looked dead, telling me that that was her ideal weight and her body goal. \n\nSo I sent her an angry message, blocked her on all social media platforms and refused to talk to her whenever she tried to approach me on campus. Our mutual friends were confused about this, so I just spun a tale about how we had a big argument since I didn't want to violate her privacy by mentioning the real reason since I'm the only one who knows about her ED. In the last few weeks she has distanced herself from all of our mutual friends and I'm getting very worried. A friend also told me that she didn't show up to two exams. \n\nI am now regretting my decision because I just realized I'm her only safety net and support group when it comes to this, and I remember what having no one felt like when I was in her position and it was horrible. I want to talk to her again because I think I've overreacted but a part of me thinks that I did the right thing. \n\nShould I reach out to her again or am I in the right ? AITA for cutting her off all of sudden and not trying to be more patient with her ? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So, I have been working my ass off since January with my post-graduate degree. Usually I'm working from 7am to late night with no weekends or holidays as we always have a project that needs to be done or a test/exam.  This week is the final week of the term and I'm also writing a test on the last day. We have a week off after this.  The problem is that  I dont get to see my gf much as she live a bit far and attends a different university. I only see her on weekends and because I've been so busy I only have been able to see her maybe 1 or 2 days of the week, the last couple of weeks.  However, she has gone out without me a few times with her friends because I'm literally too busy.  I'm always happy if she goes out because I know she struggles with friends and dont want her not going just because I have work.    \nShe messaged me that she does not want to go out on the last day because she has doesn't feel like going out and if she comes she going to stay back when we go out in town.  Which is fine, a bit bleak because I've been really keen to go out due to being trapped in my room working.  I asked her if it would be fine if I go out with my friends for a couple of hours and come back later that night.  She said it's fine but will be sad if I leave her there.   Because she knows I want to go out she says she maybe won't even come because she's going to be a wet blanket. So now I feel like an asshole for going out with me friends and not having my gf with and if she comes she is staying at my place sad till I come back.   \n\n\nAlso: she says I always chill to much with my friends when we go out and that we do not chill enough together.  Which is partly true I feel, but it's not my intention to neglect her.  I switch conversation often between people and just enjoy not being stuck in my room and socializing.",

      "description": "This is a throwaway account because I don‘t want it on my main.   \nMy fiance and I got into a fight last night about a Christmas gift he got from my grandparents. They spent about $100 American dollars on a nice, fancy shirt for him. To clear things up a bit, we‘re in a European country, the price of things here are a bit different. You don‘t really get a shirt under about $30. $100 is not as much money as in America but still a decent value of money and a nice gift.   \n I asked him last night if he‘d tried it on or what he did with the shirt (I don‘t remember my exact question.) He said he hadn't tried it on and then he implied he didn't like the pattern so I asked him why he hadn't exchanged it then for something he would like and would fit him. Then we got into the argument.   \n \n\nHis view is that this was a gift that is his now and it shouldn't matter what he does with it. He could rip it up in shreds, burn it, throw it in the trash if he pleases or his plan, keep it in the closet and give it away later on. He thinks I was making a way too much big of a deal about „just a shirt.“ and not accepting his point of view (which is true, I am not because I think he‘s being a jerk.)   \n \n\nWhile I understand that this is his now, I think this attitude is really disrespectful in any case towards the giver. If I give a gift to someone that doesn't suit their preference (color or style) or wouldn't fit them I would want them to go back to the store and get something they actually like and will be using. In the stores here they put an exchange ticket on everything before Christmas so people can return and exchange their presents if they wish to do so.  \n What bothers me the most though and what I would say the whole reason for me making a deal out of this is that this gift came from close relatives and the fact that my grandparents do not have much money. A lot of their savings has gone into medical bills and my grandpa‘s new teeth but they still want to give „valuable gifts.“ It‘s okay he didn't like THIS exact shirt but I feel like he‘s not being grateful for their gesture and kinda of just throwing their money away by not even trying to actually get one he will like and use so their money wasn't wasted.   \n\n\nIs this as simple as „this is his gift now and he can do what he wants with it“ and I am being an asshole for making a deal out of this?

      "description": "So, for a bit of background, I’m female [37] &amp; I’m a senior RN. There’s a student nurse on my ward at the moment, I’ll call her Jen*. \nShe’s, I think, [32] divorced with 2 young kids. \nI only met her last Thursday when we were on the same shift, &amp; all through the morning, she was going on about her bf, Steve [35].\n\n\nShe was blatantly showing off, telling us about the things Steve had bought her, (and telling us how much said things cost: cringe) &amp; how he was taking her on a trip to Australia...Then how much he just loves her, &amp; wants to get married &amp; have a kid. All this after six months? Woah. I was starting to feel a bit claustro, to be honest (but that’s my personal opinion of course). \n\n\nShe also said how he sent her *Interflora* flowers, (yes, she specified) everyday for 2 weeks, until she agreed to go out with him. \nThis seemed romantic when she first said it, but dig a little deeper, &amp; I realised, they met online, on POF actually, so...what? He tracked down her physical full name &amp; address to send her flowers. He works in IT somewhere too. \nRed flag. \n\n\nAnyway, to say I’d only just met her that day, she was telling us hella personal things, like how big his dick was, for example, along with showing us pics of what we (too late!) discovered to our horror, were *not* of his face! We were trying to do our jobs, but she was hovering, &amp; in our faces. \n\n\nI should add, that at this stage, we were in the treatment room (so nowhere near patients or relatives). \nIn there, was Jen, Claudia (another RN) &amp; I at the time, &amp; I mistakenly thought Claudia knew Jen, &amp; that’s why she was being so open, but I later found out she’d only met her once herself. \n\n\nAnyway, the day goes on &amp; so does she, so I finally said to her, show me a pic of this Steve guy I’ve heard so much about (his *face* this time!). \nSo she did, &amp; I immediately recognised him bc I had been talking to him at one stage, on POF...but it was ages ago (before they were together) &amp; I remember he was a bit intense, so I stopped talking to him. \n\nIn fact though, intense is an understatement, he was full on right away, &amp; we’d not even met in person. I found him creepy &amp; needy, &amp; I’ve not got time for that shit. So that was the end of that. \n\n\nAnyway, as she’s showing me, she looked at me all smugly for my reaction, &amp; my face must have changed (or recoiled in horror, can’t be sure), but whichever, she noticed, &amp; asks me ‘what?’ \n\n\nI felt I had to say something at this point bc she could see I knew him, or of him, somehow from my reaction, &amp; I didn’t want her mind to runaway with her, wondering if anything had happened between us. So, put on the spot, I just said that I recognised him from POF, but that I hadn’t spoke to him in months, bc he was ‘a bit much’ (my exact words). I might have also said the word ‘intense’, but I’m not certain. \n\n\nI explained it was months ago, &amp; that we never even met in person, but she was weird with me for the rest of the day, &amp; avoided me. \n\n\nDidn’t think much of it, but then I’ve come in to work this morning, &amp; she’s apparently made a *massive* deal about it on Friday, the day after, when I wasn’t on shift. \n\n\nShe told 3 of the other nurses, including Claudia, that I said Steve was ‘really into me’ when we were chatting (which I didn’t), &amp; even if he *had* been ‘really into me’, I wouldn’t say that to his *fucking gf*, would I?! \nI mean I suppose some people might, but I’m not that kind of person; and not even necessarily to spare her feelings, although that is an element, but I just *couldn’t* do it; it would make me literally cringe to say words like that, even if it were true. Nobody likes a bragger. \n\n\nNow, say if he *had* been chatting to me when he was with her, then I definitely would have said something, (not that, but something) bc I wouldn’t want her to look like a mug; but he wasn’t, &amp; so I didn’t. \n\n\nI was told she was found literally crying on the staff toilet floor, saying it could be the end of them. Seems like she’s gone home &amp; for some reason brought it up with him (just why??) &amp; it’s caused a huge row. \n\n\nThe only exception to her even mentioning it is, if she made a joke about it, he laughed, &amp; it was never spoke of again. Now, I’m not sure what *did* happen but I know for sure, that this did *not* happen. \n\n\nAll I know is, it was Friday when she had her meltdown, &amp; the argument between them (still not sure why it had to turn into *any* argument) apparently went on over the weekend a bit, but I didn’t see her again from last Thursday, until this Monday. \n\n\nI mean, did she expect him to have never spoken to another girl in his life?? Surely *that* would have been more odd? \n\n\nShe even asked Claudia if she should speak to Mary (my **BOSS**!!) about it!! Like what the actual fuck? \n\n\nAs if Mary’s gonna care about our personal lives, when we’re adults, &amp; it has absolutely nothing to do with work, not to mention it happened well before she’d even met him.\n\n\nClaudia said to her, she should just speak to me about it if I’d upset her, as she didn’t think I’d deliberately do that to her, but she hasn’t. \n\nShe spoke to me on Monday as if nothing had happened (and at that point I hadn’t found out, &amp; she never told me). In fact she made a point of speaking to me &amp; being extra nice, in hindsight she was probably concerned I’d heard about her freak out, &amp; would want to save face maybe? \n\nShe hasn’t been on shift today, so I haven’t seen her since I found out. So, I’m not sure how that’ll go. \nAll my friends tell me *she’s* the asshole, but they gotta say that, they’re my a-hole friends! \n\nSo, come on Reddit, honestly, am I in the wrong here? Am I the asshole? \n\n*all names changed",

      "description": "A few days ago, my 10th grade English teacher (who we'll call Mrs N) gave us an extremely hard test that we as a class were unprepared for. Needless to say, the class did extremely poorly, with the average score being a 55%. The following day she proceeded to berate and blame my class for having done so poorly on the test, even though we had only spent about a week and a half on the material, and (at least I believe) that when a class does so poorly on a given test, it is the teacher's fault for making the test too hard. \n\nOver the weekend, I, while still being mad at her, decided to send her an angry email. I will put a copy of the email as the first comment, but essentially, it was very passive aggressive, blaming her for everything and insisting that not count the test as part of our grade. I sent this email from a throwaway email address not associated with my name, and signed it as being from the students of all of her gifted program classes. A thing to note however is that while I was the only one who wrote the email, the sentiments were shared by almost all the students.\n\nToday in class, Mrs N confronted all of her classes by acting extremely disappointed. She threatened to punish the all of her students for this. Furthermore all of my fellow classmates, along with Mrs N, are mad at the person who did this, but I believe that my classmates are simply mad because they might get in trouble, but they agree with what I said.\n\nSo AITA? and AITA to my classmates or my teacher or both?

Now she's saying stuff like \"it's good that you're spending the new years with people who make you happy,\" because I didn't cancel on my friends.

      "description": "My brother is 14, I’m 28.  We’re half Brothers (share a Mum) and my Mum and brother’s father are separated.\n\nSo my Brother has Autistic Spectrum Disorder, he’s probably middle teetering onto high on the scale.  He has learning difficulties but isn’t like, non-verbal.  It’s moreso than aspergers.\n\nHe also has ADHD, and his behaviour is absolutely atrocious.  We actually think his diagnosis should be Opposition Defiant Disorder but apparently not enough is known to diagnose that here.\n\nHe doesn’t do anything he’s told, he breaks things without care, runs away, has barely done a full days school in his life, my Mum is pretty much his sole carer because his Dad is a dick.\n\nMy brother treats my Mum like garbage, she has no social life, no friends, she doesn’t get a break.  He doesn’t see it and it’s infuriating.  She has arthritis and fibromyalgia too, and is such a caring person, she was a midwife for 30 years until she had to take early retirement.  He doesn’t care though, he grabs her and hits her, never does anything to make anything easier on her.\n\nHe was fine with me until like two years ago when he found out I was gay.  Now he hates me.  He thinks he can catch gay, won’t touch me, doesn’t like me being at my Mums house, can’t go there with my partner and see my Mum.\n\nJust today, it’s Mother’s Day and we had planned a day out with my sister and Mum and Brother, and he decided he had a problem with the gay thing again despite being over it and refused to go.\n\nHe also has told me about weird fantasies he’s had and I honestly think he’s a psychopath.  He used to watch Snakes eating baby rabbits on YouTube and loved the sound of their squeals when they were dying.  I really do fear that he’s going to end up killing my Mum in her sleep or something.\n\nI honestly just feel he’s a drain on my mother and a drain on society.  He’ll never be capable of work, mainly because he’s too damn lazy, never be able to live fully independently, refuses to try and learn or try new things.\n\nI hate to see my Mum just get dragged down and down, and I can’t do anything about it because it’s not like I can look after him so my Mum can have respite.  She’s just stuck.\n\nI seriously wish he had never been born.  AITA?",

      "description": "Sorry in advance for typos, I'm properly fuming.\n\nSo she went out last night for her brothers birthday with him and all his mates. She's really close with a lot of them as she grew up with them, they treat her like a little sister. It's really awesome. One of these guys friends came out too last night, someone she's only met a few times. We'll call him Dave.\n\nSo Dave has a girlfriend of 4 years, a pretty nice guy so I hear (not that I've ever met him) ((and not that I think that now)) At about 1AM last night, he was reeeeeeally drunk and they were all in the club. For the next 2 hours he preceeded to grab her ass 15+ times despite her telling him not to, he was begging her to come back to his for the night relentlessly and right near the end of the night, she was at the bar and he came up behind her and pinned her against the bar and pushed his erect penis against her bum. She managed to push him away but she's still quite shook up by it all. (she was raped 4yrs ago, still dealing with the after affects)\n\nSo I go to pick her up, she gets in the car and she's clearly off. About 2 minutes up the road she told me about the bum squeezing and propositions and I turned the car round. I was going to drag this guy to the car and make him apologise for being such a total peice of sh*t. I was told not to so I didn't. When we got home she then told be about him pinning her against the bar. I've somehow stopped myself going back to the club, I don't know how. I haven't been that angry in a looooong time.\n\nSo here's the kicker, she doesn't want anyone to know. I've found out his and his girlfriends names and I want to send a couple of messages off. Truthfully, I want to go and put this guy in the hospital but I'm not going against her wishes to that extent.\n\nAdvice would be great here, if anyone knows a way to process these emotions I'd be very glad to hear it.\n\n\nAm I the asshole?

      "title": "AITA for snapping at my boyfriend for constantly interrupting me?",
      "description": "Hi guys, long time lurker, first time poster. Don't care to use a throwaway account because I don't really care if he sees this. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for over a year now (after pretty much love at first sight), and just moved across the country/into an apartment together. Usually we have a very happy, loving relationship and we can both safely say that we believe we're each other's soulmates. He has improved not only my happiness and life, but who I am as a person and helped me discard a lot of negativity I had weighing me down. I want to marry this man one day, and I know he feels the same, so breaking up isn't an option here. \n\nThe issue that has come up multiple times throughout our relationship is his constant need to interrupt me. Now, I myself realized a few months ago that I have a tendency to over-talk and interrupt people at times myself, and I have been working on paying more attention to what people are saying to me instead of just waiting for my turn to speak. I have tried many times to talk to him about how him interrupting me makes me feel like he doesn't care about what I'm saying, and most of the times whatever question or statement he's rudely splicing my train of thought with is one that would've been answered if he just listened until I finished. \n\nWe're currently working on a writing project together (I have been writing since I was very young, and this is not my first rodeo worldbuilding but it is his) and while workshopping, I came up with an idea. Immediately, I begin to pitch it as I come up with it, and he just interrupts me in a pretty rude voice after I get like 7 words in to go, \"Yeah, but what does it have to do with (Project Name)?\" And I snapped at him that maybe I would get to it if he didn't interrupt my train of thought in the middle of me musing, and told him very firmly to stop (bleeping) interrupting me all the time. Mind you, I did not yell, just used that irritated girlfriend voice. You know the one. His response was to go, \"Fine, I just won't work with you then!\" And to walk out of the room. \n\nI once again tried to express how he was hindering my creative process by interrupting me, and that it's become a (sorry I hate this word but idk what else to use) trigger of mine over the course of our relationship so my reaction might've been a bit heated. He interrupted me before I finished this to say that I always had to act like a child whenever anyone asked me a question, I tried to say I'm not annoyed about the question rather the timing, and he continued calling me a child. He also told me to \"deal with it\" when I mentioned the creative process thing again, which felt more childish than what he was accusing me of. He then left the apartment and now I am writing this.\n\nSo, I'm at a bit of a loss. Am I the asshole here? I have attention issues, and my brain always has about layers of thoughts overlapping at all times, so when I'm in a creative space it's imperative that I be allowed to reach the end of my idea-making process or else there's a large chance I will literally forget the path that I was on halfway through. As a writer, that is a scary prospect, because what if that is the one idea that would give your universe the kick it deserves? It also feels shitty to be constantly interrupted because it genuinely makes me feel like the person doing it does not care about what I have to say, and I have to say me being interrupted so often is what made me realize I had to kick the habit a few months ago. So, I guess I came here because I love this sub and I'm genuinely curious: am I the asshole? If I am, how can I better how I handle this regular occurrence that is (quite literally) driving me a bit crazy?\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend interrupts me all the time, I've brought it to his attention before and his behavior hasn't changed. Am I the asshole for snapping a little at him for interrupting me while I was brainstorming for a project we are working on?",

      "description": "My father tells me he loves me and I don't doubt that he would protect me from physical harm.\n\nHOWEVER,\nMy father is  against anything \"out of the norm\". Which has caused me to hide many things about myself from my parents (sexuality,gender)  I used to question if I was trans, genderfluid, ect because ive never been overly feminine and honestly it pains me to think of myself as a girly individual. Ive also changed my name because the thought of hearing my old name made me uncomfortable and brought a lot of self-hatred towards myself.\n\n I had started going by my new name with some close friends for 3 years before I even mentioned it to my parents...thought I would start there to see how they would react and see how open I can actually be with them. I understand that after 18 years of calling someone one name and then asking them to to change that, is quite the request. Being my new name helped me feel more confident and most friends were accepting of it. My mom tries, she really does. But my father will go out of his way when people ask ME which I prefer, to interupt before I get the chance to answer and say \"it's (old name)\" \n\nOther things he does I'm not sure if it's to get under my skin or if it's just because he's an asshole. \n-i was dropping off a friend at her house and he goes \"I've never seen such a fat Asian\" first off he didn't even take the time to look at her in a none judgemental way to see that she's infact white af, and she's really not that overweight.\n- I got a text at dinner and he asked out of the blue if it was from one of my trans ftm co-workers. \"Oh is that oliver? How is SHE. doing?... Me and my mom both look at him like wtf \"what ITs name is Olivia right?\" Hes not doing this on accident as I have explained everything to him before... This one in particular really bothered me because how would he act if I opened up to him about my gender stuff?\n-when we go on trips he calls the more heavy set people in the pool \"whales\" \n\nAll this random shit he does gets under my skin and I don't have time for it.  Would I be an asshole if I went no contact just because I don't want to deal with this anymore?",

We were on and off until A few months ago when we decided at the end of my Christmas break we would really break up. \n\nSo from mid-January to mid February we didn't talk at all, and I ended up making plans to go to Mexico with 5 of my friends (including friends from back home) for Spring Break.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago we both ended up going to the same concert, where I ended up sleeping with her afterwards. This lead to her coming up to my college for her birthday to come party and hangout, and we slept with each other again.\n\nWe talk now, and she wants to get back together, but I don't honestly. She's pretty manipulative and dependent on other people and I don't think I'm in the position to make her happy, or myself happy with her. \n\nEverything was okay, until she invited me to go to her hometown (Like 20 hours away from my hometown) with her on her spring break. This is when I broke the news to her that I'm going to mexico with some friends already. She continued to try to get into the Mexico trip, but our AirBNB is full, and frankly my friends would rather just have me come without her. I would honestly rather go without her also because she usually needs a lot of attention and gets jealous when I'm with friends. She thinks I'm the asshole for not inviting her, and feels hurt that she even bothered to ask me to go to her hometown. She claims that \"I don't want her around,\" and that \"I never think of her, or invite her anywhere.\" \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was thinking to myself. Doesn't she has better things to do than being on her phone in an underground car park?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went in my car and contacted the imaging center to ask them when I could go drop the documents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly I hard a bang. The lady banged HER car windows, glaring at me and telling me loudly and rudely that I needed to move.  \n\n\nI came down to ask what was happening and she told me she couldn't get out and that I was parked too close to her. She opened the door to show me and although it was a bit tight she could have easily slipped out of the door.  \n\n\nUpon looking at the car park lines I was well inside at least 15-20cm away from the line. I was going to move my car when she suddenly told me that I was holding her against her will and that if I didn't move she would go to the police and tell them I was doing an act of SELF IMPRISONMENT. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat made me angry and I just went out of the car and said to her that she could go out even though it might be a bit tight and she could also exit from the other door if she really needed to go out. And also there were a lot of empty car spaces. She could have reversed and changed spot ANYTIME. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also took a photo just in case she would go and say that I was parked outside the line...  \nA few rude words later from her. I just waited outside and she was on the phone, either pretending or really wasting the police emergency number that could be used for so much better things \\*eyeroll\\*  \n\n\nAt some point she reversed and left, not before telling me that \"I am going to the cops now!\". I waved her bye and went in the car and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe just waited 15 minutes to tell me that. I think she is the asshole but would like to ask what the general opinion is.\n\nAlso, would my act of not moving my car be seen as self imprisonment as there was millions of ways for her to get out of the car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

      "description": "So, my husband and I have a friend who adopted a second dog about 6 months ago. He seems to be settling in pretty good and he and their other dog get along fine. The big problem is this dog is a high energy one. Like, two-hours-hard-exercise-every-day high energy. She seems to think that 15 minutes of light ball chasing is enough to tire out this Mack truck. She'll toss the ball 3 times and then make the dog take a rest because he \"doesn't know how to stop.\" She gets upset when the dog starts panting (not a hard pant, either) when someone else throws the ball for him because we're \"running him too hard.\"\n\nI've been around and owned power-plant dogs before. I know that 15 minutes of light activity isn't going to hurt him or wear him out. The dog is basically doing 20 ft sprints. It's very obvious that the dog isn't getting enough exercise because he's always running wild in the house. Even worse, he's a nipper when he's excited. So, we've got a super hyper dog that's bored out of his mind who also isn't nip trained.\n\nIt's gotten heated between her and us a few times because we keep telling her he needs more exercis and training. Are we the assholes here or is she just misinformed?",

      "description": "I live in a small...very small (10ftx15ft) dorm at university. For perspective, my roommates and my bed are less than a foot apart from one another. We get along well enough and don't really argue about anything and have fun together when we can, however, our sleep schedules seem to be a bit different.\n\nI usually wake up around 6:30 a.m. and get ready for work/my day of classes, being careful not to wake him up (if he isn't already/hasn't gone to sleep). I go to work and do classes and don't get a chance to come back until around 4-6 in the evening. Meanwhile, he stays up all night playing video games and sleeps during the day. It wasn't much of a problem at the start of the semester because he had agreed to turn his stuff off and go to bed around the time I did so that he didn't keep me up, but he since rearranged his side of our room and turned his TV away so he could keep playing without it being in my eyes while I tried to sleep. The only problem here is since our room is so small the light from his TV still lights up the room and I find myself waking up at 4 in the morning when he is playing whatever he is playing.\n\nLast night I confronted him about it and told him that even though he turned his TV the light still wakes me up at 4 in the morning. He got really annoyed with me and has been very standoffish since. I feel like I am an asshole here because I'm asking him to live a certain way, but I also have a job and my school to worry about and I don't want to sacrifice my sleep so he can game all night.\n\nI don't know if this is relevant, but I think he is skipping class to sleep so he can game all night.",

      "description": "Background story: like I said, I’m deaf (from birth) and it means I can’t hear farts or anything like that. But however, my loss of hearing has made my other senses stronger and extra sensitive. So if someone dropped a bowl in a room next to me, I could ”feel” its sound in my body. Not sure how to explain this but anyway:\n\nAnyway, me and my bf have been dating for like 3-4 months. He is full hearing and has never dated a deaf girl before. So every time we hung out at my place, we usually chill in my couch. It seems like he thought he could get away with farting openly, due to me being deaf and unable to hear his farts. However, I can feel the vibration of his farts on the couch. \n\nThe first time it happened, I didn’t want to embarrass him so I didn’t tell. Same reason for other times after it. But after a while, I started to find it so funny that I decided to let him believe I didn’t know. \n\nAnd believe me, he farts a lot. Like a lot. Most of times, it doesn’t smell but sometimes it does smell and then he usually blames it on my dog. I know the difference between the smell of his farts and my dog’s farts but I still pretended I believed his lies.\n\nAnd I didn’t tell him for months, letting him fart so much and openly, believing I didn’t know. \nBut yesterday, he let out such a big fart, causing a real fartquake on the couch and I got into a fit of laughter and told him. To my big surprise, he actually seemed so mortified and got so quiet after it. He didn’t end up staying at my place yesterday and I haven’t heard anything from him today. I think I did upset him but I thought he would at least find it a little funny. \n\nWas I being an asshole? Should I have told him right away? I’m honestly surprised, I thought he would see the funny in this. \n\nEdit: \nFinally got a message from him. He is acting like nothing happened. Asked if he could swing by my place after work as usual. \n\nShould I mention anything about the incident yesterday? Or at least try to have a easy-going talk about it? I want him to feel comfortable around me",

      "description": "So yesterday, me and my boyfriend were playing League of legends together. He's fairly new to the game so he was getting quite frustrated over some of the games. On one of the games, I guess he did particularly bad and got pretty pissed afterwards (even though we won that match). He was in a pretty bad mood after that so I told him that maybe he should take a break from league for a while if it makes him this pissed off (I understand that the game is very frustrating so i usually take breaks from it if I feel like it's affecting my mood). He seemed to get kinda annoyed after I said this and abruptly said goodnight. The next day, it came up in conversation. I don't remember entirely how the conversation went, but I remember ranting about the games we played last night and me telling him \"Its just a game and that you shouldn't let it get to you\". After I said this, he was in a bad mood for most of the morning and was acting pretty cold and hostile towards me. We've made up now and I've apologised but I was just curious as to whether I would be considered the \"asshole\" in this situation. ",

The country I live in is not big, so it's around 3 hours away from where I lived before, but you have to cross a bridge, which does it make it more expensive (around $45 by train, unless you plan ahead and get cheaper tickets and a bus system goes for extremely cheap). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have mentioned how much this frustrates me to my friends and the general responses I get are usually that it's cheaper to just get one ticket for me to get over there, than if they had to pay for several tickets to get over to me, but I am the one who has to pay every time and as a student I don't have that kind of money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn of the friends who has visited me (because he was already in the city visiting another friend) said to me, that if you're the one moving away, then you're the one who always have to take initiative and that just seems wrong to me, because friendship requires work from both sides.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this and possibly some help on how to resolve it.",

My sister is 18 and a student. Whilst I don’t necessarily need the money, I did buy the new phone because I knew I’d make most of the money back by selling my old phone. I didn’t want to pay so much for a new (to me) phone every year. My mum is pissed and won’t talk to me. \n\nBearing in mind, I pay a lot for my sister. She doesn’t have a job (refuses to get one because of uni) and is just using her student loan to buy food etc. She has a huge 0% overdraft which she didn’t touch but is now what she used to buy my phone. She wouldn’t have had a phone otherwise. My mum doesn’t give my sister any money &amp; if she needs money, I’d be the one to give it to her. My mum also doesn’t pay for my sister when we go out, if we do, I pay for her and have done for years. \n\nI don’t mind paying for her for these things, she’s my sister after all but i couldn’t justify giving that phone away for nothing when I could’ve got around £500 for it.\n\nSo anyway now I’m being shunned &amp; having to hide in my room because my mum keeps making sly comments about what an awful person I am. \n\nShould I have given it to her for free? As she’s my sister, it would’ve just been a hand me down, which is normally what happens... \n\nTLDR; I made my sister pay for my iPhone 8+, mum is mad at me, she thinks I should’ve given it to her for free as a hand me down from big sister to little sister ",

      "description": "So I've been living in this \"second chance\" apartment complex in a run down part of town, in a 40 year old building that is deteriorating and pay probably twice what I should for rent. Not my neighbors' fault I have a previous eviction on my history, but it does add to the overall frustration of living here.\n\nMy neighbors live 2 doors down and are quite obnoxious. At any given moment, there are between 5-10 people in a two bedroom apartment -- So many that they live with their front door open and their life spills out into the hallway and adjacent courtyard. Their is frequently food, trash, and clothing littered outside their door. When I come home from work, sometimes there will be 4-5 small children running and screaming up and down the hallway. They only have 1-2 kids there on the weekends. So it seems like they are running an after-school care deal out of an apartment. I don't know how these adults tolerate the blood-curdling squeals of these kids. The catch is, they are quiet by 9pm, which are quiet hours. Because of this I have not made a noise complaint.\n\nThe adults fight and scream at each other occasionally, which I think is where the kids learned it from. I stayed home from work one day last week and heard a man that lived just start screaming at the top of his lungs into his cell phone, going off on somebody in a foreign language that I don't understand. I opened the front door and just said \"excuse me\" and he looked shocked that anybody could hear him. He promptly stopped.\n\nTo extent, I understand that we're all just people trying to scrape by and make the best of a bad situation. But frankly they are being a bunch of assholes and I could just call the cops out every time I hear somebody scream and also report that they are violating occupancy laws. Eventually the management would get tired of it and have them evicted. I generally like to stay in my lane and be empathetic toward others, but I have my limits just like anyone else.\n\nSo, AITA for being ready to do anything in my power to get my neighbors evicted?",

      "description": "This girl and I have been hanging out together since the beginning of the school year. She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She’s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\n\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn’t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn’t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\n\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn’t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn’t like me at all and he’s probably insecure about me, but I don’t care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn’t come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there’s hope?",

This really wasnt a good relationship as we weren’t really compatible. During those 5 months there was usually 1 week during each month where she didnt talk to me for (what i believe) petty reasons (ex: she thought I look a one of her friends cleavage, I didn’t; dark humor she didnt think was funny). After about 5 months I realized the relationship wasn’t going anywhere (this was during a week she didnt talk to me) so I decided to break up. I tried approaching her many time to talk, but she left as soon as she saw me a coming. After multiple failed attempts I decided that I wasnt going to trouble myself anymore over her and decided to break up over snapchat (as that was our main Way of communication).\n\nWhen I tell other people I often get blamed that I was childish and an asshole for doing it over snapchat, even after I explain myself many still disagree. I dont think I did anything wrong as my action was a last resort. Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "This isnt a particularly dramatic post, but one where I'd like other people's input.\n\nSo I've been living in a 3 bedroom apartment with only 1 other roommate (both of us 23M) and when we moved in I got the \"master\" bedroom which was downstairs and he got one of the 2  smaller bedrooms upstairs. The master bedroom is only bigger by about a dozen or so square feet, so nothing dramatic. The only thing that really sets it apart is its downstairs away from the main living space and away from the 3rd empty room.\n\nHe also has a girlfriend who lives with us rent free for the moment and she sleeps in his room with him.\n\nNow we have added a 3rd roommate (21F) who will be moving in soon and she will get the room next to his. \n\nBut now he and his girlfriend have essentially demanded that we switch rooms so they get the master bedroom. They argue that since a new person is across from them their privacy will be interrupted and that since theres 2 of them they should get the bigger room.\n\nI'm obviously opposed to this and argued back that I should get the room because I originally found the place and took care of all the paperwork and general tasks to secure it, and I'm the one who pays the bills for the place (he still pays me for his half of the rent though, I just actually write and send out the checks).\n\nSo yea again, nothing too serious but would like input regardless.

I know its about time we start to formalize things, get married and move together and all that but right now were both 22 years old, still in college and poor af. \n  \nThis past year my girlfriend has started looking at wedding rings, dresses and talking about our future wedding and all that. I understand her message clearly that she's ready to get married but I don't want to because its not financially wise to do so.   \n  \nNow I did make a mistake of telling her that I want to get married in the future (which means not now) and everytime we talk now its always about wedding stuff. She started planning everything and she's become a kind of bridezilla and I absolutely hate being around her right now. Honestly this kind of turns me off a lot and I told her that if she keeps this up I'll just break things off with her.  \n  \nShe's already being super creepy about the specific shade of pink she wants everyone to wear, the $800 dress every bridesmaid has to buy, about how she has to fight with my mother for flowers and cake and all that. I think its extremely unreasonable to make people pay a fortune for a dress that will only be used one time and I'm certainly not ok with her fighting with my family. \n  \n\nThe constant wedding stuff brings unwanted and unneeded stress on top of everything going right now so AITA for telling her that?",

I could hear the printing at a slow peace, and at this point, the guy called me to the counter asking me if I was printing in high quality. my answer \"No, Just Normal\", and I got back to the PC. When I was done, I closed my e-mail and all the files, and got back to the counter waiting for the printer to finish. \n\nThe guy then gets back on me arguing I had changed the settings which I replied, again, that \"I set it in Normal quality\", or \"It's just Normal quality\" or something along the line.\n\n\nThe guy would have non of it, and told me the price was then X (I don't recall the numbers, but it was much higher) \n\nI told him, while the printer was still printing, that then he could keep them, As It wasn't worth THAT much to me.

During the summer we would play video games with each other and a few other people from the discord for the freshman at our school and we got along good so I asked if he wants to be roommates. During the summer he was a normal volume level when playing games, every now and then there would be a small outburst but nothing too bad. \n\nNow to the story: Our school is starting an esports team this year and my roommate decided to try out for the overwatch team. He hadn’t played for like two months after stopping because it pissed him off A LOT. When he started practicing again he was pretty quiet at first but then he started to rage a lot. I didn’t say anything about it at first because I thought it was maybe just me overreacting but eventually I politely said “Hey man you’re yelling a lot could you try to be a little quieter from now on?”. This worked for about a week then he started yelling again so I again asked the same thing. This repeated about four times and he would always be quiet then start to yell again. I asked some of the people on my floor if they were able to hear him, because it was final exam week (only a little important to have a quiet environment to study in), and they all said yes and that it is annoying as fuck and made it hard to study. I asked them this after having to leave our room to study but even going to the floors study room I could hear him so I had to go to a whole different floor to study for my final exams. After finals we had break and I went home but because I’m on a sports floor a majority of my floor stayed over break. My roommate also stayed even though he isn’t on a team, I got back from break and all the guys on my floor said “holy fuck how do you live with your roommate he is so loud and yelled all break”. The other day when I was trying to sleep he was still playing overwatch which was no big deal until he started yelling at someone. After about ten minutes of this I lifted my head up and yelled “SHUT THE FUCK UP”. Earlier today I was complaining to my friends about how loud my roommate is and my friend showed me a text where they called him out for being too loud (they live on the floor above us and can hear him too) and he said that when I yelled the other day I hurt his feelings. So AITA for yelling at him? Ty for reading this I know it was long sorry.",

      "description": "\n\n\"So I have been with this girl for nearly two years and she always checked my phone and always acted a little crazy any time i talk to any female even related to school stuff. I love her and she was great in most other ways. I legitimately planned on marrying her once i graduated college. Im not a super jealous person but im obviously not ok with her getting with other guys. I trusted her and pretty much cut out interaction with other girls for her. \n\nLong story short, one morning i got out of bed for work and her phone was ringing (silently). I didnt think much of it...wrong number probably. I came back from the shower and she had a few texts from the same number. I opened her phone and saw 4 messages including \"Damn I miss your body *girlfriend name*...when can we do it again\". I was instamtly furious but i played it cool and left for work without saying a word. The next morning low and behold the texts and calls were deleted so i knew something had happened. I had had my suspicions before but this was the last straw. I took a day to think about revenge and i figured the best thing to do was to wait a week (for my birthday) and see what happened. I was probably a little hostile in this time but i tried to be cool until my birthday. I knew she was planning on buying me the newest iphone and mine was broken screen and still using the 6.   \n\nSo what i did...i waited until my birthday, got my iphone 10, and the next day i sent her the pictures i'd taken of her cheating and said i wanted her out and thanks for the phone. She initially tried denying, and then apologizing, and then blaming me, and calling me a total asshole.  (I never responded)\n\n\n\n\nAITA Summary: Girlfriend cheated and i waited until she bought my birthday gift to break up with her",

      "description": "So a little bit of context first:\n\nAt my high school it's very common for people to mess around with people who forget to log out on the computers. Usually all that means is making a text file on the desktop, changing their background on Gmail (Windows desktop backgrounds can't be changed on these computers), rearranging desktop icons, etc. Occasionally it gets more creative, for example, once someone found an extension for Chrome that edits all of the text on every webpage you open to wook wike this (OwO). (I should probably also mention that this is a room used exclusively for Computer Science related classes, so everyone there knows how to use a computer and can disable stuff like that very easily.) The key part is that it's never malicious, like deleting files or anything. As far as I know nobody has ever had any issue with it, with one exception.\n\nOn this particular day we're at an after school club in the computer room and the guy next to me leaves the room to do something without logging out. (Just to be clear, this isn't a guy I know very well. We've talked to each other a couple times but we barely know each other.) At this point I see the opportunity and decide to mess with him a little. His computer was left on the desktop screen so I copy one of his desktop shortcuts (I don't remember which one) and spam Ctrl+V until the screen is filled (a pretty old trick, people have done this one dozens of times, but I didn't have time for creativity). All it takes to delete them is dragging the mouse to highlight all of them, then pressing Delete. No more than a couple seconds.\n\nWhen he comes back and sees the screen he's furious. He raises his voice and starts yelling about how I \"shouldn't do that\" and that I \"signed a contract\" at the beginning of the year (which is true, you have to sign a contract to be allowed to use school computers, all it says is basically not to break/hack stuff). It's not like he was upset about me ruining his stuff, he was just upset on principle. He didn't end up reporting me although it seemed like he might, but he was so upset I'm really not sure if I was in the wrong.",

      "description": "We've been together now for close to a year. I live with my mum, I did move in with him for a while last year but it was difficult and I was constantly in debt and unable to see my friends (it's pretty long-distance), so I moved back to my mums. I've found a job that will lead me to a career I would really love, and I'm excited to start next week. Meanwhile, my boyfriend takes more and more days off work, shrugs off any advice and won't attempt to help himself, leaving him broke and unable to afford to visit me. We were planning on him visiting soon - and the whole year we have been seeing each other he has never visited my house or town a single time - but he asked if I would pay for it as he can't afford it with this month's paycheck.\n\nI told him I could afford half, which is TECHNICALLY true - but I have neglected to mention for the past few months that I do have £100 in my savings from my mum as a 21st birthday present to get my tattoo, and I just booked it for the end of next month. The past few months I lived with him, I was fronting pretty much every date, every meal, I even ended up paying £120 in one night because I bought tickets to a West End show we had agreed to go halves on, but then I was the one left to cover it as he had no money. I came back home a few hundred into my overdraft, while he had spent the past few months buying things like a new Xbox and a tattoo and a £50 video game every month despite that he couldn't afford those things, and I couldn't use my money on anything nice for myself as I had to foot all the bills, which has left me pretty salty. I could just take the money out of my paycheck next month, but I'm worried I'll fuck up and get fired and not earn enough to cover it, and he'll be pissed if he finds out I still have that money when I told him I didn't to avoid having to spend the last chunk of my birthday money on him. Meanwhile he's still paying a ton of subscription services for things he doesn't use and I've had to cancel every direct debit except for my cheap af phone bill and prescription card.\n\nTl;dr AITA for wanting to spend my money on myself for once instead of for my relationship?",

      "description": "Me (22m) and my boyfriend (23m) have been together for four years now, and for the first three and a half years of our relationship he and his mother never spoke. She had basically turned on him when he came out as gay, starting off with subtle insults and digs which came to blows and she kicked him out at 17 with nowhere to go. We were friends at this point, and all of my friends already knew I'm gay, so we got quite close and got together a couple of years later. After being kicked out, he didn't have any contact with his mother or step-father until last May, although his relationship with his father is still good. \n\nAnyway, last July his mother messaged him out of the blue with an apology, and it was pretty decent and seemed sincere, so he decided to start talking to her again. Slowly, they started building a relationship again and even though my boyfriend was nervous about it, I could tell he was really happy to have a relationship with his mother again and I was excited for him. It came out a week or so later that she has cancer, but they caught it early and she is in treatment.\n\nHer birthday was in September last year, and she invited my boyfriend out to her birthday meal. I didn't go, mostly because she didn't mention me in the message and we didn't want to rock the boat. They had a great time and started meeting up every couple of weeks.\n\nI met her just before Christmas on a shopping trip with my boyfriend and his sister, and everything was good. She seemed really nice, and honestly everything seemed fine. Fast forward to Christmas Day. We spent the morning together, went to my parents' house for Christmas lunch and then to his parents' in the evening for a late dinner. I offered to help with the dishes after dinner, so it was me and his mother alone in the kitchen. Everything was fine albeit a little awkward, but then she started making little comments like \"you don't look gay\" (I'm a 6'4 firefighter with tattoos, quite typically manly I guess), and I laughed it off, but they started getting worse. The comments continued over the next few times I saw her (day after boxing day, NYD and yesterday), here's a list of some of them from all the occasions:\n\n\\- \"don't you think you'd be better off with a woman than my son?\" (he's a very feminine guy and I can tell she has a problem with that)\n\n\\- \"I don't have a problem with you being gay but I wouldn't leave you around my kids\" (she laughed at this one but I still think it's really offensive?)\n\n\\- uses \"fag\", \"queer\" and \"homo\" a lot\n\n\\- \"a man like you shouldn't be taking it up the ass\"\n\n\\- \"I think it's disgusting but you do you\"\n\n\\- \"the idea of you kissing my son makes me sick\"\n\n\\- \"I hope he'll come to his senses and man up before you have the chance to get married\"\n\n\\- \"if I die with fags around my bed I'll never rest in peace\"\n\nA lot of the times she laughs off these comments like they're jokes, but I know if she said them when my boyfriend could hear he would be devastated, because she obviously hasn't changed her ways. There's been a few times she's made these comments (especially the slurs) around her husband and his son (but not my boyfriend) and it's obvious they are uncomfortable. I mentioned to her on NYD that she might want to cool it with the comments because I don't think my boyfriend would like them, and she said something along the lines of \"he could do with hearing\", so I don't think talking to her is an option, she clearly doesn't want to change.\n\nMy problem is, WIBTA if I told my boyfriend what's been happening and that I'm uncomfortable/upset with his mother, knowing it might cause tension  in - or even end - their relationship? I know that she's obviously the asshole, but I'm worried about being one too. ",

      "description": "So this friend and I have been friends for roughly 10 years now. We were never super close but they've always been super open with me and always come to me when they need an unbiased person to talk to. I had fallen out of touch with them for a while but we reconnected last year when we found out our friend was dying. After the funeral, they had a really hard time coping, especially since they had been really close to our late friend. A couple of friends and I tried to be there for them, but it was really hard because we were also grieving. Although I know people grieve in different ways and for different lengths of time, I don't know what else to do. That was almost a year ago, but it doesn't seem that they're doing much better. Whenever I spend time with them, they start complaining about their lives and they eventually bring up our old friend and how hard our was to lose them. I didn't mind it as much, since I've always been more of a listener, but after a while I realized I can never talk to them about what I'm going through either. When our friend passed away, I was the one comforting them but never once did they do the same for me. I brought this point up recently, but they told me that I didn't need much comforting anyways since I wasn't as close to them as they were. It was really upsetting to hear them say this because, although I may have not known our friend for as long them, I had still been their friend too. I'm not sure if they said this because they're still grieving, or if they meant it,  but after this I realized I was done with being friends with them. So,  WIBTA if I just stopped talking to this friend? ",

      "description": "My ex (we'll call him T) and I have a complicated relationship. We dated for about a year and broke up last May. After our break-up, we both acted like assholes. I kept being really indecisive about getting back together, and he threatened to kill himself several times if I didn't. There was a lot of fighting between us for a while. Ultimately we didn't get back together, but have remained friends. However, he's stated that he still has feelings for me. \n\nT's father suffered from cancer, and he didn't really talk to many people about it. Even after our break-up, I remained the confidant about his father's condition because T didn't feel comfortable talking to others about it.  A couple days ago, T's father passed away. We FaceTimed after it happened and I comforted him about it. \n\nYesterday, T asked me if I would fly out for the funeral. He even offered to pay for my plane ticket. But I've never actually met his father, and I only met his mother once. I would have stayed at his house if I visited for the funeral. He said he needed my support during this time, which is why he wanted me there. I declined, and said I felt uncomfortable intruding on his family's space during this time. While I didn't say this to him, I also felt as if he was taking advantage of this situation to try and get back together with me. Additionally, I would have to fly across the country, and the logistics were messy. \n\nT was very angry that I declined, and told me that I wasn't being a good friend for not being with him in his time of need. He said if I actually cared and wanted to be his friend, I would've accepted the offer.  AITA for not wanting to go?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway because I’m not sure if she follows this sub.\n\nSo my girlfriend and I have been living together for a few years. For most of that time she’s been working part-time from home. She suffers from anxiety and depression and her mental health took a real hit when her dad passed away 2 years ago. Unfortunately a few months ago she was laid off from her work from home job. Since she has an advanced degree in English she decided to take a stab at freelance writing. For 3 months she hasn’t made a penny because she’s been working on her novel rather than submitting resumes and short articles to websites and publications which is what we both agreed she should focus on. I have a 12yo son who lives with me full time (not hers) and we live in an area with a high cost of living so even though I make okay money, things are stretched pretty tight to the point where we have very little if any disposable cash.\n\nThree days ago an acquaintance of hers offered her a full time tech support job making pretty decent money. Like instantly solve all of our financial problems type money. She doesn’t want to take it because she’s an introvert and talking on the phone all day sounds like her idea of hell.\n\nShe keeps asking if I think she should take it and I don’t want to push her into doing something she doesn’t want to, but it would really take the financial pressure off me. She keeps saying, “I know you want me to take it,” even though I’ve been adamant that it’s her decision and I will love and support her either way. Today I splurged on a $30 item and she said that I did it to tell her to go back to work. It honestly feels like she wants me to push her into it so that she can blame it on me when she hates the job.\n\nI finally said: If you’re going to take the job, then you need to own that choice. You can’t be miserable and blame me because I made you do it. If you don’t take the job, then you need to own that choice too. You don’t get to make me feel bad about money problems when you have the power to fix them and choose not to. This decision is yours and the consequences are also yours. I will love you and help you either way but you cannot put it on me. That’s not fair.\n\nIt’s not like she can’t keep writing if she takes the job. Somehow she’s convinced herself that it’s all or nothing and now she’s crying.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nTLDR; stay at home girlfriend was offered a job that would help a lot but doesn’t want to take it",

      "description": "19M here, worked with this girl for 2 years in a boring min wage job so we talked a lot, became solid friends, and maintained that friendship even though neither of us still work there. We recently met up in person for the first time in while and there was attraction that I felt was mutual, so I later asked her about it and she was on the fence about it, saying she did feel something, but didn’t want to risk the friendship. We talked about it for a couple days and I told her I was willing to do it if she was, and she decided to give it a try. We went out for drinks and nothing really happened, we made out for a pretty short time before she left, and I took it as a sign she wasn’t comfortable with it and left her alone. The next night she snap chatted me in the bath and started being very flirty and provocative, and I asked her what was up, she said it was weird at first but now that she’s thought about it she’s more into it. I’m a dumb and horny teenage boy so despite me having realized that I wasn’t that into her and was more thirsty in general during this time I flirted back and she eventually sent me a full body nude in her mirror. Her body was very different from what I had expected and what she looked like in clothing. Essentially her breasts were much smaller than I though and she had a much heftier body all around. This larger body type just doesn’t appeal to me and it caught me off guard, but in retrospect she wore very baggy clothes at most times so I see where my misperception came from. After this I told her it felt weird now having seen her nude and went to bed, the next day she told me that she felt I took advantage of her and persuaded her into sending nudes by pretending to be interested when I wasn’t, so I told her the truth about my lack of attraction but in a somewhat indirect way. Now we haven’t spoken in a few days and have realized I may be the asshole here.",

      "description": "TL;DR: Moved in with a roommate who eats my stuff and is messy. I left her a note about it and she left me one calling me \"rude and disrespectful\".\n\nI am 20F and recently moved into my first apartment. I have definitely carried over some of the expectations I had about living with family members, and don't know if I have gone too far. \n\nMy roommate Maggie and I were strangers before she moved in. I allowed her to use my dishes, appliances (fridge, stove, washer, dryer), pots and pans freely. Almost immediately she began eating my food and letting dishes pile up. She would also get up in the middle of the night to eat and would make a lot of noise. I called her out at once for all these things. She mostly ate only the staples I had, but I noticed she used my ketchup, oil, pasta, salt, pepper and popcorn. Not a big deal but I asked if in the future she would at least ask me before using my things. She agreed to this, but never ended up asking me.\n\nAs the weeks went by, she continued not pulling her weight around the house and I called her out many times, sometimes a bit rudely, about the following things: \n\n\\- Eating my food\n\n\\- Not doing her dishes\n\n\\- Smoking pot inside (we had both signed a waiver saying we wouldn't smoke inside)\n\n\\- Removing the plastic from her window (results in high electricity costs)\n\n\\- Paying rent and utilities over a week late\n\n\\- Pooping in our only toilet and not cleaning it up once when we were out of water\n\n\\- Leaving trash bags outside on days it wouldn't be picked up (we could be fined $300 for that)\n\nShe always apologized and said she would stop, (although she lied to me and said she didn't smoke. I can smell the pot from every room in the house).\n\nRecently she changed her phone number and didn't give me the new one. She didn't like me knocking on her door (she's in there 24/7). So a couple days ago I left her a note. I asked how she was doing and if she wouldn't mind wiping down the stove when she was done because she left it oily. I mentioned a few other house-keeping related things and asked for her new number. I have confirmed with friends that my note isn't hostile whatsoever. When she found it, she crumpled it up and wrote me one where she said she would rather not give me her phone number, because quote \"You're rude and disrespectful. You have the mood pattern of an autistic child who needs a fucking nap. I'm sick of your shit and I don't need you blowing up my phone with dumb bullshit, disrespect and negativity.\" I am shocked because the few times I have talked to her face to face we have been nice to each other. After leaving her note out, she went and ate more of my popcorn. I have been living with my boyfriend ever since and am scared to return. But is she the right one in this case? Did I push things too far by constantly nagging her?",

      "description": "(Sorry in advance for formatting, I’m on mobile)\n\nSo let’s get started. During summer vacation when I was 13, I went to a summer day camp. It was fun and I made some friends but there was this one girl I really clicked with. She was a year older than me, but it wasn’t a big deal. \n\nWe could joke about anything, and we would constantly tell each other our weirdest pickup lines. It was a week long camp, and on the second day, we were sitting next to each other and she grabbed my inner thigh quite far up my leg. She said “when she grabs your inner thigh” and started laughing. I laughed to, thinking nothing of it. \n\nThird day, and we were talking and I told her I liked her. She said she liked me to. She said she wanted to make out, so we went to go do it (I had never done it before), and right before she went to kiss me, she freaked out. She said she wasn’t ready for a relationship. I said ok. It was her last day at the camp, and apparently she felt bad for messing with me and cried in the bathroom afterwards.  \n\nWe had exchanged numbers, and we would still occasionally text. She said we could be friends and would see how it went from there. I would text her asking if she wanted to hang out, she wouldn’t respond. We would have a five minute conversation every couple months. \n\nNearly a year later, I was fed up. I told her I might as well delete her number, since it seemed that she had no interest in being friends. She said she wanted to hang out. I said I was free for the next 4 days, she says she’ll go ask her mum if/when she could hang out. \n\nTwo hours later, she texts me saying I have a wrong number. I ask if it’s her,  she says yes. I say it’s u/SpyTrain_from_Canada, she says she doesn’t know a u/SpyTrain_from_Canada. I again ask if it her, by her full name. She admits she remembers me and just wanted to get rid of me. \n\nI called her a terrible person, and deleted her contact.\n\nI fell like I acted like an incel or something. AITA?\n\n(Sorry for being so long winded).  ",

      "description": "Back story: 9 months ago my mother had some severe health issues and landed in the ICU for two weeks. Because she was sick and couldn’t work, she shortly afterwards became homeless. My husband and I offered to foster her dog for three months while she got back on her feet. We live in a studio apartment with our own dog and one cat. Now mind you, my mother’s dog is an extremely overweight lab/mastiff breed. When we took him on he easily weighed 275lbs and could hardly move. Fast forward 3 months and he’s been on weight loss foods, been to the vet and even lost enough weight he can run and jump. His three months was up and my mom was no where to be found. She didn’t come to collect him, kept ignoring our calls and eventually said if she came to get him, he would go to the pound because she was still homeless and had no permanent home. Naturally we didn’t want this to happen to the dog so he stayed with us for another 3 months. Loosing more weight and regaining his mobility. By now he’s become a distant member of our little family and all is good. The 6 month period rolls around and once again, my mother dodges calls. Avoids situations that might involve her dog and ignores us. Fast forward to the 9 month mark and he’s still here. But so is my mom now. I’m sure you can imagine the chaos of three adults, two large dogs and one cat in a studio apartment. She ended up on the streets again and winter is fast approaching so we told her she could stay temporarily. This also meant that she needed to take on the daily responsibilities for her dog, something that has been communicated to her multiple times. I’m currently 3 months pregnant, very ill with morning sickness and I’m still taking care of him because she refuses. My husband and I still feed and water him, take him outside, bathe him and brush him. All the while she’s been here, refusing to do any of it and sleeping all day or going out with her friends. My husband and I will be moving shortly and both them will have to leave then too. I’m concerned my mother won’t take her dog when we leave and because of her lack of responsibility for him in the last month I’m considering re-homing the dog. Does this make me an asshole? \n\nEdit to add: This is not the first time she has abandoned a dog.  ",

      "description": "I have this friend who I’ve known for about four years now. Let’s call her Ra. Ra was always kinda weird. Didn’t have many friends, but I was one of her friends. We hung out a lot and laughed a lot. But one thing about Ra is that she is a big asshole to a lot of people. \nI have another friend who I met a year after meeting Ra. Let’s call this friend M. So Ra does not like M at all. Ra hates her guts. Ra always told me I should stop being friends with M. But you see there wasn’t much reason to why Ra wanted me to stop hanging out with M.\nNow some of Ra’s reasons where just. M used to be kinda weird and would touch me and do some weird things but other than that M didn’t do anything bad. \nI think Ra hated M because she was “cringe.” When I say cringe I mean more so the version where someone is obsessed with Undertale and makes a bunch of MarySue original characters. So to put things lightly Ra really disliked M.\nWe’re in high school now, tenth grade. Our school performs our musical in the fall so to start early we start rehearsing late summer. I tried out and didn’t get a role but Ra did. I didn’t mind at first, but then I decided to quit because the fee for our musicals was too much for my family and I didn’t want to make them pay that much money for me to be a male background in Legally Blonde the Musical.\nAfter I quit musical I was told by another friend of mine who I’ll call Sy, that Ra was talking a bunch of shit about me. Saying generally rude stuff. So of course I messaged Ra about this because we’re friends. We hadn’t talked much in the recent months but I still thought it was odd she would say such rude things about her friend.\nRa never messaged me back. I sent her a message almost everyday asking what was up and why she wouldn’t message me back. I stopped after about a week because I knew Ra was probably in a mood like she would get into sometimes. But then when the school year started things got worse\nI found out at the beginning of the year from a friend I’ll call Mike that Ra had said she did not plan to be my friend anymore because “Ryker hangs out with M.” I thought this was ridiculous. Of course Ra had always been really controlling and seemed to want me to only be friends with her and anyone she deemed fitting but it still seemed odd.\nI messaged Ra about it and this time she read it. But she left me on read. \nAfter that she decides to go around telling my friends that my mom steals things. How she “knows” this? Her brother tells her. My mother gets medicine from a doctor at a pharmacy/drug store across the street from our house everyday and apparently her brother who works there has seen my mom steal. But the thing is, the store has a policy where employees aren’t supposed to talk about customers and what they do outside of work. So of course my mom talks to the manager and the guy gets in trouble a few times for talking about it. Ra seemed really angry at me for getting her brother in trouble. \nAt this point I am really done with Ra. She has been really mean to me all this time and mostly it’s because I want to stay friends with M. In a way she acts like I’m an asshole who abandoned her, and in a way she really does think that. When talking to Mike he told me that Ra had told him once over text that it wasn’t fair that I left her because I had someone else to go to but she didn’t. \nSo my question is this: Am I the asshole for staying friends with M who has never been controlling over me instead of leaving M to be with controlling R?

      "description": "My ex was hit by a car on his motorcycle a few months ago. He doesn't have any family; I still love him and considered myself to be one of his closest friends. He very easily could have died, and when he got to the hospital, he posted on his snap story that he was hit. At this point, I had no idea what was going on; he seemed super out of it and I didn't know his condition at all or any details. I immediately threw up and couldn't stop crying. He never called me and when I asked him over text what happened he just said he was going in for scans. Before this, I would have assumed I would have been his go-to person for getting picked up from the hospital. Or at least to have someone there because I would be fucking terrified to be alone if it was me. I called my dad and he told me to call him my ex. I said I didn't want to do that since he didn't even tell me himself and I knew he wouldn't want a big scene. \n\nA few weeks later, it came up in conversation and I admitted to my ex how it was upsetting to find out through his snapchat story that he was in an accident. My thinking was, if he was able to post to that, why couldn't he send me a quick text saying he was okay. If I'm being completely honest, it was a fucking blow, like I didn't even mean anything to him to be worth a fucking text to know he was okay. I originally wrote it off as him having his priorities scrambled, but when it came up in conversation he said I made his accident about me and it was the most selfish thing he's heard anyone say. He keeps saying I should see it from his point of view; I knew he didn't want me to show up so I didn't and I didn't call him either, so I thought I was respecting him and what he wanted. I really wanted to go see him, but I didn't because I knew he wouldn't want someone fussing over him. He won't talk to me anymore because it was so selfish and immature of me he said; I'm heartbroken and I'm trying to see it from his point of view. He won't seem to see it from mine. ",

I was letting my dog out and all of a sudden this beater car going super slow pulls slightly off the road and onto my neighbors lawn. He drives off of the lawn and back onto the road(didnt look very in control of the vehicle but he was going slow so it looked very odd). He goes down a cul-de-sac which is all in full view of where I’m standing. He turns around then slowly comes back up the roar and comes to a stop at a stop sign(now facing me directly, about 20yrds away) and he flips off his headlights, no interior lights on.  He idles there for about 10 mins while I stand there lookin at him and hit my ecig. The whole time my dog stands there growling. I walk inside for a min and when I come back out the guy flips his lights on and turns around to do another slow loop around the aforementioned cup-de-sac. Once again he comes to a stop at the same location and flips his lights off and lets the car idle. I’m weirded out at this point and kind of raised my arms up with palms turned up in a “what???” gesture expecting them to drive off or ask me what’s up. I start walking towards the edge of my front lawn just to lock eyes with the person and do one more gesture. They said this time “Yo what’s up sorry I’m about to head out” and I said you’re looking sketchy as hell get the fuck out and they drove off no headlights goin super slow ",

Yesterday all of a sudden she started arguing while we were parked in my car that ‘I don’t trust her’ and ‘I’m being too controlling’ and even pointed out a scenario where her roommate who is in a relationship was talking to a guy at the club and he went for a kiss which she denied. This just further proved my point, why would I want my girlfriend getting dressed up without me to go out where guys are going to approach you and try to hook up with you, even if she doesn’t cheat. I don’t think I’m being unfair, idc if she goes out to a club if I’m there, she can hang out anytime she wants with her friends, she can even go to a bar if she wants to drink but clubs are a no go for me and I let her know that in the beginning of the relationship. And before anybody calls me controlling, she can go if she wants to be single, I’m not her dad, but I have the right to choose who I will date too. \n\nShe left the parked car angrily last night and said I can follow her if I wanted to back up to her place, and I just turned on the car and went back home. This morning she texted me apologizing and saying that I was right, I let her know this in the beginning of the relationship, and it’s not worth losing me. I got what I wanted but I feel like a real asshole for some reason. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA by losing a friend who moved overseas?",
      "description": "TL;DR A friend of mine moving overseas fell in love with me, I made it seem like I was also into it, started dating someone else, and slowly stopped talking to my friend.\n\nLong wall of text incoming\n\nLast year, I (27M) moved to a large metropolitan area, knowing virtually no one there. I got a job working on a team of eight, including a girl that I'll call Laura. Laura is cute, not really my type, but we have a lot in common including an affinity for our hometown sports team. We spend a lot of time together going to happy hours with coworkers, playing board games, generally being friends- certainly nothing romantic. \n\nFast forward five months and we start chatting a bit more often, frequently about more and more intimate things. Because we work together, we still deny any feelings starting to develop. The next month, she finds out she's moving overseas. She quits her job, but before she quits, I do some pretty sizable farewell gestures, including planning a going away party. At this point, it's clear we definitely have feelings for one another and, because she's no longer part of our org, we start making out and eventually hook up a couple times. Because she's going overseas for a few years, we have a long discussion that I shouldn't wait for her and that if we start to date other people, it's ok.\n\nLaura moves overseas to a place where she knows absolutely no one. She helps me apply for her job, which I get. We text NONSTOP. We send each other dirty pics, talk often on the phone, tell each other we love one another. She meets a few local people but still doesn't have all that many people. Meanwhile I'm continuing to make friends in the city I live in, meet new people, generally continue on with my life.\n\nIn August, about five months from when she left, I met this girl (Nicole) that I fell absolutely head over heels for. Because I was interested in cultivating this new relationship, I started to spend more time with Nicole and less time talking to Laura. I don't want to upset Laura with the development of a new relationship, so I don't tell her about Nicole, especially if it doesn't work out. Laura seems to notice something's off, and asks me about it- I tell her everything is fine. We continue to chat, though at a lighter rate; I read her texts and don't respond right away like I used to. In my mind, it now feels like I'm in two relationships.\n\nI decide to tell Laura that I'm seeing Nicole to help explain why I'm being so distant. I text her (probably the bad move) and tell her that I'm seeing someone and want to talk to her about it. She says ok, we can talk on the phone after I'm out of work. After I get out of work, I give Laura a call. Laura is furious at me, saying I destroyed her trust, ruined our friendship, that I'm a pussy for not telling her about Nicole sooner. She says she no longer wants to talk to me until I think about the situation and apologize. I say ok and hang up.\n\nIn about a week, I send Laura a long email apologizing for hiding my relationship from her and being so distant. We talk for a while and she agrees to start talking to me again under one condition: If I start getting distant again, she's going to stop talking to me for good. I say ok and hang up.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and we're still chatting a bit but this time I notice her getting a bit more distant. Short answers, curt responses, no longer continuing conversations. I figure she no longer wants to talk and stop talking. She doesn't resume conversation. That was the last time I talked to her- she's now blocked me on all social media, blocked my number, and told other friends of ours about the situation, essentially turning those friends against me. \n\nOn one hand, I understand why she's mad at me- I basically continued a relationship with her after she moved and didn't address the issue when something else came up. On the other hand, she chose to move away, understood I wouldn't wait to be in a relationship with her longterm, and didn't bring it up further when it seemed like I was pulling away. So the real question is- am I an asshole or is this just an unfortunate circumstance in which I lose a good friend of mine? Any advice would be great here.",

      "description": "Here’s the context : So i am currently crushing on some dude( lets call him Patrick) and it started when I was sitting across from him in one of my classes. He was, in my eyes, super funny, athletic, clever, and not to mention good looking, \nto me at least. I gave him my number for a project we were doing that involved our whole table, including me, him, and a friend (lets call her Beatrice). He texted me later that same night asking for audio for the project. I said I couldn’t but he told me how to like I was some idiot “record it on your phone.” After i had told him I couldn’t. Overall he seemed like a brick wall to talk to over messages. \nAfter i went out of my way to record in my room, even getting yelled at by my mom, i sent the audio. He didn’t reply. After a while I told Beatrice and two other friends about my feelings for him. (Lets call them Emily and Liza). After a while of me drooling over him in secret with my friends I finally messaged him again. It went something like this: “hey, did we have homework for Mrs ———-?” “The notes.”. And for a while that was how I talked to him. Passively asking for the homework that I knew i had done. \nAfter about 2 weeks, Patrick stopped replying all together. I told this to Liza and she tells me that Patrick said he was going to block my number after the project. He didn’t tell me it to my face, he only to Liza. I was pissed but I told myself I didn’t have all the details and that maybe he was just joking. \nAfter a couple of weeks, I was spending the afternoon at Emily’s place. She mentioned that Patrick had put his hand on the arm rest and she felt so uncomfortable that she had to swirl her chair around to break his grasp. (Me and Emily were both crushing on different people and vouching for each other) I’m heartbroken. Then at Lunch I brought up that I overheard Patrick talking to the teacher about his project for our final grade. Liza said she already knew because he had brought it up when talking to her (she said she ignored him at first and he just started talking to her.). I was super mad, even though I had not right to be. \nToday i messaged him on Kik for the first time, the message goes as follows : “Hi. I noticed you have a Kik which is pretty cool. I like ur profile pic, the doggo is smol. Congrats on getting into the History Day thing, Liza told me. The French Revolution is a pretty cool revolution. She also told me that you said you were going to block my number(this was after the project and after we switched seats). Yea..you could’ve told me, I wouldn’t have minded all that much and I wouldn’t have bothered you with the homework thing, I didn’t have Beatrice’s number. You can keep my number blocked if ya want to, its your phone anyways. So yeet. I just wanted to let you know. Hope this doesn’t make things awkward. See ya tomorrow.” . Its been hours and he still hasn’t replied. Am I the Asshole? ",

      "description": "We've been together for more than a year now and she already indirectly told me before that I'm the first priority in her life. \nContext: It was her birthday a few days ago, i was preparing some stuff for her and bought her a birthday present. When her birthday came, i had to visit early in the afternoon but due to some problems in my family i couldn't go that early. So, i told her that i wouldn't be able to come because i wanted to give her a surprise when she wouldn't expect me to visit her house. I texted her bestfriend too and she was also going a bit late so we both decided to dupe her into thinking that we both aren't going to come. But when we (we called some other friends too) went to her house, she sees everyone and hugs her bestfriend, and another friend of hers while i was still just by her side. She went on to ignore me (dk if it was intentional or unintentional). So, today i ask her about this and tell her that i felt somewhat ignored but she basically told me that i shouldn't be this insecure about these little things and i should change this habit of mine. FYI she's not that expressive about the love physically or vocally always but i know she cares about me and loves me alot because she does spend most of the time when she's alone with me when she's alone or if there are no friends around and she did alot for my birthday too by making some DIY stuff i could never make in a lifetime. \nAm i in the wrong for asking some attention in social settings? I feel left out. If i am being too insecure, I'd love to change that and become better for her because i know that we'll stick together forever but i just don't want to hurt her by nagging her about these things.\nHelp.",

This happened years ago. \n\nMy mom and I went to this shopping mall that was pretty far from our house to look for something specific (I can't remember what) and we came across Victoria's Secret. We decided to get me a few pairs of bras but at the time I had no idea just how expensive they were, so I just went with it though I didn't *need* to get them. We then later that same day went to another mall that is closer to our home and my mom told me we were getting short on money so we couldn't get too much. I asked her how much we spent at Victoria's Secret and it came out to be a whopping 400-500 dollars. I told her I'd much rather return the items that we bought and only kept one because that's all I really needed, so we proceeded to go to the Victoria's Secret at the mall we were in to return them.   \n\n\nThe manager was pissed right the fuck off after she asked us where we got the bras from (not her store) and at first refused to refund us. She demanded that if we wanted to return the bras, that we go back to the other store instead. My mom and the manager argued back and forth a bit and eventually we got the refund.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking back at it now, I think the manager was pissed or something because getting returns would hurt their sales or something? Not sure how that all works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, were we the assholes for returning the items to a different store rather than the original store from which we bought from? I just want to know exactly why she was mad, I'm only speculating here.",

      "description": "So me and my fiancé went on a week long trip and asked one of his friends to stay at our house for the week to watch our cat. We told him he doesn’t have to sleep there every night but at least a few nights and just feed the cat. He said he doesn’t mind sleeping at our place every night cuz it’s closer to his job, cool. \n\nHe’s watched our cat before when we went on shorter 2-3 day trips, and we always pay him. We offered him $150 for the week, which I know doesn’t sound like a lot but he’s a friend of my fiancé and really all he had to do was feed the cat, we weren’t asking for anything crazy. Also, I’d like to add I’ve never met this friend for more than 2 minutes. He works at the same place as my fiancé and they don’t really hang out outside of work, so I’ve only met him in passing when visiting my fiancé at work.\n\nAnyway, I left him a note telling him to feed her wet food in the morning, dry food at night. I also told him a few other things in the note (the code to the house, how to lock the front and back door, etc) and I ended it with saying “feel free to use our fridge and help yourself to what’s in the fridge!”\n\nWe come back from our week long trip and first of all I notice all the wet food is gone and none of the dry food is, meaning he either read the note and didn’t care what I said or didn’t read the note.\n\nI opened the fridge and all the booze is gone, I open the freezer and all the booze is gone. We had a bunch of expensive and nonexpensive beer in the fridge, two bottles of vodka in the freezer (one that I used for cooking), a bottle of white wine, and a bottle of rum. Overall it was probably $150 worth of booze. He drank it all. Literally all of it. \n\nNow, normally I would just think hey this guy sucks. But in the note I did say help yourself. However I was always taught that was more of like....just a nice thing to say. Yes certainly I can have a few things, but if I was staying at someone’s house and getting paid to do it, and they said help yourself to what’s in the fridge, there’s no way I’d drink all their booze. \n\nTLDR: fiancés friend was catsitting while we were abroad for a week, I left a note saying help yourself to what’s in the fridge and he drank all $150 or so of our booze. Am I the asshole for being annoyed?",

She plainly said that she thought the car was girly. I told her that I didn't think it was necessarily girly and that I liked it. This started an argument between us and she said that anyone would think the car was girly. I was basically saying that I didn't like that her first statement to me saying that I liked the car was that it was girly. After about 30 seconds to a minute of arguing she said the \"I shouldn't be taking this up the butt.\" I started to be quiet and just kinda lean towards door of the car and turn my head away. She continued to talk about how I always get hurt by things that I have no right to get hurt by and that she isn't gonna apologize for something she didn't do wrong (I never asked her too, I only asked her to be more sensitive sometimes). She continually got more mad at me for saying that I caused the argument and telling me that I always do this. When we got back to her place I eventually left because I didn't want to argue all night long and I could tell it wasn't gonna stop until I told her that I understand all of what she is saying and that she is right.

      "description": "This was probably about 2 months ago and I’ve been sitting with it for a while. Basically, me and my flatmates were having a large pre session before going out clubbing in our accommodation as per student life. As a result of this, lots of people we didn’t know were invited and one of which is the person in question(I’ll refer to him as J from now on).See I hadn’t interacted with J at all throughout the pre session nor out clubbing as he seemed in a different type of crowd which was later to be proven right. Anyway, after we were coming back to our house to sit about and chat, J’s coming back with another flatmates friend holding him as he is quite clearly drunk. We had a girl who apparently knew him and such and was a possible ex of, but not sure, who he would tell to fuck off and stuff. This girl in question was also out of it so she would shrug it off but I didn’t really like that but didn’t do anything. So we and J make it back to our house only for J to be falling all over the place in our kitchen and throwing up in our sink. My flatmates friend was trying to look after him but he obviously didn’t want to be there and was telling us that J, along with being drunk, had taken several Xanax so he was very drugged up. Eventually I ended up getting roped into looking after him and I’m not very happy with this as I hate dealing with very drunk/high people. I ended up helping J do a variety of activities like taking him to the toliet/ walking him about etc. This is at roughly 1/2 in the morning and  I’m tired and don’t want to deal with this. After all this, one of female flatmates offered to have him sleep on the floor of her room which I was very adamant against as it was unfair on her as she’d likely not get to sleep and would have to look after J. As a result I asked J, who had driven down to our flat, if he would like to stay in his car or in the house to which he said the car. Before I could take him to his car, he wanted to have another drink out of a box of cider in this room which he claimed to be his. I didn’t think him drinking anymore was a good idea so I lied that it was mine but he kept pursuing so I ended up compromising and saying he can have the box but he had to put it in his boot which he said yes to. So after this I take him all the way to his car, have him put the cider in the boot and let him get in. I was very aware of the possibility of him attempting to drive off so I hanged around for a little bit to make sure. This is when he does turn the cars engine on, so I refuse to let him drive off and run over to his car saying he can’t stay in the car and I’ll take him inside. He starts getting aggressive telling me to fuck off, which I was not planning to do, repeatedly which, along with the other factors, made me angry to a point where I tried to forcibly remove him from the car which I fail at. He then gets out and starts screaming at me to fuck off which I lose my cool and hit him in the face. This absolutely sets him off as he starts screaming and cussing at me. Some people from the pre session drag him away to his car where he begins to start kicking his car and making loads of noise at 2 in the morning. Someone gets woken up by this and tells us to call the police which I ended up doing. The police ended up taking him away and I remained at home without consequences for what I did. I’m not a natural angry fighter guy and this was the first “fight” I was in so I ended up crying in my room for a bit. Later I heard that J had previous episodes of being depressed and the Xanax he took was possibly for that which made me feel worse. We haven’t heard from him since so I don’t know what happened to him and the possible ex of him doesn’t either as she and her friends blocked him as he tried to punch one of the females apparently. Hopefully you guys can give judgement for my actions.\n\ntl;dr- Drunk and on Xanax person attempted to drive car. I got angry at this, ended up punching him causing lots of noise and calling the police on him. Person possibly had depression.",

And as all nicotine addictions are, it's damn near impossible to break it, hence why my mother smoked through her 3 pregnancies without thinking twice. \nThroughout my childhood, I've been picked on for smelling like smoke since it was always in the house, and all of my clothes and school supplies were covered in the filthy scent of cigarette smoke. It got to the point where my childhood friends never wanted to step foot inside the house.\n\nBut enough about painting them in a bad light.\n\nMy father recently lost his job, and my mother finally got one after more than a decade due to a disability. We've fallen on hard times when it comes to money, and we barely pull through on fees and rent. They won't let me assist after I got a job to specifically help with this, so I left it alone.\n\nYesterday, my mother told me that we couldn't afford groceries until the fifteenth (and this is a normal thing)... but they always manage to have just enough money for cigarettes. \nEvery other day, if not every day, my mother goes to the convenience store down the street and purchases two packs of cigarettes - and they're definitely not cheap.\n\nEvery time I bring it up, she gets hostile, and says that I should mind my own business. I've given up confronting her since of course, I'm her kid and how she spent the money was none of my business, but it's starting to worry me that whatever little money we have goes straight into this addiction.\n\nI'm trying so hard not to say something again because like I said, it's not my money or place to say anything. I just feel like it'd be a dick move.",

I even have a paper I print out for new adults to help them get ahead if they put in the work. Even talk about when I was homeless and the lengths I went to, to pull myself up by the bootstraps. Including how I made sure that I didn’t stink. But there are some things that I am terse about. Yes you need a ticket, no you cannot just ask a quick question ( too many people took advantage of that phrase), drop box or ticket to drop off paper work etc. My strictness has gotten me in trouble ( and sometimes my own “rudeness” that comes from being raised old school between Marine dad and admiring grandparents generation). However a recent stern talking to was about how I’ve taken up wearing a facemask. One of the washable doctors kind. When asked I’d honestly answer “because sick people have walked up and breathed in my face ( but apologise to everyone else for their cold) and some people just stink.” so the boss has gotten complaints that the mask makes me seem unapproachable and I should take it off. Her response about the sick people is that “they” (social workers) have to go in an office with the customers and just have to take their vitamins and put up with it. So me , minimum wage, three sick days, no vacation days, and underpaid for this bs.\n\nTLDR AITA for wearing a facemask to not get sick or smell stinky people.",

      "description": "Recently my father, who I haven't seen since I was 4-years-old (I'm 27 now), messaged me on Facebook to tell me that he might be dying, so naturally I felt compelled to respond. \n\nBut, after speaking with him a bit through Facebook messages I found out that he's just going to get some additional medical tests after having a somewhat concerning urine test during a routine physical — something his doctor told him could indicate a \\*possible\\* cancer diagnosis. Which still would not necessarily mean that he's about to die. He has learned nothing yet and I felt that his initial message to me was a little deceptive. \n\nI understand why he would take the opportunity to try to get me to talk to him, but I reallllly don't like feeling as though I'm being manipulated. Even though I felt this way I said that I would be open to speaking with him on the phone in the future, but that I needed some time to feel comfortable doing so. He suggested we talk over the weekend, but I never responded to his message, since I'm still not feeling super comfortable engaging with him and he is not in fact dying. \n\nThen, come Sunday, I received another message from him, clearly irritated that I did not call him. Now, I feel pretty confidant that I don't want to reconnect with him.\n\nHe's been trying to get in touch with me off and on for the past couple of years, but since he abruptly left my life 23 years ago I haven't really felt inclined to reconnect. And, even before he left my life completely he treated me pretty terribly, leaving me places unattended, talking poorly about my mother in her absence - something she never did, and he just always made me really uncomfortable. \n\nI don't like that he manipulated me into speaking with him initially and I don't like that he's already expressed anger towards me. I feel like there's nothing to gain from this relationship, so I don't know why I would continue trying to reconnect. And, just the thought of speaking to him triggers a sense of fear and anxiety within me.\n\nMy friends are concerned that if I don't speak to him at some point that I will eventually regret not knowing him and feel horrible when he does die eventually. But...I don't think I will. I feel like I already know him, and he's not a great guy. I love the family that actually raised me so much, they're my favorite people and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I just didn't try to reconnect with him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Sorry if the format’s weird for y’all desktop guys, this is on mobile.\n\nSo, when I was in the Philippines, my parents had a big, official Catholic wedding planned in Mindanao,  (the largest island in the south, right on the equator.) But, since due the military’s ban from going there due to the “rampant gang warfare,” and since my father’s part of the military, he got reprimanded and was forced to go back or else he’ll be labeled a deserter (another reason I hate the American government.) \n\nAs you can guess, my mom was devastated, crying day and night for three days, saying that if she could, she would enroll my siblings and I into a Philippine school until she felt better, just purely destroyed. Thankfully she recovered quickly. Six months after, my mom starts planning her birthday party as if it was her wedding. Party gifts, huge amount of people, a priest, everything.\n\nNow, this is where the hair thing comes in, I, as a guy, has long hair, little past shoulder length, I’m short, 5’3 , and obese to say the least, bmi 31. I have self-esteem issues I don’t talk about, me feeling like I have no control over anything, meaning I’m stuck with this worthless body that I absolutely despise. But my hair, is one of things feel in control with. So, I keep it long because I like it that way. I brush it sometimes and I overall that care of it, but my mom hates it. \n\nAlways saying that it’s dirty basically whenever we go anywhere. Or even just sitting at home watching a movie. I adamantly refuse to use hair ties in my mind because I feels like I’m losing one of the only things I can control in my life. I feel like I look more gross with one than without it. I never that though because I don’t like feeling like a burden, but with the hair tie I feel absolutely awful.\n\nWhenever my mom yells at me about, I’m not sure if she means to imply this but, it feels like she’s implying that I’m a disappointment, she seems to believe in the long hair = gay of her childhood and I guess she doesn’t want that for me. I feel like I’m the least loved because of my long hair and mediocre grades. I just, don’t know what to do, suck it up for the entire party for her sake or just let myself feel good for her party. \n\nNow, besides all of the negatives, my mom is the best women I’ve ever known. She’s always there for me no matter what and isn’t afraid of anything. I feel so selfish just writing this, but, I just want to know, am I the asshole? Sorry if this is too long for y’all’s taste. I’m not asking advice, just judge me oh great gods of reddit. \n\nSummary, my mom’s been devastated after canceling her huge wedding my parents have been planning for years and starts planning her birthday as a faux wedding. My mom wants me to tie my hair but I don’t want to due to self esteem issues. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I recently began dating this guy that I’ve been best friends with for about two years now. We’ve always had a crush on each other, but no one has acted on it, until now. It’s been only a month since we became official, but it already seems like he’s keeping something from me. This is my first “serious” relationship, (I’m 16, btw) and I don’t really know how this stuff works yet. \n\nSo on to the reason I believe he’s cheating/keeping something from me:\nLast weekend, he went over to some girls house that I do not know. While he was there, he’d take upwards of 3-4 hours at a time to respond to my snapchats, when he usually answers almost Instantly. I’m not one of those psychos that freak out if their SO doesn’t answer right away, but it was out of the ordinary for him. But whatever, I let him enjoy his time with her, although I was jealous. But I felt guilty for being jealous because he’s allowed to spend time with other people.\n\nWe have geography class together, and I sit next to him, and I could see a name on his Snapchat that I recognized. It was this girl I added a while ago. But the problem with this is that the name was changed to be her name, followed by two hearts. When you add her on Snapchat, the hearts are not there. \n\nHe also never lets me see his phone. I’ve noticed that whenever I touch his phone, he freaks. And when he uses it, he purposely points his screen away from me. \n\nAnd, he called my female best friend cute not too long ago. It made me uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything. He also doesn’t treat me much different from his other friends. He has called me “babe” and “beautiful” a handful of times, but he mostly calls me “fam” or “bro”. It really bothers me, but it’s just a habit for him, as he always calls everyone that.\n\nAITA for thinking he’s cheating/uninterested in me? Or am I overthinking? \n",

      "description": "A bit of backstory:\n\nI am a 22yo F who lives in a non US country. Throughout my entire childhood I was mentally and physically abused by my father until the age of 16 when I escaped  to university where I managed to enter into a medical degree. All my uni fees and some of my living costs were paid through loans and parents paid the rest of my living costs for the past 5 years (around 100USD a week). \n\nMy parents own a medium sized supermarket. Every summer break and occasional semester breaks throughout uni I would work at the shop for free which added up to around 3 months a year of full time work. \n\nAs of this past year due to some bad business decisions sprinkled with a bit of bad luck the supermarket has been struggling and they are barely keeping afloat. \n\nCurrent situation:\nI've been working at the supermarket for the past 3months for 60+ hours a week with the only day off being Christmas day. In addition to this I've been emotionally and physically abused both at home and work since I've had to move back in with them. The whole time I've been trying to get days off as a rest and to spend time with friends as this is the last long holiday I will have for a very long time (starting work as a graduate doctor at the end of the year so very hard to get leave). This is all without pay as usual. \n\nI have been told repeatedly that asking for time off is me being ungrateful and not considering the family and the business. That I am the worst daughter someone could ever have and I should be ashamed of my laziness. \n\nSo my question is am I the asshole for saying that I don't want to work at the family business this much even though it is struggling? \n\nTldr: I've been asked by my emotionally and physically abusive father to work for free for 60+ hours a week over my holidays to save a failing supermarket.

      "description": "Long time lurker here using a throwaway just in case. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nBackground: I (24M) share a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate (25F). We’ve lived together for more than a half year without any real issues until last night. We’re both single, and I have invited girls over to the apartment in the past and have given her a heads up nearly 100% of the time beforehand, while she doesn’t really date at all. Last night I had a date planned with a girl I met on Tinder.  I figured it was possible that she may come back to our place, so I warned my roommate. She let me know she would be downtown with her younger brother (18) seeing a concert, and that they would be back after midnight. She also said she was not comfortable with the girl being there while her brother was there, but that as long as the girl left before they came home then we were good. I asked her to text me when they were on their way to be safe, but that I would have the girl out by 11:30 if things went that way. So the girl and I met up for drinks, and the chemistry was there. I invited her back to my place, and we got there around 10:00. We go to my room and start up pretty quickly. \n\nShit hits the fan: By around 10:30 we’re in a joint session of Congress, and I hear the front door open. I immediately stopped since the apartment was quiet, grabbed a Bluetooth speaker, put on some music, and got back at it. While putting on the music I noticed my roommate had texted me a warning, but it was 2 hours earlier than she said they would be back, and me and this girl weren’t anywhere close to done. So I made sure the music covered any noises, and spent the next hour getting several resolutions passed. We finish at 11:30, get dressed, and she’s out of the apartment at 11:35. After walking my date to her car, I checked my phone and see I got texts from my roommate, threatening to “Scream if she doesn’t leave” and ending with “IM SO FUCKING PISSED, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS”. \n\nAITA here? Should I have stopped on the spot just because they got home? Or am I justified because they got back earlier than expected? Would love some feedback here. \n\nTL;DR: Roommate and her teenage brother came home early while I was having sex with a girl in my room, and I just put on music and didn’t stop. Roommate is pissed.

      "description": "Throw away account because I know a few of my kids use reddit.\n\nSo I have three kids, an oldest daughter and two younger sons. When my daughter and older son were young we started going on camping trips pretty regularly. My wife hates camping so she was happy to let us go together as a bonding trip. My daughter loved it but my son HATED it and we could both tell. Well over the years my youngest was born and when he was a little older we'd take him too. Eventually, my middle son specifically asked me if it would be okay if he didn't go with us on the camping trip with us. I was disappointed, but understood, so he stayed home with his mom. Well over the years we went on at least one camping trip every summer, usually more, and after turning down so many invites over the years they eventually just stopped coming. By the time my daughter was in college it was just assumed that my oldest son did not want to go anymore, so we just wouldn't invite him. I wasn't purposefully trying to exclude him, we all just assumed we didn't want to go, even his mother, and so we'd plan the trip and go without him. \n\nWell, recently (my children are older now, my youngest is a senior in high school and my others have both graduated from college) we decided to go on another camping trip to celebrate my son graduating high school. As always, we just assumed my middle would want to stay home. \n\nOne evening the whole family got together to celebrate my wife's birthday and it all came pouring out. My son very angrily revealed to us that he resented us because we never brought him on these family bonding trips. He told us he felt that we excluded him from everything, not only the camping trips, which I genuinely don't know what those other things would be. He said that just because he didn't want to go a few times when he was younger didn't mean that he appreciated never being invited now that he's older. He told us that he never asked to be invited because he felt like we didn't want him there. OF COURSE we wanted him there we just always assumed he was more than happy to stay home because he had never wanted to go in the past, so we never invited him. Am I the asshole for stopping the invites as time went on?",

I'm not rich by any means but I make way more money than we need to support our family. My wife comes from an even wealthier family, and her parents spoiled her with clothes and expensive gifts.

She'd have 50 or 60 shirts, the same number of pants etc...\n\nI would be able to afford to give her these same luxuries, but it would put a huge dent in our bank account. I see no need for $100+ items of clothing. To me it is wasteful and unnecessary. That being said I understand that these clothes make her happy, so I have no issues getting her them for special occasions (birthdays, christmas etc..).

I was playing a game at the time and it didn't exactly have a pause button (multiplayer) so I told her to wait, say, roughly 3 minutes or so.

      "description": "My boyfriend gives his mother about 25% of his income, which ends up being around 1000 USD monthly. I think this is a ridiculous amount of money to be giving his mother. It's not like she's ill or anything, she just would rather pursue her own philanthropic dreams than work to earn money, as she's \"working\" to open up a community center. I couldn't explain to you why. I just found out that his mother is actually renting out extra rooms in their house to make extra income.   \nI don't want to say that he can't give his mother any money, but I don't think he realizes that I pick up the slack in our financial situations, as we can't afford for him to be giving her such a significant portion of his income. I frankly don't understand why she needs so much money a month, as the house and car are all paid off. I have a suspicion that she builds savings off my boyfriend's money, as she somehow manages to fund trips to Asia by herself despite not having a job.   \nAside from his mother, he himself DOES need this money as he's pretty deep in cc debt and student loans. On top of rent, bills, and giving his mother money, we barely have enough to survive to the next paycheck and often I'd have to lend him money beyond my portion of things, so that he can cover HIS portion of the bills. It's not rare for him to pay bills late as he doesn't seem to have enough money to pay them all (as in all of his portion). It angers me that his mother is making a savings for herself when my boyfriend should be the one saving that money. Overall, it just bothers me that I have to pick up the financial burden created by giving his mother so much money and that she so willingly takes it when he has so much debt to solve. Vacations and using that money on me would be lovely, not going to lie, but I would much rather he have stable credit and an actual savings.  \nI would be okay with him giving her less of his income (10% seems reasonable), but she seems to believe that she's entitled to at least 25% his income because she paid for 18 years of his life and frankly, I don't want to continue this relationship with him if he doesn't change this, as I think it would be extremely difficult on me, in particular, to try to plan even just a wedding, let alone a life together or kids, with his mother being such a massive financial burden. I've brought it up with him several times throughout our relationship, but he always kinda ignores me and ends up brushing it aside without changing anything or even really discussing it.   \ntl;dr - I don't like that I have to pick up the financial burden caused by my boyfriend giving his mother 25% of his income for seemingly no reason and I want him to either stop giving her money entirely or give her significantly less. Otherwise, I would prefer ending the relationship because I don't think we could build a good future together like this. AITA? ",

I suggest that if they didn’t live in separate states they would’ve already met a couple of times.

I'm quite annoyed and sad.\n\nSo,  my(25F) boyfriend(22M) of 2+ years finds it funny to grab my tits or  pussy randomly around the house (not in sexual way). I'll admit we're  both kind of strange and do weird shit, but I really just hate being  grabbed by the pussy (I don't really like him squeezing my tits either,  but I hate it on the pussy more).\n\nI feel  like it's crossing an important boundary. I've told this to him numerous  times (at least 15-20), at first nicely and progressing into a more  adamant way. Sometimes though, I don't tell him, when I'm either too  tired or I see that he's really depressed (he's got medium-high  depression) and I don't want to make him more upset.\n\nWell,  this morning I had enough and I told him off quite meanly: I said that  it repulsed me and it made me sick. After that, I went to class. When I  came home I was ready to forget all about it but he was pissed. I  prodded about it and he said to me that he just can't take me being both  bitchy and also letting go on my appearance.  He also said I should  feel good about someone like him looking at me given the way I've given  up and that I act like a middle aged mother (I've put on about 4 pounds  since we started dating and not really wear heels anymore - it's got  nothing to do with him, I just realized they're useless and  uncomfortable. I do Pilates x3 a week. I look fine.). I was shocked.  He's the most loving guy ever, always telling me how cute I am an how he  doesn't care about how I dress as long as I'm with him. What the actual  fuck?!\n\nDid  I go to far when I said that it repulsed me? It really does, but I  don't want to be too mean, he's under a lot of stress and the depression  doesn't help.\n\nTL;DR:  Boyfriend grabbed me by the pussy, I told him it repulsed me, he said I  should be grateful he looks at me because I've let myself go. I am  furious and confused as he's been the most loving guy ever. Should I not  have said that, did I hurt him too much?",

      "description": "For a little backstory on my boyfriend, Dean: he is not new or unaccustomed to confrontation like I am. He's had a very difficult childhood filled with abuse stemming from his sexual orientation. It's necessary to understand that I have found that he has an arrogant side as well: before a lot of arguments and discussions he likes to bring up his \"pedigree\": classically trained pianist with a degree in sociology etc etc etc. I won't go into too many details here about him here though. Just know he can be very very assertive and always speaks his mind.\n\nSo for the past week me and a college organization have been having a spring break in Washington DC. Everything has been going fairly okay except for some other little unrelated dramas. Mostly harmless if not a little obnoxious. The people on this trip include the two chaperones, 2 single people, and two couples. The two couples include me and my boyfriend and a girl and her boyfriend. We'll call them Khaled and Deb. I should also mention Deb and Dean have known each other for a long time, all of college really.\n\nMy boyfriend told me that the night before today Khaled and Deb had a bit of a problem with each other. He described it that he and Deb were talking, and then all of a sudden Khaled came into the room and started getting pissed at Deb. To sum it up he got in her face and asked what they were talking about and how she needed to come and talk to him. They apparently talked in the hallway outside for 3 hours.\n\nSo I noticed today that Deb had a little discoloration around her eye and brought it up to Dean, seeing it as potential abuse. I asked if I should talk to her about it while Khaled wasn't around and he said no, he would text her to keep it discreet. I agreed.\n\nFast forward to the ride home from DC and we stop at the gas station. Mind you there's 4 unrelated people driving with us. We come back from stretching our legs and buying things from the gas station and are in the process of loading things back into the van when Dean asks to see Deb's face and points out the discoloration. Khaled took it as an implication and passively threatens Dean. Dean gives it right back and says something like \"You better not be putting your mother----ing hands on my friend.\" It gets a little heated from there but nothing happens but talking. Deb is trying to diffuse the situation. At this point I'm pissed. \n\nTurns out the discoloration was from smeared makeup the night before, when the couple went clubbing. Khaled understands that as a friend to Deb, my boyfriend was only worried. However personally, he has lost all respect for my boyfriend. Deb hasn't really said anything that I could hear. \n\nI just wanted to know, am I the asshole by getting angry with my boyfriend? I just feel like we talked about how to deal with the situation, but instead abandoned that to escalate the drama factor. Meanwhile everyone in the car had to hear this too! I just want to have an impartial view of the situation.",

      "description": "I have three sisters.  I’m the only male.  Sister 1 is who this concerns.  \n\nSister one is 28.  Has three kids and is married.  I’ve always thought her husband is an idiot, but when she was pregnant with their first he stepped up.  Got a factory job and supported them and made an ok life for them.  \n\nSister 1 constantly “jokes” about leaving him.  My other two sisters all encourage and go along with it.  I keep out of it.  The three of them all pay themselves on the back way too hard.  It’s total undeserved narcissism.  \n\nSister 1 had gotten big in the last 5 years.  She doesn’t work.  3 kids.  Yet they’re encouraging her to leave the father of her kids and the only financial support they have.  \n\nToday we were all at my mother’s house.  They were doing their typical patting each other on the back and sister 1 mentions a trucker she’s been texting with.  She’s not “joking” anymore.  She’s seriously considering meeting up with him.  This dude is probably just looking for easy sex when he passes through town.  \n\nSister 1 asks me what I think about it.  She knows I’ve never been fond of her husband.  I straight out told her that the type of guy who is going to want a RELATIONSHIP with an unemployed big girl with 3 kids who’s pushing 30 isn’t going to be better than what you already have.  Don’t fuck up your marriage.  \n\nWasn’t exactly the circle jerk she was expecting and I got chewed out by all 3 of them.  I feel like it needed to be said though.  The 3 of them only tell each other pretty little lies and don’t understand how brutal the dating world is for a single mom.  I really don’t want to see my sister as one of those women in her 40s on tinder with a profile that reads ready to settle down now sadface. ",

      "description": "Last year I lived with some of my closest friends and it honestly went really well. We had no issues about using each others things amicably and got along great. I moved out for reasons unrelated to our relationships as roommates and now live a few streets away (college housing). They're still my best friends and we hang out constantly.\n\nDuring the fall semester last year, one of my professors gave me an old set of China because she was moving and didn't need / want it anymore. Just a bunch of bowls and plates that I thought were cute and my roommates and I all used.\n\nWhen I moved out, I had packed up everything intended on taking the China set/ took all of the bowls and plates of the set that I could find in the kitchen where they were kept. I never took count or anything so I just assumed none were hidden away and I had gotten them all. \n\nFast forward to a month or two ago and I'm visiting my friends at my old house which they still live in. I go to grab a bowl and I find a few bowls / plates of the China set. (Which means someone had moved a few of them out of the kitchen during the time I was moving out.. may or may not have been intentional?)  I commented, saying I hadn't realized anyone had kept some of the China without telling me and I was basically just met with \"yep!\"\n\nThis honestly really bothered me. I probably would have been willing to share them considering they were free and its just dishware, but it seems so presumptuous to just keep them without asking?\n\nI decided to just let it go and not make it an issue because I really felt like I was being an asshole needlessly. It really felt like a stupid thing to be upset about. \n\nHowever, any time I randomly remember this issue, I'm genuinely annoyed and bothered that some of my things were kept without asking.\n\nI think itd be unfair/ needlessly confrontational to bring it back up, especially since I didn't really say anything when I first realized, yet I'm still bothered. It's been months and I don't think about it often, probably less than a handful of times, but it really is annoying me. \n\nAm I an asshole for fixating on dishes like this? Would I be an asshole for trying to talk to them about it? Help. ",

These total about 1 hr/week.\n\nI take care of everything else. Meal planning, grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning up after I cook, vacuuming, changing sheets/towels, and my own straightening/laundry sorting. I also take care of the smaller things - refilling soap/sugar etc, purchasing household items. This totals somewhere between 5.5 and 7 hrs/week, sometimes more. \n\nI get frustrated because, even working from home and with chores that take less time, spouse often doesn't get their chores done, and I have to handwash items to have a utensil or plate for my meal or the recycling will build up in the collection area.

      "description": "I’m currently taking a lower level class at my university which meets twice a week for a lecture and once a week for a smaller discussion based class. During the lecture we have online simulations or questions assigned as a different way to take attendance and counts as participation. During the discussion we complete a fairly easy worksheet and turn it in with out names on it for attendance and participation. \n\nThere was a GroupMe created at the beginning of the year and it was used for asking general questions regarding the class. Recently people have started asking to be notified of when the in class simulations are active so they can complete them from home instead of coming to class. Originally I didn’t find this to be a big issue since it was only occasionally happening, but as of this week people have been offering to pay people to write their names down for discussion and the number of people asking has grown increasingly. It’s started to bother me since those who don’t put in the effort to show up to class are receiving the same points as those who willing to actually participate. \n\nWIBTA for notifying the professor and potentially leading these classmates to receiving sanctions for academic dishonesty?

At first i honestly didn't care about her sleeping around, but i eventually tried to see it through the perspective of her mother, and I decided that I'd want to know if i were in her mums position. so when i saw her mum again ( who is also one of my teachers ) i told her in explicit detail about what her daughter has been doing, and how she lost her virginity at the age of 13. at first, her mum thought that her daughter was making up what she told me, but later started to believe me. as you can expect my ( now former) friend reacted really poorly to that, and now refuses to talk to me now. if it matters, I'm a 15 year old dude\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso. am i the asshole for snitching on my friend for sleeping around?",

      "description": "I know this sounds trivial and stupid but just hear me out. (It is trivial and stupid) \n\nA bit of context: I love birthday cake. Like, LOVE birthday cake. Ever since I was three, it’s all I want, every birthday. I don’t care about parties or presents or any of it, but it’s not my birthday if I don’t have cake. This is so widely known, it’s kind of a family joke. Usually my mom makes me a cake (I love her cakes so much) but there have been a couple of years she ordered one (Hannah Montana themed when I was 10, for example). \n\nWell this year, for my 20th, my mom decided to go all out. She took all the money she usually spends on presents/dinners/parties/etc and ordered this INSANELY AMAZING two tier (five layers per tier) Kingdom Hearts themed cake. It was MASSIVE and DELICIOUS and BEAUTIFUL and EXPENSIVE. I loved it so, so much. \n\nOn my actual birthday, my family (mom, dad, brother) and I took care of the top tier. The next day, I met up with some friends and family and we brought the cake to share with everyone. Now, the bottom tier was somehow taller than the top and there was a piece of cardboard halfway down, making it easier to serve. When we went home, we still had most of the bottom half. \n\nThe next day, we had more cake. And then again the next day.  (I know this seems like a lot of cake eating but it’s a pretty rare occasion in my family and I can’t explain to you how good this cake was.) So by now, there’s less than about 1/4 of the bottom half of the bottom tier left. \n\n(I just wanna throw it out there, my brother absolutely LOVES working out and he’s kind of a muscular dude because of it. I’m not really into it but I keep myself healthy. Sure I could lose a few pounds, but I’m by no means obese.) \n\nMy brother’s number one weakness is sweets. He loves fudge and cheesecake and Oreos. He’s a teenage boy that’s kind of a huge foodie and has a reputation for eating everyone’s snacks and leftovers in the house. It’s really more of a silly quirk that you roll your eyes about than an annoyance. \n\nAs I’m sure you’ve already guessed, he’s been eating a lot of this cake. Like, three slices a day, while I’ve had one. So now, with less than 1/4 of the cake left, I asked him, as nicely as I could, if he could not eat any of the rest of it. \n\nHe completely exploded on me. Calling me selfish and rude and greedy and a lot of other things. At one point, even made a comment to the effect of, did I “really need the rest of it” and a couple of other things hinting at my weight.\n\nNow, I have no problem sharing but this cake is very much my birthday present and I’d like to enjoy the rest of it. I didn’t want to get in an argument, so instead of poking the bear, I just went straight to my mom and asked if I could have the rest of it to myself. She responded with something like, “enjoy that diabetic coma.” And after a minute, “don’t be a jerk, share it with your brother.” \n\nI genuinely want to know if I’m being a selfish a-hole here. ",

      "description": "I had travelled to and was staying in a hotel in the United States with 5 of my coworkers. We had driven from Canada hence had our own cars. The reason was we had to be at our clients office for a month, hence we arrived on Monday Morning and left Friday evening. Note that our company covers our accommodations.\n\nWe work longer hours due to tight deadlines, and hence are never out by 5. The hotel we stay at shares a parking lot that they own with other local businesses, but parking is free for hotel guests till 5PM on their checkout date. \n\nSince we usually leave around earliest 7PM on a Friday, we have an issue with parking, as our passes expire at 5. Note that this is a very crowded city and parking is minimal in other places. Every year (this is my 4th year on this client), the hotel has never given us trouble and has always gladly extended our parking.\n\nLast week, on the Friday, our last week there (we had stayed there M-F for 3 weeks and this was our 4th), the front desk employee told my coworkers before I had gotten down to the lobby that he couldn’t extend parking. They told me when I got there (it was their first year on the client, where as it was my 4th), and I told them this has never happened. Therefore, I went to speak to the front desk employee. \n\nI told him that we were giving his business over 25K in business (granted our company is paying for it) over the 4 weeks we stayed, so extending our parking for 2 hours shouldn’t be a big deal. He snarkily responded that to use a service, you have to pay for it, and my coworkers understood that concept, implying that I didn’t understand how it worked. This infuriated me, so I asked him if he understood how hospitality worked? He said he did, and I asked to speak to the manager. \n\nThe manager came over, was shocked to hear what happened, and gave us our extra hours of parking. I assume she reprimanded the employee for how he behaved as I mentioned to her what he had said. Looking back now, I feel bad, as that is the first time I’ve ever had to talk to a manager, and I didn’t want to get that guy in trouble. Also, we could have just expensed the extra parking costs to our company, but to me, it was the principle of hospitality, if we are paying 25K, 2 extra hours of parking shouldn’t be a big deal.\n\nAITA for potentially feeling entitled for parking and calling the manager?

We talked for a solid 7 or 8 months and parted ways and then reconnected for a month or two later a couple of years ago but nothing ever came of it, obviously. \n\n8 months ago we both got out of long term relationships and almost immediately reconnected. We got along great and loved each other’s company through FaceTimes and phone calls (he lives on the other side of the country for the time being) and so about 4 months ago, he asked me to come visit. I paid $800 and decided to go, with it being either closure and never talking to him again or knowing for sure that he was someone I wanted to Pursue. \n\nThe weekend overall was weird and I came back home and thought I wouldn’t hear from him again, but surprisingly I did. We’ve maintained contact but it’s always been similar to friends but also more. Exchanging risqué snapchats, but then he’d tell me about a girl he hooked up with and my feelings would get hurt. He’d see snapchats of me with guys (even if they were just friends) and he’d tell me that he hates them and that I’m HIS girl. \n\nHe’d make jokes about us getting married but then remind me that he, AND THIS IS THE BIG PART, DOESNT WANT A GIRLFRIEND UNTIL HE MOVES BACK HOME AND IT CANT BE A LONG DISTANCE GIRLFRIEND. \n\nSince I don’t live near him now nor will I in the future, it automatically rules me out. Since he told me that, it’s been really hard to keep going on these long FaceTimes and talking to him and hearing him tell me he loves me and know that it isn’t going to go anywhere. \n\n\nWould I be the asshole if I told him to stop saying he loves me and acting like there’s a future between us?

      "description": "Relevant backstory: \nI am female and I have two younger brothers. Growing up we were kind of poor and our parents also got divorced when we were under 10 years old. Our family life was horrible and everyone hated each other.\n\nFast forward to our teens, my brothers started bullying and beating me. It really took a toll on me, but nobody in our family listened to me,especially our dad, who told me quit bitching, I am the oldest so I need to figure it out. He also always said that if I didnt annoy them they wouldnt beat me.\n\nIm now in my mid-twenties and even though it was kind of rough for me, Ive managed to build a decent life for myself. I still try to be nice towards my family,though Im too scared to be in touch too much, because I dont think theyre too nice people and they make me feel bad emotionally.\n\nSo HERE IS THE ACTUAL STORY;\nYesterday I was chatting with my dad through facebook, because our dog had died. I tried to be nice to him even though I kind of hate him. So i talked to him normally, even got sidetracked and stuff. Anyway, in the end he then said, that he should go and pick up my little brother who lives alone now \n\n(he moved out at 22 and when we were young they shouted and beat me asking me to move the fuck out since I was 17, i moved out at 19. It was horrible moving out, since I was so scared theyd know where I live. I tried to move as stealthily as i could, but in the end my dad forced himself to get to help me getting my stuff toghe new house, and even though i several times told him not to take my brothers to my house, he fucking took them to my house. Nothing ever happened though, those two psychos never bothered me while i lived there. Oh and they once threatened to rape me when i still lived at 'home')\n\nBACK TO THE STORY\n...so my dad says to me my little brother has always been the most sensitive one of us his kids, so he is going to go and pick him up so they can talk. This comment was so goddamn autistic and rude, I thought, and I just replied with what I thought; \"What?! Hes not the most sensitive, hes the most spoiled since hes the youngest\". And then I just said \"but yeah go ahead, talk away\". \n\nId like to add, that I never got to talk about my problems with my dad. I get emotional and other kinds of support from friends and their parents. But not my own parents.\n\nTl;dr: My dad said my abusive little brother needs his time more than I do, since my little brother has always been the most sensitive one. ",

I have spent most of the time we’ve drifted apart trying to stay in her life. I regularly invite her to things, try to make plans, or otherwise check in on her. She rarely reciprocates.\n\nOver the weekend, on Saturday, I had planned to go help her out at 12:30. She was an hour and a half late, apparently simply because she couldn’t get herself together. She has a habit of not respecting my time as I do not have any children, and this isn’t the first time I’ve been left hanging for that long. I still went to help, but only stayed until the time I said I would in the first place because I had other plans for the evening. She seemed annoyed I wouldn’t stay later even though she had left me waiting an hour and a half.\n\nI offered to help her again today as I have an early day at work on Wednesdays, and she accepted that offer. Last night I texted her to confirm that she still needed my help, hoping to figure out a solid time so I could plan the rest of my day around it. She did not respond to me (and I know she had not gone to bed or anything)\n\nI am frustrated with her not respecting my time when I’ve offered to do her a favor. So when she finally got back to me this morning saying that she did still need my help, and asking me to pick up boxes for her, I told her I had made other plans for my day when I hadn’t heard back from her. (I should mention that I work full time and she isn’t currently working and has also had 4 months to pack her old house up and before Saturday she hadn’t even started)\n\nShe responded with both that she was driving when I texted and that her phone died, but I haven’t answered her on that because it feels like just a lot of excuses. I was offering to do her a favor that I did not have to offer to do, and I just wanted to solidify those plans with her and she couldn’t prioritize responding to me.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "I'd known this girl for about two years and I swore she was my absolute best friend (let's call her Leah). We would hang out every time we had the chance. After a little while, she introduced me to another friend of hers, who I got along with pretty all right, and I thought I ought to invite said person (we'll call him Ed) to hang out with Leah and I on the weekends.\n\nSo, I invite Ed and Leah over on the weekends, always making sure to ask a week ahead so they would have time to check with their parents, and they always promised to ask their parents. I ask them both the first weekend we were planning to hang out.\n\nEd told me that he couldn't go because his mother said it was too short notice. I brush it off because I have crazy parents and I understand. I text Leah that Ed wasn't going to be able to make it, but she and I could still hang out.\n\nLeah declined the offer. I understood. We reschedule for the next weekend.\n\nI ask them Friday afternoon if we're still good to hang out the next day. Again, Ed says it's too short notice, and I ask when would be a good time for him to hang out. He said anytime, just not this weekend. I understood and again told Leah that Ed wouldn't be able to make it. Again, she decided it would just be better to reschedule again, as it would be less fun without Ed.\n\nSo we reschedule again. They both cancel again.\n\nWe get to the weekend, I ask Ed if he's still good, and he actually says yes. I immediately text Leah to see if she's still good to hang out. She canceled to go to a concert, and I broke down and cry.\n\nI left Leah and Ed alone for a week just to let myself calm down and give them some time in case they wanted space. They both mentioned to me that they wanted to hang out sometime. \n\nWhen they canceled again, I snap. Ed told me it was too last minute, Leah didn't want to hang out without him there, and I told them both that I was getting fed up.\n\nI very explicitly told them that I didn't want to continue being friends with them if they would keep canceling on me last minute because they kept asking their parents too late, to either get their act together or don't talk to me again.\n\nLeah texted me back saying that what I had told her was abusive and manipulative (her actual words), and that I couldn't just cut off our relationship. I told her that for the past five times, she and Ed had canceled on me last minute and that I wasn't going to have that, that a genuine friendship requires effort. She then brought up that we had known each other for two years now, and to break off our friendship over this was stupid. Leah brought up all of the things we had done together (gone to the movies, gotten food, etc) and I snapped at her saying that I had paid for all of those times we had hung out, and that she was manipulative for trying to keep me in a friendship I didn't want to be in.\n\nWas I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for being mad my boyfriend said he would come inside in “a little bit” but didn’t show up until 4 hours later?",
      "description": "Buckle up folks, this is a long one. \n\nOkay so some backstory. The entire time we’ve been together he has “struggled” with time management. I put it in quotation marks because I really find it to be a weak excuse for his lack of communication rather than actual lack of time management skills. You have a phone that you’re on a fair amount, you know what time it is etc. \n\nFast forward to this weekend. Last night some of his friends come over to supposedly drop off a trailer to store (he has quite a bit of space for this at his house) and hang out for a bit which he lead me to believe to be a couple hours. They came over around 8:30/9pm. I had gone inside because I wasn’t feeling social and my boyfriend had said he would be inside once they left “in a bit” so we could shower together (honestly my favorite part of the day which he knows). Fast forward to 3:30am. I’m asleep in bed when he comes in. He proceeds to tell me about how his friend started tinkering with his car but then broke it accidentally and they had spent the last several hours trying to fix it. I just agreed the friend was a dumbass for doing that and rolled back over. He then started pestering me for kisses. Which is when I smelled that his breath reeked of beer and cigarettes. I have asked him in the past not to smoke because he used to smoke a pack a day and I don’t want him to go back to that, not to mention the smell literally makes me want to throw up. He ignored me. So I have gotten angry with him in the past for doing it after I had asked him not to and even jokingly given him a hard time about doing it trying a different form of communication. We had another argument a while back about it where I finally was calm enough to get my point across and he had actually stopped smoking when his friends are around. At this point I didn’t give him too much of a hard time about it other than saying I didn’t want to kiss him because he smelled like cigarettes. He went and brushed his teeth/washed his beard and it was fine. \n\nSo tonight the same friends and also their girlfriends come over around 6:30pm. We are all hanging out in the shop where they are working on the car until about 11:30pm when the first friend and his girlfriend leave. I was getting pretty tired at this point so I said my goodbyes and my boyfriend said again he would be inside to hang out and shower “in a little bit”. \n\nI had been awake for an hour after I came inside and then woke up several times looking for him realizing he wasn’t inside. I checked my phone every time looking for an update on what was going on and what was taking so long because to my knowledge the car was pretty much done at 11:30pm when I went inside. He came in at 3:30am and asked me if I wanted anything to eat and to tell me that his friend would be staying over. \n\nHere’s where the problem starts. I have an issue with this friend because he has a history of hitting on his friends’ girlfriends and just generally being creepy. Not the kind of guy I’m super comfortable with staying over. The next part of the problem? It’s 3:30am! I didn’t realize this until after he left the room to go make himself and his friend some food. Then he doesn’t come back until 4:30am. So now it’s clear we can’t shower for the second day in a row like we planned and I’ve been stewing for the last hour that he came in at 3:30am when the car was supposedly mostly done at 11:30pm AND THEN spends another hour away because I “was asleep” (was awake enough to know he had been smoking AGAIN and make a comment about how he smelled like smoke). \n\nSo now I’m angry for multiple reasons. Like I said, he comes back in at 4:30am and tries to pester me for kisses again. Normally this doesn’t bother me too much but the smoke and complete disrespect for communication and my time is too much for me at this point. \n\nI’m very short with him. He asks me why I’m upset and I say “Umm because it’s fucking 4:30am and you smell like cigarettes”. And he immediately gets defensive saying I “know how he is with time” and that I’m upset because he “didn’t come in when I wanted him to”, I don’t have a right to tell him not to smoke (maybe, I guess) and that I don’t want him to hang out with his friends (which is honestly not what I’m asking for. I’m just asking for some communication and therefore respect for me and my time). He also said he couldn’t handle me being aggressive with him but has also said in the past that sometimes people get angry and that we need to learn to deal with it when we have done something to hurt the other person (which as I see it has happened here). He also had me look up what “in a bit” means on google and argued that it had no relevance to time and therefore I shouldn’t hold it against him (to which I’m like why use it at all). \n\nHe told me I was being ridiculous and that he couldn’t handle the amount of aggression (anger) I had because it was way out of proportion to the problem. Which in turn just made me more angry because he made no effort to understand my point of view and instead tried to accuse me of trying to control him.\n\nI said “why couldn’t you have texted me?” And he says “why couldn’t you have texted me asking what was going on?!” And I said “Am I your baby sitter??” And he says “Am I yours?!” Which to me makes no sense because he’s the one who didn’t come in and my not texting him was in an effort to not be controlling so wtf?? \n\nSo anyway. \n\nTLDR; Am I the asshole for being angry about my boyfriend’s not coming in until 4 hours after he said “in a little bit” and then arguing that I’m “trying to control his life” after I voiced was angry about it?\n\nTyping this at 6:30am because I’m so upset I can’t sleep at this point. Sorry for any grammatical or formatting errors. ",

One isn’t here often as he does deliveries, but the other works with me in the workshop. Both co workers are 60+ M, and he is constantly busting my balls. I’m pretty sure he had OCD or autism, some kind of mental problem and it makes him very irritating to work with. Everything has to be done his way, otherwise he moans or gets pissy. \n\nI understand that he’s set in his ways, but it’s the LITTLE things that he moans about that really gets to me. If I leave the wheely bin slightly off from where it usually is, he moves it and moans. A job I was doing this morning, I had put the job I was working on at my workbench, a couple of steps from the welder which sits on the edge of the workbench. He comes over and says “What I don’t understand craig, is why you leave the work further from the welder, make life easier for yourself craig!” While he sassily puts my work beside the welder for me. \n\nIt’s the constant nagging about little things on a daily basis like this that is really starting to wear me out and I’m sick of it. He’s always watching me Incase I make a mistake which he has to correct me on, when it’s important I’m greatful for the help, but the little things is just annoying. \n\nBut when he makes a mistake I don’t act the same I just let it brush off, I’ve noticed he deflects his mistakes by having a go at himself out loud, which I find really strange. \n\nThis is all a bit rushed because I’m just fuming and writing down what comes to my head, if you want to ask anything else please do. I’m can’t decide wether im letting it get to me too much or he is wrong. Thanks for taking the time to read.",

      "description": "Long story short, I had a good friendship that took a nosedive after high school. About two years ago my parents sat me down to tell me they don't think she's really my friend and not to trust her around my bf. They pointed out a bunch of situations that occurred over the years where she treated me poorly but I made excuses for her because she was my best friend. Right before Christmas, I noticed that she was making a whole bunch of subliminal posts about me. I knew they were about me because they would always correlate to whatever it was that I have posted.she never came to me to tell me why she was upset but her and the other people she recruited to help her in these posts I said some really hurtful things so I ended up blocking her on all social media and on the phone. Sometimes I feel bad throwing away over a decade of friendship without a conversation first but after the conversation I had with my family and the posts I think I did the right thing. So, AITA here? Did I owe her a break up talk? ",

Has never had a job, has no license, never taken a college class. This guy basically hasn’t done shit since high school and still mooches off his friends and family and plays video game and watches tv all day. I’ve kept this friendship because he genuinely does have good qualities and potential and I’d like to see him succeed one day but it’s becoming too much especially recently because he has started acting like he’s too good to hang out with me or he’s too busy. He will literally cancel on me last minute and I’ll find out later he was just at home playing video games or he decided to hang out with someone else. It’s really insulting after all the time I’ve spent trying to help him and all the money I’ve spent on him because he’s always broke but I don’t want him to be left out when we all decide we wanna go do something fun over the weekend or go have dinner as a friend group. I don’t have any hard feelings really but the friendship just seems to have lost all value to me at this point. ",

While some of us are willing to split the price increase to cover the difference for those with a budget, \"Quria can just sleep on a couch\" gets thrown around constantly while house hunting. \n\nI get that it's easier and cheaper for everyone if I just sleep on the couch or floor, but it's my bloody vacation too and I want to sleep in a bed even if it's three nights.

      "description": "So a few years ago my husband worked as a contractor - it essentially operates as a business with one employee - him. He earned a fairly decent amount of money.\n\nI work, run the household including the household finances. Every pay I take my husbands income, and distribute it to where it needs to go. \n\nEarlier this year my husband saw his accountant and they did his tax. Turns out he hadn’t paid ANY tax for the year he was earning a lot of money and more we owe thousands of dollars. We’ve been fighting about it ever since.\n\nI’m angry at him because I feel like it was HIS responsibility to pay the tax. He is angry at me because he says that as I do the finances I should have been putting money aside for tax. I did bring the tax thing up with him a couple of times while he was doing this and he fobbed it off so I assumed he was dealing with it. Besides I feel like how much else am I expected to manage? When he started with this arrangement he made a joke about me doing the bookwork and I said absolutely no way no how did I have any interest in business accounting.\n\nOur finances are now a mess because he’s now in a different job where he’s earning a third of his wage, and we have this massive debt. I am getting towards the end of my own studies and it looks like I am going to have to throw in the whole thing and get a full time job.\n\nI’m so angry at him but he thinks i have no right to be angry.\n\nSo what do you think?

      "description": "My husband is a phenomenal guitar player. I sing very well. We used to do gigs together as a duo before we had kids. \n\nNow he’s got the music itch again, since his regular job doesn’t involve music. He is joining friends once or twice a week to come on during their gigs and do a few songs to give them a break and scratch the music itch. But since I can’t be there, he’s doing the singing himself. \n\nHe is not a good singer. He’s got a pleasant tone when he doesn’t get too nasal, and I enjoy hearing him around the house, but he has major pitch problems and a limited range. It’s not just a little pitchy; sometimes he just can’t find the pitch at all and just throws a random note out there. He also likes to tackle more difficult songs than he’s able to sing. He knows he has these issues but thinks that with a little daily practice in his car while commuting, he could get good enough to perform. I don’t share that outlook. I’ve given him some pointers that have improved things a bit, so he knows more or less what I think, but not in such blunt terms as “you should not perform singing in public.”\n\nI’m not jealous at all. I’m happy he’s doing something that makes him happy, and look forward to playing music again, with him and others, once the littlest one will sleep without me. I don’t want to crush the joy he is getting from this, but I’m also embarrassed for him to put himself out there with his current skill level. So WIBTA if I was frank with him about it?",

      "description": "Long story short, I was at a party two days.  It was fun, and a good number of people were getting tipsy, I wasn't one of them.  Basically I was having a good time just talking to others then this other party member, lets call him Barry, comes up to me.  So sidenote Barry is kinda an asshole himself and is extremely machismo, aggressive, and just overall a dick.  We were never really fond of each other and kinda keep our distance at social gatherings as our friends were all friends with each other, so I saw him often.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut he was drunk and starts talking to me, friendly for about 4 sentences before he starts backhand roasting me in front of some of the girls we were talking to.  (This is college party btw, he was talking dumb shit like my shoes and hair, etc high school kind of shit).  I pretty quickly realized he was trying to act tough to me, being 6'4'' and male to impress others, and it seems like he wanted to try to fight.    Pretty soon we were arguing very loudly, my voice is deep and tends to travel, and he called me a bitch and alittle punk and a pansy in the midst, I returned insults of similar nature.  I wasn't trying to fight, I knew his game, but one of the insults I told him without really thinking was something along the lines of \"Coming up to me thinking your tough and acting like a faggot makes is really fucking sad man\"  Now the verbal argument continued for like 30 seconds before we were seperated and the rest of the night went on kinda unsmooth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats all the really important details, I left some gaps for the sake of making this story short, but basically I got a text from one of the girls who overheard at the party and called me a homophobic dick for calling Barry a faggot.  I didnt response since i didnt really care but the incident has got me thinking.  Now I know this guy isn't gay and I didnt mean any offense but i wanted to just say he was being a cunt in another wording.  I never really saw myself as homophobic.  Well ive said enough I think, what do you think?",

      "description": "A coworker always talks about how she needs emotional support for anxiety and shit like that. She’s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here’s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. \n\nSo she gets the puppy, and can’t really train it because she’s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. \n\nNow she’s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic “Give the dog to an owner who can care for it”. And man did I get attacked. It’s a “therapy dog”, it’s a “getting her through a tough time”. My reply was “She should try Netflix, it won’t piss itself and die while she’s away”. \n\nWell, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I’ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I’ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something. \n\n",

      "description": " \n\nSo I’m a second semester freshman at my college, and throughout my entire first semester I was having a fair amount of issues with my roommate (whose name will remain unrevealed for the sake of her and me just in case she finds this and figures out it’s me).\n\nShe never paid for her half of the microfridge, which I asked her about a few times. She also would regularly use it for her own food, and would stick her disgusting, smelly fucking pizza (I swear I’ll never get a job at Dominoes with how much I ranted about it online) in the fridge and store it there for a week. After I started to sort of push her out by storing my food in there more and more (up to that point I had only put in a few water bottles), she starting leaving her pizza OUT in the room for around a week and a half at a time. I actually had to buy multiple, very strong air fresheners to block out the scent, but one time, near the beginning of the semester, it got so bad that I couldn’t fall asleep because the scent was causing my eyes to water. That too was something I addressed with her, and she even admitting to not liking Dominoes that much. Then, when I got back from winter break, while my mom was helping me get settled in again, she noticed just how filthy she had left the freezer and microwave. They were disgusting, and my mom even said that we would probably have to use an ice scraper to clean it.\n\nShe also continuously used her phone and played videos (a lot of which were really high pitched, annoying videos) without headphones, which I called her out for three times throughout the semester, and while she did stop for a bit, she started up again around the end. After one of my confrontations with her, SHE asked ME to not use my alarm (a Sonic alarm), which I need to use because of the fact that I’m a very heavy sleeper, who can’t wake up on time without it. My disabilities counselor (I have a fairly bad case of ADHD) even recommended it for me. She also was very loud when she was on the phone with her friends. Meanwhile, the one time I was getting into an argument with my parents on the phone (they were fighting about something while I was trying to get something done with their help), she told \\*me\\* to quiet down.\n\nThere are also other, minor things she did that annoyed me. She would knock my trash can over whenever it was near the middle of the room, so it would fall over and shit would fall out, but instead of picking it up she would just fucking leave it and all the shit that fell out all over the floor. She slept with her head on the side of the microwave (we had our beds aligned parallel against one of the walls , with the microfridge in the middle). This made it harder for me to use the microwave, especially because she would charge her phone using the microwave outlets. She seemed to have a 9:30 lights out policy, because she would always turn the light off around that time. which fucked with me because I’m a late night owl. She would use my fan which I had bought for myself during the heatwave we had at the beginning of the semester, and then have the audacity to point it at herself alone. When we were both up late working on something and our movement sensitive light would turn off, \\*I\\* would have to be the one to get up to turn it back on, even though she was on the side closest to the switch/sensor, because she would just let it stay off. Meanwhile, it was also harder to get it to turn back on because her stuff was in the way of the sensor.\n\nAdmittedly, I have my own issues that prevented me from addressing this with her directly most of the time. One of the symptoms of my aforementioned ADHD is that I have RSD (rejection sensitive dysphoria), which causes me to have a sort of fear of rejection times ten. The thought of bringing up some of this with her, especially the minor things, actually causes my heart to start clenching up on itself. As for the things I have already addressed with her, I actually get more and more afraid to ask again the more I have to so, because the possibility of her getting angry at me gets larger in my mind the more I ask. I’m also afraid to bring it to my RA, because I’m afraid she’ll see my problems as being minor OR she’ll bring it up to my roommate and that’ll make things more tense. I also just had an internal issue with doing anything involving cleaning while she was in the room; it made me uncomfortable to do so. Also a side effect of my ADHD, I have SPD (sensory processing disorder) which causes me to either desire sensory input sometimes, or suffer from sensory overloads. This seems to mostly effect my auditory input especially. For example, I need there to be at least white noise in the background wherever I am, because the sound of silence is very unnerving to me. However, sudden loud noises, or more than two loud noises at once, or even the sound of someone talking to me while I’m in pain, cause my senses to go into absolutely overload, so my annoyance with her seeming lack of headphones is more along the lines of almost panic inducing at times.\n\nNear the end of our first semester, I remember her telling me that she was probably not going to be coming back for the spring semester. I got excited. No roommate, and no more from her? I thought it was great. I didn’t tell her that mind you, but I still thought it. When winter break started, her name seemingly disappeared from where my it was supposed to be listed for indicating who my roommate was. It stayed that way for five whole weeks. I was beyond excited at this point. My mom told me that she had asked about it, and the housing department said that I might get another roommate at any given point, but if I got a new roommate while in the middle of the semester, they would inform me at least an hour ahead of time (and even the hour ones were just for emergency cases). Nothing changes for five weeks.\n\nI get back from the break, and set all my stuff up. I get excited and maybe brag a bit to my friends that I don’t have a roommate. I got comfortable having my own space to go back to after a day of class. I liked being able to stay up till four am without worrying about staying really quiet for someone. I liked watching my shows with no headphones. I was happy. It was like this for five days.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, after a very stressful day of dealing with my shitty fucking phone and slow ass computer, she walks in. No notification from the housing department. Nothing but a text from her saying “Jess?” And one of the first thing she says after she walks into my room? She tells me that she was gonna put something in MY fridge.\n\nAm I the asshole for being angry about this whole situation? My friends don’t seem to and my parents don’t either, but my sibling Ray does, so I just wanna know. Sorry about the rant.",

For now? Makes it seem like he was planning on bailing.\n- we had hardly talked in the past several days\n- it sounds like something a catfish would say (note: we met online and have yet to meet in person)\n\nSo AITA?

      "description": "My intro computer science course had a competition in which you could win prize money. I assembled my group in a forum and didn't really know what to expect from my teammates. One of my teammates had some sort of disability and was almost always late to our meetings, but seemed genuinely engaged. I was pretty behind in some other classes and helped out when I could, but I was overwhelmed by the mechanism of our final project. This teammate started pitching what seemed like overly complicated ideas for a solution that I felt must have been easier, so I started consulting some dorm mates that had already taken the class to see what they had done. She didn't want to work with me on this strategy and just did her own thing. The plan was to maybe meet in the middle at some point. So two days before the deadline, it turns out she finished the entire thing. It was super elaborate and I couldn't really follow it. I tried to help debug it a bit and was always present during meetings to help, but at this point it was entirely beyond me. Anyway, turns out that our team won the competition, and all four of us won $100 each and getting an A. After the competition she messages the group chat asking how much of the work we feel we had contributed. I was honest, and said basically nothing, (mostly because she didn't work with us on developing it). She then asked if we thought we were entitled to the prize money. I was so shocked by this, like, the team won, not you, this is just how group projects play out sometimes. She said she did it to help all of us out (one of our teammates experienced a tragic event during), and that it was rude of \\*us\\* for not offering. She then went on to point out the flaws in my proposed code and said it never would have worked. It was a draft!! She had to take a night off work to finish it, but none of us asked her to do that. AITA for accepting the money and not giving it to her?",

It concluded with me hiring 2 of my friends Chuck in Tony which whom I've known since before my teenage years.\n\nTo the story:\n\n Recently I've felt very frustrated with  Chuck who has been arriving late at least 30 to 40 minutes every day for more than 3 weeks in an ongoing cycle for 3 years.\n\nLast Thursday when temperatures were below 0 Tony had been calling off a few days for the flu so is up to us 3 my dad Chuck and I to finish the job. Job starts at 9:00 a.m.. Around 10:30 Ami asked my dad if he heard from Chuck since he wasn't on site. He responds with the definite no. A 1/2 hour later I send a text out of frustration..\n\n\" What's up man? You been late almost every day, we gave you a full day's pay for half day's worth of work on Tuesday. And now no call no show today? As for today we've got this under control  But the irresponsibility is working against you. He demanded a raise, got it and this is now in repeat from before with the issues.\"\n\n He then said why do I need to jump down his throat for being late when he texted my dad earlier that is car wouldn't start because of the subzero weather. Given that he just put a new battery in exactly one week prior, I decided to glaze over that and called BS and say to get your ship together or just don't in find a new job. Not only that, but come to find out he did text at 9:00 a.m., still late for a notice, but because my dad missing for me I then got fired up and threatened his job security over it..\n\nHe quit the next day and says hes gonna work somewhere else.\n\nAm I the asshole for treating a friend like an employee?",

One of the siblings needed to use the bathroom and as they went in my house they commented on how nice everything was and how great the food smells. As they were waiting one sibling commented on hungry they were. \n\nI diplomatically said that \"well I'm sure you parents have a nice dinner planned for you\" as I definitely had not cooked for another four people to join us. \n\nThe father replied \"not really\" and looked away. \n\nI said \"well take out it is then.. perhaps you should get moving since the kids are hungry.\" and ushered them to the door.\n\nSince then I've told my son that he may be better off meeting Chris and hanging out elsewhere rather than bringing him home so much (four visits to one per week) or even going to his place as I don't want a repeat of Chris' family here on my doorstep. \n\nI feel like I did the right thing by my family and yet I feel like an asshole.

Tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nLately, I’ve been pretty busy with work and life, and I’ve reached out to my friends to let them know that I may not always be down for plans, but if they’d like to include me, please let me know. Most times I go, and sometimes I have other commitments. I’m 34, BFF is 35, other friend (OF) is 30.\n\nI made tentative plans with OF today to have a prolonged hangout with beers and TV today, because my spouse is out of town and neither of us work the next day. The plans were kind of tentative because OF was drunk while making the plans, and because we’re both not feeling in great health. It’s been a hard winter, and I have autoimmune issues.\n\nI have a massive work trip on the 18th that I can’t miss - I’ve been working collaboratively for almost a year on the project we need to complete. OF texted and told me she’s been vomiting today, so I told her that with all respect and love, please keep your germs out of my house, then followed up with asking if she needs any sick supplies (because she’s single and has no car.) She tried to wave it off, like, “It’s just stomach stuff,” but I told her nah, I can’t do it, and apologized for bailing. She texted back, “Booooo,” then nothing else. \n\nShe might be busy, sleeping, yacking her guts out, whatever, but I feel like a bit of a dick. I do not want to be hogging the bathroom of an Airbnb in a strange city while my collaborative team does all the heavy lifting, though, or worse - stuck at home.\n\nTl;dr: AITA for telling my vomiting-sick friend I don’t want to hang because I can’t get sick before a big work trip?",

We are in an interracial relationship and this has meant that she often reacts aggressively to the hostility (I have been channelling her aggression by encouraging her to do boxing) that we face. \n\nThis is compounded by religion. She is Muslim whereas I am not and this has meant that there are some quite judgemental people. For example, she was recently called a 'whore' and a 'slut' for having been in this relationship and dating a non-Muslim man.\n\nShe lost her temper the other day and went to physically confront someone saying this. I had to hold her back. I told her that if she doesn't watch her temper as hard as it might be, she could seriously hurt someone (she is a talented boxer) and then she would be in a lot of trouble. \n\nMy attitude is to let the hate and bigotry just run off us and show people that our relationship can work.

      "description": "I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years now.  I've always been the primary breadwinner in our relationship which is absolutely fine but he's not pulling the weight he did at the beginning of our relationship. \n\nWe met at our old job. We moved in together about a year in. I moved on to another job and he got a promotion at his job. We were doing okay. Not great but okay. \n\nI ended up moving on to a much more challenging but higher paying job that I've been at for 4 years. Around the time I made this change the company he worked for went under. \n\nHe moved on to a much better,  higher paying job with a great schedule and full benefits. We were doing really well at this point. Knocking out some debt and even managed a small vacation. \n\nAbout 2 years in to his new job he started calling in a lot. He missed like 15 days of work in a 6 week period. He wasn't sick he just 'didn't feel like it'. We both have anxiety and depression but we are medicated. \n\nHe got fired. He lost a good paycheck and schedule and most importantly his medical insurance. \n\nHe's worked a couple little jobs since but nothing well paying and nothing with insurance. I've been trying to encourage him to apply for low income medical insurance or jobs that offer health insurance because his anxiety meds are very expensive and we're basically living off of one income but he doesn't even try. \n\nI'm getting frustrated with his lack of motivation and it is starting to show.

That this is how a “real man” will treat me so I better get over it. \n\nThis is what gets me mad. Because a “real man” would respect me when I say I don’t like something and stop. Not continue to do something they consider to be nice even if I consider it to be annoying. \n\nThough when I try to bring this up to him he gets mad at me and tells me I’m being too sensitive and moody and need to chill out. I don’t normally feel like a overly sensitive kid who gets mad all the time but once he starts doing these things and ignoring my wishes I can’t stand to be in the same room with him.

He is also overweight (6', 300+lbs)  I love him and I'm attracted to him, but I feel he should lose weight to be healthier and it would possibly help with his ED.

But it's very hard for me to stay that way when I feel he is not doing everything he could to address this problem. When I ask him if he's working out or going out for a daily walk, his reply is he's not in the mood, feeling lazy...\n\nHis only \"solution\" was to get prescription Viagra/Cialis... every year, he's had different pills and none of them worked.

People that get pound puppies are admirable but I don’t feel like it’s the right choice for me at this time.  I have lots of pro-adoption friends who see this “lack of conscience” on my part as “evil” but I’m of the opinion that I am the one getting the dog and therefore what dog I get or don’t get is up to me.  I can’t help, however, but feel a bit guilty after having discussions with them.\n\nThe reasons that I do not (at this stage) want to get a shelter dog because of possible underlying health and/or behavioural issues.  My partner and I have a cat and we worry about a dog coming in and attacking the cat.  My parents had a shelter dog for a few years who they adopted from the shelter who ended up one day attacking and eating their cat.  She also had other behavioural issues and was a loving, but difficult dog.  Due to this, if we were to get a dog from a shelter it would have to be a young puppy.\n\nI would prefer to buy a puppy from a reputable breeder and I have been actively looking into what breed best suits my partner and my living situation.  I’ve been very critical about what kennels I inquire about and I am being careful not to be tricked by puppy farms.\n\nWhen I relay that reasoning to my pro-adoption friends they scoff at me and tell me that “that is no reason not to get a shelter dog!!” and how I’m going to spend “thousands of dollars on a dog when there are unwanted dogs in the pound right now!!!”\n\nSo AITA for not getting a dog from a shelter?\n\n",

      "description": "A little bit of background. I attend an international private school and our graduation is coming up. The graduation ceremony includes speeches given by selected students. Normally the more gifted and compelling speakers of the graduating class are given the honor of addressing the guests. However, this year, it was very obvious that the selections where not merit based. Almost all the speakers are locals who are hardly qualified and who also happen to be buddies with the young new principal (he's verrry young for the position and he only became incharge 2 years ago and he's only like 10 years older than me). On top of that, only 2 of the speakers are even from the graduating class, the rest are under-classmen. Very atypical from all the years I was at this institute.\n\nBack to the story. I actually like the principal, he's generally a good happy-go-lucky guy. **But** he does sometimes get on my nerves because he treats me like a child at times inspite of our small age gap. I don't know if he does it because he feels that his position demands him to be overbearing, or if he just likes to tease me, or he feels like he's a lot older than me than he really is, or what other reason.\n\nAnyway, I'm pretty sore about the selection. I guess I did feel a bit entitled to give one of the talks. I especially feel shunted that under-classmen were preferred over the graduating seniors. \n\nSo one day after rehearsals I vent my frustration on an anonymous letter and slide it under the principal's door. I basically called him out for the biased selection and used a bunch of derogatory words \"incompetent, favortist, disrespectful, undeserving, etc.\"\n\nI leave.\n\nNext monday, **he brings the letter out and reads it to he whole freaking class** mfw holycrapnononono.\nHe was visibly shaken and hurt by the letter. (I also mentioned how he didn't deserve students giving up their time to come study at his school since he has no respect for us and how if it weren't for us students, he would have no job).\n\nI feel terrible. He thereafter claims that he didn't even make the selection of speakers and that they were selected by a council (but I think that's tenuous since even *if* there was a council, he makes the final decision). Anyways.\n\nI feel like an asshole. Basically there is a huge boundary of respect which I was emboldened to cross under the veil of anonymity **and** there is a possibility that I unjustly accused him of something he didn't even do. \n\nBut in my defence, I never intended the letter to be read infront of people. That's why I frikkin wrote it to him privately. He went and read the whole thing to other people which was never my intention. \n\nSo be honest. Am I an asshole?\n\nThere are a few followup details and I'll clarify any questions.\n",

      "description": "I'm not the best at explanations, so I thank you ahead of time for taking the effort to understand my problem. Please let me know if I'm justified in my actions or not. \n\nI feel shitty mainly because we had been such close friends and I left seemingly meaninglessly but I really couldn't stand it anymore. We had been friends for a couple years but we knew everything about each other--to the point that every detail of every day was the norm. I'd never had this kind of friendship before and I was so grateful I could ramble about something that should be considered mundane to someone. He was always a jokester, the type that everyone makes fun of to have a laugh, but also smart af so people trusted him with their problems as well. You'd think someone with that much interaction would be socially adept but lately I'd been so frustrated with him. \n\nFor one, our conversations used to flow naturally but he started to force me to basically recite my itinerary for each day. It felt like since I had previously talked a lot about what happened each day, he felt entitled to a \"good story\" from me. All the conversations he ever started were \"How are you\" and \"Tell me about your day\". Don't get me wrong, it's nice to have someone care about these little things but man when you're just showered with this question (sometimes multiple times a day...) it really gets annoying. There's only so many details I can give you, man! Just cus you have nothing interesting to say doesn't mean I have to be some show monkey and carry a conversation I didn't even start. It just seems so shallow, especially coming from a someone I considered a friend for years. I think it's totally acceptable as a polite conversation starter with someone you're not familiar with, but when you're this close there's a lot of better ways to show interest. This didn't occur when we first started talking because we had mutual friends in a group chat, so we usually talked about our third-party opinions on that. After life hit us both, we both ghosted the group chat and our conversations slowly devolved into annoying check ups every couple of hours. \n\nBut like, even when I did talk about something in my life he would shut it down. Like I said, he was a jokester but he did not get the hint when someone didn't find it funny. He even got mad at me for saying \"lol\" instead of my usual \"LOL\", and asked me if something with wrong in MY life. Oof. If he was actually funny I would laugh, I was tryna hint that it's not good and please stop. I don't know why he acts entitled to my reactions. So it would end the conversation, because I didn't feel like divulging more details if he was gonna keep making offensive jokes like that. Previously, I thought he was funny because in a group chat setting, roasting people were more appropriate. When it's a one-on-one conversation that you've started, I feel disrespected when all you have to say in response is how dumb I am to not have included an obvious pun in a sentence or whatever. I've also brought it up to him a couple of times, he apologizes, but then continues to do it. I felt bad because that's kind of his personality, and maybe someone else can appreciate his sense of humor. Who am I to change his entire personality just to suit me? \n\nThe worst part is the guilt tripping. I always responded even though I found it annoying because I knew he cared about me, and that's why he messaged so often. Unfortunately, I'm not a clingy person to begin with, so this was really not up my alley. However, I was so overly conscious about his efforts that I held back my initial feelings. I felt appreciative because he made it clear to me that he valued me a lot. I mean, how could I possibly tell someone they were annoying, when I know they have good intentions? I thought maybe if I kicked this under the rug, I'd truly come around and be the person he wanted. Someone who would reciprocate and cling back. But I couldn't fake it. \n\nI finally blew up. It began with me telling him I needed space from him, to focus on my school work. He called bs, saying that I wasn't caring about him for a long time now (huh, so he actually did get the hints but never changed) and he never did anything wrong. I couldn't really pinpoint one big \"thing\" that he did wrong either, it was just a bunch of little habits he had that just built up. Since I couldn't really justify it myself in a neat explanation, I wanted to avoid pointing fingers at him and blamed myself. But that didn't work, so I began telling him all the reasons above. He kept saying \"Nah, something changed with you\", and cut me off the whole time, which really sealed my opinion that he wasn't going to listen. I blocked him on everything I could think of, and only when he realized that did he say sorry. I don't want his apologies though, I'm just simply sick of him. I guess friendships really do drift apart. \n\nThese seem like little things when I list them aloud but they honestly just killed our conversations. I could feel resentment building up every time he messages me, which sucks so much. Friends are supposed to be fun to be with. So, could I have handled the situation better? Am I the asshole? \n",

      "description": "I've been dating my BF for about a year and a half - dating, not living together or engaged. A couple of months in, he had car trouble and I, knowing he was struggling a bit, offered him a $600 loan to get it fixed on the condition he pay me SOMETHING every month, ten or twenty or thirty dollars.  He gladly accepted. I knew it would take a long time to get paid back, but I was fine with that.  I'm doing ok for myself; not wealthy but ok.\n\nA couple of months went by and he never mentioned it. I finally said, hey - remember that loan? He gave me $60 and complained a couple of times that he was broke because he gave me that money.  He never spoke of the loan again after that.\n\nAs time went on, I realized how truly broke he was; literally living paycheck to paycheck, on the edge.  I feel like he misrepresented to me HOW broke he was when I loaned him the money. I might still have given it to him knowing I wouldn't get paid back, **but I would have done it with all the information.** \n\nFast forward,  I am now planning to sell my 12-yr-old vehicle and buy a newer used car. I plan to sell the old one and use the money towards the newer car. He mentioned that he could use my old one as it's still newer than his.  I don't want to give it to him.  I'm sort of ok with not getting my money back for the loan, it won't damage me, but the fact that he just continued to pretend it never happened hurts.  And I can get a slightly better car with what I can get selling the old one.\n\n(He could have repaid it on other ways, helping me with work around the house or whatever)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

Its 4am and everyone is asleep. Some on the floor and couch, one in our king bed. But the cousin's bf is still awake. \n\nThe bf starts talking about how hes gonna set up an air mattress and comments about how its loud but they brought it so they should use it. The cousin is fast asleep and murmurs a \"what? ill sleep where you sleep.\" and falls back asleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis thing is gonna be loud, everyone is asleep and we have a puppy in a kennel asleep in the living room as well. Our walls are not that great cause its an apartment. So I tell him something like \"man just sleep on the floor, everyone else is and that thing is gonna be loud.\" He insists to use it, so I offer my bed to him. But he says no. I repeat, go sleep on the bed and start listing off reasons not to inflate the air mattress. \n\nAfter going back and forth for a few minutes he just starts inflating the mattress and its loud as fuck and lasts a while. Our guests wake up and have to move so this beast can take up like half the floor for 2 of them to sleep on. I know the cousin personally and she was 100% asleep and was happy on the floor sleeping with the other guests. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get up after its inflated and because im a passive aggressive fuck who cant just speak his mind I yell, \"well, now that everyone one is awake and our neighbors are awake you can sleep in your fucking bed.\" I was pissed and everyone heard but I just got up and went to my bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe just ignored it and in the morning they left. Our neighbors probably didnt hear and our dog was fine but that shit was loud. Our guests talked among each other and played it off like I was just grumpy but I am pissed still. I'm not gonna go on a rampage but im not having that dude over again without an apology. Even if the reasons I had weren't valid, he disrespected me after I offered my bed to him while id sleep on the floor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't know, maybe its all not a big deal and I shoulda just let the dude get comfy.

      "description": "\nI met somebody on a dating app about a week and a half ago who I thought I had a decent rapport with and had quite a bit in common with. Monday of last week we had established a date for that Friday evening. We continued to chat throughout the week and it seemed to me that, for internet stranger online dating standards, we were getting along extraordinarily well.\n\nThe day of the date, i asked if she was still on for that night, and the response I received was essentially “actually I’m out of town, my roommates mom has a medical emergency and I left to help them out” to which I replied that I hoped she got better and left it at that. \n\nWhile I fully acknowledge that her reason for canceling was totally legitimate, i walked away bothered for a few reasons\n\n1. no apology for the last minute cancelling of the pre established plan\n2. No immediate effort to reschedule, which I’ve always understood to be the responsibility of the person doing the cancelling rather than the person being cancelled upon (is that even a phrase?)\n3. The fact that at some point over the course of us chatting she knew that she would have to cancel to help with her roommates mom and wasn’t immediately forthcoming with the information. In fairness to her, contextually it seemed like a last minute emergency, but again the onus of responsibility should on the person doing the canceling to communicate that as soon as they reasonably can.\n4. The phrasing “I’m actually out of town” seemed incredibly blasé to me\n\nI hadn’t received a reply after wishing her a recovery by the end of the day, which led me to believe that I had been blown off and that I wouldn’t be hearing from her again. Mildly frustrating, but not the biggest deal in the world. \n\nAfter two days, she replied and asked me that Monday if I’d want to meet up with her and I told her that I was no longer interested in meeting up. I made it crystal clear that it wasn’t the fact that she had to cancel that bothered me but the cavalier manner in which she cancelled that bothered me. \n\nBefore I made the decision to say that, I considered if maybe I was overanalyzing things, and I ultimately came to the conclusion that if I had cancelled plans in that matter with a friend or a date or whoever that that person would have every right to be frustrated with me, so I had the right to be frustrated with her. She then unmatched me.\n\nI was fairly convinced that I had done the right thing and that I was correct in feeling bothered, but when talking it through with my friends the opinion is kind of split. There’s some that agree with me that I was justified in calling it off and others that think i burned the bridge too early and that I should have been more forgiving due to the circumstances of her cancelling. Naturally, I’ve been overthinking it all day.\n\nwhat do you think Reddit? AITA?\n\n\n",

I don’t know, I could clean more, and I do not feel it is her sole job in life to be the “maid”. Usually what runs through my mind is that she lays around, and watches tv all day, like it’s some kind of vacation. I literally work my ass off, and I make sure she is able to stay home for the kids.\n\nAm I selfish for thinking we should take advantage of the time she has, and clean? Am I the asshole for thinking this way??",

      "description": "BACKSTORY:\nThis issue is between my housemate and I; let’s call her Mary. We’ve lived together for a bit over a year and when I first moved in we became best friends immediately. However with that closeness came disparity and we’ve had a few arguments since then. I’ve never had this kind of dynamic with any friend or housemate before, and the first time we fought was a shock to me. \n\nThis particular incident has some backstory that informs my feelings and reaction. A few months ago we had a fight after Mary accidentally got the impression that I showered twice a day every day. She told me that I shouldn't; I said that I didn't except in special cases, but \"also hygiene is a really personal thing and on really sweaty summer days I might shower twice, and I don’t think that’s unusual or a bad habit.\" She didn't take this well, citing how much water one shower uses and \"to be asked not to take 2 showers a day in a share house is a reasonable request. What’s not reasonable is how self-righteous you are about it and how you’re trying to infer that your hygiene is being policed. Please don’t manipulate the conversation this way ever again, I don’t take lightly to manipulation whether it’s conscious or not.\" These were literally her words in the message she sent me.\n\nI was actually really hurt by her reply. I’ve tried to take the criticism in stride and work on being less defensive and more clear in my communication. As a result of this conversation I have been extra careful to never shower twice a day unless I have a good reason.\n\nNOW: \nI work night shifts and on this night got home around 10.30pm. While at work I had started to feel itchy and even after leaving the office it didn’t go away. While Mary and our other housemate John watched a movie, I laid in bed feeling itchy, depressed (for other reasons), and apathetic. After the movie John took a shower which gave me the idea to do so myself, as it might help my itchiness. \n\nMary often has to be up early (earlier than the rest of us) and has asked us not to make noise once she goes to bed on school nights (including not flushing the toilet or taking showers, as our pipes rattle hard). I respect this and do my best not to make noise on those nights. At this point however Mary was still pottering around in the kitchen. At 11.40 as I got into the shower I heard Q grumbling about us showering close to midnight. I was in and out of the shower within five minutes and went straight to be afterwards.\n\nThe next morning I woke up to these messages:\n\n&gt;HER: Hey showerinpeacepls quick question, why?\n&gt;You got home an hour ago and tomorrow is your day off: why now?\n\nThese messages made me really uncomfortable. I feel like a child being asked to explain myself to my mother, except that I’m 30. I want to tell her what I’m feeling but I'm not confident I can face her without being sure: am I the asshole?",

      "description": "To start off, I am in high school and I know a person who is 19 years old who is known to go after young girls around the rage of 13 and 14 and recently he was trying to date a 14 year old girl who is the ex of one of my friends. And a friend asked him what does he find in a 14 year old girl that he likes and he said \"I dont go for looks in girls I go for personality\". And we thought that was really funny because at 19 and 14 is a huge difference in mental maturity. So we tested this theory to see if he was a \"Pedophile\" by setting up a fake instagram posing as a 13 year old freshman girl named \"Alyssa\" who is new to the school, we make small talk with him for the first few days via direct messaging, and then one night at 10PM he wanted \"Alyssa\" to send him a video of her and because Alyssa is not a real girl we can not send a video so i decide to play it off saying i am trying to go to sleep and that i dont look good at the moment. And he replies saying \"Come on im sure you look gorgeous ❤\" and I replied no and he ends off the conversation by saying \"Goodnight Goofy ❤\" after a few days of talking to this 19 year old dude we decide its the day we put him to the real test. So at school in the morning we text him to come meet 13 year old \"Alyssa\" in the back of the school in the girl's bathroom and that \"Alyssa\" has something waiting for him in there 💦👅🍑🍆 using those emojis signifying that this \"Alyssa\" wants something from him. He then says he is coming so we are waiting for him nearby those bathrooms and the bell rings to go to class but we continue on anyway, we then see him show up outside of the girls bathroom waiting for \"Alyssa\" and then we decide to confront him i tell him \"Oh so you have science 1st period?\" (Thats the hall we are in which is not really where his 1st period class is supposed to be) and he says \"Yeah\" and then i say to him \"Dude what are you doing shes 13\" and hes like \"this girl told me to come over here idk\" and im like \"wtf are you doing back here coming to meet a 13 year old girl?\" And he's like \"nothing i thought it was funny\" and I said \"You know im \"Alyssa\" right?\" And he puts on a fake smile and i say \"You wouldve done something to this girl\" and he says \"no i would have not\" and i said than what buisness do you have back here? He then kept on replying \"i wouldnt have done anything with that girl\" and that was his only argument. I than said \"Your a pedo dude\" \"What business would a 19 year old adult possibly have with a 13 year olf girl\" and then he just angrily walks away. \n\nTLDR: Posed as a 13yo girl on Instagram to see if a 19 year old dude would try something on her, I lured him to the girls bathroom and confronted him telling him that hes a pedo.\n\nI would like to make out these points\n*He's 19 and talking to a 13 year old girl\n*Hes sending a 13yo girl heart and kiss emojis\n*He asks a 13yo girl to send a vid of herself at 10PM\n*He knows a 13 year old wants sex from him and goes to meet her privately at the back of the school outside of the girls bathroom.\n*He has made no other argument than saying he wouldnt have done anything to a 13 year old girl.",

      "description": "A couple of years ago I became part of a preexisting friend group of around 10 mixed men and women, They'd all already been friends for years at this point, So they had multiple inside jokes already when I was first starting to get to know them.\nOne of their inside jokes was that a particular friend, Lets call her Jane, is a racist, I actually don't know where this came from, But I can tell you with 100% certainly that Jane isn't racist, which is what makes the joke, you know funny. \nNow I want to make it clear when we say these jokes I wouldn't say we actually say racist things, There's definitely zero slurs of any kind, it's more ribbing Jane based on things she does, Like if we were playing chess and she chose to play white, We all be like \"Of course you picked white Jane, There's nothing wrong with the black pieces!\" \nIt's all really tame stuff like that and always in private.\nJane dislikes it no more than every one else dislikes their own inside joke (Mine is that I sleep with prostitutes) In our friends group if you're nice to someone it means you don't like them much.\nA while ago we got a new girl in the Group, Kitty, who is far more SJW/Pc than the rest of us, and while she can be fun to hang out with, she can also be exhausting at times.\nSo recently Kitty has developed a problem with these jokes and wants the rest of us to stop saying them, a few of the group are worried if they keep saying them Kitty will brand them as a genuine racist, But a me and a couple others are unwilling to stop something harmless over one person developing a problem with it, as when Kitty first started hanging out with us, these jokes were just as rife as they are now if not more. \n\nSo are we the assholes if we keep the joke going?

      "description": "Hey there, throwaway account for obvious reasons...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a couple months ago, maybe 5 or 6, I met.. let's call him Vick? I met Vick online through a mutual friend, and he was funny, and charming, and we hit it off super well. Fast forward a couple weeks, we've been spending more time together talking, watching movies, texting each other every day, things like that, and at this point I'm pretty sure he's flirting with me. He's honestly pretty fun, so I end up flirting back. Eventually, one thing leads to another... we end up sexting, phone sexing, whatever you wanna call it. It just kinda sorta happened?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this goes on for a while, and we're getting closer, and we keep doing this, and sure, it's fun, but honestly? I didn't really know what to think of it. I mean, here's this funny, charming, down-to-earth guy that's cute as heck, and is great company, and is checking literally every single box on my \"hypothetical perfect man\" checklist, and he might just be into me, too? So, one night, I ask him the question that you're *supposed* to ask in my situation. \"Just what are we?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd he doesn't know, either. But he's okay with just \"letting things happen and seeing where they lead\", if I am too, and that \"if we enjoy each other's company in the here and now, that's what matters in the end, right?\". So, y'know, I took that to mean that, hey, there's a chance it could be more, somewhere down the road. Looking back, maybe that was silly of me, but hey, they say love is blind for a reason, I guess. But yeah. We keep this up, and we grow closer, not just romantically but as friends, too, and I'm falling harder and harder for him all the while. I'm the kind of girl that has a hard time separating physical intimacy from emotional intimacy; I know that about myself, I'm mindful of it, and at the time, if I didn't think we had a real chance of turning into something *real*, I'd've probably stopped doing things with Vick a while ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut y'know, all good things come to an end and all that. We're talking one night, and it comes out that, while he likes me, at this point in time he's not really wanting any sort of actual relationship, or the responsibility that comes with one. And that he felt this way even way back when, when I asked him if we had any chance together. He didn't say so at the time because he wanted to try, and maybe he could manage it sometime down the road in the future, but apparently right now, it just wasn't working. But we could keep doing what we've been doing and still be FWBs, right? If that's something I wanted? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I just didn't know what to say. I.. I'm not crazy, I wasn't planning our marriage or picking out names for our children or anything. But I had fallen for him, hard. Harder than I had ever fallen for someone before, if I'm being completely honest. And so, I'm not entirely proud to say it... but I stuck around. I figured that having him around as a kind of LDR FWB would be better than not having him around at all, and I mean, I was still enjoying our time together as friends too, even if now I knew it wasn't going anywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that was months ago, and nothing's changed. If anything, it's gotten worse. I should have just turned him down and walked away, because I'm pretty sure I well and truly love him, now. And a part of me just keeps saying that if I stick around long enough, maybe he'll be \"ready\" for a relationship, even as the rest of me screams about how dumb and awful an idea it is to hold out hope like that, and that for both of our sakes, I should just ghost him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?

      "description": "Background: I don't know how many folks have seen it or heard about it, though I know the video is near the top if r/all but Ben Watson made a video about the rampant softcore pedophilia on YouTube. If you haven't seen it, it's fucking disgusting what is happening.\n\nAnyway, I saw the video yesterday evening.  I usually get on my playstation at night and game with some friends from high school and college. I brought up the video and asked my friends if they had heard about it.  They had not.\n\nI wasn't surprised because I feel like I am relatively well informed and had just learned of it. (Admittedly, I had seen it on the front page like a week ago, but just got around to viewing.)\n\nSo I bring this up to my friends and one in particular begins to react in a contrarian way.  I'm not gonna be able to remember verbatim what was sad but my friend asked what I was going to do about it and questioned whether or not it was important since there are so many terrible things that happen every day.\n\n I found this response rather surprising and noted that I was merely hoping to inform them about something that I didn't know and felt that in the moment the only thing I could do was raise awareness about this thing that I just learned about.\n\nThe conversation got caustic and the responses that I kept getting were dismissive and questioning why I thought this was such a big deal.\n\n The question that really got to me was him asking me \"what are you going to do about it?\" \n\nMore backstory: I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse.  I've dealt with it and moved past it but hearing him ask that question made me feel like I was doing something wrong by even bringing it up and that I'm not doing enough to fight back against childhood sexual abuse and pedophilia when in reality sometimes just getting by day-to-day is all I'm able to do.\n\nAm I the asshole for not doing enough to combat pedophilia by wanting to raise awareness. Obviously I know there is more to do, volunteering, dedicating my life to stopping it, but in that moment all I felt like I could do was talk about it and my friend made it sound like I was not being a good person because I was bringing up a problem without also having a solution for it.\n\nSo, AITA? If I am, I'm really sorry, I just wanted to talk about something that I thought was important.",

      "description": "So we have been dating for half a year, it has been rocky since she would break up with me for the slightest thing, only to come back to me within the hour. For example she didn't like my friend by the way he talks to girls, and since it says a lot about people by who they hang out with (I lived in a new country so didn't have much choice in friends who spoke English). But since she has feelings for me she came back within 20 minutes. I just think its her being insecure.  \n\nFlash forward months, I'm back in Europe and she's in America studying. It's going ok, we call and play steam together when we have time, I'm just building my career to be able to fund regular visits and she's studying. One morning (her night) I get her calling me super early, I think it's an emergency and answer. She's in tears saying she got raped, I'm in shock, speechless. She says she's going to have a shower and asks if I'll leave her, I say no but I need the full story once you shower.  \n\nI sneak to the kitchen to get a coffee to wake myself, to try and wrap my head around what could've happened. She responds and she's crying and saying she's vomiting etc.  \n\nNow I've never been in this situation, so I'm calming her down saying I'm here, I ask if was there condoms. She flips saying she doesn't know and how could I ask such a thing. Now this weirded me out, I was only asking in case she needs to see a doctor, if I need to PayPal cash for the doctor etc.  \n\nSo I tell her to tell me the whole story, the story is a few days ago someone screenshotted an email she left open when she went to the library. And then used it to blackmail her into sex or they email the university, she decides to go and sleep with him. Now I am speechless, firstly I think it isn't \"rape\" (my friends later on tell me it is), but we called daily in those times where she was blackmailed and not a peep, she says because she didn't want to be a bother.  \n\nShe sleeps and my mind is a mess, I message my friends who have been victims of rape and god knows who else just for advice. She then calls me in my evening, where I spent all day thinking of everything you can think of, she is crying and asks if I am still with her. I said only if you let me support you and we consider transferring to Europe so I can be closer.  \n\nShe then says it was all a prank, her friends told her to do it and it was funny. I was speechless and hung up, she expected me to be relieved but I felt nothing but rage. I haven't felt so betrayed, I ignored her for an hour and ask if the whole thing was a lie, the rape, the blackmail. Yes it was, I said \"You know I probably thought you were cheating and made it up to cover your tracks, is that what actually happened?\" And she was in shock, how dare I, her boyfriend, acouse her of being disloyal. I apologise but even months from now she brings it up to say I had doubts.  \n\nI soon found out the friends was a lie, she did it to see my reaction, if I would stay with her, but she says I should feel bad for telling she's probably a cheat.

      "description": "Ok, this might seem kinda insignificant but it drives me crazy. I'm 18 years old and throughout my entire life i've always been the person everyone comes to to ask for a favour, when i was little my siblings did it but even then i could understand why they would since i am the youngest and it seemed like a way to bother me more than anything. My mom was also like that, she would ask me to clean the house, my brother's mess, do the dishes, go to do groceries with her, etc. I felt sorry for her as she came late from work and i could see she was hesitant to ask my older sister for help cause she has a terrible attitute and my older brother is \"disorganized\" so she couldn't trust him with these things. I mentioned to her many times that she should teach my brother to look after himself, that being messy isnt an excuse cause im also extremely messy. She would get mad and become very passive agressive when i pointed these things out, saying that she was taking care of us all on her own and she needed help, that i was being selfish, and i always gave in. My mom died two years ago and now im living with my aunt and my brother, and the same situation happens. The excuse now is that she's old, she has knee pains, it's too hot, im tired,etc, and says the same thing about my brother and how \"easier\" it is to talk to me (lies, i barely speak in our conversations cause she never shuts up). Now, i usually give in too, but from time to time i bring up the same arguments. I'm tired too, i have very harsh migraines that make me dizzy and prevent me from doing certain things, but that doesn't seem like a valid reason for not wanting to do stuff. So, am i the asshole for not wanting to help all the time, or am i allowed to not want to do something for others?",

      "description": "Hi,\n\nSo this story is mostly done from email as the seller only put his email address as a point of contact on Craiglist. The seller will be S and I am Me. \n\n/Wednesday/\nSeller posts on Craiglist that they are having a huge moving sale. On the listing I noticed it said a Nintendo Switch with 2 games for 200.00 dollars. I didn't think I would have a shot but since I got the Craiglist app I noticed the time of post was just an hour ago so I make contact.\nMe: is the switch still available?\nSeller: Yeah sure is. If you want it you will have to come to ____ station.\nMe: okay cool. That is a hour away from my station but I can do it. What day works best with you?\nSeller: Next weekend works great for me.\nMe: Alright cool, my kakao ID is ***** just message me a exact time and date when you can.\n\n/24 hours past/\n\n/Thursday/ I got no message on kakao from the seller so I emailed at 11am  asking if they wanted to meet that day. I gave this option as my job is only 30 min from their station and would make more sense for me. I would be ok with any answer as I had the money but I was excited to finally own a switch. I leave work to find that i got no replay.\n\nEmails total: 4\n\n/Friday/ i felt odd to have been ghosted by a seller so i decide to try a different approach. I emailed the seller again from my alternate email address. Asking again for the switch and when could I purchase it. \n\nSeller: Sorry it is sold.\nMe: Yes I know but when can I get it.\nSeller does not reply to the email anymore.\nI go to my original email address asking is our deal still on as I do not want to ride a subway 1 hour out just to get nothing. \n\nEmails total: 7\n\n/Saturday/ I am getting pretty fusterated and send another email, this time in a new message (so no chain) asking if another item he had in the original post was still for sale. This caught a fast reply (mind you my original email has yet to get a reply since the first conversation)\n\nSeller: Yes they are still for sale \nMe: I wanted to ask you to bring them with the switch.\nSeller: Sorry the switch is sold.\nThis literally now has me confused.\nMe: I am sorry? I asked to buy the switch and I never got it. How can it be sold?\nSelller: oh it was first come first served and I sold it to someone who forwarded me the money.\n\nNow i am fuming. He mentioned non of this in his original post which I am showing here. So I am legit getting heated from the nerve of him not only going silent on me but not keeping his word.\n\nMe: You did not even mention that as a option. I had the money and YOU picked the date. This is bullshit on your part as you never updated me. I even asked to come to your station the following day to do the purchase yet you chose to ignore me. Fuck you.\n\nNow i wanted to know if I should be as angry as I currently am. It is just rude to me that the seller ghosted, sold to someone else and did not update to tell me that he sold to someone else until I ask him to bring it with another item. The worst part was that all me emails had a auto footer with my name so he could have told me the truth at anytime.\n\n&lt;Since I can't post photo I will instead copy and paste the ad without the full list of items for sale.\n\n\nMoving sale\n\nHere is the list of things I want to get rid of. I am willing to negotiate and make a good deal to buyer. Please email me and we can work it out! I am leaving feb 26 so let's get it done before then!\n\n1. No brand TV 50\" &gt;",

      "title": "AITA For getting angry at my dad for criticizing my parenting?",
      "description": "A bit of context, my dad is in his mid 60's so grew up in a very 'traditional' home. He had plenty of kids and i'm the youngest at 21, me and my partner, lets call her P decided to start our family at an early age and our perfect daughter was born in late October, we'll call her B.\n\nMy dad currently has around 15 Grandchildren so he is definitely not new to this, 14 of which are from marriages before he married my mother, my daughter is my mum's first grandchild.\n\nNow my mum hasn't been very well recently (nothing contagious) so we went to visit them at the weekend. My dad spent most of the day criticizing how me and P choose to raise B, its nothing crazy, we just don't agree with the 'cry it out' method when she goes to sleep. Instead we only rock her for 5-10 minutes, when B starts to drift off, we put her down and most of the time she soothes herself to sleep. If B wakes back up and starts crying, we rock her again and repeat until she sleeps.\n\nNow this seems to really anger my dad, he constantly tells us that B will never be independent if we keep doing that, and how we just need to let her cry. I've explained to him plenty of times that times have changed, we're happy doing it this way and B sleeps as well as you can expect a baby too. Let's be honest, no first time parent has it all figured out and you learn as you go along.\n\nB also hates going in the car, (I'm well aware most babies love it, but B just cries from when we put her in the car, until the moment we get out) so either myself or P will be in the backseat with B, in an attempt to calm her down and let her know she is safe.\n\nAgain, my dad says we should just leave her and let her cry it out, how we're doing it wrong and how me and my siblings were left to cry and we turned out fine. \n\nThis has been going on since B was born and most of the time I ignore it, or come back with a sarcastic response like \"opinions are like an A-hole, every one has one, but I really don't want to hear about yours\" I finally lost my temper at the weekend, telling my dad to fuck off and to leave us to raise B however we want. He gives the usual response telling me to calm down, how he's 'trying to help' how he's only 'giving his opinion' and how 'this generation gets offended if someone disagrees with them'. We left promptly and I have spoken to him since.\n\nAny parent will agree that unsolicited 'advice' is frustrating, and I've calmly asked him to stop countless times but he doesn't listen. My mum says that he's just stubborn and set in his ways and I should just ignore him, but its hard to ignore someone criticizing your parenting, especially when you're stressed and sleep deprived, should I have just let it slide or am I right here?",

      "description": "Mobile, sorry for the formatting issues.\n\nI have a dollhouse bed, and it’s a bunk bed. I exclusively sleep on the bottom nowadays, and I got it when I was younger because I really wanted a dollhouse bed. \nI have a 4 yo niece who comes over just about every week. I do not really like children and I’m not the one who says I’ll watch over her, my mom does. But I live with my mom, so I have to be around her every week. \nmy mom spoils her rotten. Every time she goes shopping, online or not, she always sees something and says “This would be perfect for *my nieces name*!” Or just gets her something. When my niece wants something, my mom will almost every time get it for her. \nSo whatever, the typical grandparent who loves her granddaughter. (My mom isn’t very old though, late forties.) But we go back to my dollhouse.\nMy niece LOVES it. She used to crawl into the bottom bunk all the time and when she would spend the night or nap here, she would always want to sleep in my room for the dollhouse bed. I didn’t want that though, I don’t like having a child in my room at night because I usually stay up late and I would honestly not like to jack off around a child, and during the day , this means I can’t really be in my room to do stuff and I would take it somewhere else, and I feel most convenient and comfortable in my bed and desk. \nMy sister needed my niece to be watched one day, and my parents weren’t going to be home, so she paid me to watch over her. Cool. I did everything good and I was going to put her to bed when she starts begging to sleep in the dollhouse bed. I decided to cave in, but when I put her there, she kept asking to get up for the restroom, she forgot her milk, etc, etc, etc, until it was obvious she just didn’t want to go to bed. I got really frustrated and I had to put her to sleep somewhere else. After this, I really didn’t trust her to actually sleep in it. \nRecently, when she comes over and wants to nap in the dollhouse bed, i tell my mom i don’t want her to for the reasons I already said, plus I no longer trusted her to actually sleep there. So I always managed to not have her sleep there. But when I leave the house when she’s with my mom, I almost ALWAYS find her In my room, sleeping my bed. It’s even more frustrating  now because I have some bags from shopping where I was going to cut off tags or sort some art supplies I had just gotten, but now I can’t be in there because she’s napping and I have to wait. It’s even worse because my mom doesn’t ask me when I’m not home and just does it, so it’s always a surprise. I’ve told her not to multiple times and she keeps telling me that she’s ‘just a child’ and that she ‘really wants to sleep there’ and ‘she rarely comes over’ which is a LIE because she comes over WEEKLY. It’s also kinda frustrating that she talks more about my niece and how much she misses her over my other sister who is at college Who we actually rarely see.!\nAm I the asshole for not letting or not wanting her to sleep there, and for getting upset at my mom for ignoring my wishes?

I usually do go out with friends even during these periods, though I avoid all contact with this girl, I don't message her, I put her messages on mute or filter them, and don't approach her in public.\n\nA few weeks ago I was in this spot again, and even though she sat the next table over I didn't say a single word to her, I barely looked at her, though she was staring at me, wanting my attention. According to my friends, who paid attention, she basically looked ready to either kill me or start crying. \n\nOne of my friends went up and asked her how she felt, and she basically said it hurts, but that she's used to me ignoring her randomly and doesn't want to raise the issue with me. I asked her over a few days later, apologized, things got weird and then I did it again. I blanked her again and stopped writing. I feel shitty. Am I an asshole, and how big of one?",

      "description": "I know how terrible it sounds but just read.\n\nI’m 15 years old and I don’t get money often, I can’t get a job because of my age so my funds are always limited.\n\nI get larger amounts of money twice a year, my birthday and Christmas. This is because my family doesn’t always know what to get me so they give me money to spend on whatever I want. This system works good bc some of my family aren’t tech savvy so they can’t get things I want on amazon or an online site that doesn’t have a store near them.\n\nMy parents are divorced and have been for years, they both have a S/O and are well off. I spend each week with both 50/50. \n\nFor Christmas I got money as usual bought some things and now, I’m left with $80. I’ve been planning on attending a concert in March and I want to save my money for merch + ticket. I’ve never been to a concert and I’ve been planning this for awhile. \n\nBoth parents have said they’d give $50 for the ticket. And then I pay the rest. The ticket is going to be $120 so I pay for the $20 and use the $60 for a shirt. \n\nI need to save this money as I will not bet getting any more before the concert, so I plan on not spending a dime. \n\nMy moms birthday is coming up in early February. She is pushes me to save money for her birthdays and Christmas’s. When I get money for my birthday June, she’ll say “save it for my birthday”. To me this is ridiculous, this is my spending money for myself. And my father agrees. It would be different if I had a job and earned money but I don’t. My mom is very self centered and doesn’t understand I’m not made of money. She expects me to spend a lot of money on her that I don’t have. \n\nIf I don’t get her something I’ll probably not be allowed to go to the concert. \n\nAs much as I love my mom, i can’t spend that money and I can’t get her a present. AITA? ",

      "description": "Before Reading this post I know that academic dishonesty and plagiarism is the worst crime in the academic community. I was guilty for writing 2 History papers for her. I know that I’m not not innocent also. I take full responsibility of my actions.\n\nMy ex and I have known each other for many years. She and I have been hooking up for the past 2 years. She and I became official last July. Lots of red flags in our relationship and she was very controlling. I ignored all this because she’s very hot and I wanted to be with her for years. She goes away back to college at SUNY Albany in the end of August.  Because her family Financial situation(father in jail). I would support her giving her an average of 300 a week.I also wrote her 2 history papers for her. She was telling people at school also that she was single. I found out because I got her 250 dress for her formal I was supposed to go to with her and she sent me a Snapchat in the dress one night. When I asked her what’s up she told me not to worry about it. The next day she broke up with me saying she wanted to take things slow. Slowly after I find out about all the cheating she did . She also never wanted me to visit her at school saying she didn’t want me invading her life out there. I was very heartbroken and give her a bunch of chances to come clean and tell me that because we known each other since we were kids but she never did and she ghosted me from her life. \n\nI waited a few months because my family did not want me to tell the professor about the papers. But last week I was like fuck it I sent the school and the professor an email and the Google documents for the papers. Saying I wrote the papers and she did nothing basically. The Google documents has a feature known as version history where you can see everything at the date and time it was written. It shows me writing the entire paper with her making only small edits at the end or nothing. Later on the day that Professor got back to me. Saying that the history department takes these offenses very seriously. About a week later my ex girlfriends mother starts freaking out calling my parents saying she has a meeting with the school community standards. The next day she had the meeting and of course she tried to blame me Probably lied a lot about me at the meeting. Her mother says her  case with the school is pending(no idea what that means). I checked on the SUNY Albany website for academic integrity and plagiarism and it says the minimum penalty of caught for Academic integrity Misconduct is a one semester suspension and she will get a F in the class. But this wasn’t just copy and paste plagiarism she straight up had me write the papers for her and she did nothing. There still is a chance she can get out of this saying vindictive harassing ex boyfriend tried to get revenge. But I just want her to get expelled or at least suspended for a semester.   ",

      "description": "This might be a quite long, complicated, uninterresting adolescent story. I just put a big part of it in brackets, you don't have to read it to get the point, but I feel like it's less abrupt with these optionnal bits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout three years ago I told a girl I loved her, and was answered that she didn't love me. I reacted as I could, so I basically went crying, but within a few days, the situation got less awkward, and we kept being friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(**The next year was a bit complicated for me by the fact that she was in a class with all our common friends. So I just felt a lot lonelier that I would have wanted, but nobody's fault, right?  It was a bit hard, but I got through it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following year reversed the situation, and I got in the class with all of the friends, and she got the class where she was alone. Consequently, she had to make the moves not to be isolated, as I had to do. I took profit of that to get a closer friend to her, not only because I was in love, but because I felt like she would be alone otherwise, and most importantly, I just liked her personnality. Anyway, along with another friend of ours, we formed a small 3 people group inside the big group, and got a lot closer together. \n\nBy the mid-year, they two noticed that something bothered me: I was still in love with her, and just didn't want to tell her, in order to prevent her from being embarrassed or having to be nicer to me or anything. So I jut told her. And she said it was perfectly fine, she didn't minded about it and she just wanted me to find another girl to love in order to be happy.\n\nWe discussed about it a lot afterwards, because from this point, I just couldn't keep a sadness for me which was both irrationnal and easy to sort for her. She told me she was lesbian too, that prevented me from being jealous, but that's not the point at all. \n\nFrom there, she wore a big part of my sadness whenever I was sad, because she knew she could help me. It's been to the point she even accepted to hug me whenever I needed to, and I needed it on a daily basis, of course. But don't get me wrong, I didn't see it nor a way to satisfy any need of sensuality, nor as forcing. I mean, I saw that as a way to be happier on short term in order to be a happy person for my friends who, I felt, needed someone happy. And it wasn't forcing either, I just asked everytime for a discussion or a hug when I felt I could use it, and she just gave them to me, saying it wasn't making her incomfortable any time I asked, which was often.\n\nShe ended up telling me she couldn't stand the whole hug-thing anymore around 2 months after starting it. I acctepted to stop right away, a bit angry she lied to me all along, but now she was honest, so it was fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSummer came, and I started to feel really miserable, isolated for no reason etc. I started thinking about suicide too, mostly because of this one side love. I told a lot of friends about these dark ideas, but they would never really keep a long conversation I felt I needed. So I ended up talking to her, and she made me promise not to do \"anything stupid\", I promised.**)**\n\nIn the course of summer, we spent a week together(, all three of us). I took profit of a night where we were just two to tell her about how I felt, and I found something to replace the hugs: telling her why she was a great person to me. Naturally, like for the hugs, I asked her wether I could, wether it was useful etc... and she told me yes, so I just did that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis year, we are in the same class. And we sat next to each other. We were really close, and both happy, as far as I could tell. I did went to see a therapist, for I didn't want to tell her about my problems, but it seemed useless to me. One day, she just sent me a message to tell me not to compliment her ever again, or anything approaching. She wouldn't explain nor expected apologies or an answer. I got desparate for an hour. I felt this was a great way for me to get better, and was really bitter that she lied to me again. I couldn't really see how I was going to handle my despair now. I asked her to call me, just to help me getting through that harsh hour or so. She just said no. I thought that was fair, she had the right to say no, and I didn't want to force her. But, seeing how hard it was going to be, I felt like I would have to face the question of suicide before getting throught if completely/ I told her I took back the promess I had made. She must have felt bad about it and called me, crying. We spoke for like an hour and went to sleep. I was more or less ready to keep it all on me from now on as I had previously did.\n\nThe next day, she didn't show up in class. And I was called to the provisor's office in order to clarify with them what had happened the previous night. Her mother had complained about me, or was scared for both her daugther, who I was weighting upon, and for me, for being suicidal. \n\nThe next week, I discovered that 1) she wouldn't talk to me anymore (it's actually her parents who forbid her) 2) I had essentially lost all of our common friends, which went with her.  From this point, I was basically alone for a week. \n\nThere had been hollydays when we talked to each other for the first time again. It had been 3 weeks. I was thrilled with the fact that I could see my friends again, but now, something's different. I am out of most of the message groups, which turn out to be essential for the social life ouside of school. Yet, it's gradually getting better.\n\nQuestion is: Am I an asshole, taking profit, even without being aware of it, of the weakness of a friend to avoid going foward?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuick résumé: A girl that had rejected me accepted to hear me complain about how much I sufferred of our relation, but lied to me in order to handle more that she could. She ended up not wanting to handle everything anymore, and that made me talk to her about suicide, which shook her a lot.",

      "description": "I’m a [19] senior in college, my class has a giant project at the end of the year that’s worth nearly 50% of our grade. Luckily I was paired up with one of the best students in our class, I’ll refer to him as Sean. Sean transferred here on a basketball scholarship, but is still relatively lower class and took out huge loans to get through school. Our curriculum is very strenuous as well, we have around 25 - 50 pages of notes due every week. Because of this Sean only works part-time, because of the expensive rent he usually eats the cheapest meals such as McDonald’s or instant ramen. I decided to offer him a proposition, I’ll give him a $350 local grocery chain gift card in return for him doing my portion of the project. At first he was kind of hesitant, but said that it would be nice to eat some “real” food for once. So he agreed, I went home smoked some weed, made some dinner and posted a snapchat. Some of my classmates replied to my story with question marks or asking how I was able to be chilling during prime grind time. I told some, to which they replied I was an asshole for “taking advantage” of my poor classmate. I think this was strictly a business transaction where both sides benefit. Am I the asshole in this situation?",

On the way home he insisted that we got Taco Bell, so we successfully purchased $25 worth of tacos and made it home safely. As soon as we got home he was in the bathroom puking his guts out. Now I got him cleaned up and he is passed out in our bed. I really want to eat the Taco Bell, but I need to stay in the bedroom with him just in case he gets sick or whatever.

      "title": "AITA for invading my friend's fitness safe space?",
      "description": "I (26F) had shoulder surgery in December and have finally gotten the ok from my surgeon to resume normal activity. For the past three months I have not been allowed to run, use stationary bikes, ellipticals or lift more than 2-5 lbs. The recovery has been incredibly painful-- possibly the most painful thing I've ever had to work through. The whole thing has massively lowered my self-esteem. I used to be fit and happy with my body. Now, I'm several lbs heavier and just really frustrated with not being able to workout.\n\nIt's coming up on the one year mark since I injured my arm and all I want is to feel like I have some control over my body again. I decided that I wanted to try personal training so I can have someone there to check my form and help me find creative ways to push myself around my limitations. I feel like getting someone qualified to guide me is the safest way to get back in shape without compromising my shoulder's recovery.\n\nMy friend, Julie, goes to a gym she LOVES that is really close to my house. She's been going there for over a year. After texting her a question about the gym rates, she called to tell me she didn't think it'd be a good fit for me. She started out by telling me it was SUPER expensive and that it’s got limited equipment (it has great equipment), but eventually she just came out and said \"I don't want to be a bitch, but I just don't want to see you there.\" It’s a small facility and she feels like she's finally comfortable working out. She's struggled to be active her whole life and to find a place that really worked for her and this was it. It's clearly become her fitness safe space--and I get that. But then she got super condescending and wouldn't listen to me when I told her I didn't want to workout together, I just noticed their trainers had great accreditations. I tried to explain how hard  the past few months with my shoulder have been and that I really needed to find a trainer who knew what they were doing. She pretty much just ignored me and told me to try LA Fitness or anywhere else.\n\nIts been a week and I finally had time to go through and contact 16 different gyms in my area. Julie's gym is tied for the cheapest prices with one other facility. (Depending on the number of sessions I purchased, hers would be the cheaper of the two by $5/session). I texted her to let her know this -- including the names of all the facilities I contacted to show I made an effort (I also made a list of all the prices), but I haven't set up meetings to go talk to trainers at either gym yet (I intend to speak to both). She has yet to text me back and I have a feeling that she's pissed. I kind of wish that there were more options available, but I'm also a broke student and unfortunately her gym actually is really fairly priced with supposedly excellent coaches.\n\nAITA if I decide to set up personal training sessions at her gym after she told me she wasn't okay with it? \n",

Timmy says, \"What's that?\" I reply with, \"It's a ham sandwich, you never had it before?\" I don't remember what Timmy said back but Timmy's friend who we will call Anna replies and says, \"We just wanna know.\" After lunch, my teacher talks to me and says that I said \"It's a ham sandwich, you never had it before?\" to Timmy and Anna. The teacher basically says that it came off rude. Now, keep in mind I didn't say it in a rude way like a bully. The teacher also said I should apologize. I kinda cried but I sucked it up. I really didn't want to apologize because I did not believe they deserve a apology, but the teacher was there so I had to do it. That's how the story ends ladies and gentlemen. I know it sounds ridiculous because this story is just about a freaking ham sandwich. But I hope you enjoyed the story.",

      "description": "I'm an 18 year old who's going to college later this year, is trying to have good grades, make some money, and still try and have a social life. So I'm almost always stressed out, and lately have become (overly) emotional over things. I live with a lot of people and that includes my oldest brother, my Sister in Law (SiL for short), my 2 nieces, and my nephew. Now I love my nieces and nephew, but I really don't like babysitting as it just adds a whole new layer of stress on me and the kids can be little hell spawn sometimes. For personal issues about myself I often feel like I can't say 'no' so anybody, so I almost always agree to babysit unless I honestly have something to do.\n\nRight now I'm on my February vacation, and so far almost every single day they have asked me to babysit. Sometimes they pay me in food for something, but almost never in actual cash. Recently they have started to pay me for longer babysitting times (things like $20 for 4-5 hours) or whatever. But today I had an online DnD game, and I really wanted to play it because 1.) I love playing it with my online friends, and 2.) I had to miss my Tuesday session with my school friends so I could watch their kids.\n\nMy SiL comes into my room and asks if I would watch my nephew (my niece's where at SiL's family's house) so they could go drop my mom off at work and go get food. I tried to tell her that I have DnD, but she just said that my nephew is sleeping and walked away. Like I said before I have often feel like I cannot say no, so I just sit there.\n\nAbout an half an hour to an hour in our session, my nephew wakes up and the girls are home, and so is my dad. I tell him about what happened and that I just want to play my DnD game. He understands and takes the girls downstairs, while I sit in the living room with nephew because he's just quietly watching Blues Clues.\n\nBut it turns out my SiL's step dad was hearing the whole conversation with my dad, and goes home and tells this to my SiL's mom and I guess now they're arguing over it. My brother just told me that I don't have to watch the kids anymore, and my SiL comes in pissed at me because I told my dad and her step dad over heard it. I didn't even get a chance to explain myself and I just felt like shit to the point where I thought that everyone would be better off without me. Then later after I talked too some friends of mine, she started messaging me saying that she doesn't want me talking to my dad about her anymore.\n\nSo I just want to know, am I the asshole for telling my dad what happened and how I feel?",

      "description": "Im glad she put herself there actually instead of waiting till she needed an ambulance like last time.\n\nShes got liver disease (dont drink kids, screws you over later in life) after 20+ years of being a raging alcoholic. She thinks its only been 10 years (because thats any better) but when your 21 yr old daughters first memory of you is you holding a JD in one hand and a Long Beach ciggarette in the other (can recognise the brand by scent even after all these years) you start to wonder. Not to mention im starting to find out shed started to get into the heavier drugs when i was 3 (she left when i was 5).\n\nShes still drinking. Says theres no point trying anymore cause shes gonna die anyway (personally id rather die knowing i tried but if she wants to be miserable thats on her i guess).\n\nIts her liver. If she would give it the chance, itll recover, she is actually amazingly healthy for someone who refuses to see a doctor about anything.\n\nHemmoraghing blood? Ill just wear more pads (her actual response when this happened. A year later she got her uterus removed after 13 years of severe cramping daily)\n\nShe wants me to be supportive of her but i cant. She did this to herself. She is doing NOTHING to help herself, she thinks i should be proud shes trying to get better right now so we can all go to the zoo together but im not. Because i learned long ago to never get my hopes up with her. Forget everything she promises imediately after she makes the promise or youre gonna be dissapointed. \n\nI cant be proud of her i cant be supportive the most i can do is yell at her because i cant think of any other way to get through to her that shes only hurting everyone around her. But of course shes got my stepdad as her fucking echo chamber because hes the biggest pussy on the planet.\n\nShe wants to die. Shes using this as an excuse to die. Im not making that assumption this is what she actually told me.\n\nEver since we reconnected 5 years ago i have been her shoulder. Shes my mother, she has never EVER been an adult i could turn to and suddenly im expected to be the adult.\n\nFuck her.\n\nEven if i could get to the hospital easily i probably still wouldnt visit. Her first stint in there i did, and i had to deal with her icu delusion. (there was a mass shooting and a house in the ceiling according to mum (she was hallucinating), she also had bruises on her wrists that looked like shed had to be held down at one point) but i wont do that again.\n\nShes never done anything for me. She blames my brother for everything wrong in her life as if he ever asked to be born, but im the angel because i was the baby they wanted. We didnt even get fed as kids unless we were at dads house.\n\nThis isnt nearly the full story but its already longer than it needs to be so...\n\n......\n\nTLDR mums back in hospital for liver disease after 20+ years drinking, says she wants to die anyway.\n\nAITA for not really caring that shes dying.\n",

      "description": "I (17m) recently had a big fight with Dad about him forcing his religion on the entire family. I have been atheist for almost 2 years now, but I kept it a secret because both my parents are very religious. It wasn't a problem until recently when I started working part time (also a HS student).\n\nBefore I started working, I simply went to Mass since I would have the whole day to rest, go out in the afternoon, and get my schoolwork done. Now, I work weekend afternoons (I start at around 2) and mornings is when I get my schoolwork and volunteering done. I really cannot afford to lose 2 hours of my morning time, it really sets me back.\n\nI tried to tell them respectfully that I did not wish to attend Mass anymore, but they would not listen and still force me to go. I tried so many time, every Sunday for 2 months, that they have he right to believe what they want, but so do I. But nothing worked :(\n\nAnd then came this morning. I have a lot of schoolwork at the moment and I'm applying to this summer program across the country, so I have spent a lot of time on my application. I've been in the zone typing my essay for about an hour when my Dad walks into my room and tells me to get ready for Mass in 10 minutes. I tell him I don't want to go, he tells me he's not asking blah blah blah just like every Sunday. Finally he shouts at me (for the first time in our arguments, they had been somewhat civil in the past) and tells me he\"ll throw away my new computer, which I bought, with my money.\n\nI say nothing and don't move, he reaches for my laptop and I just snap. I move my computer away and just start screaming that I'm done with his BS and I how I really feel, that I haven't prayed once in 2 years and I just lose it. I then took my anger out on his beliefs. I point out the flaws, hypocrisy in the church, the molestation problem, the nonsense and homophobia and blah blah blah.\n\nLater he comes and tells me he's expects me to apologize to him or he'll take away all my electronics and that tomorrow he's taking me to confession to \"apologize\" to God.\n\nSo AITA for what I said? Did I take things too far? Should I apologize?",

      "title": "AITA- For wanting my girlfriend to be allowed to hang out in my dorm?",
      "description": "So my gf and I are in our second year of college. I’m a transfer student and she’s not so our dorms are different. Her room is a single 2 person bedroom with a shared bathroom. My dorm is more like an apartment, me and 3 other girls share a kitchen and living space and 2 bathrooms, but we each have our own bedrooms with full sized beds. Because of this my gf is more often over at my place. We’re both private people and we don’t go out much, just hanging out in my bedroom works best for us.\nOriginally I wanted to get to know my roommates so we would hang out in the common areas to try and socialize more, but my roommates told me that this made them uncomfortable because they felt like they invaded our “couple’s space” whatever that means. So now when she comes over we stay in my bedroom away from everyone else. We keep to ourselves, keep quiet, and clean up after ourselves if we do go into the kitchen or something. This has been working fine for 4 months or so now, or so I thought.\nWe just got back from winter break and my roommates called a meeting last night. Basically they don’t want my gf in the dorm AT ALL anymore. One girl even had her dad call the head of housing to talk about a restraining order. This is the first they have mentioned of not being happy with the situation and personally I feel attacked. I told them this is my room too and if I want my girlfriend in my bedroom then I’m going to have her there. They already banished her from the kitchen and living room, they’re not banning her from MY bedroom. \nThey are now threatening to go forward with the restraining order. Am I wrong here? Should I be paying more attention to what they want? I just feel like they don’t have a right to just decide without even really consulting me that my gf doesn’t belong in the dorm???",

      "description": "So I (F21) matched with this cute dude (M23) on a dating app and we kinda hit off. We spoke for a bit and decided to meet up, the first date was random but really cute. I found him quite good looking which is why I was quite fidgety throughout the date. He noticed but said he found it cute. At the end of the date, we just hugged and went out separate ways promising a second date. The second date was a few days later, we met for a quick lunch on a weekend. Quick because I had plans afterward. It was quite nice too and I walked him home before I went back to work. \n\nFinally comes the third date, I invited him for theatre (I knew he likes theatre but I really don't have any interest in it, didn't mind watching a show for him though) Unfortunately we missed the show but had a nice time exploring art galleries nearby. We went to grab a bite later and walked around for a bit. I dropped him off and went home. Once I reached home I saw his message saying we shouldn't see each other again because we didn't click the way he wanted us to. I was confused but totally cool with it. Then I noticed that he has blocked me on Instagram? I thought about and maybe it was the fact that I didn't make a move? Quite honestly, I had a terrible cold on the third date and hence didn't \"lean in\" But it is the blocking part that caught me off-guard. Is that normal or am I weird to think that it is an immature thing to do?\n\nBut AITA here for not making the move which is why I was blocked?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I will try to keep it short while getting the full story. Married about 9 years to only woman I ever loved. 3 years ago she complained that I was no longer affectionate to her and never was really romantic. I didn't desagree and tried to make improvements but we would get into a cycle of me being really affectionate for a few weeks or months and then it tapers of and she gets upset and I say sorry and start again etc etc.\n\nI am a pretty reserved guy so I know I don't consciously mean to show less affection but I believe her when she says I do. Fyi this does not mean I ignore her i think it is more the compliments on looks and sensuality towards her that becomes an issue.\n\nSo 2 years ago I found that she cheated on me once with a random guy. I threaten to leave she begs me to stay and we get marriage counseling. We do this for about 1.5 years and I really see that she wants to be with me and after many months of counseling we start to groove really well and it's great. Then seemingly about 5 months ago she says she cant do it and doesn't feel any romantic love to me. She wants to try a separation, I say ok and we physically separate for 2 months. She then said that it is her issues that she needs to solve and no longer blames me and promises that she wants only me and that she will be more understanding.\n\nOk we get back together but I am really hurt and show little affection and have sex maybe once on the weekends but it is awkward and mechanical. But still i slowly open up and feel more comfortable and better, because she seems totally cool with me taking my time and letting me be me.  And she really shows lots of love and tenderness to me. But of course my affection is nothing near that which it was even before we had trouble together!\n\nAnd then last night she freaks out and asks me why I don't show more affection. More lusting after her, more sexy talk, more passion in foreplay, more of everything.  Like she really freaks out, even throwing things.\n\nShe has been very loving to me in the past months and on a friendship level we get along very well. But the intimacy is shattered in my view and I want her to be patient while I see the good in her instead of painful memories. AITA for taking this long?",

      "description": "Before I met my SO, him and his mother were extremely close to a very unhealthy extent. It was actual a cause of bad blood in his previous two relationships but I did not come to find that out until later. \n\nShe would go with him everywhere, to run errands, to dinner, like every single day. He wouldn’t go almost anywhere alone. She did his bills for him and at one point even paid them instead of telling him that he needed to get a job. She would kiss him, hug him and constantly say how handsome and he is in front of his friends and in front of superiors in his volunteer position which she also started volunteering at. He would call her to bitch about our relationship instead of actually coming and talking to me and  working on things. Of course she would tell him that he deserved better and I needed to ‘get my shit together’. I have seen some of the messages and said something and especially most recently heard her tell him that I AM not healthy for him. \n\nHe had a rude awaking this past year and I told him boundaries needed to be applied and I was done being in a relationship between him and his mother. He tried to set boundaries and she acted like he was trying to kill her. It was ridiculous and pathetic, she turned to me to try to talk sh*t instead of just going to him to say how she felt. He asked her to go to counseling and she used the whole 2 sessions to make her therapist believe that he was bipolar (which is he far from) and refused to do a session with him so he could speak. \n\nFriday I went out of town to visit a sick family member. She messaged me about a house that we could all live in ( I think she was kidding, hopefully ) I played it off like a joke and I told her that I was out of town. Not even 5 minutes after she messaged him about going to lunch the next day or today. I am honestly pissed because I feel like she’s taking advantage of me being away to see my sick family member as a way to sneak back in and ‘fill me spot’ or ‘ take it back’ while I am not there. I don’t trust her and I am having a hard time trusting him because I feel like he’s starting to let the boundaries with her go to the way side. She even sent him a picture today with quotes about him always being her baby boy and super sappy love crap. Needles to say I flipped out on the situation and vented to him and told him to handle it. \n\nAm I the asshole? ",

I was forced to live it as a kid despite hating it and I grew up loathing it so much. My parents forced me to do so much Chinese ethnic stuff that it completely turned my mind off from my culture as an adult. \n\nBut I don’t fit with an American culture either. Because I was so silo’d into the Chinese culture, I never had American friends. Sure I was part of the culture growing up but never really had friends outside of Asians. And that’s okay, but it kinda put me in a position where I just don’t have an identifying culture. \n\nBut I’ve always been mesmerized by culture. Hawaiian culture is one of my favorites, for example. I see how they’re so family oriented and nature oriented and I wish I was a part of it. \n\nIt won’t happen any time soon but it’s always been a secret dream of mine to go and “become” Hawaiian or another similar culture. I know that sounds ridiculous and please don’t call this a shitpost because this is absolutely a serious concern for me. \n\nI see so many people saying how it’s fucking gross and disgusting how people pretend to be another culture and how appropriation is bad.

      "description": "Back in May of 2017 I had a friend who met someone and started dating them within a couple weeks. One month after that they got engaged. Their wedding was set for September. But the Bride to be, the “friend”, wanted it moved to the weekend of August 19. It took place in Boise, Idaho. She had invited me, but I had my own plans. Plans that was 10 years in the making and came to fruition two days later (August 21, 2017). The day of the solar eclipse. \n\nI live in Florida; the friendship was through social media. In 2007 I learned about the 2017 eclipse and made the promise I would go see it on the path of totality. I even became a truck driver just to have that opportunity. The plan was to fly to Springfield, Missouri and drive to St. Joseph. Weather wasn’t looking good for St. Joseph when I checked the day before, so I changed plans and drove overnight via rental car all the way to Kentucky. All of that succeeded. 10 year promise fulfilled. \n\nUntil the friend door slammed on me. She said I was invited to her wedding, and I was the one guest she wanted to come no matter what. She claimed to have moved the date so friends and family could see the eclipse on the same weekend as the wedding. I told her why I couldn’t come to Boise that weekend even if I wanted to: two months before the eclipse, airline flights, hotels, and rental cars were booked and unavailable in Boise, Salt Lake City, and Denver, not to mention any regional airport in the area. There was no possibility I could get there that weekend. This resulted in a HUGE fight since she thinks I was being selfish for choosing the eclipse over her wedding, saying “there will be more eclipses. I’m only getting married once!” So for months she would say to mutual friends I refused to attend her wedding because she didn’t mean anything to me, because I chose a selfish ambition instead of being there for a friend. Like if I’m not the one getting married, why does my presence mean so much? I sent her my blessings and well wishes, but i said she chose to have the wedding on the same weekend as the biggest celestial event in modern American history. She knew I had planned on seeing the eclipse for 10 years, 8 more years than how many I knew her. But apparently it was selfish of me to choose to see the eclipse from another state.\n\nSo our friendship ended because she thinks I was too selfish to skip her wedding. ",

      "description": "I  started working in a new office building and have noticed a pretty annoying (to me) trend in morning banter with the daily security guard.\n\nI'll preface this by saying it is a relatively small/new office building, so there are not that many people in and out yet, and thus interaction is a 100% certainty every morning. I am by no means an introvert so I don't mind morning pleasantries. I do however, get annoyed by dumb things.\n\nWhat annoys me in this situation is this security guard's affinity to EVERY MORNING mention what day it is and comment on it. For example:\n\nMonday - Ahhhhh. Mondays! How did we get here??? So far from Friday!!! \n\nTuesday - Well, another day closer but still very far. What a long week!!!\n\nWednesday - Happy Hump Day! We're turning the corner. Almost there!\n\nThursday - We're really close to Friday now, can you believe it?!!\n\nFriday - WE FINALLY MADE IT. How about that??? It's Friday!!!\n\nThis is the worst of the worst of useless office banter to me. I don't love work or my job, but I don't hate it enough to comment on how I want this week to end every day, without fail. I guess I feel like the asshole because this lady is super nice, but I find this annoying and I am about to break it to her.\n\nAlso she tends to always hold the door for me? Which was great when I moved in an my hands were full, but now I feel weird because I don't really need her to do that. \n\nBut hey, maybe I am the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL,DR\n\nSecurity guard comments on what day it is every morning, without fail, and it fucking annoys me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We talked beforehand about our likes and dislikes, and I told him that I don’t like sex to feel too gentle or passionate and that it makes me uncomfortable. I know it’s strange but I was in an abusive relationship before and I’ve found that when I have rough sex I can sort of let go and have fun but when it’s gentle and about connection I get all in my head and I get really uncomfortable and I hate it.\n\nLast night we were gearing up to have sex, and he said he wanted to have “normal” sex, and when I asked what he meant he started kissing my body a lot which I didn’t really like.  I told him I didn’t like it and he stopped but he kept trying to do cutesy things like playing with my hair and chaste kisses and stuff, and I got mad at him and told him to stop. I didn’t really say much I just put my clothes on and left.\n\nI haven’t answered his messages today. AITA?",

So i think deep down wants to get fitter, but just doesnt have the motivation.\n\nYet, when someone raises it up, he throws a tantrum and claims everyone is against him. \n\nSo will i be the asshole if i raise it up with him?

      "description": "My life long friend who I spend lots of time with and value more than most of my family, I've recently been having reoccurring thoughts plaguing me about me and their interactions.\n\nFirst of all, I feel our beliefs or maturity don't line up as of recently. One of my favourite things about our friendship is that I can talk to her about anything and everything and know even if she doesn't agree she will respect what I'm saying. However, as of recently, there are certain topics she avoids like the plague. Especially topics relating to reality.\n\nAs we are both studying discussions about what we will do after we finish our courses are bound to come up often. Which she is fine with, unless i give my opinion. I'm a pretty realistic person and I care about her a lot so I like to make things clear to her - especially with big decisions - factors she hasn't considered, I see it as being a good friend and have good intentions. To give an example say she said \" I want to be a forensic scientist because I like the idea of solving murders\" and I replied by making her aware that forensic scientist's find evidence on corpse's but are never involved in solving, and I doubt get to know much about the usually classified investigation. Her response to something like this would to be cover her ears, say something like \"ah, ah\" just so she cant here me, or she once literally said : \"let me live in my fantasy\". she also often goes quiet in group situations and glum and may even get teary eyed.\n\nShe means so much to me that her being upset, upsets me too, and I feel instantly guilty for unintentionally upsetting her. But I'm also worried, it can't be healthy to choose to live in a fantasy over important decisions like career? I often avoid commenting on topics I know she finds sensitive (there are others besides career) and let her just talk at me. But I don;t enjoy it. I feel like I'm changing my personality around the person I see as the one I'm normally the most comfortable with.\n\nShe often makes off hand comments about me being too negative, when what I'm saying, to me, I don't see as negative -just an observation. I don't complain a lot and I don't normally get bothered very easily unless something is repeated again and again. The comments she makes about me being negative she knows hurt me as I've expressed before that I sometimes can't enjoy things that other people love but love things that other people don't care about; making me concerned about whether my attitude to things is 'normal' or not. When I opened up to her about these things she reassured me that I'm a very creative thinker and everyone has different taste - some more than others. yet the comments on my negative self continue over things like; \"It might rain\" (which i dont think is super negative)\n\nAnother thing she does a lot that has been bothering me, is she gets annoyed or stressed about something and projects it on me. Like she will be stressed at a situation for about half an hour then when I talk to her she is much more irritated and also is more likely to fault me - she then later apologises for being that way. So she is aware about an hour later of her unfairness but she has done this so many times and increasingly often. So I am hearing the apologies again after having to walk on egg shells around her annoyed self knowing it's definitely not the last time that week that it will happen.\n\nIt's making me feel more distanced from her because I can't relate to her choices of ignoring reality and I feel I can't express what I want anymore.\n\nAm i an Asshole for being so judgemental? am i over thinking things or being over sensitive? I know talking to her is an option but I feel like it would be a personal attack on her and she would also want to keep living in her \"fantasy\".",

      "description": "My boyfriend \\[21\\] and I \\[20\\] have been together for nearly a year and a half, and I love him to pieces. We've always gotten along well with each other, but recently things have gotten rockier than usual. Throughout our entire relationship, he has had an issue with punctuality, often leading us to change plans or postpone things at my inconvenience. Since we first began dating, he has also had a sleep schedule much different than mine: he'd frequently go to bed at 3-4 am and wake up at noon, while I'd go to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am. I've found this understandable in the past, as he was in the process of applying to graduate school and was quite busy/stressed for several months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, it's been nearly a year since we've moved in together and, despite his schedule returning to normal, he now goes to bed at 6 am and wakes up at 2 pm. While before he was staying up to catch up with work, he now stays up to watch tv shows or play video games. This turns into a major inconvenience to me when he leaves the bedroom lights on until the early morning, making it difficult for me to fall asleep at night. I've spoken to him about this in the past, and he has agreed to turn off the lights and take his computer to a different room after midnight. However, for the last week, he's been back in the usual routine of going to bed at 6 and waking up at 2. Last night, he stayed up until 6 am talking loudly to a friend on the phone, causing me to lose several hours of sleep. After he was finally finished with his conversation, I had a brief talk with him about how I would like to move out if this continues. Once again, he has agreed to keep the lights off after midnight, but I don't know if I can take much more of this if it continues. I'm a university student and, in addition to classes, I work a part-time job, and I'm worried that if things don't change (as I suspect they won't), it is my future that will be affected. I can't stress how much he means to me, but I question if it is really worth continuing to date him if we only get to spend a 3-4 hours together each day (incl. weekends). AITA for wanting to break up with him over something as trivial as having a different lifestyle than me?",

      "description": "First, I am sorry for my English. Here is the short story, and there is a TL:DR at the end.\n\nI moved to a new country four years ago. The first two years were very hard - I worked sometimes three jobs at a time for low wages. During my second year I met my friend. He is am immigrant as well, but from a different country. I would hang out at his place every few months. I did not feel like were we friends at the time - our cultures are very different. He owned his own apartment and his girlfriend was over all the time and I did not know them well but they would fight alot and I would give him advice if he asked. She was a drinker and yelled so I told him he could do better so they broke up. That summer he traveled alot of holiday so he gave to me key to care for the place. \n\nYear three we became better friends. I got a single job and could come over more often. But I moved to a city away so it takes an hour to travel between my city and his city. He would feed me very often in his kitchen and when I started the new job gave me some of his old professional clothes. \n\nHe started dating another girl. She was nice but also drank alot and would talk to me flirting when me friend would leave us alone together. Still she was nice. It was so she would come over Thursday and leave Monday at his apartment. He did not like this much but I do not know if he told her as he told me. She ended up cheating on him - he found out when her family was visiting. There was much drama but I was away at work for a month and missed it. \n\nA few months later my brother died. My friend was away with work colleges but let me stay at his apartment so I could go to the airport. When I got back he let me stay at his place for a week when I was not working during that time because of bereavement. He started darting a few girls on and off - I do not know much at this time because I got a new job a did not visit for two months. I worked two jobs again, and I would come over afternoon on Saturday because of the bus table. I would either leave very late or the next day. I notice at this time he does not have friends beyond work. I worry I am his only friend. \n\nThe past three months he has been dating a girl from his home country. He told me before he had not done so because he does not like his home country and if he married a girl from there he would think they would move back. In November I was very tired working two jobs so I would stay over the night rather then taking the night bus. I went to my home country in December for the first time in years to see my family. \n\nTwo weeks ago the girl left my friend. He told me and I was very surprised. They seemed very happy. She had moved in with him and it was good. He said she was upset I was always at his house. I asked him if he was upset and he said no. He said my friendship is enough of a thing from me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am concerned that I am not a good friend for this man. I do not have as much money so I cannot buy him things. I have offered to have him eat a meal at my place but he declines - he works late and the bus table is hard for him. I share a house and it is always full and he does not want to rest at my place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I think I am taking advance of my immigrant friend with his space and food. ",

      "description": "I am on my mobile, so formatting might be an issue.\n\nIn my undergrad, I had this group of a dozen friends, where everyone was really close. Being a person who gets close to only few people, I was close to 3 out of those people. There is a girl, X who was in the group and was liked by a guy Y, not in the group. Y and I started talking after they both had a fight (both of theirs fault, X made it public to the batch) and I consoled him, helped him with his exams and just life in general, often listening to him over 10 hours a day. For context, Y and I were always \"shipped\" together, but there wasn't anything involved. Also, I know X since childhood, went to same high school and stuff, but we weren't really friends but I was okay with her being in the group (and planning her b'day surprises and stuff). At end of sophomore year, I somehow found out, that at a particular time, X was really upset with me over something insignificant (she admits this) and was bitching about me to Y (one of the few times they talked in an year) and he joined in. It had a lot of hurtful stuff involved, such as, no one wants to be her friend, people just bear with her, she is a weirdo etc. She also around a week later proceeded to tell me how Y is way out of my league and I should be glad that they group even includes me etc.\n\nMy 3 closest friends in the group knew all of this. They refused to confront her, or talk to her about it. One out of these 3 was her close friend and I kinda understood her decision not to. Others didn't because then the group would have fallen apart. I tried to be with them when X wasn't around, but slowly, work took over and they stopped calling me. At the end of senior year, one of them tried being friends again, and I did too, but things were different.\n\nIt has been 3.5 years since then, but I can't stop wondering, was I wrong to expect my close friend to take a stand? Was I wrong in leaving the group?",

      "description": "So a little background: my parents divorced when I was 13 and because my mom gets disability she was unable to file taxes and claim my sister and I.So my father would claim us and get the child tax and would give like a fraction of it to my mom. My dad hasn’t always been the best dad in ways of child support and supporting my sister and I.A few years ago my dad left the country and fell behind on his child support so his taxes last year were basically all given to my mom. \nTo the present: In 2018 I got my first job and my dad moved out of the state for work he would pay his required child support for my sister but since I turned 18 he hasn’t supported me in anyway. Most of my paycheck would go toward the support of my mom, who is disabled, and my younger sister who I have taken an active role in helping my mom raise her. So with my moms permission I claimed my mom and sister on my taxes to help our household. I told my dad at the beginning of the year I was filing and not to claim my sister and I but he went behind my back and filed anyways. So as I’m filing the federal taxes wouldn’t go through because he claimed me. I had to file through the mail and now he would be audited. What was really messed up though is he got all this money and didn’t even offer to give a penny of it to my mom or sister. Everyone I’ve talked to said that I’m not and my dads an A because he went behind my back but I just feel guilty because I love my dad.So AITA for filing for my taxes knowing my dad can go to prison and can get in a whole bunch of other trouble with the IRS.

My best friend likes blow em up action movies and/or fart comedy movies (dont ask), my mom likes rom coms and/or non supernatural thrillers, I like gritty dramas and slow burns, and my sister likes comedies and reality tv.\n\nFinally I win out and we pick my movie, American Psycho. Its got drama for me, a little bit of action for my best friend, a thriller vibe for my mom, and some comedic bits for my sister.\n\nI never get to pick movies and usually end up watching garbage adam sandler movies or crappy scream rip offs. Still im respectful and dont try to derail the movies and dont annoy people by playing on my phone. I try to engage with people and have a good time so i expected the same thing.\n\nMy sister immediately decides to start playing candy crush on her phone, poking my best friend about funny pictures she found, and then most annoyingly she decides to start random conversations with my mom about parking spaces and groceries. All during the movie. She does this when im having conversations too to passive aggressively annoy me when she doesn't get her way.\n\nFinally when my mom and best friend are getting into it we get to the scene where the homeless man gets killed and she starts bawling like a baby.\n\nShe says she cant watch it anymore even though she watched fucking saw. I tell her to stop crying like a baby and leave then and that shes doing this on purpose. She goes from crying to angry and we yell at eachother. Movie night is over.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I've (M-26) been working on a political campaign for nearly a year. It's pretty long days, maybe 18 hours a day and definitely 7 days a week. At some point our boss (M-28) became obsessed with the idea that we would at some point get recording devices planted on us in our office by the opposition. The boss talked about it constantly, always without evidence. So much so that the rest of the staff (F-40, F-40, F-26, M-25) would talk about his obsession when he wasn't around. Obviously, it would have been easy for us to get on board with this had there been some semblance of guidance on what specifically to be on the outlook for rather than just random assertions, but there was nothing except the vague theory. \n\n\n\n\nAlso two particularly random things happened in the months prior to the election. First, two months prior to the election someone, purporting to be a supporter, came by and said they had two (extremely nice and extremely comfortable) matching leather sofas that they were getting rid of that they wanted to know if they could give to us as a donation to our office seating area. We accepted but the boss spent days talking about how we had to get rid of them because they might contain recording devices built into them. Secondly, on the candidate's birthday (he was almost never physically present in our office) someone(s?) separately sent an edible arrangement and some flowers to our office without cards. Boss predictably flipped out made us call to find out whom they were from but the companies refused to tell us as it was against policy. These are legit nationally known companies involved and there was a very slim chance that they'd be involved in an illegal campaign bugging operation. But again they had to be dumped into the trash because... \n\n\n\n\nHe insisted that he was going to call the police and have them do a full investigation. He never followed through but this was getting ridiculous. \n\n\n\n\nA few days after a successful primary election was the boss' birthday. I stopped off at a drug store bought a large teddy bear and tied a bunch of balloons to its hand and a bow around its neck. The pièce de résistance was the two inch wire I had repurposed from a pair of ear buds and superglued to the neck of the bear and had hidden, poorly, behind the ribbon. I left it at the front desk and told everyone in the office what was up and got them on the same page that it had been delivered that very morning without a card. Everyone in the office was fully aware that this was a prank. He flipped out exactly as predicted immediately. And *then* noticed the wire sticking out and was instantly at an 11 for all of about 3 minutes before I let him in on the joke.\n\n\n\n\nI was and had always planned to be there to supervise the entire prank and would have obviously never let it get to the point where he actually called the police. He threw the dumb bear at me sort of chuckled. But, he has stopped bringing up the stupid \"recordings\" paranoia for the rest of the campaign.\n\n\n\n\nI already sorta think I know what the answer is, but still, AITA?\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR Is it sometimes okay to unstick your boss from something they keep harping on with a lite prank? Assume I *cannot* be fired.",

      "title": "AITA for being upset with my ex for bringing her new BF around my kids?",
      "description": "So my wife and I have been separated for about a year and a half now. Everything has been very amicable. We have a good schedule with our two boys (ages 7 and 11), we hangout as a family usually once a week, and get along a lot better than when we were married. Things have been working out so well between us that we have not been in a rush to pull the trigger and finalize the divorce.\n\nWhen we first agreed to separate, one of the things we agreed on, and she brought up first and was very adamant about is that the kids would not be exposed to anyone we were dating until we knew it was a very serious relationship. Something I was fully on board with and readily agreed with. Whenever I start to date someone, I joke with them that we will be married for a couple of years before I bring the kids around them.\n\nThe ex has a condo there that she goes on long weekend trip, or for family events, and for part of the kids school breaks. They have cousins near the same age there and I believe it is important that they have a chance to spend time with them.\n\nThey pent spring break there, and came back to my place on Saturday. Sunday morning I woke up and started making pancakes for breakfast. I asked them, how were the pancakes, and my oldest replied along the lines of that they are much better than mom's friend Ron. This set off big alarm bells in my head. Namely, who the fuck is Ron, and why is he cooking breakfast for my kids?\n\nI didn't follow up, or ask any questions of the boys, and just got ready to take the boys to the beach. Later, we had to stop at the ex's house so the boys could pick up their backpacks for school the next day. I casually asked about Ron and why he was making breakfast. The ex just shrugged it off that he came by after hockey practice. She gave a little dismissive explanation, that as far as the boys know, he is just a friend. Later that night I texted with her and told her that I'm not comfortable with some guy coming over trying to ingratiate and buddy up to my boys. I also brought up the agreement that no boyfriends/girlfriends were going to be brought around unless it was something that was very serious. She replied that she wasn't sure how serious they were, but the boys just see him as any other friend. I also brought up that if things were getting serious, than we need to fast track finally getting divorced.\n\nNow kids aren't completely clueless, especially they older one. I'm sure they aren't making out in front of the kids, but I also know that lingering glances, sitting close to each other, small signs of affection are there.\n\nSo AITA? For getting upset that I have no idea who is hanging around my kids, how much time he is spending with them, what kind of relationship he is trying to make with them. And come summer vacation when they are there for over a month, how much will he be around? I know as a divorced partner, I have no say in who she dates, and I do want her to be happy.",

      "description": "So I dated my ex for around two years (26M/24F).  Overall, he’s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn’t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he’s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don’t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn’t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don’t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I’m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he’s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I’ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he’s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I’m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn’t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we’d still be together. I just couldn’t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?",

      "description": "Hey, so I was wondering whether I’m TA in this situation. I an a 27 year-old male graduate student, and there’s this one guy in one of my classes that I kinda worry about. He seems to be kinda out of it all the time, often comes in sniffling/coughing, talks *very* quietly (I only ever hear him because I usually sit by him- or more accurately he sits by me as he always arrives after I do), and just now I saw him while walking on campus and he was really awkward and decided to go on his way right after asking if he could walk with me briefly. \n\nI mean, the guy doesn’t give off “shady” vibes. I don’t feel unsafe around him. He gives off “I’m having difficulties” vibes, and since I was hit really bad with burnout toward the end of my undergrad career, I kinda worry he’s going through the same. I am working as a paid note-taker in the class (our school has a department that helps students with disabilities, through which they can anonymously request a paid note-taker, a classmate who, once hired by the Student Disability Services people, would upload their notes to the SDS site for the requester to see), and I suspect he’s the person who requested notes. We’re not supposed to try and find out, though.\n\n*That said,* I also feel like it’s really fucking patronizing of me to be thinking that way of a total stranger. There isn’t really even a way to ask him if he’s okay without the potential of accidentally insulting him to his face. \n\nSo....yeah. Am I the asshole for potentially thinking of my classmate in a patronizing way without knowing him very well at all?",

      "description": "Context: I'm an openly Bi guy, in the sense that if someone asks I'll tell and I don't hide it, but I never actively bring it up and I never shove it in people's faces.\n\n**TL;DR: I feel that my friend is defining my entire personality and life by my sexuality, he constantly brings it up in unrelated conversations and uses it as a 'roast'. This has been happening pretty much since he learned I was bi. He thinks this is no big deal, that I'm overreacting and I need to 'chill' and he doesn't see what he's done wrong. AITA?**\n\nNow my friend, who we'll call Jack, seems to have turned into a bit of an ass lately. The reason I say he's turned into a bit of an ass is that he doesn't seem to understand when a roast is or isn't called for. You'll see why I say that.\n\nTonight, we were talking about what we're doing tomorrow. I didn't understand something he said, so I asked and he came back with\n\n&gt;no wonder you got to [my uni] so slow to catch on (for added context, with my grades I could have gone to any uni in the country. I chose mine)\n\nAnyway, the convo continued with him calling the bar at my uni shit (🤷‍♂️) and eventually getting to *'our bar is better because I saw someone who graduated years ago there'* and *\"Your lonely ass wouldn't understand\"*.\n\nNow this did offend me because honestly since we went our separate ways he has no fuckin clue what I've been up to, and even at school I was one of the most socially active people in our grade. It'd be like me making a hiroshima joke to him; it's just wrong to begin with, plus he's not even Japanese so it doesn't even make any sense. I said to him \n\n&gt;HAHA don't even at me about being lonely, you have no idea what I do\n\nto which he came back with\n\n&gt;What sucking guys off\n\n&gt;you a gay stripper or someshit now\n\nAt this point I kind of went off. To fully understand why, you have to know that he's been doing this for months. In person and online, in DMs and group chats. If anyone brings up the topic of sexuality or relationships, I have to stop contributing immediately or it'll end up being about that. Even in completely and entirely unrelated conversations such as above, he still brings it up as a 'roast'. I've made it clear multiple times that it's not ok, and he keeps going.\n\nI feel like he's defining my entire self by my sexuality, as if there's nothing else to my character. That's just one part of the problem though.\n\nHe's said now that he'll stop (sure, whatever) but he keeps calling what he's doing a 'joke' (\"I'll stop making the joke\", \"dude it's just a joke\") and he keeps telling me to chill and that it's not a big deal and I'm overreacting, which makes me think he still doesn't realise what he's done wrong and how big of a deal this is to me. That's the bigger issue imo. I don't care that he's going to stop, or that he's apologised (he actually hasn't). I'm pissed that he thinks he's done nothing wrong and that this is no big deal.\n\nAm I overreacting? AITA?",

      "description": "I've been with him for around two years. Back then i was starting on meds for anxiety, i began dating guys and he was very charismatic and i fell for him just talking online, when we first met in person he asked me to be his boyfriend, and i said yes.\n\nThings went well, there were some  traits of him that i disliked but i just thought \"give him a chance\". At a point i went back to having anxiety attacks, he always brushed them off but made a great deal of his anxiety, he made me feel no one would be interested in me when he told me how \"impressed\" his friends were that he was dating an epileptic person and that \"he must really love me to put up with that\", he constantly says how our life will be living together even thought i've told him how uncomfortable it makes me. At a point in our relationship i discovered he still had Grindr on his phone, he told me it was to \"troll guys\", one day he handed me his phone and i knew i shouldn't, but i went through his Grindr and his latest conversation implied that he brought a guy to his house and had sex. He assured me nothing happened, the guy was his friend and they ended up just talking instead. Gave him a chance, even though he said that if i did something like that he would \"kill me\".\n\nLast year my family went through a financial crisis, at times i couldn't see him, i didn't even have money to take the bus. He was mad about that cause he couldn't understand it.\n\nAround November last year he began getting sick, having trouble with his throat. My depression got worse and sometimes i forgot to talk to him, he sayed that he would stop telling me stuff cause i \"clearly didn't care about him\" and that he was giving me a last chance or he would break up with me, i had enough, but then he brought up how serious his sickness was, i wanted to be with him as a friend but he told me that if we broke up he was shutting me out of his life and blocking me everywhere... of course again, i thought \"give him a chance\" \n\nLet's jump to December, i told my parents of his health situation and they got involved in supporting him, he was told he was in the early stages of cancer and he began chemo... he was very depressed at first, then he began demanding that every week i visited him and i did it, accompanied by my mother. His mother constantly talked about how he has these rage fits and yells horrible things at her and his brother.\n\nHe's always annoyed for not visiting him more often and then apologizes saying how much he misses me. I told my mother how i felt and she told me that he needs me through this hard time and to give him a chance.\n\nSo, am i the asshole for thinking to break up with my boyfriend with cancer? Am i truly blowing everything out of proportion and exaggerating? Should i just, suck it up and go with it for however long his treatment is?",

      "description": " \n\nSO! First time post to AITA, and I'm a tad frustrated with a friend.\n\nThe whole story was we agreed to go to the gym on Wednesday several days before. I had to pick them up. They have a car. It's supposedly not working well. My other friend is already at the gym, and takes the bus to get there himself. I make a texting group called \"gym peeps\" and post in it around 2 PM. I'm at work until 5 PM. Other friend texts them once I'm off since the first friend hasn't responded and I'm driving. (I try to not text/call and drive since it's illegal) Still no response. Then 47 minutes later, when we've already gone to the gym, and are working out. They respond. Pissed as hell we're already there. Says they don't get group notifications (even though they were individually texted as well) and that we should have called or just stopped by. I had a large homework assignment that day, and had no extra time to wait for someone to either be awake or get ready. The expectation was they'd be up/ready/responded. Since I was kinda going out of my way to get them anyway. And they do not pay me gas money ever as a side note.\n\nThen they go off on me because I've canceled a couple times in the last few months. Says I can't treat people like shit just because I'm incredibly depressed/very busy with school/work/my business I run/my 5 year old/my rescue parrots/etc. Freaks out on me, and basically talks down to me. At one point I had told them \"I'm going to take the high road, and not get angry\" then they tell me I'm patronizing them. When the intention of saying that was admitting I usually get upset and yell. I didn't want to do that, and I'm trying to be better about anger. Then in that same breath, they turn around and text me saying \"Repeat back to me why you think I'm upset\" like I'm a small child! Which seems super patronizing!! AND to top all of this off they wouldn't be able to get into the gym without me. I have the special membership that means I can bring a guest. They have no membership, no way to get themselves to the gym, and no way to get home from the gym. (They could take the bus, but refuse I guess??)\n\nSo not only am I a taxi. I'm a way to get into my gym.\n\nReddit, am I the asshole in this situation for not calling them/stopping by to get them even though I (and my other friend) tried to text?",

      "description": "I have a friend who graduated last year and is now a Masters student. He took a class this semester because he heard the professor was easy. Now he's asking me if the workload for another professor is less, and he's basing his class selection off of that. Grad classes (unless they're combined/stacked) are generally never easy; they are so much more detailed, and they require a lot more work than undergrad classes. There are some exceptions, but very few. Grad school is more about learning rather than getting the grade; that's why we take classes to learn, not to get an easy A and waste our time not having learned anything. With that in mind, WIBTA if I told my friend that he's lazy and shouldn't be in grad school until he starts taking learning seriously?",

      "description": "Basically, I was attracted to this girl (17m, 18f) a few months ago. She was really cute and funny. However it eventually felt like she would only snap me if she was feeling bored or needed an ego boost. Now I could totally be wrong here. Sometimes, whenever I called her pretty, she would say I was wrong. Humble I guess? But then she would talk about all the time that she is not pretty but then I'd be like, wait, that's not true. She would then say my answer is predictable.\nWell if it's predictable why keep asking? Idk maybe I'm missing something\n\nOn top of that I realized a lot of our conversations stemmed from snaps she would send to everyone in her friends list. Which is too bad cause I personally felt like we were connecting or something, but then another guy who is her friend brings her up by talking about the same thing we were talking about last night.\n\nEventually she snapped me that a peer in class asked if we were a \"thing\" because I took her on a date and we were going to go to a dance together. We also had pretty good chemistry, and it seemed like we were doing okay. However, she said she was super embarrassed that someone would ask of we were a thing together.\n\nI got instantly mad and disappointed. She always kind of dropped hints that she wasn't interested in me like saying \"that was fun, I like going out as friends\" and \"I'd love to hang as friends\", but this kind of seemed like she would be embarrassed at the even thought or us together or something. But at the same time we would always be kinda flirting. She would call me like a \"bad boy\" etc etc. I think mixed messages would kind of be the term?\n\nAnyways, in hindsight I believed I lashed at her a little bit. I felt kinda hurt because it really seemed like our whole friendship or anything we has going on was fake.\n\nAfter that fiasco happened one night, I kind of avoided her at the start of class walking to my seat than talking to her. Like it would be weird to sit down and be like \"how bout that fake argument we had? Real bummer huh\" in the middle of 30 people. But then she brought it up later over messaging that \"is this how it's going to be\". I brought up my reasoning and it kinda just stopped there.\n\nAt one point I felt bad about all this so I gave this apology about how mean I probably was, wanting to be on good terms. She just replied with \"ok\".\n\nSo now we don't ever talk anymore. I don't necessarily feel bad about what happened, but I was wondering if Reddit had a certain take on the situation.",

The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n",

I have no problem in helping people but I also have no problem in telling people off when they are just nice because its convenient at the moment. Specially older people that think that just because they are old they can disrespect younger people.  \n\nAnyways...\n\nEarly today IT guy was helping one of them with something and didn't know how to correct it, so they called me and ask for help. I'm like \"am I getting paid for this because I'm not IT\" and go about fixing it.  Then I send a little message to coworker saying \"I'mma start charging yall $5 for every IT question\" (mind you I have been here for 3 years and fixing their IT stuff since I started just because). She then tried to help another coworker about fonts size and she comes around and asks me a question I put my hand out like saying \"where's my 5 dollars\" she says \"I'll buy you lunch\" (which probably won't happen) and I tell her what she needs to do so she goes and tried to fix it and here I'm laughing like \"wtf are they doing?\" They got the other 20 year old to fix it and all is good now. \n\nAITA for not wanting to help her with IT questions/ fixing issues anymore?",

      "description": "I have really low expectations for friends but they never seem to meet them. All I want in a friend is for someone to be caring enough to ask me how i'm doing every once in a while, stick up for me even if I'm not around, and ask me to hangout. Almost all the time in the one putting in the effort to talk to them, and hangout with them. Me and some of my friends stopped talking after I got out of a weird break up with my ex boyfriend a few months ago, because at the time everything revolved around him. I reconnected with them, because they finally remembered that I exist. I had plans with one of them for New year's, but she never texted me again about it until New year's Eve. I assumed she didn't want to see me anymore so I made other plans and I guess \"cancelled on her\". After winter break seems like none of them talk to me, won't even give me a smile when I see them in public. Last time one of them talked to me was to ask me to hangout but I have work almost every day, and they aren't the type of people to make plans in advance. They talk shit cause they think I'm weird and don't give a shit but they won't even check up on me? Am I the asshole for not continuing to ask them to hangout even though it feels like I get rejected every time?",

She asks me to help put together some materials (light photo editing &amp; email crafting) which I do. After that she says so I'll see you on Saturday? And I said, that's a hard no. So she says she's personally offended by that and wants to know why. I said that she wasn't in a position to demand a favor after offering to do one for me and then cancelling when the terms were unfavorable, but if she needs help during work hours I am willing to do that . She then asked again for me to reconsider and I said no. She needed me to go to get the credit, she was doubting the turn out would be sufficient.  Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'm a male high school teacher, and I've been at this for a few years. I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? ",

They're fundamentalist christians, don't send their kids to public school, don't \"believe\" in modern medicine -- whatever that's supposed to mean, and go out of their way to isolate themselves from the world around them. \n\nI left the group when I was 18 to go to college. I'm now 25 and living my life. And I don't feel the least bit bad for rejecting the group's beliefs. \n\nHowever, what really eats at me is that I have 5 younger siblings still in the group. The group has some rule where they try to keep members -- especially younger ones -- from interacting with people who leave the group. It's obviously a reprehensible rule. And my younger siblings do contact me occasionally, which I really appreciate. \n\nHowever, I'm a non-confrontational person and I basically avoid contacting my family due to the rules they supposedly live by. I periodically feel waves of guilt for not being more proactive about it. I have a legitimate legal case given that it's not legal to keep siblings from communicating/seeing each other. But I really don't want to turn it into a legal battle. Should I? \n\nIn a certain sense, people have the right to live how they want, even if that involves disowning me or whatever.

I'll try to make this as short as possible and I know how much of a ball ache large paragraphs of text are.\n\n\nSo my mam and him got together two years ago (a month after his own wife died). I was a bit apprehensive of him from the start incase he was using my mam as a rebound or such. To be fair he has been nothing but amazing to my mam so I quickly got over this. But I have a feeling he just puts up with me to please her. \n\n\n\nI'm living back home as I'm saving for a trip of a lifetime and will be away for a while so it's obviously very hard to avoid him when he is around alot of the time. I lost my dad five years ago, and for fathers day me and my mam went to the beach and had a bbq. The whole time we were there he was messaging saying \"can you not drop them off and come to mine yet\" (I only saw because my mam asked me to change song on her ipad). I got upset and left shortly after. \n\n\n\nWe all went to go see my poorly auntie who lives 3 hours drive away for the weekend and when we got back we were talking about it and how we might go again and he came out with \"well you never know, that would be the last time you ever see her, she didn't look good at all\". Then we went to see my gran in hospital this week and while I was trying to have a conversation with her, he blasted her TV so we couldn't hear each other and wouldn't turn it down till mam snatched the remote off him. \n\n\nMy boyfriend was nice enough to get me some flowers (rare) for getting a promotion at work, at which point he said they \"stink like cat piss\" and wrinkles his nose whenever he is near them. He knows I wanted a certain watch for months and months and then he bought my mam one for Xmas and I had to sit there and watch her open it. \n\n\n\nI feel like I'm being petty by being bothered by it but it's so upsetting and annoying and it's actually wearing me down. I don't know what to do other than to avoid him. I tried telling him how I felt about the watch to which he started swearing at me over text saying I've pissed him off, which was never my intentions I just wanted him to understand that it really upset me. I've spoke to my mam about it all and she keeps telling him off but things just keep happening. I keep trying to forgive and forget and just move on but it's getting pretty obvious that I'm now just keeping my distance a bit. What do you think I should do. Am I an asshole or is he? \n\n\n",

      "description": "So me and my boyfriend are both in college. I was supposed to go to his place last night. I told him I had an event with my roommates that started at 8 and would go on for at least an hour/ hour and a half. Then I would go straight to his. During the event we are continuously texting. It ends up going late, until about 10. I tell him when it’s over. \n\nI’m 10 minutes into the 25 minute drive. I send him a quick text that I’m on my way. He sends back that he’s started a movie with his roommate and he didn’t think I’d be coming over anymore since it was so late. He tells me not to come anymore. I honestly was pretty surprised. We had plans to hang all week. So I turn around and head back to my place. It was annoying but it seemed like we just had some miscommunication.\n\nI always go to his on Friday night and will usually stay the entire weekend going into Monday. Since I’m going to be at my apartment on a Saturday for the first time in a while, now my roommates want the chance to hang out, so we’ve made plans for today to go to a basketball game. \n\nMy boyfriend is now mad. He wanted me to come over early this morning. He doesn’t understand why I’m going to this game and thinks I should ditch my roommates. His reasoning is that we technically had plans to hang at his place today since I was originally going to stay over. I told him that I was just confused about last night and thought it would be fine. From my perspective, when he cancelled last night, he changed the plans. I told him when the game would end and that I’d come afterward. He’s still annoyed at my choice. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not wiping down the gym equipment?",
      "description": "So, I know the title makes the answer seem obvious, but it’s something I’m actually struggling with.\n\nMy gym, like most, has those oddly-small white towels available for members.  When I first joined my gym (standard ok-and-cheap YMCA) I would always take two towels - one for sweat, and one for wiping down the equipment.  I have always been pretty fastidious about wiping down the machines after use.  The gym also has little spray bottles of cleaning solution scattered around to use when wiping off equipment after use, which I always used.\n\nThen, a few months ago, the gym instituted a one-towel-per-person policy.  So, now I have the choice of:\n\n- wiping sweat off on the towel, but then no towel for equipment wiping\n- using the towel for wiping the equipment and not having a sweat towel unless I bring my own separately, or;\n- what most people seem to do, which is use the same towel for both sweat and wiping, which...seems disgusting.  I do t want cleaning solution on my face, and I wouldn’t want to wipe down equipment with a sweaty towel.\n\nI asked the front desk at one point how I should wipe down the equipment if we only got one towel, and was told there were paper towels in the fitness area to use when wiping the machines.  However, I looked pretty thoroughly, and have never seen paper towels available nor have I ever seen anyone using one to wipe down equipment.  \n\nThe gym does have attendants who come around every ten or twenty minutes and wipe down the machines not in use...but, if someone gets on a machine right after you, it likely hasn’t been wiped unless the person using it has wiped it.  But, they do get cleaned off periodically.  Possibly also relevant - knowing I’m not wiping, I touch the machine (usually a treadmill or stairclimber)as little as possible.  I’ll only use the touchscreen and speed buttons, don’t touch the handles, etc.  I’m also not a big sweater, if that makes a difference.\n\nFaced with this dilemma, I’ve pretty much stopped wiping down machines after using them, other than to swipe away any obvious moisture with the provided towel.  But, I feel like a complete criminal every time.  So, AITA? Should I give in and dual-purpose my single towel as a sweat and cleaning rag, am I obligated to bring a personal towel (something I also never see anyone doing at the gym, but I guess it could solve the issue)...or can I get away with not wiping?

      "title": "WIBTA for throwing my girlfriend under the bus to help someone else?",
      "description": "Alright, I'll provide some backstory for context:\n\nMy girlfriend (let's call her Nina) and I have been dating for a few years. Nina is genuinely the most gentle, compassionate and kind person I've ever met. However, she's reluctant to face any sort of conflict and hates to 'rock the boat'.\nNina's best friend (let's call her Zoe) has always been problematic and toxic to say the least (she's one of those people that says really horrible stuff, but later defends herself by saying \"I was just joking! You're so sensitive\"). She's been a bully to me and isn't the nicest or most respectful person to other people, including Nina (in my opinion, she's isolated her from having other friends - she's very toxic and manipulative). However, Nina overlooks a lot of that because she's been best friends with Zoe since they were 3 years old (they're now 18). Despite Zoe's behaviour towards me and my girlfriend, I'm civil and polite with Zoe as I feel like I owe that to Nina.\nZoe has also been dating someone for about a year and a half (I'll call him Bob) and they are pretty serious, with Bob saving for a house, marriage etc. Bob is a VERY genuine and nice guy, although I don't see that much of him (we end up seeing each other about once a month).\n\nAnyway, in June this year, Zoe started cheating on Bob with her teacher from last year. As far as we know, there hasn't been anything physical, although there have been MANY explicit texts and pictures sent between them both and at least one \"coffee date\". The only person Zoe has told is Nina and soon after Nina told me (and kept me updated as things progressed). \n\nFrom the start, I've wanted to tell Bob about it, however Nina has asked me not to since it'll end horribly for Nina - she's afraid she'll lose Zoe as her best friend and be the victim of anything Zoe may throw at her (again, Zoe is very manipulative, selfish and can be quite cruel if you're on her 'bad side').\n\nDuring this time, Nina has voiced her concerns several times to Zoe and told her how she's doing the wrong thing by Bob. Zoe will brush it off by giggling at how 'naughty' it is or by telling Nina that \"what Bob doesn't know can't hurt him\".\nShe has also confronted the teacher and told him how disappointed and creeped out she is by his actions also (bear in mind this teacher is aware she has a long term boyfriend and, in my opinion, has groomed Zoe to some extent while she was at school. Very creepy stuff).\n\nAdmittedly from the start, I have been unmoving in my opinion that Bob needs to know ASAP and Nina and I have had several arguements over this. We've also spent lots of time trying to figure out a way to tell Bob that doesn't throw Nina under the bus and I've offered to take the hit for her so many times. However, even if it were me who told Bob, it would still come back to bite Nina because Zoe would unleash hell on her because Nina told me about it.\n\nEventually, last week Nina decided she was going to tell Bob herself, but after filling her mother in on the situation for further guidance, she was convinced that she shouldn't tell Bob after all and instead should let things \"come to a head\". \nSince then, Nina has also told me about how it's exhausting to be invested in this situation and how she needs to take a step back from it and not intervene anymore as it's too emotionally exhausting and she needs to practice self-care instead (she's been complaining of stress/guilt headaches the last couple of days). \nWhile I support her decision to practice self-care and her wellbeing is a priority to me, I think Bob needs to know regardless. \nNina is aware of my opinion and has told me I have her permission to tell Bob and that she won't be mad at me. Even still, I know it would hurt her and by telling Bob, Nina would get thrown under the bus, lose her best friend and suffer the consequences of whatever Zoe may do to try and seem like the good guy. Obviously Nina's wellbeing is a huge priority to me, but I can't help but think that keeping this to ourselves is the wrong choice to make.\n\nI'm feeling really lost right now as to what to do. Nina and I are both aware that Zoe has toxic traits and can be a bad friend at times. We also both think Bob should know (although Nina doesn't think it should come at the price of her own wellbeing).\n\nWould I be the asshole for throwing my girlfriend under the bus to save Bob from wasting his time/energy/emotions on a cheater?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend's manipulative best friend is cheating. Telling her boyfriend would throw my girlfriend under the bus. Would I be the asshole for doing so anyway? ",

      "description": "Backstory is required but I'll try to keep this short. I'm a sophomore in college. Freshman year I cut ties with my nana after getting tired of her negativity and what I and the rest of my family assume are mental health issues. We were really close when I was growing up but the older I got the more the things she did bothered me as I lost my rose tinted glasses. she's tried to contact me multiple times since then but I have refused her calls. I haven't spoken to her since I cut contact freshman year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis week is my spring break; my family is visiting our home state while I'm still in my city. Last night I received a call from an unknown number and then a voicemail where my nana pretty much said she had drove down to my city, and wanted to meet for dinner. I immediately call my mom because frankly I'm weirded out and she knows where I live. I find out she lied to my family who had visited her a few days ago and said she had work the rest of this week, and instead drove all the way here. At that point I'm annoyed she'd put in that position but I figure I'll just ignore her. Today I come into work, I just came back from my lunch break and guess who walks in. I was extremely uncomfortable but talked to her anyways, and she wants to see me tomorrow night and Saturday night. Frankly I'm pissed, I cut contact with her, have refused contact up to this point, and she shows up to essentially strongarm me into spending time with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn't say no to her face so I said I'd get back to her on Friday and Saturday but I really don't want to. And I think she tried to guilt me intentionally or not by saying she drove all this way just to see me. AITA if I just ignore her and don't see her this weekend?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Grandma who I cut contact with shows up from a state over to try to force me into spending time with her.",

      "description": "I'd like to give some background first. I'm almost 19 and at the time of this happening I was 17 while the friend in question was 18. It was an online friendship- she lived in Georgia and I lived in Connecticut so the difference wasn't as bad as some but it was still big. She was the only friend of my original friend group who was still around, and we had met when I was maybe 13-14, while she was a year older, and one might assume she was the more mature one. I assure you she wasn't.\n\nSorry this is long and rambly it was 2 years ago and so I'm rusty and just trying to remember everything\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe'll call her... Rabbit. I don't feel like using her real name. Anyway, it started, honestly, the first friend group fight we had. Another girl caused a big stink because we made a bandwagon on deviantart (had to have been in 2014) for pokemon, and so had she, and she got angry. I forget why she was so angry but this isn't about her, this is about Rabbit. Rabbit had access to my account and hid all of the other girl's comments so that it seemed like I was the bad one. At the time I thought she was protecting me but... One night my other friend told me that he didn't really trust Rabbit. I naively continued my friendship with Rabbit.\n\nFast forward to when it was just me and Rabbit. Now, listen, I was an asshole back then because I had just had my first heartbreak, and I talk very loudly. I guess her family heard me talking loudly and said I was yelling at her- and hell,  maybe I was? But I don't think I was yelling at HER, more like yelling TO her. I had a lot of anger at the time from bullying, etc. A lot of time Rabbit wanted to RP ( honestly thinking about it a lot of them were cringeworthy and maybe worthy of the creepy asterisks subredddit ) the same things. She LOVED Osomatsu-san and when I said I didn't want to, she threw a fit and told me that it was her coping mechanism. So I went along with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bad things happened when I called her a bitch in an RP, as a character. She told me 'I don't think that character would say that so you must think that about me!' when I told her no, that wasn't it, she yelled at me saying that her family, who had heard her yelling at her (from before which was why I added that in) had asked her why she was still friends with me. Funny enough my mother asked the same question- why was I friends with her when she was causing me to be extremely depressed? I was young. I thought she needed my help.\n\nI still feel horrible about what I did next. I told her we needed a break. She got upset but agreed. It happened around her birthday, so when I said I needed another break she got very angry and said 'first i'm ignored on my birthday now this.' I needed the break because I was stressed as all hell and it was making me sick. She was a year behind me in school though she was a year older, so I was graduating and the struggle was hard to keep up friendship which was already going down in flames and to focus on my graduation. I cried a lot, and I do mean a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her I needed that break and I never talked to her again. I felt horrible, but I thought maybe eventually I would talk to her again. Now another thing I need to say is that I apologize for anything I do wrong, even if it's minor. So when she messaged me on Instagram out of the blue I was upset. I don't remember the exact contents of the message, and I wish I'd kept the screenshot I had taken to show my mom, but this is roughly what she said. \n\n\"It's clear that this isn't a break this is just lets get this girl out of my life, but I wasn't the only one who did things wrong. you never accepted your faults and never apologized. I put you up on a pedestal, but you never did anything for me. I don't want you to respond to this, it'll be better if you don't.\" Though it was much longer than just that, berating me for being a bad friend. But often she shamed me for the things I liked, but if I ever even teased her about what she liked she'd throw a fit and get all depressed. I'm not the only one that has had the problem with her either.\n\nSo, am I the asshole? I feel super bad about it even today and it's been almost 2 years. There's a lot I left out that happened with her, mostly because I don't remember most of it so I wouldn't be a reliable narrator on it, but that was the most depressed I've ever been in my life. Sorry for the length.",

Usually me and my brother clean up together because my mum cooks however my mum had just got back from a trip to London which is about a 2 hour train ride each way. She had asked us both to cook dinner as she was really tired.\n\n We decided on something that didn't really take much work as neither of us could be bothered. I stated cutting potatoes and stuff and he was just standing around doing nothing. There were things he could be doing but I didn't really need that much help as I was only putting things in the oven then microwaving my mum's meal. \n\nSo once I had sorted the chips out my brother just walked off and started playing on his playstation. I didn't mind because he wasn't much help but I was a little annoyed that he just decided to walk off. I finished cooking and we all ate and everything was good. However before we started cooking my mum had asked us both to cook and clean but I didn't think it was fair that I had to cook and clean when I had cooked on my own so I walked up to my room and I could hear my brother throwing a Mardy downstairs about it and I feel really bad.

      "description": "Obviously, English is not my first language, otherwise I would not be having this problem.\nThe town I'm studying in is predominantly white. However, there is a lot of international students at my university. To give you an idea: about 70% of the students in my masters program are international students. Since it's not a requirement for them to learn my language and the classes are in English, the only way we can communicate is in English.\n\nI used to address every stranger in my language if they were white and in English if they where not. In like 95% of the cases, I was right about which language they spoke. A while back I addressed a non-white stranger in English, who got really offended that I assumed that he was foreign and didn't know the language, since he was a local. It got me thinking and I decided it might be a bit prejudiced, if not racist, of me to assume a not-white person is not local. So I tried to find a solution.\n\nAt first, I addressed everyone in English, independently of their appearance. In hindsight, that was a stupid idea. The person I offended would still be offended if I acted this way. Furthermore, I had some conversations with people in English where we both struggled to find the right words and only later realized we both had the same native language.\n\nSince that didn't work, I started addressing everyone in my native language. This lead to a lot of confused  and nervous looks and I had to repeat myself a lot in English. I myself also get nervous if someone addresses me in a language I don't know, so I can imagine it's not fun for them either.\n\nSo since neither systems seem to work as well as my old one did and lead to a lot of confusion, WIBTA if I revert back to my old ways? If you think I would be TA, please let me know what you think I should do in this situation so I would not be.",

Also on mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues.\n\nAnyway my boyfriend and I ordered lunch from one of the app based delivery services. And all was fine and dandy except they ask you to tip the driver before the order has even been placed. This was something that I was uncomfortable doing for many reasons, most notably that if my order is wrong/food has been damaged/just never arrives for whatever reason then I’m out of that money that I maybe wouldn’t have wanted to give away otherwise. And could how much I tip or not tip affect the service I would be getting in anyway? As delivery driver for a shopping service myself, if I knew my order had already been tipped I probably wouldn’t be as worried about making a good impression as I would have been if I still had to earn my tip.\n\nNow, I was planning to tip, just after the delivery had been made. But according to the boyfriend that wasn’t possible to do in the app. Which was fine, I would and could tip cash when the order arrived no big deal. But my boyfriend (who has also been a delivery driver) was offended and saw my refusal to tip before the delivery had been made as an asshole thing to do. \n\nSo, ATIA for not tipping before the delivery had been made?

Ever since I moved to the states and visited Mexico though I would have an intense repulsion to roaches, I was disgusted by them and afraid of even being in the same room as them. My whole family knows this. As a matter of fact my mom also shares this hatred of them. That being said though, my whole family took a vacation to Hawaii and stayed at an Airbnb. You can probably guess, but there were roaches in the Airbnb. And I don't mean small ones, I'm talking full on 2 inch long tropical flying cockroaches. I was fucking shook. On day one, my step dad kills one with Raid, picks it up with a napkin and brings it into my room to scare me with it. I freak out and everyone hears my reaction. The next couple of days my family leaves a lobster bobblehead fridge magnet to spook me, outside my room door. It got old and i got upset so I just broke it. Yesterday, my cousin caught a live roach and put it in a Pringles can. She offered me some Pringles and much to my delight there was a huge roach at the bottom of the can. I had a drink in my hand, and out of disgust and anger I threw it at her and her fiance who was happily playing along with the joke. Everyone in my family said I needed to apologize and that I was overreacting. I didn't apologize. Am I the asshole?",

Our friends and family have seen pictures because he wanted to know if they think I’d like it. I’m totally fine with that, it’s a picture of the ring on a website. \n\nBut he was ordering it today and he was saying he’s gonna send it to his mom’s. No big deal. But I told him that I want to be able to see it first before we show everyone the real ring. He didn’t understand, saying he wants to show his mom and sisters the ring first and then give it to me. \n\nI didn’t understand why he wanted to show them first and I told him I’d appreciate it if I were the one to see it first and if he could just ship it to our address. He says he sends all important mail to his mom’s and when he gets it he wants to be able to show it to his family. We went back and forth for a few minutes and I was basically saying that I would really appreciate it if he and I were the first ones to see the actual ring when it’s delivered and I know his mom will pester him about seeing it first if it’s shipped to her house. She won’t open his mail, but she will ask him to open it and show her and, honestly, I don’t like the thought of others seeing the physical ring before me. \n\nI think he finally agreed to ship it to our address but he’s not too happy about it. So am I the asshole for asking him to let me be the first one to see it? Was I being unreasonable and am I being unreasonable with telling him I’d prefer to see it first before we show his family and my own family?",

      "description": "I'm an American married to a Filipina, we've been together for 5 years married for 2. We live in the United States.  \nWe met while teaching in Japan where we made approximately 25k USD/year which was enough to get by, but every month she would send money back to her family in the Philippines. Once we got serious and moved in together this never stopped. She'd defend it as \"well it's my money!\" but then use the money I made to cover things like dinners and outings.  \n\n\nCurrently we're back in the United States and making more money, but she's sending a solid percentage of it back. We're at the point where we're really just making enough to cover our expenses and not paying off the credit card debt we accumulated from starting our lives here in the US. All of the money I make goes to our credit card (which we still use), health insurance for both of us, and retirement. Since we are waiting for her degree to be evaluated she hasn't started her career yet and is working jobs that don't come with benefits, so our pay checks are about the same after my deductions. She sends approximately 200-300 dollars per month which I feel we should be putting in retirement, paying off our credit card, or moving out of our shoe-box apartment.  \n\n\nMy frustrations also stem from her family there. We help her mom with some spending money and purchase medicines for her, which I am absolutely 100% on board with, her mom sacrificed a lot for my wife to be able to attend college and deserves all the help we can give. My issue stems with two of her brothers. The oldest brother is \\~30, didn't finish high school, has never had a job other than driving a motorcycle around for a few months as a taxi, is covered in tattoos which is a big cultural no-no over there, and has an elementary aged son. He, his son, and his girlfriend live in the house my wife purchased rent free. I feel that at his age there's no reason for us to support him, that we're making it too easy for him to exist doing nothing and we're going to be stuck taking care of him forever. I've turned numb to \"medical emergencies\" and any other reason they need money.  \n\n\nHer other brother is a college student, very smart guy and lives at home with us as well. We pay his college tuition which is dirt cheap \\~250/quarter  I'm totally cool with him living rent free in the house there and I can grin-and-bear paying his tuition because it's so cheap, but part of me also feels that I'm $80,000 in debt for my university studies that I'll be paying on for a long time, why can't he go $4000?  \n\n\nI understand the culture is different, I understand it's her family and she loves them, but I see the money she spends on them as depriving us of moving forward and establishing a better future while money is still tight.  \n\n\nAITA?  \n",

      "description": "Alright, a quick summary of the events that led to this.    \n\n\nI dated this girl for a year in total, but after our first month long break up about 8 consecutive months.  We got in a few fights and eventually the week before Christmas her mother was diagnosed with Lymphoma.  Due to the stress of that and our pre-existing issues, she broke up with me.  We then had a random run in two days later and began talking and hanging out again.  Effectively the same as we were before, only without being in a \"committed relationship\".  I was sort of under the impression we would work things out and get back together.  I wanted to be there for this difficult time regardless of our issues.   \n\n\nFast forward to a week later.  We were back to staying together and having sex like we did when we were together.  I had told her that despite our issues I wanted to be there for her so I was.   It was effectively the same as we'd been before we broke up without an \"official\" title.  After a week or so of this we got in another fight, on a Saturday morning about me hitting the snooze on her alarm and making her 10 minutes late to work.  This then caused her to \"break up\" with me again, and say \"you can't even fix your issues when we're not even in a relationship\".  I apologized and said I was sorry.  She then told me we were totally done, with absolutely no chance of ever getting back together.  She said I'd blown all of my chances and there wouldn't be any more.  This was a Saturday afternoon.    \n\n\nI went no contact and on the following Wednesday she called me hysterical, having found out some negative info about her mother's cancer.  She wanted to come to my house and decompress since it's close to her work and she had a key.  I had conveniently called in that day so I was there.  I agreed anyway and she came over, cried on my shoulder, the whole nine.  I then bought her dinner and ended up staying at her house again.  The next day we went back to more limited contact, but still texting a bit throughout the day.  She then got sick over the following weekend (last Sunday).  I ended up taking her to the ER and then taking care of her that night and staying again.  The next night (Monday), she was asleep on the couch while I was there taking care of her and she did some talking in her sleep that sounded like \"Fuck me Charles\".  Now, Charles is the best friend of her absolutely toxic and awful best friend.  When she woke up I asked her what that was about, and she admitted that she had been having sex with him, had done it multiple times, with the first time being the Sunday night after she  \"broke up\" with me the day before, for hitting the snooze.  I asked her how many times she'd done it and if she was going to continue doing that.  She said she had done it a  few times and could do whatever she wanted since we weren't together.  Now, I know we aren't together so there technically isn't anything wrong with that, but it hurt me because I still love her and wanted to be with her and try to fix things, despite her obvious lack of interest in doing so.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here's the part that brings me to this sub and asks Am I The Asshole?  Once I found out she was already having sex with someone, not two days after we had slept together.  I told her that I loved her and wanted to be with her and be there for her, but couldn't stick around and hear about her having sex with someone else.   It's just too hard for me to do that.   I then told her that I know she's having a hard time, but I think our issues were really aggravated by her sick mother and that she's been unraveling a bit and this sex with the other guy seemed like a reach for something to fill that hole.  She went off of me and said I was being hurtful on purpose and was even \"gas-lighting\" her.  She then said she doesn't ever want to talk to me and doesn't want me to be able to talk to her so she blocked my number.   So I ask you fair redditors, Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "TL;DR at the end, since I can ramble.\n\n  \n**Background:**\n\nSo I'm a bit of a loner.   My family lives far away, most of my true friends live far away, and I generally am much more comfortable alone with my dog than with any other person.  My family has learned to accept that I am not a reliable guest for holiday gatherings, so when the holidays come and I don't feel like driving 3 hours to be uncomfortable in a crowd, everyone just gets it and moves on with their plans.  \n\nLast year my personal solitude festival got cancelled when a coworker who I'm pretty chummy with at work heard about my plans to do absolutely nothing for Christmas and was horrified at the idea of *someone being alone at Christmas.*  He invited me to his home since they didn't have anything special planned, have no kids, and his parents were on a cruise or something.  I didn't want to make him understand how happy I am when I can look forward to a quiet day of not being bothered, so I said yes, bought them a gift and made the effort.   \n\nI pretty much hate all kinds of socializing, so when I go to a new gathering of this type and don't return feeling like a complete waste of skin, it's a victory.  Anyway, the people were mellow, the food was good, the gifts were no more awkward than coworker gifts tend to be.  It almost went fine, except for one thing.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nSometime after dinner he shows me his cool new security system which has a video doorbell and about a half dozen cameras constantly recording and cloud saving the video around the INSIDE of the house.   Now at this point, I should mention I am what doctors refer to as a bit of a fat fuck.  Whenever I do go out and socialize I am consumed by shame a rage about being overweight and can barely think of anything other than how I must look like shit, and I'm probably making people uncomfortable, and everyone has got to be noticing that I'm sweating in a room they find cool, etc. etc.  The mere idea that someone would take out their phone and start taking pictures is a nightmare for me, because then it all gets ten times worse in my mind since now there's time to scrutinize the image forever and do god knows what with it.  \n\nAnd here's my gracious host showing me cloud storage video of me hugging his wife when they greeted me at the door in which I look like a fleece rhinoceros trying to smother a harp seal to death.  I wanted to nope the fuck out of there like he'd just thrown a million spiders on me but he was just beaming at me saying \"how cool is that\"?!  So I pretended everything was fine, went home mentally shitting myself and tried to just forget about it for the next year.\n\n**The Offense:** \n\nBasically, that time of year came again, I am hoping to do absolutely nothing (and the coworker knows) and he's invited me over again.  And I want to say \"hell, no!\".  He's cool and his wife is nice, but his home is basically a torture device designed to inflict the most punishment possible on an anxiety case like me.   I can't just say \"no\" because he knows I don't have other plans, and I still don't want him thinking nothing is a better option than his place.  So, would I be the asshole if I just said it really freaks me out to spend an evening under personal surveillance??  I realize I'm overly sensitive to it because of my anxieties, but do I get a pass because of that?  Is there any chance that this is something normal people find creepy too? \n\nTL;DR Last year, I had Xmas dinner at a friend's house and was so weirded out about being on camera the whole time, I don't want to accept his invitation to do the same again this year.",

      "description": "I've been friends with Sarah since we were in the 7th grade, not BEST friends but always tight. Like 3rd tier BFF, if you know what I'm saying. Anyway - there's a guy in our friend group, Dylan, who I used to be in a FWB relationship with when we all lived in the same town. No one really knew about it, but I'm sure it got around a little. Idc. I moved colleges though, and nearly 3 years passed since I spoke more than a 'Happy birthday' or 'merry christmas' to either Dylan or Sarah. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I moved back home, one of the first people I reconnected with was Sarah. We went to dinner and she and I ended up having a long, 2hr+ conversation in her car about how she and Dylan had been hanging out a lot together a year before, and she'd fallen in love - only to be rejected by him later. I felt bad for her because I thought it was such a long time to still be so hurt over a boy. I was going through a break-up at that time too so we bonded that night, but got caught up in life and didn't see each other again for like 5 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 months later I'm at a local party and Dylan is there. We're really flirty and touchy and end up making out near the end of the night, and I know some of my mutual friends told Sarah about it. I had totally forgotten she liked him. In my head i rationalized it by thinking it'd been nearly a year and a half since Sarah and Dylan, so hopefully she was over him and didn't feel betrayed by me. I told myself I would have to be super discrete if I rekindled the FWB w Dylan, but we kind of haven't been. Since then to now there's been 2 parties were Sarah will be in the vicinity and he and I are being flirtatious and end up leaving together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my head I feel like its logically okay and not my responsibility. But another part of me feels guilty and like I should have been more sensitive to Sarah on the basis of some kind of girl-code. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; my close friend told me she had a short-lived thing with a mutual guy-friend who I used to f\\*ck during freshman yr of college. He curved her 1 year ago. 6 mo later I f\\*cked him again casually, and I'm pretty sure she knows. I don't know what to think or how to feel about my actions. ",

      "description": "I’m 24 and currently in grad school. My friend, who’s 23, got engaged a few months ago and married officially in December. She had to get married early since she’s in the military and wanted to get reassigned with her fiancé, and there was a deadline coming up. She did have a few family members and such at the December wedding, but now she’s having a larger “wedding” and reception in April. We were pretty close in high school. We competed in the same sport, took very similar classes, and hung out with the same people. I wouldn’t call her a best friend, and she wouldn’t call me one either I’m sure, but we spent a lot of time together over the course of 4 years. Since graduating, we rarely speak. We might see each other once a year around Christmas, but other than that we never talk. Nevertheless, I received an invite to her wedding about a month ago and RSVPd “no”today, explaining that I can’t really afford to go right now with a graduate student salary. Part of me thinks that there will be so many people at the wedding that she won’t even notice I’m not there. The same part also thinks that she’s only inviting me because she feels like she has to. Another part of me, however, feels really shitty about RSVPing “no” because her inviting me suggests she does want me there and isn’t just inviting me to be nice. (There really isn’t a point to niceties anymore since we live so far away from each other and have no need to maintain a relationship). \n\nAside from not feeling like we have a strong enough friendship for it to matter whether or not I go, I’m also not in a great position to attend. Money is tight since I’m in grad school. I have some saved up so could technically attend, but it would be a huge hit that I’m not entirely comfortable taking (with hotel, airfare, transportation, and a gift it would cost around $800). It’s also the end of my first year in school, and mid-April is right when finals will be starting. I need to do well in these finals in order to prepare myself for my comprehensive exams that will take place shortly after finals. Taking a weekend off doesn’t seem like a big deal, but I’m worried about doing too much and burning out when it counts.\n\nBasically, I feel like I have conflicting responsibilities. I can either be financially and academically responsible and not attend, or I could take on the responsibility to be there for an old friend on a day that means a lot to her (without knowing whether or not my presence means anything at all). Ultimately, I feel like it’s more  important to focus on studying and being financially secure than attending the wedding of a friend I rarely speak to anymore. AITA for deciding not to go? ",

      "description": "In the beginning of January I organized a social gathering at my flat to play a few board games and play some video games at the end of the month.\nThere would of been about 12 people in total but a few didn’t reply so maybe about 9 said they were coming.\n\nDay comes. I get a cancellation in the morning due to a friends brother passing out meaning 2 people wouldn’t be coming the two people were a relationship). I felt this was understandable. \n\nI texted another friend to see if him and his girlfriend were coming they originally said they were. Didn’t get a reply.\n\nThen I texted another friend who said he was coming not just once but twice, on the day I first organized the gathering and a few days later.\n\nHe didn’t reply till about 2 hours before my gathering was about to happen (on a Sunday at about 18:00) He told me he had work to do.\n\nAt this point ill admit I got a little annoyed only two people were now coming to something I organized a few weeks beforehand. So I kinda just went out at the last minute friend.  I told it it was a f*cking piss take that people have no communication. I had also spent a bit of money on this event I bought like 6 other controllers and some food and drink.\n\nI told him why didn’t he just text me earlier at least. I mean if you have work (he works as Tech support and no he doesn’t have to drop everything if he gets a call) they tend to give you  plenty of notice to come in.\n\nA few hours later his wife (they married quite young and they even have a kid) telling me how dare I speak to last minute friend like that. And basically told me she won’t be inviting me to any future events. I had calmed down a little by then and I did eventually apologize to the guy but I don’t think I was particularly that harsh on him. I did still say I think I had enough reason to be a little annoyed at people. Anyway his wife’s basically kicked me out of the friendship group and blocked me on social media.\n\nOh and I did eventually get a text from another friend who originally said they could make it (he would have brought his girlfriend as well).\n\nHe told me he was at work. This was at 11pm....\n\nI decided not to reply to him Incase of any other future drama. But I think he knows I’m pissed off with him as well.\n\nAnyway do you guys think IATA?\n",

      "description": "Hi fellow assholes, or not assholes, or whatever!\nI am on the fence about this, I've felt really weird about it all from the beginning, and my family and I just don't know what to think about the situation in its entirety. Link for screenshots included!\n\nLet's start from the beginning, April 2018. She lived in an apartment in our hometown that was leased by her deployed military fiance. My brother and his high school friends played basketball at the courts there, conveniently located just outside her building. They all got to talking one day, these 17 year old boys thought she was hot shit, and all fell in love with her. She would bring them all into her apartment, they'd hang out, party, and prob do a bunch of things that older sisters don't want to know about. For reference, I'm a year older than she is. For whatever reason, she became infatuated with my brother. They started a relationship. Our parents found out and weren't happy; mostly because he was a minor, but also because she was cheating on her fiance. They were worried this dude was gonna catch her and my brother together and that some bad things would happen.  \n\nShe broke it off with her fiance to be in a relationship with my brother and moved home to her family in another state. When her family asked why she was leaving her fiance, she said he was abusive to her and she was no longer safe (I can't say whether that is true or untrue, but doubt, seeing as he had been deployed for at least 4 months before she moved back to her parents). My brother graduated and turned 18. This is his first relationship, and they've been together ever since. \n\nHe just went to visit her from Feb 16-19, this year. They had a great time. But I guess people and feelings change. Friday, my brother broke up with her. I'm not entirely certain on all of the details as I haven't really heard her side of things, but I know he felt like they didnt have much in common, and he wants to focus on going to college. He wasn't a jerk about it, and she even posted (publicly) about how she respected how maturely he handled it on Facebook.\nTuesday, I get a call from my mom. \"Well, you know how I used to joke how [youngest brother] would make me a grandma first? Yeah.\" Surprise, ex girlfriend is allegedly pregnant.\nI gathered my thoughts, consulted some wise people on the subject, talked to my brother about it and asked his permission to speak with her about it (yes), and then very carefully concocted a Facebook message to confront her with. \nThe timeline doesn't make sense to me and I feel like she is lying to try and get him to feel sorry for breaking her heart. I genuinely felt that if she didn't have anything to hide, sending me a picture of the UA results would be okay. \n\nSo, I ask you, r/AmITheAsshole ?? \nLink to ss of messages and the events that have transpired: https://imgur.com/a/L2IyMKi",

This leaves my passenger side with a crap ton of room and allows me not to worry. \n\nThis doesn't leave much room for me to get out or the person next to me to get in so I always try to park in the last spot but it's not always available. I pull in my mirrors when next to another large vehicle to try and help with the spacing but am I still the asshole for knowingly giving the other person less room to get in and out if I'm still technically in my spot?

      "description": "I'm a senior in high school and graduation is coming up. In my high school we do a graduation ceremony in the day then a graduation banquet at night. I will go to my graduation ceremony but I don't want to go to my graduation banquet. The biggest reasons why I don't want to go, are because its kind of pricey (I would need to pay for the banquet ticket and buying a dress) and I honestly can't justify spending so much money on something I don't consider to be worth it to me. I recently got accepted to a very good university, that's not in my city, so I would have to move. That's going to drive up my university costs so I would much rather save my money for university or spend it on something that would better my daily life. All of my friends are now going (or got pressured in to going by other friends) but I still don't want to go. They keep arguing with me about \"how it's a once in a lifetime chance\", \"how I'll regret it\" and \"how I was going to end up buying some materialistic item instead so I should my money to pay for this once in a lifetime chance.\" But I don't find just eating a dinner and dancing around to be something super interesting to me. All of my friends are working some type of job on the side so it is much easier for them to afford it but I don't work so its harder for me. They have said that I should ask my parents for the money (I know if I ask them they'll say yes) but I would feel so bad and that it's a waste by using their hard earned money for something I don't that I don't even want to go to.\n\nThe graduation banquet is set up so you are in tables of typically 8 people. You have to hand in a sheet of paper with whose going to be in your table (if you don't have 8 people they'll put other random people at your table). I told my friends back in September/October that I didn't want to go and back then they simply said that I should go but they didn't push it. Come April now, when you have to hand in the sheet with whose going to be at your table, they are struggling to find 8 people to fill their table. I told them back in September/October that I didn't want to go so they would have plenty of time to find someone else to join their table. I told one of my friends (who keeps really pushing me to go) that she has other friends and she can ask one of her other friends to join the table. She said that because some of my friends (the ones who got pressured in to going) said maybe, that they told their other friends that some people were still deciding and that couldn't guarantee their other friends a spot at the table. So by now, most of their other friends already found a different table. But she also replied asking why I was so mean. I'm honestly clueless as to why she thinks I was being so mean just because I didn't want to go to my graduation banquet.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to goto my own graduation?",

      "description": "I'm 32M, my sister is 29F. She has anger issues, goes on endless racist, homophobic and otherwise hate-filled rants, is verbally abusive, controlling and demanding(you have to tip toe around her because the smallest thing can set her off in a screaming fit). I have tried many times to reason with her regarding her bigotry, but she always sees it as an attack and shouts me down.\n\nHowever, we were very close for many years. I knew she was troubled and as the older sibling was thinking that in talking it through with her, being there for her, just generally showing her love, that she would slowly start growing out of it. She has always been possessive and controlling of me, but I know it is because she doesn't know better, she can't handle her emotions and withdrawing from her would reinforce her feelings of being all alone against the world.\n\nShe is also smart, talented, can be very charming, and has been my emotional support quite a few times. For a period of a few months we were working together through our childhood issues by talking about it, retelling memories, etc. We were pretty tight.\n\nLast year I entered a new relationship. My sister immediately wanted all of us to \"hang out\". There were a few instances where she acted overly jealous but most of it was underhanded slights and just general talking over my GF and dominating the conversation. My GF was very patient but after a few months snapped back at her. This resulted in my sister exploding in a storm of verbal assault, calling my GF \"a b\\*tch\", \"crazy\", \"Nobody wants you here\", \"I can see right through you\", and finally she slammed her against a wall.\n\nAfter this I told her that her behavior crossed a line,  and that for the time being I need my distance.\n\nHer reply was very angry, she said my GF brainwashed me, clearly my GF wanted to pull me away from the family, and that she will never forget or forgive how I abandoned my sister. She accepted zero responsibility for her own actions. She said she did her best to accept my GF without even knowing her, always inviting her or us to hang out together, and basically had an open heart. She said my whole view of the events is misconstrued.\n\nThis happened 3 months ago. We haven't spoken or interacted since. Her birthday is on Saturday, and I am torn between not acknowledging it at all or sending her a simple \"Happy Birthday\". I do not want to break the NC, but I also know that in her mind she's been wronged, abandoned, it will be very hurtful if I don't wish her a happy birthday. Birthdays have always been a big deal in the family and this would be the first one in our lives that I would not acknowledge.\n\nWIBTA if I don't wish her a happy birthday? I could really appreciate some honest feedback from people. I am genuinely torn by feelings of guilt.",

      "description": "For the reddit secret Santa exchange, there are very simple rules. Spend around 20 USD (more if you want), actually send your gift to your person, confirm the receipt of your gift. You can elect to match with people from a different country if you want, but there’s a big warning that international shipping can be quite expensive that you must acknowledge. \n\nI signed up be to an international reddit secret Santa this year, primarily because I thought it would be really fun and interesting to give / receive a little unfamiliar culture with some international neighbors. \n\nI did a ton of research into my match’s country, figured out what they do and do not have access to there, and sent a little of what their particular interest was along with a little culture from my country. \n\nI had a blast being a Santa! I had a ton of fun doing the research and learning about their culture, the things they are into, etc. It was quite expensive to ship from my country to theirs (around 80 USD), but I kind of expected that, and reddit did have a *very explicit* warning about this, so no worries there. \n\nAs much fun as I had gifting (believe me, It was a ton of fun), I was just as excited to have an encounter with someone outside of my country. When my gift was marked as shipped, I was super excited. I spent a ton of time tracking what times they accessed my information, when stuff was marked as shipped, etc to try to figure out where they were from. \n\nIt took roughly a week for me to see the tracking number. Seeing where it entered my country, I was trying even more to try to figure out where it came from based on geography and international flights, etc. I was so excited. \n\nThen I received my gift. It was from a local vendor, nothing that I wouldn’t have been able to pick up from any local shop. Didn’t seem to be very thoughtful, even for a domestic gift. Where I thought the package entered my country is actually where it originated. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I am very appreciative that someone spent the time and money to get something for me. The cost is irrelevant to me, i know that there is a ~20 USD recommendation and all of that. What I was excited about was receiving something, ya know, foreign. What’s the point of signing up to participate internationally if you’re not going to share something special with another part of the world? \n\nAm I the asshole for being disappointed / was I expecting too much?

      "description": "So this might get a bit confusing. \n\nAlbert - A guy I dated for two years from 16-18 years old \nPatricia - The new girl Albert is dating now\nLarry - Another guy I dated for a few months when I was 18\nOzzy - My friend of many years\nAlicia - Ozzy’s girlfriend of a year. \n\nBasically, I dated Albert for a few years when I was younger (I am almost twenty now.) Albert and Ozzy are best friends, and Larry is also good friends with those two. \n\nAlbert was not a good boyfriend. Albert cheated on me countless times, continuously lied to me, was very manipulative, and broke up with me less than twenty four hours after my dad died. Albert really broke my heart and my trust in relationships for a long time, and even though I am very over him by now, I still have lingering traits like still having trouble talking about my feelings with my dad passing away and having trouble trusting people I love. \n\nLarry was also not a good boyfriend, and our relationship was very short. Larry was... very forceful. He disrespected my boundaries and pulled a lot of stuff that made me deeply uncomfortable and still makes me want to gag whenever I hear his name. (sexual assault warning) For example he would start to have sex with me while I was sleeping and wouldn’t let me go back to sleep until he finished. He wouldn’t let me say no to sex, basically. He would do things like call me a slut, a whore, try doing Butt stuff when NONE of that was discussed beforehand and totally threw me off guard. He would guilt trip me into having sex with him constantly and he even got me and my best friend in a very compromising position and took advantage of both of us when he knew we were very, very, very drunk. \n\nThe problem is that I do genuinely like Ozzy and I did like Alicia as well up until a few days ago. Basically me and Alicia got in an argument because everyone HATES Patricia. I’ve never talked to her or hung out with her myself, and frankly don’t care much for her since she likes to talk shit on me without knowing me, but I don’t know her. Ozzy and Alicia have said that Patricia has cheated on Albert several times, physically and mentally abuses him, and is overall just a terrible and vile human being. So from that alone I can deduce that me and Patricia probably wouldn’t get along. \n\nAlicia, after hating Patricia for ages, suddenly posted on social media about how Patricia is actually the sweetest person ever! I tried talking to her about it because I considered Alicia and I to be good friends and basically was like “Yo that’s a little weird because like you said she is this and did this and blah blah, how come you like her all of a sudden?” Not in a “you’re not allowed to like her way” but in a “you totally hated this person and now you’re buddies, that’s a little weird, what happened?” way. Alicia got really mad at me and thought it was rude of me to question her friendship with Patricia and hasn’t talked to me since even though I have offered to discuss things over coffee to apologize. \n\nThe problem is that the more I think about it, the more I wonder if I really even want Alicia and Ozzy in my life. I like Ozzy and enjoy his friendship but I keep going back to idea of them just not caring about how their friends treat people if they aren’t the ones affected. \n\nSomething that I keep thinking about is when Alicia asked me why I hate Larry so much when Albert is the one who basically broke my heart. I didn’t get into the knitty gritty details as I did here, but I basically told Alicia how he wouldn’t take no for an answer, he was very forceful, and had sex with me while I was sleeping. Instead of answering in an even slightly acceptable way she just said “oh well his current girlfriend hasn’t said anything like that so I guess he’s gotten better” like... ok I guess? Cool if he’s gotten better but that doesn’t change what he’s done to me! \n\nOzzy and Alicia are both very proud of not letting other people’s opinions change their judgment on someone until they get to know that person themselves. I think that’s fine when it comes to “oh I don’t like that person they are rude” but is really different when it comes to “that person is abusive, that person is a rapist” \n\nCause at the end of the day I feel like I don’t care if a specific person is nice to ME, if they’ve done horrible shit like that to other people then I don’t want them around me. Maybe that’s just the way I am. Ozzy even acknowledges that Albert was absolutely terrible to me yet it’s like he doesn’t even care. \n\nI guess at the end of the day I’m left wondering if I really want these people in my life because it leaves me wondering how much they really care about me. I’ve cut people off that I considered a friend once I found out that they had sexually assaulted my other friend. I’ve stopped being friends with people for much less because if someone can treat my friend like that, they can certainly (and usually do) end up screwing me over later as well, and I just don’t want that in my life. I feel like they just don’t care about me all that much if they continue to be friends with people who have hurt me so badly. \n\nSo, AITA for not really wanting them in my life anymore? \n\nTL;DR - I’m friends with a couple who are friends with two of my ex-boyfriends that cheated on me, broke up with me the day after my dad died, and sexually assaulted me. I kind of don’t want to be their friends anymore after drama has come to a head. ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to put my dog down?",
      "description": "  \n\nFor some background, my dog is a White German Shepherd, not gonna say her name for anonymity reasons. She's about seven years old now, fairly good health besides glaucoma. With this, the fluid pressure in her eyes builds which causes pain, and she's slowly lost her vision. About two years ago the vet informed us she'd eventually have to have her eyes removed so she wouldn't be living in pain, and we all seemed to agree that'd be the way to go.\n\nCome yesterday, my mom calls me and informs me that we have to decide between putting the dog down and going through with the surgery. To my surprise, she strongly wants to put the dog down. The dog has needed the surgery for awhile now, but my mom kept putting it off as she couldn't stand the thought of the dog not having eyes. I've been far away at uni for the past four years, and she hasn't been in too much noticeable pain, so it was kinda just a \"this doesn't need to be immediately addressed, I'll cross that bridge when I get there\" type of thing.\n\nMy mom's main reasons for wanting to put the dog down are 1. She is now alone at home as my brother is also at school, albeit about five minutes from home, and 2. The surgery is too expensive. For point 1, I kinda see her point of view, as she did become the primary caretaker of the dog once I left for school, and has also footed the bill for vets visits, food, and medicine. As for the surgery being too expensive, I'm baffled - we're solidly upper-middle class at this point, I've seen her drop $2k on lamps. A $3k surgery isn't cheap, but it's nowhere near unmanageable.\n\nI can't really wrap my head around wanting to put the dog down when the surgery would be minimal and immediately improve her quality of life, things I learned after calling and discussing with the vet. I'm even willing to come back home over a break or long weekend/skip a week or two of class in order to handle the surgery and immediate recovery care, and foot the bill.\n\nOver several phone conversations where I tried to lay this out, my mom essentially just got more and more accusatory, claiming I'm not grateful for all she's done for me, it's not fair that she's had to care for the dog all by herself, she's so busy and stressed from work, breaking down crying, etc.\n\nAt this point she's agreed to let me schedule the surgery, and depending on the timeline I will be heading home to deal with immediate recovery care. After graduation in June I'll also be taking the dog with me, which was the plan anyway. In my eyes my mom’s view is basically \"this surgery is kinda difficult, so let's just put the dog down\" which I'm appalled by. I'm also furious that I've had to take everything into my own hands and fight her on this, when I'm the furthest from home and least able to help at the current moment (brother is non-committal about helping care for the dog). Am I just overreacting?",

      "description": "This is currently happening. Long story not short, my parents moved to the south from Indiana (both U.S.A.) for my dad’s new job. They need help with my brother, keeping up the house, they miss me, it would be cheaper all around, I could attend graduate school down there and have a “base/supply depot” so to speak. We are all a very close family. My girlfriend, who we will call J, who is a junior and I’m a senior, both in college, (3rdvs 4thyear), knows I’m moving so that’s not the issue. However, I’m going to be taking an EMT course, Spanish med course, and applying for a hospital job, a fire cadet position, and applying for physician assistant schools all over the summer, so me moving has been set in stone. Got carried away with the backstory. J knows I’m moving, and I had told her about all the stuff I’m doing this summer, however it apparently didn’t register that “yes, that is this summer, as in, less than 2 months”. She found out today that I won’t be here for her birthday mid-summer, and guys… you should have seen her face drop when she found out. As such, I am moving early May, 2 days after graduation. As far as I know, she is thinking like late May or even early June. I have been pushing to hang out a lot more, which doesn’t take convincing as we both love each other, so we’ve been with each other almost every day for 6+ hours, she’s sleeping at my place every night, we workout together, we see each other before a few of our classes, dates galore, etc. She already secured a job in the same town I will be living after she graduates in a year, we will be together after a year but… a year is a long time and flying to see each other isn’t cheap. So, AITA for not knowing how to tell her that I’m moving so soon? I already [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b26nps/how_do_i_tell_my_girlfriend_i_will_be_moving_1000/) on r/advice for HOW to tell her. But can you confirm my theory here? ",

To be honest, it makes me very uncomfortable.”\n\nShe seemed taken aback, and reiterated that other people used to bully her with the term.

      "description": "Wouldn't necessarily call myself an asshole, but I can see how I could be considered bitchy in this situation.\n\nA little background: \n\nI met my bestfriend almost 2 years ago when we were freshman suitemates. She comes from a background that has led her to being a bit stingy with money. Now, I'm not judging her for that considering I also come from a semi-similar, just not as strict, background. \n\nThe stituation: \n\nDuring the summer, she asked me if she could use my Netflix account. I said yes, of course, and had to increase the subscription to the 2 screens at a time, just in case we were watching it at the same time. She offered to venmo me half of the subscription every month, but she never did and I never asked because it was automatic billing and I never checked my account to see when the money was coming out of it. \n\nA few months after her, another friend (who she doesnt know that well) asked for my subscription and so I had to increase to the 2-4 screens tier. They actually paid me at the beginning of each month, but like I said, I never checked my account (they have the same bank as me) so the money would go in and I wouldn't notice.\n\nFast forward to last month, I lost my wallet and obviously cancelled my card. This apparently occurred before Netflix was due and they asked her to update the billing info when she signed on one day. She offered to add her card, since I hadn't gotten my new one yet.\n\nNetflix recently increased their pricing, so instead of $13.99, the subscription that we have is now $15.99. Today, she texted me asking if we could downgrade to the $8.99 plan. I told her not really, since there were 3 people on the plan and it wouldn't make sense for us to essentially have to police each other's Netflix times. She then tried to argue that we most likely won't be watching Netflix at the same time, because she barely watches it. I already know this to be a lie, since she practically uses it everyday.\n\nI told her that I would just switch it back to my card instead. She still insisted on switching it, even though she hasn't paid me a cent from the previous months, so it wouldn't be like she would pay me when I switched it back. So I told her I would just get my own account and keep it simple. I honestly only said that because I knew that she wouldn't protest because that would mean her having to pay $8.99 herself, if she still wanted the service. I knew it was manipulatory, but I was honestly annoyed that she was mincing over a $2.00  difference because it just happened to be on her card for a single month, but when I was paying the $13.99/month subscription, she didn't offer or even cared that I was paying that much.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So context I (23f) and my husband (26m) have been together for 8 years and we're currently expecting our first child. I'm currently 27 weeks pregnant and am an anxious mess even without being pregnant. We've been having a lot of discussions about what will be allowed around the baby and one thing I'm very adamant about is no drinking around the baby. Now little things like Mike's and the \"bitch\" beers I'm fine with. But I do have a problem with actual liquor. My husband doesn't really drink but he will if someone offers and this is where I get into my situation.\n\nMy DH doesn't have a lot of friends and he never really has, so whenever he makes a new one, absolutely great I'm happy for him. But he recently made a new work friend who drinks a little too much for my liking and he gets my husband to drink. I've talked to my husband about before but idk if I'm actually getting through to him because he keeps drinking with this friend and he gets drunk. He gets to the point of he's puking and can barely move. I don't want this around my house right now. We're getting ready for a new baby and I can't have anyone drunk around them. I'm starting to feel bad about a lot of things I'm asking regarding this baby and I feel like asking my husband to not have this friend at our house is starting cross the line of asking too much. The friend is normally over when I'm not home because he doesn't want to intrude on us but I don't really appreciate coming home to a drunk husband. And there will be times, like when I'm working, that DH will be home alone with baby. So after typing out a novel (sorry I'm bad at wording things and wanted to make myself clear as possible) I'm going to ask, WIBTA if I asked my husband to not have this friend over if they are going to be drinking? \n\n(Also my DH is not a justno. He's actually amazing but he can a push over sometimes and doesn't always know when to say no.)",

      "description": "\n\nHi. So this happened a few weeks ago, but it’s still bothering me because I don’t know. A few weeks ago, I went to target to pick up a few things. I was looking at socks when an old friend of mine who just started working there says hi to me. She comes up to my basket and fumbles with what I was about to buy and at the same time, I threw a pair of cute socks in there. She leaves and I continue shopping. I was now near the toy section and for some reason, I decided against the socks and just put them by the toys. I know ugh, I’m legit dumb but who doesn’t put things where they don’t belong?\n\nWell the sorry doesn’t end there. I forgot about the old friend who was working there and when I got home, she snap chatted the sock and called me out by name and saying I was lazy. Even though I thought that she overreacted, I just replied to the snap saying, “Lol oops” trying to think it wasn’t a big deal.  Yesterday, I went to Target again and she says to me, “Remember to put your sh** away” before rolling her eyes. I was annoyed so I said back, “Get a new job if you don’t like it” I said this while laughing kind of and walked away. Nothing else has happened but I feel like she overreacted but I don’t know. AITA??",

She went from throwing up to being put into a medically induced coma while she's fighting a severe blood infection. Currently shes hooked up to a bunch of machines that are essentially keeping her alive while they pump her full of antibiotics\nSomeone told my cousin this and she preceded to post on Facebook that my sister might not make it through the night and she was requesting prayers. I was a little annoyed about this because I know she's obsessed with attention and this was a thinly veiled attempt to get said attention. What really pissed me off was that she decided to link it to my sister's profile, where my sisters kid could see this shit about her mom possibly dying overnight. We had chosen not to tell him yet as the doctors weren't sure what her Chances were yet.\nMy nephew ended up finding out via this Facebook post, all he had know prevot was that his mom was sick and she was receiving the best care possible. Needless to say, he freaked out.\nOnce I found out I was furious. This cousin isn't even very close to my sister and she did this shit without even considering how it would effect my nephew not did she clear it with is before posting this. I blew up, I sent her a long message that basically said I was blown away by her sheer lack of tact or foresight. Now she's crying And feels like a piece of shit but I honestly don't feel bad for her.\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Hi Reddit, I’m hoping to get some genuine, unbiased feedback. Also I’m on mobile so my apologies. \n\nTo make a loooong story short my parents divorced when I was a few months old. I was extremely lucky however and my family (both sides) stayed really close. I grew up spending a ton of time with my dad’s side of the family and we love each other immensely. Over the years life has happened. Nothing bad but people have moved (uncle and grandma live in a city about 8 hours away, aunt started a business etc). We were still close but busy. The past few years though have changed significantly. I used to see my aunt and her husband (and my adult cousin) about 2 times a month. As of this writing it’s been two YEARS since I’ve seen them. Just recently I saw my uncle and his partner were in town visiting my aunt. I have not seen them in 7 years. Since my wedding. \n\nTo say I’m hurt would be an understatement. So we’re clear, to my knowledge nothing has happed. I can think of no reason they would be mad at me. I’ve invited them to my house on a number of occasions and for whatever reason they haven’t made it. They adore my husband. I honestly don’t know but I’m hurt. \n\nI’ve been considering confronting them about it (not aggressively, just asking) but I’m worried that I’m being an asshole. Maybe I’m being too needy or I’m overlooking something. I’m not on drugs, I don’t lead a chaotic life. I’ve obviously grown up since being a kid but I don’t know why the sudden change. WIBTA if I asked them what was up? Or am I over-stepping my bounds? \n\nThanks guys. Any advice is appreciated. ",

But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I’m gonna play some games if she doesn’t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn’t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it’s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I’m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn’t a “plan.” I’m not going anywhere, I’ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn’t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her ‘she didn’t need to go out every time, I’m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.’ \n\nShe’s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out.

      "description": "Locations, dates, and situations have been slightly changed in the even that he/she/the son see this. This is gonna be a long one, so buckle up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the last 5 years my (M26) brother has been with his (F43) girlfriend(his first serious relationship) and has plans to marry her in the future. I've heard all sides of their relationship from my family (I've been away from my hometown due to work) and it has only been negative, they have made a point to support their relationship regardless of how they feel about her and to not take out their negative feelings on her. One thing of note is that my brother is quite passive and easy-going when it comes to dealing with issues; he tends to be non-confrontational about his problems. My brother has had aspirations to join the Intelligence Community (IC)/FBI for some time. His plan for the last few years was to join the Border Patrol and (somehow?) obtain a clearance, eventually transferring to the FBI/CIA. I've explained to him that this is not the way the IC works and that if he wants a strong foot in the door he either needs to change his major to something intelligence/law enforcement related or join the military. I was a Non Commissioned Officer in the Army and have knowledge of how this process works so he understands that when I say that this is what he needs to do in order to achieve his dreams, he doesn't take it lightly. In the past he has been strongly against joining the military, but we'll touch on that later. \n\nI met her for the first time earlier in 2018 when we all met up in NYC for a holiday. The trip was a big deal for my brother, mainly for financial reasons; they both work minimum wage jobs (earning a little under $10/h). Having to buy 3 tickets (her (M16) son was not originally invited, but girlfriend insisted that he be there for the trip) put HUGE financial strain on my brother because he was cornered into paying for the majority of the trip by the girlfriend. My brother has fantasized about living in/visiting NYC for as long as I've known him, having the opportunity to go there (albeit only for a few days) would have been the highlight of his year. He had planned out everything they wanted to do during the trip and consulted with me to make sure it was all feasible due to the short amount of time they were there (I lived in NYC for about 5 years at this point). I told him that it was absolutely do-able and to pull the trigger on the purchases. She had hardly contributed financially. \n\nMorning of day 2, the girlfriend and the son decided that they did not want to take part in ANY OF THE EVENTS that he had on the itinerary, without giving any reason. Girlfriend ended up staying in the hotel watching TV and the son played Fortnite on his phone for the duration of the trip. My brother pleaded and pleaded to get permission to do these things with (M27) me and my (F27) girlfriend, she did not let him. In the end, he did two things on the itinerary.\n\n\\*\\*Takeaway: She has no concern for his financial stability and no respect for his desire to spend time with family.\\*\\*\n\nLater in the year, my family (Parents and brother) had decided to visit me in Colorado. They had decided to drive out of the way to pick up my brother in Las Vegas and continue the trip to me. When they arrived, the girlfriend threw a fit because she was not invited. She played the \"If I don't get to go, you don't get to go\" card, so she caved and was invited last minute. The trip was only supposed to last for two days, during which we had decided to take part in a number of activities that involved alcohol. When they arrived in CO she removed herself from the group and spent the majority of her time at my home watching TV after numerous invites to join us at the activities. I made a point to confirm that she would be still our designated driver since 1. I was new to the area and didn't have any friends to drive us home and 2. my girlfriend was out of town for business, we needed her to drive or we would incur a very pricey uber/taxi home, she agreed and we left. At the end of the night, she flat out refused to come and get us without giving any reason to justify other than \"I just don't want to anymore\". I was very against this decision and after some arguing with my brother to convince her otherwise, I paid for an uber home.   \n\\*\\*Takeaway: She has no respect for his time spent alone with family/family in general\\*\\*\n\nLets move forward to Thanksgiving. One thing that you should know is that our grandfather was diagnosed with Cancer and has taken a turn for the worst over the last year, all signs show that he will not make it to Thanksgiving 2019. That being said, our parents were adamant that we be there for the holiday so that we can spend some time with our grandfather before he passes. My brother opted to drive the 6 hours for the holiday alone so that both he and his girlfriend could be with their respective sides of the family, she declined that stated that she would be willing to go to Thanksgiving with our family (around 20 people were getting together) and skip seeing her family but only if he were to pay for the hotels/gas/meals during their stay (Tuesday-Friday). He agreed. During the drive up on that Tuesday evening she began to complain about how she wanted to spend Thanksgiving with her family and that she didn't want to go with him in the first place. Things got to the point where my brother had caved in order to \"save the relationship\" and agreed to only stay for one night (Tuesday) and leave the next morning, missing Thanksgiving. He cancelled his non-refundable hotel stay and drove home the next morning. My parents/grandparents caught wind of this and decided that this was important enough to completely change the plans of the whole group and have Thanksgiving dinner on Wednesday instead of Thursday. It was mayhem to say the least and effectively ruined Thanksgiving for the family.\n\n\\*\\*Takeaway: She reinforces the lack of respect for his family and financial stability, as well as displaying serious episodes of manipulative behavior and control aimed towards my brother\\*\\*\n\nAfter the Thanksgiving fallout and some pressuring for information, my brother explained to me that he is the one responsible for making dinner, picking up the son from school, paying the majority of the bills, sacrificing his time with family so that she (they) can be with hers instead, and that she does not want to have any more children, while he does. Based off of our conversation, I can tell that he is not happy in this relationship and that he is desperately trying to take control of his life and find a way out of this situation that allows him to both keep her in his life and achieve his career/life goals.\n\nI used this opportunity to pitch the military route to him again, and to my surprise he entertained the idea and started asking questions. I have had this conversation planned out for some time and I executed it perfectly, he's on board. He knows that the only reasonable way he is going to achieve his goals is by joining the military, obtaining relevant job experience, and earning a clearance. We had made plans that same week for me drive to him, set up an appointment with a Military recruiter, and have a talk about options for enlistment. No papers signed, no fitness test, just talking. He knew that the girlfriend was not going to be happy about this and said that he would talk with her about this, she lost her shit and ignored him for two days. We ended up not going to a recruiter. I still consider this a step in the right direction because he now understands that this is the path to success, something he did not understand before. \n\nAt this point, my family has started to become more vocal about their opinions of the girlfriend to me (I had previously asked them to stop trying to convince me to form an opinion of someone I had never met, they respected that). They stated that as parents, if they were to voice their concerns about her to my brother it would only drive the two of them closer and him further away from family.\n\nIt was around this time that I had formulated my opinion of her and come up with some reasoning to explain her actions. Remember how I mentioned the Military/Border Patrol? She has thrown a fit every time that he has brought it up since the original conversation. Why? Because it requires him to be away from her for an extended period of time, thus, putting more strain on her as a single-parent (this is literally her only argument). The only acceptable situation that she will allow these things to happen is to wait until her son is graduated from high school and moved out. \\*\\*After seeing the relationship that they have maintained and the lack of empathy and respect that she has for my brother, I can only reason that she is keeping him around in order to provide for her son, eventually leaving him once he graduates.\\*\\* \n\n\\*\\*Takeaway: She does not want him to achieve his career/life goals and uses him only to provide for her son\\*\\*\n\nLet's jump to December 23rd at 11:30pm. I'm fast asleep, but my brother, his girlfriend, and my parents are all in the living room watching TV. The plan for the 24th was to meet up for dinner at 6:00pm and open presents (all of the presents) at my Dad's parents house. The girlfriend knows that this is the only time that 1. my brother will be seeing the grandparents during the holidays and 2. receiving presents from the family. She says to my brother that she is adamant about leaving at 3:00pm and gives no reason to justify other than \"I just want to\". My dad hears this and decides to remain silent and let them figure it out, assuming that there is no way that she would take Christmas away from him. She started throwing a fit in front of the family and accused my brother of being incons",

      "description": "Made on a throwaway because I don't want to hurt the guy's feelings. Honestly I think I am starting to be the asshole here but I'm just kind of looking for advice on what to do.\n\nI'm a manger at a store where I spend hours at a time standing at the back counter making food for customers. Recently one of our regular employees was made full-time so he's back there with me a lot now, something like 3 out of 5 days a week. He's a nice guy and we have a bit in common, but he has no idea how to gauge when people aren't listening to him. He talks VERY fast and can do so without breathing. (I timed him and he's gone 8-12 minute stints of gabbing with nothing but grunts from me.) I myself am pretty chatty but he's outright stifling. \n\nI've worked with him for a bit over a year and normally would try to tune him out, but now I'm with him way more often and it's a lot harder. I need to mention that I have moderate OCD and am routinely boggled by all the light and sound going on around me, but something about this dude's voice just absolutely flips a switch in me. I get so short and angry. I'm generally a really friendly, patient person but I've snapped at him more than once (\"Hey [guy] I have SEEN that movie, you don't have to tell me the whole damn plot.\") I feel like a huge dick letting myself get so wound up that I might one day shout at him, especially since it's my mental condition that gets me so wired. That being said, we are short-staffed and I can't exactly request not to be put on any more shifts with him. I talked to my MHP and she said as silly as it sounds, the stress at work of being nonstop overstimulated all day isn't great for my health.\n\nSo, reddit, I have a few options in mind, and I'd like your advice on what might be the right course of action:\n1. Request to, as best as I can, be moved to shifts away from him\n2. Explain to him my condition and try to find a nice way to say \"the sound of your voice makes me want to rip my teeth out\"\n3. Find a new job (kind of already in that boat but it's slow going)\n4. Flex my manager power to keep him in different departments even though I know damn well he does this job better than a lot of our other employees\n\nI know my condition might make this a less-my-fault kind of scenario, but if I have some control over my environment then I'm at least partly responsible for how I respond to it. AITA for lowkey hating this genuinely nice dude for such a dumb reason, and WIBTA for trying to avoid him at work?",

      "description": "This happened a while ago so bear with me as I try to recollect what happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI planned to go to a concert months in advance with my girlfriend at the time for New Years Eve. She agreed, we bought our tickets, housing, and travel and everything was set. We drive a few hours to get there a few days before to settle down and explore, but the day of the concert she gets sick (a cold maybe) and decides not to go to the concert. We have a few other friends coming along, so I was really agitated and repeatedly (maybe 3 times) asked her to confirm if she really didn't want to go. This also wasn't the first time she bailed the day before on a concert, last time also because she got sick, so understandably I was pretty emotional but it was out of our control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 2 hours before the concert I called her one last time to make sure she didn't want to go. I had to resell her ticket last minute because I didn't want it to be wasted, so I wanted to 100% make sure she wasn't going. She flipped out over the phone and turned that against me saying it was her money and I didn't have the right to tell her what to do with it and that I didn't care about her health because I kept trying to convince her to go to the concert despite being sick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI figured that if a friend bailed on me last minute, I would also try and convince them to reconsider, especially when we all planned this months ago. I didn't want to bail on my other friends going as well, it wasn't fair to them as we all took a road trip for this concert, so I went to the concert without her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then attacked me saying if I really wanted to spend NYE with her, I shouldn't have gone to the concert and spent time with her (took care of her while she was sick) even though she agreed to spend NYE with me at the concert. I later found out that she went to another party with her female friends and had drinks while \"sick,\" claiming that she didn't want to be alone because I still ended up going to the concert. To be honest, she did not seem sick at all (when I came back at 3am she was still up and being active), though that's not for me to decide. I felt betrayed and when I confronted her she said she felt down at the time and didn't want to go to the concert because it could've made her sickness worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for trying to sell her ticket?

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom\n\nThis is going to require a bit of backstory. There's a a TL;DR at the bottom, but the history is rather relevant to me questioning whether I'm the Asshole:\n\nBackground: We both attend the same graduate program, she is a year above me but the school is incredibly small. For the sake of this discussion I'll call her Patrice.\n\nAugust/September:\n\n* Having never spoken before, we match on Bumble. She does not initiate the conversation and the match expires. We discover we are in the same class and end up talking. \n\n* We end up grabbing drinks one night after class, staying up way too late, but nothing physical happens\n\n* We hang out a few more times before anything physical happens. Over the course of September we hang out and hook up but don't go on any dates but talk regularly \n\nOctober: \n\n* Patrice comes to me and tells me that a woman in our class has been spreading rumors that I am suicidal. [As an aside, I'm not, and I am not judging people are are, but this saga is a tangent that involved me having to speak to the Dean of Students and was an incredibly stressful situation].\n\n* Hearing about these rumors, I am stressed and upset. However, Patrice adds to the stress by, during the same conversation, asking how we are. I tell her that I really can't handle talking about that and that I need to address these rumors.\n\n* Later that same day, walking to my car, she blocks me and demands that I talk to her about this. Angry, I say \"Are you really making one of the worst days I've had to deal with in a long time about you?\" and I walk around her to my car.\n\n* Following that, I pull back from the friendship. \n\nNovember:\n\n* About a month and a half later, during thanksgiving break, I extend an apology to Patrice. I tell her that I'm sorry for just pulling away but that I was angry about how she had handled that day.\n\n* We begin talking and eventually hang out a few more times, nothing physical happens.\n\nDecember:\n\n* We fall back into the pattern of hanging out, and sleeping together. \n\n* After finals finished, Patrice, myself and several mutual friends go out bar hopping to celebrate. Around 9 o'clock, I decide I need to go home and let my dog out and that I wanted to call the night before I got too drunk.\n\n* Later that night, I get a call from Patrice. Confused, I pick up. What proceeded was a vicious slew of feelings. She told me things such as \"You're a piece of shit for not taking me home, how dare you not fuck me tonight;\" \"You're going to be just like you fucking dad [my dad is a bipolar drug-addict and Patrice is well aware that turning out like my father is one of my biggest fears];\" \"You really should hate yourself as much as you say you do.\" Among some other seriously heinous things. Patrice hangs up on me.\n\n* I call her back, because at this point I'm concerned. I'm livid at what she's said but I'm worried about what is happening and we proceed to talk on the phone for another 20 minutes where she vents, apologizes, and goes to bed.\n\n* The next day, not remembering much of the conversation, I recount to Patrice what was said. She feels horrible, tells me she never meant any of it, that what she said is not how she feels, etc.\n\n* I go about a week without really wanting anything to do with her, but after a lot of apologies and hanging out with mutual friends, we begin hanging out again.\n\nJanuary: \n\n* On NYE, our mutual friends joke that \"we all know this is a relationship.\" I am uncomfortable with this statement but Patrice doesn't seem phased. I tried to talk about whether that is what she wants but she says \"I've never really thought about it after you've said that isn't where this will go.\" \n\n* Over the course of the end of December and the start of January, I start feeling bad that things aren't moving forward. For a number of reasons (hung up on my ex, commitment issues after my last relationship, etc.), I felt uncomfortable about moving forward, but Patrice is really compassionate and cares about me and so I try pushing past my discomfort. We grab dinner and a movie and the night goes okay. It never really felt like a date, just felt like us as friends hanging out.\n\nNow, to the actual situation. I've been doing a lot of thinking on this and for several reasons I decided I'm uncomfortable with proceeding with the physical aspect of our friendship. I know she is her own woman and that she can make her own decisions, and I like to feel like I've been upfront and honest with her about what this is and what this would and would not be, however I still feel like I'm taking advantage of someone that is holding out that I will develop the feelings that I believe she has. I can't shake the things she said on that phone call about how I treat her horribly and that I'm leading her on. \n\nSo, last night, I tell her about this discomfort. She says a lot of what I said about, that she knows what she's gotten into, that she doesn't want anything more than we're currently doing and that she likes seeing me/talking with me/sleeping with me. I push back and eventually tell her I need to take a step back from the physical aspect.\n\nThis is where things took a turn. She shelled up and told me that she doesn't believe that I'm being upfront with her, that there must be something else going on here and that she is confused. I tell her that conveying my feelings wasn't exactly comfortable so I'm not sure why she would think I was making them up or not being upfront with them. \n\nShe tells me I'm entitled to wanting to take a step-back but that she is entitled to be upset. And I agree. She is entitled to feel anyway she wants, but the preceding conversation takes on a different light when it took such a sharp turn after I really put my foot down and said I didn't want to sleep with each other anymore.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole? I want to say no one suck here, that we are both adults with different feelings and emotions and that no one is really the bad guy here, but I can't shake the fact that I'm the asshole for continuing this. On the other hand, she is her own person and it feels awfully paternalistic or patronizing to say I should be looking out for her in all this. I don't know.\n\nTL;DR: Told my friend that I think I need to take a step-back from the physical aspect of our friendship after a complicated history where I believe she has feelings that I can't reciprocate and that has been a rollercoaster of events including a drunken phone call several weeks ago berating me, making suicide rumors, regarding me, more about herself than anything, and several other worrying moments that have make me feel continuing the physical aspect of our friendship is a bad idea.

      "description": "TLDR: broke up with a girl because of severe depression, sought out therapy, got better, tried to reconnect as friends, got screamed at and called a very shitty person.\n\nSo about a year ago, I went through a very confusing bout of mental illness. I was absolutely convinced I had schizophrenia, because I kept having very strange experiences and symptoms I had never had before. Long story short, it just ended up being a case of severe depression and other life stresses working together.\n\nI had been dating this girl for about 6 months before this, but felt it was best to break up with her because I wasn’t in the right head space for a relationship. I told her there was potential in the future to pick back up (after she asked me), and everything seemed to be fine. We talked for about a month after, I kept her updated on my mental health, and everything seemed fine. I genuinely valued her friendship, but apparently she wasn’t okay with it.\n\nShe eventually ghosted me, and I assumed she met somebody new and moved on. Which was completely fine, I hold no grudges. Fast forward about 3 months, and I reached out to her just to touch base and see how she was. At first it seemed fine, but then she got incredibly angry at me. She accused me of “hurting her worse than anyone else had.” And that “I’m a selfish person, because I broke up with her without even consulting her about my problems.” \n\nI was obviously very surprised, I had no idea she had all of this built up resentment. I was very apologetic because I felt bad if I truly did hurt her this way, and she basically told me to “just leave her alone.” The last thing she also said was “tell your cat I said hi.” Which I thought was really weird.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? Was breaking up with her really selfish? I personally don’t think so, but this is something that has periodically bothered me and I’m curious about what Reddit thinks.\n\nAny input is appreciated.",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI'm a female and in my early 20s. I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?",

      "description": "I\\[25f\\] have been going out with my bf\\[25m\\] for a few months now. He's wonderful but he's really bad at communicating when he's upset and tends to shut down. We're also long distance which I think adds to this.\n\nHe texted me about an issue the other day and asked if I was mad. I said no. He responded that my reply sounded passive aggressive. I sent him another text with an explanation that I wasn't mad about this issue, just disappointed. I didn't hear from him so I tried to call him to reassure him I wasn't mad. He didnt pick up so I left a voicemail. I didn't hear from him again for over 8 hours, and keep in mind he had the day off. In that time, I was thinking the whole day that he had convinced himself that I was being passive aggressive and that he got mad about it and thats why I didnt hear from him. Like I said, he has a tendency to shut down and not want to talk when he's upset. So, thinking he was upset, I tried to call 2 more times and sent 4 texts over the span of the 8 hours asking if he was ok.\n\nAt the end of the day he said he was away from his phone but saw that I tried to contact him \"like 20 times\". I said I thought he was angry at me and I just wanted to reach out, and I thought the amount I tried to contact him was pretty appropriate. He implied that I was being crazy and possessive. I said if he had just acknowledged my initial message by saying \"cool, I have to go Im gonna be busy for the next while\", that would have been totally fine. We're long distance so I have stressed that communicating is super important and he has agreed before, but now hes kind of throwing it in my face, saying \"Well you were saying before that we should talk all the time and now I have to let you know what Im doing?\" I could see how things could be interpreted that way, but honestly not talking for 8 hours was a weirdly long time for us and I thought he was mad. I'm not expecting him to text me every hour of every day, and usually we have times where we don't chat for a few hours and thats totally fine by me, but this time it seemed like he deliberately ignored me and I just wanted to talk it through. AITA?",

      "description": "I recently won a ‘fuck you’ amount of money. I won’t say exactly how much but it’s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It’s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n",

      "description": "So this all started around October and is still happening. I am a senior in college, and I've been pretty depressed that no one has even remotely liked me for my entirety of college career. Towards the end of October, I was flirting with a guy, and he was flirting with me back. He even asked me out for coffee to get to know me better which I gladly accepted. We ended up talking for over 4 hours and grabbing dinner afterwards. This would happen a few more times with the same outcome. \n\nWe were pretty much going on weekly dates at this point but he decided to drop on me that he was doing the same thing with another girl at the same time. I was, of course, devastated which lead to confrontation. He said that he wanted to be friends with both of us and not chose until he knows his decision. I accepted this and still stayed friends with him. \n\nWe decided to set boundaries which we both did not follow. We continued to hang out almost everyday and acting like a couple. We would even go on dates sometimes. I was having a good time because I was guessing that he was going to chose me at the end of the day because he said he was physically more attracted to me. \n\nOn night he walked me to my car and we kissed. While this may not seem like a big deal, it was my first kiss. (Yes I know that I'm way behind socially). It wasn't just one kiss too. We pretty much made out by the side of my car. Throughout our relationship he promised that if he kissed me, it would be the moment that he chose me. After we left, I was on an extreme high and started to tell my friends that we were going to actually date at this point. \n\nThat night he texted me about how we should not hang out anymore. I was confused and a little hurt. I asked him why not, and he said \"I have made my decision. I need to protect (other girl) so I chose her.\" I was of course devastated and confused. He said that he wanted to still be my friend because he likes talking with me. We talked after all of this in person so that I could explain why I was so hurt by his choices. At the end of the conversation, he said that he most likely won't date her for awhile because his integrity was completely destroyed. \n\nAll of this is background for the actual part I want judgement. Since he still wants to be my friend, I tried to explain what I wanted in a friend. I said that I like actually talking with my friends on a regular basis. So he does text me now and again to really no avail. Every time we talk it is bland and like we don't know what to talk about anymore. Most of the time it ends with me complaining that he doesn't actually talk anymore because he responds with one word answers. \n\nOn the 24th of December we were actually having a good conversation. I was scrolling through Facebook and saw that him and the other girl were actually in a relationship. I, of course, went off on him because he should have had the decency to actually tell me that they were together rather than me finding it while on Facebook. \n\nHe became angry and told me that we should not talk anymore if I was going to not forgive him for his actions. He decided that we should take a break so I wouldn't yell at him and give me time to forgive him. I will admit that I have yelled at him too much but the things I've said included: \"you never cared for my feelings because you won't hurt someone like that\" and \"I can't trust anything you said because you made so many promises and broke them.\" \n\nMost of his friends care now calling me crazy because I am still mad at him. The other girl has tried to reach out and try to be my friend. When I tried to explain to her that I can't be her friend she became upset and said it was all in my head. So am I the asshole because I'm still angry at the guy?\n\nTLDR: I was caught in a love triangle where the guy stole my first kiss then gets mad when I yell at him for choosing the other girl. ",

Fast forward to February and after talking to people online as well as close friends I realised that I’m actually gray asexual (very rarely have sexual desires). \n\nAt first I was going to tell her and here her thoughts but I remembered she has very strong views on sexuality since she’s a catholic. I decided I wanted to end it as I was confident she wouldn’t understand if I tried to explain to her how I feel. She already has issues with me being an atheist so this would probs be a deal breaker. \n\nSo my question is would I be wrong for ending it on the premise of just wanting to be friends??\n\nP.s.

Doesn't even clean itself. Just lays under the coffee table. Then, she got another kitty months later, without consulting me. I'm no asshole, so I didn't make a big deal about it. But then she puts her kitty in \"cute\" suits. The cat proceeds to rip it off any chance it gets, obviously not liking the restriction. Did I mention my roommate is also allergic to cats? So she pushes them out of her room all day and maybe only interacts with them for a couple minutes a day (feeding). I started letting her new kitty into my room (since the other one hisses when i try to reach for it) whenever she left for school or work and proceed to take off the suits and entertain it/pet it. I bought a hair removal tool  and cleaned her kitty tonight, since she left for the weekend (doesn't even ask me to feed/water her cats bowls btw, I just do it if i notice she has been gone long) and was thinking to myself \"I should take this kitty when I move out.\" Obviously illegal but would you consider me an asshole for such an act/previous acts?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I stow my roommates kitty in my room when shes gone, since she neglects the fuck out of it.

      "description": "Been with my girl for over 2 years and we plan on geting a place together soon. We both are very excited for this but im a little worried because she wants to bring her dog with.\n\n I love my gf and I dont hate animals but i dont think I can deal with hers. Its not trained and it makes mess every where nonstop. When i goto her house some rooms are full of flies from piles of dogshit, and giant pee puddles all over. The only time it gets cleaned is when her family starts getting very upset about the smell.\n\nSince we been together she has moved twice and each time the house was clean to begin with, but it never stayed that way very long.\n\nI tried talking to her about this and she says she just needs someone to help take care of the dog. I dont have experience with large animals, and wont have time to always cleanup after. I know I will be the only one trying to keep our home clean. I suggested that she leave dog with her sister and mom, but shes afraid they will get rid of.\n",

      "description": "I am a man in my early 20s, but because of my mental issues (I have anti social personality disorder) I have never been able to find a real friend who shares my interest. I had girlfriends in high school but it was sort of a detached relationship and I ghosted them after I graduated.\n\nI just can't connect with people very well. I started spending more and more time online, finding chat rooms and forming bonds with people that I would easily break after I got bored. Then, in a local chatroom, I met Samantha. \n\nShe was older than me, but not yet 30. She is an EMT, and very cute. I myself am a firefighter but for a different county, but we had a lot in common to talk about. She hasn't been diagnosed but she shares my interests and my dark sense of humor.\n\nShe is also very kind too me. Sending me birthday wishes and christmas greetings, I would do the same. When I finally showed her my face I was afraid she would rebuff me as I have a pretty bad scar on my face from my childhood, but she was fine with me and said I was very handsome.\n\nMainly I enjoyed just talking with her and opening up about things I could never tell anyone else, things I haven't ever told my therapist. She makes me feel \"human\".\n\nWe eventually meet up since we only live like 30 minutes away. The first thing I notice is that shes wearing a wedding ring. Shes married. I felt my heart sink. She apologizes to me and said that she has been married for four years, and that she wanted to stop our convos but she feels like she has a connection to me.\n\nI asked her what she wanted, and she said that she needs to remain faithful because of her daughter. I tell her ok, and we decide just to be friends.\n\nThat didn't last. All of our convos end up being about how much we care about one another. We meet weekly now, we don't have sex, we just sort of bond together. Talk, hold  hands. I have never had this connection with someone before.\n\nWe also sext, though we make it clear that we wont make it physical. She tells me she loves me more than her husband.\n\nI am so torn, because I feel like this is my soulmate. We've been doing this for eight months. Its getting more and more intense, and I know I love her.\n\nBut I also sometimes wish I never met her, because shes married with a daughter. I want her so bad. She tells me the same. We both say we love each other.\n\nI know, that the correct thing to do is to break it off, but shes the one person ive been able to truly be myself around. The one person I really feel for. Its like someone else has my heart chained up, and theres no way for me to get it back.\n\nAm I the asshole for not breaking it off?",

      "description": "This story has a lot of facets; a lot of interested parties. I'll try to be succinct... three years ago, our dog (then a puppy) was hit by a car and broke both hind legs and punctured a lung. After an ER visit and a long hospital stay with two surgeries as well as a 6 month rehab process and about $9k in debt, he's back to normal. Full use of both rear legs, no lasting issues with lungs or anything. My girlfriend at the time (now my wife) was ***offered*** a loan of basically any amount by her sister to help out. My girlfriend declined at the time because we had covered the cost of his treatment with credit cards.\n\nFast forward a few more months and we're having trouble paying off the credit card debt and staying afloat on our other debt (we had just bought our house literally two weeks prior to the accident). Again, ***without solicitation***, her sister ***offered*** a loan of basically any amount to help out. After some discussion we did decide to take her up on the offer this time and asked for about $4k to pay off one of the credit cards (we used two and the second was almost paid off already). Immediately after giving us the money, and with both of us as witnesses, the sister said not to worry about paying her back, but ***whenever we had saved up the money to pay her back, use the money instead to build a fence in our backyard*** to keep the dog penned in so he doesn't get hit again. This was both sensible and very kind of her, but complications soon arose.\n\nA couple more months down the road and me and my girlfriend get married. My now sister-in-law and father-in-law get together and pay for the fence to be built in our yard. This \"wedding present\" as it was referred to by both the sister-in-law and the father-in-law seemingly nullified the $4k we owed sister-in-law on paper. I say \"on paper\" because neither me nor my wife believed that this ended our obligation to pay her back in some way. We weren't sure exactly what to do, and she kept insisting that we shouldn't worry about it, so eventually we did stop worrying about it.\n\nSome more time passes and my wife landed a really sweet job and I got promoted, so we're making ends meet and then some; and we've had the opportunity to start saving more and just being more financially solid. In case it wasn't obvious, my sister-in-law is already financially pretty solid (this whole family that I married in to is very financially savvy), and even though she's on her own and doesn't have a super-high-paying job, she was still able to save up *almost* enough to put a great down payment on her dream house.\n\n...*Almost*.\n\nTo get a 20% down payment on her mortgage and still cover her closing costs she needs, you guessed it, $4k, which she asked my wife for just the other day.\n\nNow, a little about my wife and I and our saving habits. We have our retirement accounts, our long-term savings, and our short-term savings. As I said, we were fortunate enough to have some good luck in our careers, but that was only just recently (like, it was less than a year ago that we stopped living paycheck-to-paycheck), so while we are doing much better, we are far from wealthy. We don't touch our retirement; our long-term saving goal right now is *solely* to make a cross-country move in the next few years so we can start a family in a place we really want to live, and short-term goals are a few minor home renovations and a new vehicle. We were trying to get the vehicle before it started snowing this year, but, if we give my sister-in-law that money there's no way it can happen... so... I advised my wife not to give her the money ***at this time*** because of our need for a vehicle.\n\nThe shit storm this has caused with her family was something I wasn't prepared for. That's probably a story for another sub, so long story short, just yesterday we relented and wife is going to give her the money out of short-term savings. So one of us is going without 4WD again this winter (mucho inportante in the area we live). So, am I the asshole? I genuinely don't know. Sister-in-law got really pushy about it considering she kept telling us not to worry about it. But the fact that we didn't pay for the fence... just don't know.",

      "description": "So my neighbor and his wife were very nice to us when we first moved to the neighborhood, brought us wine and brownies and has had us over to their house for snacks and conversation. They’ve lived in the neighborhood for 15+ years and there are other neighbors on the street that have been for same amount of time, if not longer. We moved in this past March. \n\nSince then he’s been asking us a lot of favors, pick up the mail for them while they’re out of town (that’s fine, that’s normal), check up on his god while he’s out (okay, sure), try to hook up his nephew from India with a job with my boyfriend’s company (um), and then on Halloween he tried to invite himself into our house and we were kinda like “ummm, what?” (had our dab kit out, wasn’t expecting company).\n\nThis week he asked me, not my boyfriend, to ship a package for him to his son who’s in a mental facility while he’s out of town. He dropped it off on Monday and said it *has* to be shipped on Thursday so it will arrive on Friday. He asked to me to get a receipt after I drop it off. I thought the whole thing was kind of weird, do they not have UPS stores in the Bay Area (where he went(obviously they do)) and couldn’t he have just shipped it on Thursday and paid for next day delivery? I reluctantly agreed because I’m a pushover and my boyfriend was pretty upset because to him it seemed like our neighbor was taking advantage of my niceness. \n\nFor the record, we have never asked him for a favor for anything. We have reciprocated his niceness and brought him and his wife wine and cookies. I guess I’m confused why he didn’t ask any of the other people who live here who he has known for many years...\n\nI don’t love when people put their responsibilities on me, but again, I’m a pushover. He texted me this morning and reminded me to drop it off and get a receipt, I replied okay, but that I wasn’t comfortable doing this in the future. He replied, “understood” but my boyfriend was still pretty pissed at the whole situation and called him and told him that he didn’t appreciate him asking his girlfriend to do things for him and that we would not be shipping the package and left it on his front porch. \n\nAITA for agreeing to drop it off and then not going through with it? I feel weird about it, but at the end of the day it’s not my responsibility, right?\n",

      "description": "I suffer from an illness that causes me to have regular bouts of vertigo.  These present as bad balance, walking around stumbling a little bit, needing to steady myself.  This same illness also makes me slur my speech on occasion.  So the other day I was at a dinner with my wife and her parents and I got up to go to the bathroom.  It was a bad day illness wise so I was stumbling a fair bit and my speech wasn’t at all clear.  I tripped and fell over in the restaurant and it was a bit of a scene.\n\nAfter the restaurant we went back to their house, my wife drove my car because of my episode and I swear I saw them exchange a look of “I told you so” when I handed her the keys.  We were staying with her family overnight because we live about two hours away, and didn’t want to drive four hours for a dinner in one day.  So her mom turns on the news and we all settle in.  At some point during the evening both of my in laws had excused themselves to the kitchen, and a bit later I went to get myself some water, still having trouble walking but not quite as bad as earlier.  I over heard them say “[my name] is absolutely trashed, I can’t believe it, our daughter married a drunk”.  I knew right then that this was why they’d disapproved of me our whole marriage.  They thought I’m an alcoholic!  I walked right in and demanded to know what they were talking about, and then just lost it.  I told them I knew they thought I’m an alcoholic, that I’m drunk right now, and that I’m not.  My FIL laughed in my face and said “son you’re slurring right now why don’t you go to bed we can talk in the morning” and I just LOST IT.\n\nI started yelling at them, why the fuck would you assume I’m lying about this, hasn’t wife told you about my illness, I’m sick of being treated like a degenerate because I’m fucking sick, etc etc. This isn’t an uncommon reaction to seeing someone with my illness, and I just let out all of my frustration from every time I’ve been treated like a drunkard because of it.  There was name calling and four letter words and honestly from the time I started to the time I stopped I don’t think they said a single word.  I only stopped when my wife came in and intervened.  \n\nThey then said that I had to leave their house immediately, so me and my wife are staying at a motel tonight.  \n\nMy wife is furious at me, she says that I should not have spoken to them that way, and she says that they can believe what they believe.   She’s furious with me and says that I did have some wine so what do I expect them to think \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year. Within the first month of our dating she told me she had sexual trauma from a past relationship. It was frequent and long term, and as a result she periodically goes through periods of near asexuality. \n\nBy the end of the first month we had sex, at her assurance that it was what she wanted. It was good. It would continue to happen at least once a week, sometimes more. I could always tell I was more interested in initiating it than she was. She always seemed to enjoy it, responding in the right ways, but she would show a lot of concern as to whether I was enjoying it, even asking me to be more audible. \n\nWe moved in together about three months ago and did it maybe two times in the first month. Then it all fell apart when she had a really bad ptsd episode. I asked for sex and she said yes, but when we were done she started crying as I comforted her and she kept saying sorry and that she couldnt figure out why she was so “broken”. It was horrible and scarred me significantly to see her like that and know that I caused it. It was a month before I even thought about sex in any way again. \n\nNow Im beginning to feel very lonely. We’re best friends and enjoy each others company, but it’s hard to get intimacy of any kind out of her. I bring up sex and she insists that she’s trying to get better, but Im seeing no improvement, Im getting impatient, and I don’t want to just be friends who live together. However, I never push the subject when she says she isn’t ready yet. \n\ntl;dr gf and I haven’t had sex in two months because of traumatic episode. Should I continue to remind her that I want to have sex, or AITA?\n\n",

I'm a heterosexual male into heterosexual/bisexual females, I have nothing against transgendered people but I am not sexually attracted to them.\n\nI matched with a girl on tinder a couple nights ago, got her number pretty quickly and hit it off well. We were talking about a lot of stuff, I mentioned I played video games, she said she did too, got her steam username. \n\nQuick interjection: When she (Tinder girl) gave me her steam username she said it was from her ex-girlfriend but she (Tinder girl) kept the account. I assumed she was bisexual at this point.\n\nI went to go add her and decided to google her username too to see where else it might pop up. Found some hits on deviantart. Eventually found a link to her Tumblr, active like a year ago. She put she was \"M\" in her bio. Also found her insta, posts from a year or two ago are all about trans awareness, non-binary, referring to herself as a \"demiboy\".\n\nI mean I guess I'm just asking the internet for confirmation at this point but she's transgender, right? She never explicitly stated it in her tinder profile anywhere, which I've seen many transgendered people do before.\n\n",

      "description": "Okay just to get this out of the way - I live in a country where it's extremely common to have house help. Context: I'm 19 and live with my parents so they're her employers not me. \n\nSo our help has been with us for over 4 years and over the years she's been taking a bunch of clothes from my closet without permission and I only find out when I suddenly see her wearing them around the house. I try to let it go because I understand that maybe she needs them more than I do. But she's been taking a bunch of clothes I still plan on wearing. She took a bunch of school shirts last year that I still needed, and she's been taking some of my favorite event shirts from my organization that I certainly did not want to dispose of. Recently I saw her wearing the shirt I've spent quite a while looking for, and a lot of these shirts are really sentimental to me. It makes me really sad that they're gone and I'm really pissed off now. Plus she's a lot bigger than I am so all the shirts aren't only really worn out now but also stretched. \n\nI'm definitely not going to ask for them back but I feel like a jerk for being upset. How can I get upset at someone who probably needs these clothes more than I do? I feel really guilty for being mad and want to bring the issue up soon but thought of confrontation just makes me feel like a terrible person. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: House helps been taking my clothes and its making me increasingly upset",

You would have thought I raised a gun at the person for the way my friends reacted. They pushed my finger down and jumped all over for me for pointing, telling me how rude I was being. Now I understand that in a normal setting, pointing is rude because the person on the receiving end doesn't know if you are saying something mean about them. But if you are cosplaying at a convention, wouldn't it be expected to be pointed at? I was so taken aback by their reaction, that I really am worried that I was doing something wrong.

When one of them is absent, she asks where they are and says “he’s doing a (name of the worker) thing”.\n\nIm not gonna lie, when we started high school, we were both kinda “obsessed” but I soon realized that it was creepy and we shouldn’t stalk these two dudes. She, on the other hand, is still going on with it and takes photos of them. I kinda go off and try to talk to her but slowly end up yelling for her to stop taking photos but she says that she doesn’t care what happens. But I do. \n\nEarlier today I tried to talk to her and she said “why are you even friends with me then?” which made me feel like I was overreacting. \nI love her pieces but I’m scared for her.

      "description": "I'll provide as much context as I can, but details may be slightly hazy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis time of year, as many of you know, is finals week for students across the US, with me being no exception. In 2 hours I will be taking an advanced Calculus final, of which I am woefully underprepared. In an attempt to correct this conundrum, I have spent the past two days in my university library, going over every note and practice problem I could find. My favorite room in the library is the Map Room, way down in the basement. It is relatively unknown and is used by most students because you can typically hear a pin drop from 30 feet away. My potentially asshole-ish moment came after about 10 hours going over Power Series Representation, when two young woman walk into my sanctuary of silence and begin screeching and cackling like old cartoon witches. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, as they were not the only ones talking, as there were lots of study groups having quiet conversations, perhaps they were just a little too excited when coming in? I'm not petty, I'll let it slide. Well after about 20 minutes of what must have been a life changing comedy routine based on the sounds they were making, they decide it fully appropriate to start facetiming their friend (without headphones I might add, I know, the audacity.) Well this does not sit so well with me. Do these ladies not know there are students with finals all around them, and that they're in a LIBRARY? Well being the level headed person that I am, I approached them and decided to speak my mind. What I failed to realize, however, is that because everyone else in the room was as silent as the dead, as soon as I got the attention of the charming harpies sitting across from me I would have the attention of EVERYONE within 50 feet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout knowing that important detail, I tried to express how rude I thought it was to be so oblivious to your surroundings, and said something along the lines of \"Hello, I'm not sure how aware you two are, but there are students with finals trying to study, myself included, are you are being \\*incredibly\\* loud.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, due to the graveyard like silence that had taken over the room, I had essentially just told these two young woman to shut the f\\*ck up in front of about 50 people. I was met with an awkward \"Okay...\" followed by the most deafening silence I have ever heard. Have you ever heard 50 people all trying not to be the first person to say something? It's pretty funny unless you're the one who caused it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell to make a long story short, they settled down, but the friends I was studying with laughed and called me a dick for confronting them, but I thought I was well within my rights to tell them to be quiet. So the question is, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for going home with a girl's friend?",
      "description": "This happened about a year ago and still bothers me to this day.\n\nI met a girl on Tinder. One of those 'she's out of my league' type girls, that I am amazed I even had the courage to message (as I rarely do). The conversations went surprisingly well and we seemed to hit it off, so I nervously asked her to get coffee at a local laid-back coffee shop. She agreed and we met for coffee as planned. We stayed at the coffee shop just getting to know one another for what ended up being 4 hours, at which time she asked if it was okay that she goes next door to a bar for her friends birthday. Obviously I said that was more than okay and we did the usual Midwestern pleasantries before saying goodbye. That same night she texted me apologizing for cutting the date 'short', and telling me how much she enjoyed the time.\n\nWe continued texting and that weekend ended up meeting up at one of the local bars. Come bar close, I offered to walk her and her friends home, to which she said yes. She was oddly quiet on the walk home, and I assumed that in her mind she thought that I was attempting to make a move to stay the night with her. When we reached her house I walked her to the door, gave her a hug, and said good night. She seemed confused by me saying that and asked if I was staying, I told her I hadn't intended to but that I would if she liked. She told me to come in and we drank a few glasses of water before heading to bed. We laid in bed and I put my arm around her, but that was the extent of that. I wasn't sure how to read the awkwardness that had suddenly come upon the situation. In the morning I left for work before she awoke and sent her a text thanking her for allowing me to stay the night.\n\nNot wanting to be overbearing, I gave her space. A week went by and I sent her a message saying hey would you like to get coffee again sometime? She told me she was busy that week. So the next week I asked if she had any time available to grab coffee or dinner. I didn't receive anything from her. It seemed odd to me as everything seemed to be going well, yet ended so abruptly. Then one day, a friend of mine sent me a text that said \"Didn't you go on a date with \\*Girl 1\\*?\" with a twitter screen shot of one of this girl's friend that read \"Currently waiting outside of Chipotle in the car because the guy who has been stalking \\*Girl 1\\* has been inside for the last 20 minutes\". This kinda took me back, as I hadn't said anything since she began ghosting me... I just kinda took it. So I, childishly, went to this girls twitter and replied to her tweet saying \"Hey, sorry about that. Next time I'll try to eat faster for you.\" To which she just responded back with more of calling me a stalker of her twitter now.\n\nAfter that I just let it all go. Maybe a month and a half or so later, I started talking to a different girl I had met through Tinder. She told me that she was good friends with Girl 1 and asked if that bothered me, to which I told her it didn't. One weekend out at the bars she messaged me and asked me to meet her at one of the bars. When I eventually got there, she had already left for the night. However, she messaged me and asked me to come and stay at her house. When I got to her house I was greeted at the door by one of her roommates, one of the girls I walked home, who was incredibly nice and let me in. I was pretty drunk that night, but I remember the two of us kissing, her stopping to say \"you know I'm friends with Girl 1?\", saying yes and then continuing to make out before falling asleep. She woke up, late for work, in a panic trying to get ready. I went outside and scrapped the ice off her car for her to help in any way I could. She also became distant after that night.\n\nAbout a week later, I'm standing in line for a burrito with a friend after bar close. Out of the blue a couple girls cut in front of us... no big deal, there are plenty of burritos to go around. The group (consisting of girl 1 and a few friends) looks at who they just cut... realize it's me and vice versa. They begin berating me passive-aggressively by shit talking me to one another just loud enough for me and my friend to hear. I respond to this by saying \"damn dude, I gotta stop getting burritos.\" and all hell broke loose. Two of the girls turned around and got in my face spitting anything derogatory they could think of. Saying \"what piece of garbage gets with someones best friend in spite\". They even tried to enlist a couple guys in the area to help them by saying asinine things and trying to get them to fight me (I'm a bigger man, so luckily it deterred any physical altercation). This whole time, Girl 1 looked so uncomfortable and didn't say a word to escalate the situation, but she also didn't attempt to deescalate the situation. We ended up just walking away empty handed. This level of tension still exists with them anytime they see me at the bars.\n\nI know I'm an asshole for making you read all this but, given the situation, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Long post!!! Okay, so a little backstory is required. I'll try to make it quick, promise!   So my BIL (my fiances older brother) graduated college in May. He needed somewhere to stay for a few months until he could start a career pertaining to his degree. Cool, my fiance and I have our own house with a spare bedroom, so we welcome him in. In the very beginning we lay down that he would only be staying for 3 months but for 5 months ABSOLUTE MAX.   It is now November, and my fiance and I are ready to move to a new house (we rent, btw) and are on the search. \n\n I find the most perfect house for us and my BIL tours it with me and he sees how in love I and his brother are with this house. The only problem is that my fiance doesn't have great credit due to some past complications with the military, so there isn't a good chance of him being approved by the owner. We easily make the rent requirement, it's just that pesky credit. \n\n That's fine, my credit is good and so is my BIL's, so we ask him to think about putting his name on the new lease, since he would be MOVING WITH US INTO A NEW HOUSE FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME (hence over staying his welcome by even longer) and would be living there for the lease period. He thinks about it for a few days and eventually tells us no because \"he doesn't want to put his name on something he doesn't understand\" (?) and because “every horror story you hear is about a 20 year old who trusted someone with his credit” (???)  \n\n We are so livid that he has forgotten the tremendous favor we have done for him, because he has literally no friends or family he could stay with and makes absolutely no money to get his own place at his shitty waiter job. When I confronted him about not signing the lease, he tried to be a smart ass and he got extremely defensive, to the point where the conversation was unsalvageable (he's the kind of person where he is NEVER wrong). \n\n We are currently looking for a new place to live so we can kick him out. Am I the asshole for being pissed beyond belief and wanting to kick him out and honestly not caring what's next for him?",

      "description": "My ex and I were together for about two years. Out of nowhere they had a depressive episode and things just fell apart. In the following months, I tried to maintain contact. But, things were irreconcilable. During this same time, I abruptly lost my job and became unemployed. I am just now getting back on my feet. During the period after the episode, they gave me $200 to help me pay my bills. I always intended to repay them, but I was not expecting us to split up. Along with the check, they also left a couple of things at my place that I would also like to return. \n\nIt’s been almost a month since I’ve cut ties. They could use the money, but I also don’t want to bring up any pain that they may have put behind them. The only address I can send the items and the check is at their place of work. It’s a small office, and they usually collect the mail from the post office. \n\n",

      "description": "I'm using a throwaway because a few people in this story know my username. I'm going to use fake names.\n\nI'm 23 years old. I was raised Jewish, had a Bar Mitzvah. Both of my parents are Reform Jews, but I am an atheist (they both know this and are fine with it). My best friend, Russell, is also Jewish. All three have gone to Israel - Russell goes to Israel once per year.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Birthright Israel is an organization that sponsors free trips to Israel for people of Jewish heritage. You can be anywhere from 18-32, and they'll fly you there for free for 10 days (for the record, I don't know much about the actual program, and this information is from Wikipedia).\n\nMy parents, mom especially, and Russell want me to go in June, as soon as I graduate from college. My mom took a trip to Israel at my age and she said it changed her life, so that's why she wants me to go. My dad wants me to go for the same reason. Russell wants me to go because he feels like I'm not embracing my Judaism, and his embrace of his own heritage helped him in high school and college. I have NO INTEREST in going for the following reasons:\n\n- I'm not particularly connected with my heritage - outside of Russell, I have few Jewish friends.\n\n- I have a bad fear of flying that I have received therapy for, but it's still not something I want to do.\n\n- Politically, I think Israeli's occupation of the West Bank is both illegal and morally wrong and I have difficulty supporting the country. I also don't want to be judged for visiting.\n\n- I have access to information about my heritage and it has little to do with Israel (As far as I know I'm 100% Ashkenazi Jewish, and my ancestors are from Russia, Poland, and Hungary)\n\nSo I told my parents no, and I told Russell I wouldn't be going. My mom was especially upset because she wants me to go and experience it, but I just really do not want to. I also understand that it is a free trip and I don't have a job lined up for after college, which is why my mom and Russell really want me to go now. But I really do not want to. I would rather spend ten days at home than in Israel. Also, I'm only 23, and I have nearly a decade to change my mind.\n\nI'm stressed - I think I did the right thing for me, but I really upset my mom and Russell isn't too happy with me either (he wanted us to go together). AITA? No Jew ever wants to upset his mom.\n\nTL;DR: Being pressured to go on Birthright, don't really want to, but now I feel bad",

The thing is, it's smack dab in the middle of Richmond, Va. During the weekend around a bunch of museums. The hotel costs are almost $500. That's not including food and other things I need to get done to look nice for the wedding. I.e. hair and nails. (Side note I work in a soil and concrete lab so my nails look disgusting. It would be trashy to show up at a wedding with 6 inch long blond roots. The rest of my hair is a faded blue) Plus at the risk of sounding a bit selfish, my birthday is on the same day. So I'm giving up celebrating my birthday to celebrate thier wedding. I'm not saying that my presence is a gift enough. Im also not saying I need acknowledgement from them about my birthday on their wedding day. I'm not that important friend wise and its their day. Am I the asshole if I dont get them a wedding gift?",

      "description": "Will need to provide context to explain the situation\n\nAs a little precursor, I have Aspergers with one thing being for me that too much socialising can really stress me out. I go to uni with a friend I have who I've known for around 4 years at this point. We get on quite well, although there is a very strange habit that they have done over said time. It feels like they synchronise their schedule so that we happen to do the same actions around about the same time. Some of these make complete sense to me like same route home and going for lunch together, which im completely fine with and am happy with.\n\nWhere the issue in this lies for me is that this also applies to things such as going to the toilet. As soon as I say that I'm going to the toilet, they go to the toilet as well. I wouldn't really mind this so much if it wasn't for the fact this happens every single time without fail when we're together. This also applies to situations where I'm really wanting to spend time alone due to social burnout and I really just want time alone, but they change their route and time leaving to follow the same path as me. Its socially exhausting and tend to give more of a headache than anything. I try to at least hear them out since they are my friend and I just try to put up with it, although the talking becomes so one sided with the topics that I'm genuinely not interested in, its just them speaking on and on and on while I don't really say anything, due to a mix of not getting a chance to get a word in and at the time really not wanting to socialise.\n\nI do feel bad that sometimes I just completely shut down and basically nod to whatever is being said, not really listening but with them talking for hours each day to me already I just want time to hear my own thoughts and just to be able to be able to not have to socialise all the time which is something that freaks me out majorly if I get overloaded.\n\nLeading back to the question at hand though, I haven't said anything as of yet because I wanted to see what people here thought. I'll just note that despite what I've said, the person in question I do really like. They're a really cool person besides some of the odd synchronised schedule with whenever I seem to go somewhere like the bathroom. There's only so many times I can handle them talking on about something so much while I'm sitting on the toilet, while they're right there waiting for me. I don't really want to come across as an arse with this although its something thats just really been on my mind for a while.\n\nTLDR: I'm friends with someone, they talk to me ALOT, attempted conversation areas can be very unnerving, (such as bathroom/restrooms while im in a stall),conversations can become very one-sided at times, I struggle to handle all the conversations they want to have which causes me to burn out from talking, wanting to ask if they could try not to talk to me constantly or synchronise their schedules all the time to that we're on the same path).\n",

      "description": "My husband’s sister (we’ll call her Mandy) is a bitch. She orders everyone around like they’re her own personal servants (even her own mother who enables it), and she’s ALWAYS yelling, talking over people, and trying to control every situation. Simple things like how the family kids open their Christmas presents, how we order at restaurants, and how we play family games, how we stand for photos, etc., have to be controlled by her. I’ve given up fighting this for now because I can’t stand being around her let alone talk to her about something sensitive. \n\nShe’s also an anti-vax, stay-at-home mom who thinks that essential oils cure diseases. She is constantly bugging me to get in on her (pyramid scheme) products she sells on Facebook. She comes to my house to tell me that I will poison my future children with my cleaning wipes. I’m POSITIVE that my husband’s mom pays for a good portion of her living expenses as well (which would be fine if she had a real job and tried to improve herself). Basically, she is the textbook example of everything I loathe in a human being. \n\nSo...\n\nHer daughter is in kindergarten. I have seen her assignments first hand. I’ve also heard her read. She is functioning on grade level, and does not appear to struggle in school. \n\nMandy just texted me to ask if I will tutor her daughter one day per week because she is “struggling to sound out words” and gives her a hard time when she tries to practice with her. \n\nI know Mandy doesn’t plan to pay me because sh’s a bitch and has no extra money. \n\nI am a licensed teacher (k-5) with SO much on my plate. I really don’t want to give up a portion of the little free time I do have to tutor a child (for free) who is functioning on grade level. \n\nI haven’t replied yet. I feel guilty for saying “no” because I like to help people out. I’m just so stressed in my day-to-day life. I’m also a professional educator who doesn’t want to work for free to tutor a child who doesn’t need it. If she did need it, that would be a different story. \n\nAITA for thinking of refusing this?",

I told our dorm and later confronted him alone about it, causing him to feel unwelcome.*   \n\n\nNever took a break from studying, meaning I finished high-school then jumped straight to College. Got into a distance-relationship that means a lot to me, has been going on for more than 4 years now. Visits regularly and just want to finish college fast so I can finally get the person to move here after I get a job. Getting a well-paid job has been my goal for the past 4 years and my 7-man dorm knows how much it means to me because I can't stfu about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBachelor year, suddenly an opportunity; Form a group where one of the members actually has friends on the inside of one of the local most sought-after job. Usually takes in bachelor students from this college if the bachelor project was given by them. Above-average paying plus benefits. Just enough to get my partner over( law reasons)! Struck luck! My friend, who also has a distance-relationship that he recently got into, has been stressing out about not finding a bachelor group, so my group invites him and he is thankful.   \nLater we all have to hand in our resume + grades. Everyone is very aware about the deadline and are updating their resumes. Friend has girlfriend over. Best time of his life. Is the only one that forgets to hand in his resume so we lose the chance. \n\nThe group panics, trying to find a new bachelor in the limited time we already don't have. After some time goes by, friend pulls me into a room telling me he has bad news. He wants to leave the group because he found another group willing to take him. Tell him it's shitty, considering we lost the chance of a good bachelor project because of him. He says he knows and is pretty close to tears.\n\n \n\nA day later, him and his group are getting ready for the an interview? I ask with who; previously mentioned sought-after company. Can't believe what I'm hearing. \"Can you repeat that..?\" He immediately becomes uncomfortable so I leave to not create a fuss, pretending I don't care.  \nI care **immensely.** \n\nTells exact story to others to make sure I'm not overreacting. They give me a 50/50 answer, so I keep asking half of my dorm.  \n\"Well, he technically didn't ruin your job, only your *chance* of getting it.\"  \n\"Probably slipped his mind when he was with his girlfriend.\"\n\n\"You can probably still get a good enough job with your bachelor.\"\n\nAfter becoming uncomfortable my friend stays in his room all day. I try to get him out because I didn't mean to cage him. Confront him telling him what it meant to me, starts telling me he misses his girlfriend so much and he feels like he isn't cut for his education anymore. Immediately see myself in him and I feel horrible. Tells me he feels unwelcome, but I assure him nobody thinks anything bad of him. I reassure him telling him it's totally fine from my side. He smiles, becoming happy, thanks me wholeheartedly and hugs me. Starts hanging outside his room again. I stop talking shit altogether.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still holding grudges and I did put him in a bad spotlight. Whenever I see him, I get uncomfortable and want to leave the room or be a dick about it, full Michael Scott style. Reddit, I'm sorry but I need to be sure so I can stop fucking thinking about it and just be chill with my friend again; Am I The Asshole for being so fake?   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for reconsidering my relationship after my boyfriend tells me he doesn't feel love?",
      "description": " \n\nFor context: My boyfriend and I have been dating for a bit over a year and he told me from the beginning that he doesn't feel emotions that strongly and has a hard time with empathy/sympathy towards others.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were walking through town. He opened up about himself which he doesn't usually do, so I thought I would take the chance to understand him a bit better. Eventually I decided to ask him if he felt love. I knew I was digging a potential hole but I wanted to know how far this supposed lack of emotion stretched. To this he replied \"No, not really\" I then asked him if he would be sad if we broke up. \"No, I would mostly have a hard time adjusting to the lack of company.\" I decided to remain calm about it and try to understand it a bit better so I asked him a bunch of other questions that made his approach to relationships sound as though it was more a partnership. He also told me that the gestures he does like being kind to people, hugging and kissing were things he had learned were necessary in social interactions and not something he did because he had a desire to do so (Nor a lack of).\n\nThe conversations eventually ended but after a while it got to me and just before bed he asked me why I was acting odd. I said that if he truly didn't feel love, I had to consider if I could live with that. He bluntly replied \"And? ... \" -\" And what?\" I say. \"And what if you can't?\" He said. \"I don't know yet.\" Frustrated he turned his back to me in the bed. \"If you don't know why do you even think about it?\" I tell him that by thinking about it I can understand my emotions better and figure out what I want. \"That doesn't make sense\" He told me. This confusing conversation/slash argument continued for a while.\n\nAfter that he switched to a new argument ( Even though I never wanted to argue in the first place and told him so) and he said \"You were fine before, why did that change it?\" I explain to him that I love him but I want to be loved back, I can't be happy knowing that it’s fake. Then he changed approach again, telling me that I take everything so personally and I misunderstood all that he said. I tell him that I'm sorry if that's the case and ask him to help me understand. \"Why would I do that? you have clearly made up your mind about what you believe.\" I tell him that I want to be wrong. After much silence where he simply didn't reply me he said \"No matter what I say you always misunderstand so why would I even try?\" After this I'm simply crying, trying to understand him but to no avail. In the end the conversation ends unresolved and a few days have passed without us talking or texting much.\n\nDid I overreact? I honestly don't know anymore. I tried to remain calm throughout it all and not make any rash decisions.\n\ntl;dr My boyfriend told me he doesn't really feel love. I tell him I have to consider if I'm okay knowing that to which he tells me that It shouldn't matter, I'm taking it too personally and that I misunderstood.",

My close friend, C,, before me, got cheated on by this same girl, and he told me about it. Being dumb, I still ended up dating her anyways because at the time, she was giving me a lot of attention I never really received. He told me so.\n\nSo on Valentine's Day, she began dating the new kid in my grade, let's call him D. D and I were pretty good friends already, so he told me about it. I began to tell him about what my ex did to me and C in the past. D scoffed this off and said I was just jealous, even though I broke up with her and am with someone else. D was cussing me out, and I just said that it was fine, and it was whatever. They were happy as can be.. or so D, C and I thought.\n\nToday, I see on my ex's story that she became single again. I was confused, and obviously since she was my ex, I wasn't going to ask her. I went to D at the end of the school day. He said that he found out that she was hooking up with some dude that she was friends with for a while. I asked who, and it was one of the guys she sent nudes to during my relationship with her. I told him that I told him that this would happen, and he was really upset at me, starting cussing at me again and stormed off.\n\nI was shocked, since I really was looking out for him when they started dating.

      "description": "Throwaway because some friends follow my main account.\n\nBasically my dad cheated on my mom with this woman. My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my future children to spend significant time with my future in-laws?",
      "description": "I recently had this argument with my girlfriend of 4 years. \n\nBackground: my girlfriend had a very rough childhood, with a neglectful father and emotionally/(sometimes, though rarely) physically abusive mother (note: the parents are divorced). The stories my girlfriend told me about them are nothing short of horrible, from not being fed by her father in middle/high school (neglect) to being kidnapped by her mother shortly after her parent's divorce when she was eight (which, according to my girlfriend's telling of the story, almost ended violently). Her mother, in particular, is an extremely narcissistic, emotionally volatile person, with many phone calls between her and my girlfriend ending with her mother screaming until my girlfriend hangs up. I have met them several times, and her mother has negatively commented on my girlfriend's appearance almost every time (all of the comments are unfounded but that's not the point). Additionally, there have been situations where my girlfriend has desperately needed money, like when she was set to be stranded in another country due to flooding unless she purchased a $200 flight, and her mother refused to purchase it (my mother ended up buying the ticket). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese is not the kind of people I want my children to grow up around, but I recognize that it would be an asshole move to ban her parents from ever seeing their grandchildren. However, I absolutely do NOT want my children to be left alone with my girlfriend's mother, as I do not trust her to keep them safe or treat them like they deserve to be treated. I'm also very skeptical of her father, since he did not provide my girlfriend with food or any sort of protection when she was growing up (once her dad let her abusive ex into the house while she was sleeping and she woke up to him standing over her bed yelling at her). However, her father has clearly been making more of an effort to be present in her life and has never been outright physically or emotionally abusive to her like her mother has. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo all this brings me to last week when we were having a discussion about children. I forget exactly how this was brought up, but I eventually mentioned that my mother never allowed her MIL (my dad's mom) to be alone with us due to her abusive nature and that I wanted us to take the same stance with her parents. My girlfriend got very defensive about this and told me I was seeing the situation as \"too black and white\". But is this really that black and white? My girlfriend thinks that I'm over-exaggerating her parent's negative qualities and not seeing them holistically for who they are. But am I? Her mother kidnapped her and tried to flee the country and \"allegedly\" threatened a murder-suicide if the police didn't back off, she has consistently demonstrated that she does not give a shit about my girlfriend's well-being by not helping her when she was desperate (despite her mother being stable middle class), and she has (in my opinion) exhibited a lot of personality traits that I see presented time and time again in subreddits like r/raisedbynarcissists. Her father is incredibly neglectful, never defended her when HIS mother (gf's grandmother) used to kick her with high heels on, let her abusive ex-bf into the house when he was looking to \"negotiate\", or when she needed food growing up (food that she eventually got at friend's houses). I would feel incredibly uncomfortable leaving children with people like this, and I won't even talk about the step-parents which are each their whole own realm of yikes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo provide further context, I was raised by two AMAZING parents and I recognize that my privilege here may be clouding my judgment because I simply can't believe that anyone could treat their own children so horribly and then somehow treat their grandchildren any differently. There is also a cultural difference to acknowledge here that is probably relevant in how our perspectives differ when it comes to family bonds (I am white, she is Asian, I won't specify further to maintain anonymity). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: AITA for not wanting my future wife's neglectful/abusive parents to be alone with our children?",

      "description": "Last summer I (F28) took in a roomie (F18). This girl, \"Amy\", was starting uni and with the semester one month away she still hadn't found housing. Her mother contacted me, and I took her in.\n\nThings went well to begin with. Amy told me she had depression. I struggle myself, so I was accommodating towards her, taking on a role akin to big sister. Over the fall semester, she grew increasingly more sick as the stress of uni got to her. I spent nights sitting with her when she cried, I helped her call for help - I even drove her to a psych ward on her request and picked her up a couple of days later. I was unemployed, so I was taking care of most of the housework. Her mental illness made chores difficult for her, and she would often text me that she couldn't do the dishes due to xyz.\n\nAt this point I wanted to contact her parents, given her young age, but she begged me not to so I didn't.\n\nWe both had pets and agreed to take care of them for each other if someone was going out of town. I took care of her pet during Christmas. (Will be important later.)\n\nIssues started when I got employment. I work long shifts and about five times a month I work 24h/day. I asked her to take care of the apt while I was gone. Cleaning and dishes fell to the wayside. She continued to get sicker.\n\nLate January, my pets got sick. When I worked 24h I asked Amy to look after them, meaning food, water, cleaning up, and medication. She agreed.\n\nThe week after they got sick I had three 24h shifts. First two went fine. On the third night Amy texted me and told me that she couldn't petwatch anymore. It was taking her so long she had to choose between food and sleep, and she was failing her classes. I told her that I couldn't find anyone else for the night, and asked what she wanted me to do about it. She had no response.\n\nNext day she confronted me. She said she was \"furious with me for working fulltime\". We got into a fight and after she refused to talk to me.\n\nTwo weeks later, I was fed up. Wanted to kick her out, but had to give 3mo notice. I was done helping when she clearly wasn't willing to help me.\n\nI forced her to talk. She told me it wasn't working out, that the \"past three weeks has shown we're not compatible to live together\" and that she had a new place she'd move to in 5 days.\n\nAfter this, Amy brought over her new roomie and had them stay here until she moved out. She wouldn't meet me without them. Judging by the way they treated me, I think she told them I was dangerous.\n\nShe's moved out but I'm still fuming. I feel taken used. But I cant help wondering... AITA? Did I expect too much from this 18yo girl? I feel like she was using her mental illness to get out of helping out with the household. Despite all of this, she said she *still wants to remain friends*. This is something I don't think I can at the moment. I feel manipulated.\n\nAITA, reddit?",

      "description": "This past Halloween my family was going to go trick-or-treating so I offered to stay behind and give out candy. My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?",

      "description": "I was born in the United States. For the past two years I've been living in France. When people me ask where I'm from, I usually say, 'I'm American.' I've met a bunch of people from South/Central American countries these past two years, and several of them have gotten upset when I have called myself 'American.' They have claimed that they are 'Americans' as well, and that people from the United States should not have ownership over the word. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsually I apologize and move on. But the last time I was called out, I started defending my use of the word (in a completely respective, calm manner). I argued that the United States is the only country in the Americas that doesn't have a unique name for their nationality (Example: Argentina = Argentinian). Not only that, but most countries can give their nationality first, and then say that they are 'South/Central/North American.' The United States seems to be the only country that doesn't have a unique name for their nationality. To me, it seems fair that we have adopted 'American,' and it appears that most of the world recognizes the distinction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI completely understand their line of thinking. Technically, they are 'American' as well, since they come from one of the American continents. But it's extremely difficult to deny calling myself an 'American' when I've been taught my entire life to call myself one. That's why I started defending myself. I'm such a progressive person and open to new ideas, but I can't help but fight back whenever I'm called out now. AITA for fighting back? ",

      "description": "Last semester I sat next to a girl every Wednesday in our history class. On the last day of class before finals she asked me if I could show her around campus. She was a senior but she literally only went to campus for school then went home. I didn't have anything to do so I obliged.\n\nI showed her all around the campus to the best of my abilities. We ended up sitting in an empty classroom and talked for a few hours. Eventually when I was pretty sure she was in to me I decided to ask her out. I asked her what movie was out that she wanted to see and then asked her to go see it with me. The date went fine but as it went on I noticed things felt off. At dinner she didn't sit by me, it was a sit on Asian restaurant with open seating. She kept trying to pay for herself too which I found a bit odd. At the movies I slowly cozied up next to her. Eventually I decided to go for the move. I put my arm around her and she very quietly lifted it off and put it down. I tried again toward the end of the movie and she did it again. (I still cringe).\n\nI drove her back to her car and talked the whole ride back. She didn't really open up though. Whenever I asked questions she would brush them off and remain silent. So I never texted her after that. I figured whatever and moved on. A week later she messaged me and I approached her as a friend this time, figuring that our date wasn't really a date after all. After a few days she begins hinting at some sexual stuff. I play along because I am a guy. Over the next week things get more and more heated over text. I am not in the state right now so I couldn't follow up my words with actions.\n\nFinally, last night things kinda hit the inevitable. The \"where are we\" conversation. I told her all the stuff above and told her I wasn't sure what she wanted. After she basically said she wanted to be more than friends I came clean. I had written her off as a romantic interest over the last few weeks because the more we talked the more I realized that romantically there wasn't much there. It would all be sexual, which I do not want. When I told her this she got upset and started telling me that I string her along and she isn't good enough for me. I tried my best to explain to her I don't want her to change but I don't want to be with her or change myself. This made things worse. AITA?",

      "description": "So I’ve begin to notice recently that my mom is an entitled parent and my younger sister is an entitled child. Now neither of them have grown up amazing but still. They act super entitled to things about me.\nThe first thing I noticed was my computer I got for Christmas. I asked for it so I could write more as I want to writing or journalism as a future career. I’ve had it for about 4 months now and recently I ended up getting the sims 4 on it. Now I should also mention my sister is a sims addict. She loves the sims and could play it for hours. So when she realized she got it she felt entitled to play it. Now I don’t say this lightly. She comes in my room everyday at least 20 or more times and asks to play. Sometimes I’ll say no just because I don’t want anyone using my computer then, and sometimes I say no because I’m using it at that moment. Every time I say no she always storms out of my room angrily. Well yesterday she told my mother I said no and my mother texts me saying she is “disappointed in my behaviour and maybe if I can’t share my computer I don’t deserve to have it.” MY COMPUTER. Now I know it probably sounds selfish but I wanted this computer for my stuff and my stuff alone. There is a family computer that doesn’t have sims but still. So of course I let her use it after that because I felt guilty. \nAnd now today which has taken me over the breaking point. My sister stayed home “sick” from school today even though she looks completely fine. She texted me ALL DAY LONG asking if she could play the sims. Now I didn’t text her back because I was in classes and when I wasn’t I forgot about her messages. I only have about an hour total at school for free time and I’m usually eating or laughing with friends during that time. So when I got home my sister says “can I play sims?” And I say “just let me use the bathroom and you can play for an hour. Then I have to work.” And my mom yells “what do you even have to work on!?” So I told her “I have an idea for a story that I’m working on.” Well ladies and gents, my entitled mother was not pleased with that answer. “She has been texting you all day about it!” “Well I didn’t get them until after school.” “That’s bullshit! Complete bullshit! Your phone is always in your hand!” So yeah. Now I’m getting yelled at for not answering my phone during class even though it is a known rule at my school that if phones are seen they are taken? Weird flex mom but okay.\nAnyways what do you all think? Are my mom and sister acting entitled or am I just an asshole? Also if you have any questions feel free to ask.",

      "title": "AITA for being mad at my friend that she talks to her boyfriend 24/7?",
      "description": "So, here's the thing. I've known my friend for about 6 months now, but we practically have spent every waking hour together since not only do we go to the same college, were housemates, and we took the same classes. Pretty much I'm always around her therefor, and because of this, we have gotten to know each other really well, and we're good friends.\n\nThe guy she's been talking too wasn't always her boyfriend. While we were first getting to know each other, he was a friend. But even then, he called her all the time. She had to lie just so he wouldn't get mad at her for not picking up. They ended up kissing, and things of course got to where they are now. Now, she has to talk to him all the time.\n\nIn honesty, she has no idea if they are a couple, or just fuck buddies, or whatever you want to call it. It's super complex. Therefore, she's super afraid of losing him as a friend if they break up (or stop...doing whatever). I totally get it, although it's annoying since he tends to put her through hell since he knows that. If she won't pick up the phone for whatever reason, he'll get pissed off and will shut off his phone, not answer when she calls him back, call her a liar (albeit, she does lie about why she's not picking up the phone. Her reasons though are always really quite innocent, so I don't know why she lies. For example, one time she had a meeting, but told him she was in class), and not speak to her for days on end. This always irritates me since she comes to me, and is freaking out about it.\n\nSo, to keep him happy, she's started just going along with it. They talk *constantly.* I don't just mean like texting constantly, or checking up every hour or so, no I mean talking on the phone. For example, today, we had class at 8:30, so she woke up at 7. The second she woke up, she was on the phone with him. She went to class with him on the phone, hung up at 8:30, and when we left to go get breakfast at 9:45am, she talked to him the whole time we were at breakfast, and until she went to her next class. She had class again at 11, hung up before she went, and by the time I saw her at 2:15 (fifteen minutes after her class got out), she's on the phone again. She's been on the phone ever since then. It's 6:30pm.\n\nLast night, she was up until 3am, until she literally passed out on the phone, talking to him, and it was the same constantly talking as today. It annoys me so much, because if she doesn't do this, he gets pissed off and ignores her.\n\nEven though we've had arguments about the fact that he literally won't stop talking to her, it came to a bad last night. Last night, I had a PTSD flare up.  She came to me about 30 minutes into the flare up, stayed off the phone with him for like 5-7 minutes to help me...and went back and saw that she had 15 missed calls, and over 50 texts. Sometimes I need her, and sometimes she's not there because he's making her sit on the phone. Not to mention, she's having to do this. It pisses me off so much, but I feel like no matter what I say, this will keep happening.\n\nIt's hard for me to watch this happen. She doesn't want to talk to him all of the time, at least that's what she tells me, and I'm inclined to believe her.\n\nI'm not only pissed at her for never standing up for herself and her time, but I'm pissed off at him for doing this to her. One of our mutual friend's has told me to just drop it, and let it happen. I've gotten into screaming matches with her over this, and I don't want to get into another one with her over last night.\n\nI feel like I need to know if I'm an asshole for being upset in the first place. I just want her to see what's really happening.\n\ntldr; My friend's boyfriend makes her talk to him all day, never ending. It bothers me because I feel like sometimes I need my friend, and she deserves her space. I feel guilty for being pissed off, and arguing with her over this, but at the same time, I feel like she needs a reality check.",

      "title": "AITA because I \"half\" accepted my mom's apology after she belittled me",
      "description": "My parents have been going through what has seemed like a divorce, except it's going on 3 years now of conflict. Basically, my mom feels that a friendship my dad had with a woman was further than he says it was. She thinks it was a full blown affair. He's admitted that he became too close and talked to her too often, but she wants more of admission. She's 100% set in her beliefs, and has consistently lashed out in different ways over these last 3 years -- destroying things in our house, physically attacking my dad, verbally attacking him and often my sisters and I, especially if we give her any push-back on the conflict which we can't seem to get them to stop bringing us into.\n\nShe tries to bring us down with her sadness. It seems like she doesn't want us to be happy if she isn't, and anything else is heartless on our part. She lashes out at me for the smallest things, especially if she thinks I am being too friendly with my dad. She always tells me that I side with him because he \"gives me things\" and that I am \"cozying up to daddy warbucks\". I can't even have a conversation with my dad without expecting her to be harsh to me later on. The real problem is that I live at home right now. I just graduated college and the only job I could find for my degree is in my hometown so I've been saving money by living at home. It's really difficult to leave, because when things are fine, it's really not a situation where I'm a burden or have overstayed my welcome, and they both tell me that. But everything is in a cycle like it has been for 3 years -- everything is fine and then blows up, she hurts most of our family in different ways, cuts out a relative, etc., but then it stops. She generally doesn't apologize, and if she does, it is minimal and usually blames my dad more. She just expects everything to continue like it never happened, and I generally go along with that because I don't want to cut her out of my life or blow something up. But I can really tell that it is affecting me, so I've been thinking more about not allowing this cycle to continue.\n\nToday I came home for lunch and was cooking something and she got upset with me for something I said. I really don't know why she got mad. I was talking about turkey bacon.. I tried to tell her that I can't keep accepting this, that sometimes she's just going to lash out at me for no reason even. It turned into a much larger argument and she told me that I learned my \"bad habits from my dad\", and that I am going to \"die a sad, lonely man\". That really got to me. I think she knows my insecurities and decided to attack them directly like she does my dad -- \"Your friends only like you for your money.\" \n\nI just got increasingly angry and more sad because it's hard to not feel like it says something that my own mother would corroborate a feeling I fear deeply, when she was angriest and most unfiltered. \n\nMy sister called her and said my mom was very angry over an argument we had, and I explained to her what happened. I shouldn't have told her what was said. I think she ended up screaming at my mom over it because when I came home my mom was there and immediately tried to hug me and wouldn't let me go until I hugged her back but I truly didn't want to. She just said it was so horrible what she said and that she shouldn't ever say anything like that. \n\nI just kept telling her that I didn't want to be a part of all this between her and dad and she kept saying that isn't a part of that. I told her I can't keep accepting these apologies because it's not the first time you've said something like this. Usually she claims she \"doesn't remember saying it\" when I bring it up months later, and she probably doesn't apologize on her own accord usually because I typically don't give her the cold shoulder and reject her calls like I did today. I just told her that I will forgive her, but I'm really not convinced that it will stop. She went into an explanation of how my dad indirectly made her do this and how it was his fault and I became a lot more forceful in what I was saying. I just rehashed how this is messed up and it has nothing to do with my dad, this woman (I said her by name which I shouldn't have), that SHE said that to me and that I think she is emotionally abusive. I told her that what would make  me feel better is not talking about this ever, and to be left alone. She walked away and I heard her crying as she walked down the steps. I'm so worried about her and that this might send her further into depression or that she might do something even worse",

      "description": "**TLDR: My ex refused to hang out with her friends instead of me, and sees being alone with the opposite sex as something shady. I consider spending time with friends and the opposite sex to be healthy, and broke it off.**\n\nI have a very close and tactile relationship with my friends that includes hugging and cuddling, and I like to cultivate those friendships by sometimes meeting up with friends one-on-one. I find that people are too closed off from their friends, and I don't want to be the kind of guy who doesn't hug his friends or show emotion. I am very open with my view on this, and I look for partners with a similar view on platonic skinship. \n\nTherefore, I have 3 important criteria for a potential SO:\n\n1. They have friends of their own, with which they spend regular time with.\n2. Some of those friends are members of the opposite sex. I don't trust people who are incapable of having platonic friendships with the opposite sex.\n3. They, at the very least, hug their friends (the friends who want to be hugged, that is.)\n\nRecently, I started dating a girl who went to my dance class. I hadn't really dated outside of my social circle before, so she didn't really know how I acted around them, but I made sure to be open and clear about the way I drew my boundaries, and invited her to most of my outings the following months. She never invited me to hang out with her friends, which I didn't really care about: I figured I'd meet them eventually, but if she wanted her social life to be entirely her own, I was okay with that. It's not like I wanted her to always hang out with me and my friends either.\n\nDuring our time together, she cut off a couple of her male friends, but she explained that they were pretty toxic and that it was for the best, and I reasoned that she knew better.\n\n2 months later, I noticed that she visibly sulked when I made plans with a friend, and I suggested that she do something with her friends. We had been hanging out a lot just the two of us recently, and I figured she missed her friends too.\n\nShe blew up at me, saying that she didn't want to hang out with her friends because she was in a relationship, and that meant that she'd much rather just spend time with me than them. And if I didn't feel the same, then it meant I probably didn't like her. We argued for a while, but after cooling off for a bit, she came back and said that she wasn't going to argue about my friends, but that she felt spending time alone with other people, especially other guys, was an act of betrayal and that she wouldn't do it. \n\nI broke up with her, which she was understandably very upset about, and she expressed this through some very angry text messages that I've deleted. \n\nI'm conflicted. It's not like she tried to cut me off from my own friends, but I just don't feel like I'm compatible with someone that doesn't share my outlook on social life. Am I the asshole for breaking up just because of that?",

Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding?

      "description": " \n\nHey guys. I am a 25 year old male and live with two girls, both 28 in a 3-room flat. We are living together for a year now, and my relationship to the girls are very different. Let´s call ´em Ann and Mir. I have a good relationship to Ann and would consider her a friend. We talk about our issues, have fun together, although most of the time inside our four walls. We have the same kind of humour and she is very patient with me. To Mir I had an okay relationship in the beginning, turning into a bad one over the months. My problems with her are, that most of the times we talked it was either about her work or her medicine studies, where it seems she always puts herself on top of others, because others cause problems and she is always better. When I talk about my issues with her, which I barely did the conversation often shifted to her problems. I dont like people who are all about themselves, I want to share a conversation, not listening to a monologue. Some friends of mine, who met her also say she was an unsympathetic person, but I have to say I ranted about her, before they met her so this could have influenced their opinion. And sometimes she doesnt do her dishes and her kitchen mess right away, but thats actually not a big prob.\n\nFor me I am far from perfect. I´m sometimes short tempered, in case of her more often, because we had fights before and then I have the urge to defend myself and take things more personal. Also I broke some of Mir´s things and didnt come up for it right away. It wasnt on purpose, but she had to talk to me that I pay up for it. The worst thing i did, i drew some beards on her anatomy posters in the living room and laughed when she was upset, so a real dick move from me. I paid for the posters and apologized but I still have a bad feeling about it.\n\nSo in all we have a cold relationship, I barely talk to her, because of the conversation we have and she barely talks to me, because I take criticism of her personally sometimes and she doesnt want to deal with that.\n\nYesterday evening, she asked me why I take so many night shifts in the week, when I have university afterwards. I explained I wanted to have some free weekends and would deal with less sleep. She then said I hadnt that problem in the last university term, because I barely was in the university. I answered she knows me that I am a lazy person and not motivated in the last term. So she said \"Although you said in the beginning of the last term you would get your work done\" I heard a derisive tone from that and left the conversation. I want to add I was still tired cause of my night shift the night before and may have wanted to hear that from it.\n\nAfterwards she asked whats the matter and I said she should consider how she talks to other people when they open up to her and then get smeared their weaknesses that they admit, in their faces.\n\nShe didnt understand my anger and said she meant no harm with that saying and didnt want to discuss with me further because I was still tired, I agreed.\n\nWe are both not perfect person, but am I the asshole in this relationship? I really cant judge it right,",

      "description": "I am not that great of a writer so please bear with me as I try to start this out. I am 26, ex US Army going to college in a town near where I grew up. I just started dating a single mother about 2 weeks ago and it's like instant chemistry with all three of us. The boy's dad is an absolute dead beat, and being US Army I've seen plenty of those so I've done my best to make the boy feel like he's special and deserving of respect. \n\nI am also huge into DemoBass systems. My car is my passion. I drive a 2009 BMW M-series with the truck and back seat filled as best I can with sub-woofers. I get so much pride out of being the person you can hear coming from miles away. I've won local car and bass contests because it's something I put my heart and soul into. \n\nSo here is where he stories cross paths. My girlfriend hates my system. She say's its obnoxious, it hurts her ears and it's a major sticking point between us progressing in our relationship. I tell her that I will always want to be loud and proud but I can turn it down when she's around. She agreed but told me she still doesn't like it. She also said that I am never to play my bass with her son in the car. I also agreed. \n\nWell yesterday, her dead beat ex didn't show up to pick up her son but she had to work. She asked me if I might be able to watch him for the day. I happily agreed. We were out cruising around and he kept begging me to crank my system up but I said your mom wouldn't like that. So finally we were at a light and some choad came up next to us with a weak ass system and finally my pride got the best of me and let Aiden absolutely crank the system. It was so loud and impressive that he was actually vibrating in his seat. We laughed so hard when the choad slinked away in his little rice grinder. I had the volume up for maybe 5 minutes before I said his mom wouldn't like it so we should turn it down.  All was good, five minutes of fun. \nI told Aiden we don't want to keep secrets from his mom but maybe lets just not talk about this and it was between us. \n\n\nSo all was good, girlfriend was super appreciative that I watched him for the day and even started talking about the next night she has off and her mom can watch Aiden, she'll stay at my place for the first time. I was like on cloud nine. \n\n\nBut then overnight I just started getting angry text after angry text from her because I guess Aiden told her about the choad and how we buried him at the intersection. I tried to respond that it was only five minutes, bass doesn't damage hearing anyways and he really loved it. She called me an asshole for violating her rule, she said I was immature for having the \"stupid bass\" anyways and her last text was \"we're done!\" before apparently blocking me. \n\nIt's 541 AM here and I'm lost because things were going so well and now this? I'm just devastated and wish she would listen to reason. \n\n\nam I the asshole for this?\n",

      "description": "I recently went to various countries in the Middle East with a university program, Israel being one of them. I posted a picture of me in Israel on Instagram where the caption was a joke referencing how Israel somehow beat 5 other sovereign nations in Nabka. As background, I am currently a university student, and the university I attend has a decently strong Jewish presence (I am not Jewish). Also, my university is very left-leaning and basically anytime you disagree with popular belief, you'll get ridiculed pretty hard (and that's putting it lightly).\n\nA girl in my class (we'll call her Rachel) took my caption as me mocking the region's war history. I respond by saying that if she's offended by my post, I'm willing to sit down with her and discuss it with her (my parents also come from a nation with a LONG history of war). Rachel then responds by... well I'm not really quite sure how to describe how she responds, except citing my privilege of being able to visit Israel and how many Palestinians aren't allowed back in their home. Also note Rachel is an American citizen (who can ALSO freely enter Israel) with Middle Eastern roots.\n\nFor those who don't know, Nabka is the war that happened in Mandatory Palestine between several Arab states and Israel after the UN voted to split it into Palestine and Israel. Read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947–1949_Palestine_war\n\nNow I'm not super knowledgable on the Israel-Palestine conflict, but I sure as hell don't condone a lot of the actions of the Israeli government  (ex: Israeli settlements in West Bank), so I apologize and tell her that I was only trying to poke fun of the incredulity that is Israel 1v5 and winning. I direct message Rachel, asking if she wants to meet up to talk about my post, what offends her, and hear what she has to say. No response. Her friend, Megan, (also an acquaintance of mine) also chimes in and basically echoes Rachel's sentiments. \n\nI'm not trying to burn any bridges here. I generally got along relatively well with Rachel and Megan. A few others commented they found the caption humorous, but now I'm not sure if my joke was insensitive, or if I'm just an asshole? Please let me know!\n\nHere's screenshots of the posts with names crossed out: https://imgur.com/a/dUn7W2w\nRed = me\nGreen = Rachel\nBlue = Megan",

      "description": "Here’s the story. I’ve been the vocalist for a band for about a year now. We are a three piece, including myself, the drummer and our guitar player. We ended up renting a small rehearsal space for quite a bit of money. The reason for this is because we had no other option for a place to rehearse, and this one was closest and also cheapest. All 3 of us are in school and have jobs. Guitar player has 2 other bands as well. When we agreed to rent, it would be roughly $130 per person a month. No issue everything was great, no complaints. We dedicated Sunday afternoons to meet and practice with each of us writing and recording on our own at home during the week. All of a sudden guitar player couldn’t make the payment anymore. His reasoning was “$130 is too expensive to only be there 4 times a month”. Fair enough. This led to me and the drummer splitting the bill, ending with $200 each. To compensate guitarist would buy equipment we needed. We are determined to do anything that will work including higher bill. We begin meeting twice a week, Friday and Sunday now. Fast forward 6 months. Roughly 2 months ago drummer was having a really hard time and didn’t know if they could pay the next payment, same with myself. When I brought it up with guitar player he said “we have to keep it. I know for sure we won’t ever do anything if we don’t keep this”. We bite the bullet and continue paying. Forward 2 months: Now I receive a text from guitar player saying he can’t meet on Fridays anymore because he has started another band. I explained thoroughly to him that we were not okay with that. I’m not against his other projects at all, we’ve always supported his projects and do everything we can to help out. But we are paying money to ensure we have a place to practice. Within the last 6 months, guitar play compensate with a single $20 item. He bought a mini fridge at goodwill. We discuss; he’s says he’s not obligated to be there, which I told him is correct. But it’s not fair for me and drummer to be working our asses off to afford the room and now use it less? I told him that if he was still paying on the room it would be a different story. if $130 is too expensive for him to only be meeting 4x a month. Then why is it okay for me to pay $200 for the same thing? He said it wasn’t fair for me to expect him to be there, and he’s burnt out on music. I told him, he’s right he’s not obligated to be there but it’s not fair to us either. If he’s so burnt out on music, why start another band? I just want an honest opinion here. AITA?",

      "description": "My (16M) friend (15F) and I are both sophomores in different high schools. It's worth noting that her school has \"valedictorian\" and \"salutatorian\" titles for each grade and not just seniors.\n\nSo my friend and I were talking via SMS about school in general the other day, and she brought up how she was essentially failing and that she was very stressed. Well, this was concerning to me, as she has always been known to be one of the most academically gifted people in her school. I asked her to elaborate, and she said her grades were just under the level necessary to be student of the year.\n\nOf course, I thought that it was quite ridiculous that \"just below student of the year\" was considered failing in her book, but before I got to say anything else, she sent a text saying something along the lines of \"I guess I'll just have to settle for sophomore valedictorian this year.\"\n\nAt this point, I, potentially wrongfully so, recognized this as a humble brag, and a bad one at that. I didn't say anything else to her that night except for \"goodnight\", but next time she does this (it has happened before, but not to this extent), I may bring up how obvious it is that she is bragging.\n\nWIBTA if I were to do this?",

My friend who's a friend of the douche told me that he hates me because I reflexively called him bitch once but, the thing is, I call everyone a bitch, all of my friends and other classmates and even people below my grade so it's not personal but i think he took it personally.\n\nSo actual story now. My classmate who was sitting next to this douche was noisy so the teacher made her switch seats with me. It was math so most of us didn't get the lesson. I already hated being with him but being beside him gives me a whole new other level of anxiety so I hated it the entire time I was beside him. While the teacher was discussing, he kept whispering to his friend (I'm pretty sure they were talking about me) and after they whispered to each other for a bit, he suddenly said \"Do you get the lesson?\" in a patronizing-ish way and I shook my head and said no at the same time. He asked me again after another whisper session with his friend but this time, he held his arm around my shoulder as he asked, and instead of saying no again, i reflexively said\" stop\" in a serious tone and I'm pretty sure I offended him in a way.\n\nAITA??

      "description": "Hey guys, I’m a little lost in terms of whether or not I’m being a jerk by getting slightly upset in this scenario.  Please let me know AITA.\n\nI am a 27 year old woman and about 6 months ago I got out of an abusive relationship, got clean, went to rehab, and dramatically changed my life for the better.  When I got out of rehab my dad (D) and my step-mom (SM) convinced me to move in with them so I am not alone and so they can ensure that I do not relapse.  \n\nMy D, SM, and I have never had a great relationship but things have been far better than the abuse of my childhood.  I am very grateful to live in their home, have offered to pay rent (offer declined), and try to help out as much as possible (shovelling snow, laundry, dishes, etc.).  For the most part I put my feelings or wishes aside in an effort to maintain a peaceful home.  Recently however a situation has occurred which has been irking me.  \n\nThe room I am staying in was designed for my sister when she was 8 years old and is painted baby blue, decorated with picture of flowers, rainbows, angels, and stars.  The colour theme is baby blue, green, pink, and orange.  It is not my style but I’ve been ok with it given that it is not my house to dramatically alter.  \n\nThat changed last week when our cleaning lady told me that my SM thinks it’s funny that I’m stuck in this childish room and that she plans on making it into a proper, neutral, adult guest room once I leave.  This upset me significantly as I’ve asked before if I can take down the childish flower power paintings and angels and put my own bedding on the bed and I was told that the room must stay as it is until they sell the house in a few years.  \n\nThen today my SM told me she and my D are cleaning out their basement and asked me to go through some paintings and photos to see if there is anything I would like to keep.  I selected one painting and asked to keep it.  My SM said that was cool but that I should take it to my closet or storage locker.  I asked if I could hang it in my room where the three “flower power” pictures are hanging.  I mentioned that I would not have to put any new holes in the wall and that I could keep the flower paintings in my closet so they can be put back up when I move out.  My SM told me that it would be ridiculous for me to change anything in the room and that she walks by the room sometimes and wants to see it as is if she glances at it.  \n\nAm I out of line for wanting to make this space a little more comfortable?  I would not be throwing anything out (and would safely store the childish decorations), would not make any new holes in the wall, and would only use things that I already own and have been keeping in storage.  I am very grateful for the place to stay,  so AITA for asking for this change or should I just keep things as they are?",

      "description": "Yesterday my friend and I were playing a video game of mine at his place. When it was time for me to leave I was going to take it with me but he was insistent that I leave it for him to play overnight. I didn’t want to do this but we ended up making a deal that he would get me food at his job tomorrow when I pick him up (he works at a local deli). I agreed and left.\n\nThe next day I delayed lunch because I was anticipating picking him up and he would get me food. I texted him what sandwich I would like him to get me and he responds “Shit man I already got a ride” which pissed me off. This was probably an overreaction on my part but (after sending him an angry text) I went to his house, told his mom that I needed a game back that I let him borrow, took it and left. \n\nI thought he was intentionally screwing me over but he later said that he forgot and I was overreacting. He said he took 2 Xanax bars and drank some alcohol the night before and that made him forget. This led to an intense argument between us with him saying I shouldn’t have been so angry and he sent that initial text (about getting another ride) when he was in the middle of work. He was also insistent that I should have reminded him. My main argument is that taking Xanax/alcohol is not an excuse and he should have made a point to remember especially after I sent the text about what food I want. I don’t think I should have to remind him to hold up his end of the deal. I wished I could have not let him borrow it but it’s too late for that.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "I (25F) came out to my parents (50s M/F) when I was a sophomore in college. They are extremely religious, and while I thought it was kind of obvious that I was gay, my announcement came as a huge shock to them. I'll spare you the details, but basically while they didn't threaten physical violence or kick me out of the house, the conversation did not go well and they said a lot of extremely hurtful things.\n\nOur relationship was very tense for a while after that. I only talked to them about travel logistics or financial matters, and stopped relying on them emotionally, building up a support system among my friends instead. After I graduated and got my first \"real\" job, I stopped relying on them financially too.\n\nEventually we worked through it and we got to a place of mutual understanding and respect (or so I thouguht). I told them about my current partner when we first started dating, and while they weren't exactly thrilled, they didn't try to dissuade me and accepted it. My dad even made efforts to ask about her when it became clear that we were pretty serious.\n\nFast forward to a few years later, my partner and I are getting settled in our careers, and feeling stable enough that we want to start planning a wedding. I really love her and want to get engaged, but I also don't want my engagement to be the first time my extended family finds out that I'm gay. I reached out to my parents and broached the subject of telling the rest of the family about me being gay (without mentioning the pending engagement), and they said that they were sorry, but they just weren't ready to have that conversation yet.\n\nI understand their concern. My extended family is also extremely religious and would probably not take the news well. When I first came out, my parents asked me not to tell the rest of the family -- and I agreed, mostly because I didn't really want to tell them anyway. But that was six years ago, and at this point I'm tired of censoring myself on social media and want to just live my life openly. I feel like if my parents don't feel ready by now, they'll never feel ready.\n\nI'm considering giving my parents an ultimatum of telling our extended family by a certain timeline, or I'll do it for them -- but it feels so selfish. Honestly, I don't really care if my extended family disowns me, I rarely see them nor do I care what they think. My life wouldn't change that much if I never spoke to them again. But my parents interact with my aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, etc every day, and this ultimatum might put them in the position of having to choose between me or them. I'm concerned that they wouldn't end up choosing me, but beyond that I know it would definitely affect their day-to-day life way more than mine -- which is why I'm not sure if forcing their hand here is an asshole move.\n\nSo, what do you think? WIBTA for coming out to my extended family even though my parents don't want me to?",

The people that have been on the team will make jokes about anything and some are terrible but that’s what’s funny. Nothing racist or anything like that, mostly jokes about how “oh you don’t know this thing, let me make sure everybody knows” we all have a laugh and then teach them what they need to know.\n\nIn the past month or two because of management half our team was replaced with newbies. They are all pretty cool, and have been in on the jokes, it keeps the spirits high even with the stress.\n\n\nYesterday one of the newbies (call him Joe) was struggling with something, he knew what he was doing it was just taking longer than expected. Mostly due to file transfers, not even his fault. But he was stressed over it I guess.\n\nWe were telling a story of a previous employee, who is my friend, who did something dumb, and it injured another employee. Joe starts ragging on him hard. Saying things like “what a dumbass” “he must have been a trash human being”  and “he’s a complete idiot”.\n\nAfter the last one I turned to him and said “wow, that’s what I think of you every day”.\n\nHis tone changed, I could tell he was upset. He said “you know I could beat you up right”, i jokingly said “I bet you could”. Then he started saying “nobody asked your opinion” then he got cutoff for work business.\n\nHe called off work today, could have been completely unrelated, or maybe I really pissed him off that much?\n\nSo was my not so witty comeback too far?

      "description": "I'm 24. In late spring of last year, I met someone online that I found out I had a lot in common with. We kept chatting for a while, and he revealed that he was 18 (19 now). In the summer, he revealed that he had begun developing feelings for me, and wanted to pursue a relationship with me. I was a bit hesitant at first, partly due to it being long-distance, but mainly because of the 5-year age gap. Still, we kept growing closer and closer, and decided to give it a chance in September. \n\nWhile the majority of people who know about us seem to be supportive, he has some friends that seem to disagree. According to my boyfriend, they keep referring to me as someone that's \"grooming\" him, and basically portraying me as a predator, despite never having met me. \n\nSo yeah, my question is if I'm the 'bad guy' here, for being in a relationship with someone younger and more impressionable than me, or if his friends are assholes for labeling me as a \"predator\" just because of the age difference.

      "description": "I am very awkward in social situations. I am quiet and I’ve been asked by multiple people whom I’ve never spoken to if I’m mad at them because apparently my extreme shyness translates to a look of hatred. But I do not hate anyone I’ve gone to school with. I’m just socially inept. But this is the way I’m perceived. \n\nGiven this, please tell me if my actions in the following story are assholish and if there’s anyway i Can and should fix it. Thank you. \n\nI am in a research team with three other people. We are technically not teammates, the only thing that links us is our mutual research advisor. We will not be working together but we meet every week with our research advisor to go over our individual research projects. \n\nFor clarities sake, I will call my advisor Dr. Will. \n\nSo today we met and our advisor was reminding us of the deadlines for our drafts. He asked when the review paper deadline was according to his schedule, and one of my teammates checked the syllabus and told him the date it was due which was a month ago. I had turned my review paper in on time last month, but no one else had turned theirs in. \n\nDr. Will got a bit pissed, not yelling or anything, but he was like “cmon guys there’s no excuse to be this late. I received (my name)’s paper like a year ago!”\n\nAt this, I laughed. It was funny, that he exagérate d that much. I normally laugh at a lot of what he says because he’s a funny guy. \n\nMy teammates were silent and kind of panicky, and Dr. Will said “BOOM reality check.” And I think I kind of giggled at that too. \n\nOnly after this happened did I realize they might have thought I was laughing at them. I feel like a total asshole. \n\nIf this happened to you, would you think I was an asshole and that I was laughing at your misfortune? Is that how the situation looks? \n\nThanks. ",

      "description": "Today my wife and I found out our young son has Autism. Apparently it is only officially diagnosable at 4 years old but the specialist took one look at our boy, made us answer some questions and said without a doubt our son is Autistic. As upsetting as it is, I saw it coming. Call it intuition or just knowing what the signs were or whatever, but finding out my son has Autism isn't something I am surprised about. \n\nTo say our son is a handful is an understatement. Between us we get between 3 - 5 hours of sleep a night due to his constant screaming and violent thrashing. He refuses/is unable to sleep alone so our bed has had three people in it for nearly 2 years now. He has eczema all over his body and has allergies to most things. \n\nI love my son, I love him with every fiber of my being and yet, it doesn't feel right to me to bring another life that could be like him. We always wanted a second child but with his physical difficulties and now the confirmation of his Autism, I changed my mind. I don't want to bring another person into the world if they're just going to have a life as hard as my son's. \n\nMost of us went to school with at least one kid with Autism, and the ones I went to school with were bullied pretty severely. I feel it is selfish to want to bring a child into the world if they're going to be as badly afflicted (if not worse) as my boy. My wife thinks I am being selfish and spiteful and an asshole for saying these things but I feel the opposite. I'm not willing to roll those dice. And so as someone without anyone to give the neccessary immediate insight I need right now I turn to the internet. Am i the asshole?\n\nTL;DR : Found out son is autistic and I don't want another child due to the potential of them being as bad or worse than him.",

Also I'm 20 years old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have a dog that basically lives at my moms place since me and my dad don't have the time or room to take proper care of her. My dog just got a tumor removed and when I got the news that the surgery was a success I came to visit later that day and brought some treats for my dog. After greeting everyone I sit down and talk with my mom and her husband about how things are going and so on, the typical stuff. After a while my litte brother (18 years old) sits down with us and joins the conversation. After about 2-3 hours I decide to leave, so I stand up and stretch my back and this exchange took place. ( It is very common for everyone in the family the just roast each other in good fun when they have the chance)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrother: \"God damn you're fat how much do you weigh?\" (I'm actually rather skinny)\n\nMe: \"I don't know last time I stood on a scale was in 1458.\" (I often exaggerate like that)\n\nMother: \"Wow I didn't know I was that old\" (While laughing)\n\nMe: \"Must have been a long time since you last looked into a mirror then\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother and her husband burst out laughing but my mom gets angry, telling me how dare I and tells me to leave and walks into the kitchen. I just leave cause talking to her while she is angry is impossible.\n\nShe has been on the receiving end of roasts like that before and always took it in good fun and even had some really good comebacks here and there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow am I the asshole or did she just overreact?",

      "description": "I could go on and on but I'll try to be quick. I had this friend online for probably a year, things seemed fine until he started to tell me multiple stories of drama and love triangles he was somehow involved in. These stories always seemed to have a similar type of girl, the damaged, depressed, lonely... You get the point. Considering I could fit that category I started getting a bit suspicious since I notice he puts a LOT of time in our friendship, so much so that it was making me very uncomfortable. (Getting notifications for all my tweets, seeing who liked them, what time it was, making comments about stuff I said ages ago, looking into anyone who followed me, etc) I made comments from time to time telling him I didn't like to be snooped on but that just gave me a half assed apology then he'd continue as usual. I've felt forced into being someone's \"best friend\" before but something about him didn't add up. He has a history of getting close to damaged girls then giving them a long explanation about how they're too damaged for him and it's causing him stress. (In one story a girl's relationship with her boyfriend was causing him stress because he can't stand to watch her be with a dick, so he basically asked to no longer be friends) Not to mention the girls involved all kinda knew each other, at least slightly, and you better believe he tried to paint each one as an evil witch.  Knowing all this, I tried to detach from him a little, talk less, not tell him as much about my personal life, yada yada.  To be honest I was just waiting for the day he'd do it with me, even though I can honestly say I was always the kind of friend to him that I'd want in a friend for myself... except for the end obviously. One day I was stressed and just got fed up with another snoop attempt, so I blocked him without a word. I just needed space, I can't stand having attentive eyes on me CONSTANTLY. Then a few days later unblocked and explained I'm not necessarily happy with him still but blocking was immature of me. He then sent a long message giving a half assed apology, then explaining that he can't handle someone being \"AGGRESSIVE\" with him, and as such we had to stop being friends. Is this gaslighting? AITA for blocking him? ",

If you want the full story because your curious or think its critical for context you can check my post history, where I posted about the experience.\n\nAfter I posted said story, a redditor pointed out \"that 20 euro note he handed you is almost certainly counterfeit\". \n\nI immediately panicked.  I looked up how to check if a euro is fake.  From what I found, my bill seemed pretty real but some of the descriptions of what I was supposed to look for weren't clear to me.\n\nSo I figured, if it's a fake, it's a high quality fake.  I then to decide to spend it somewhere where I think it's most likely to go unnoticed if it's fake.  I find a local grocery/convenience type store to break it.  I go and spend it without incident.  \n\nI felt sort of guilty because I might've just screwed a small store out of 20 euro.  I'm not sure if the store will have to eat that cost or the government.  I obviously feel guilty about the former possibility.\n\nI rationalize(d) it by saying, well it should still be my euro to spend even if it's fake.  In a way, the scammer stole from that store, not me.\n\nHowever, it always seems to me if you have to rationalize it, your in the wrong.  \n\nI'd like to clarify that I DON'T know whether the bill was fake or not.\n\nSo what does reddit think?",

I told her my reasons and told it to keep civil or else well have to stop contacting each other in any way.

      "description": "I’m on mobile so I apologize in advance for formatting. Also a fake account since he uses Reddit as well. \n\nMy (23F) significant other (25M) is a talented portrait photographer, he’s always kept his tinder account simply as a way to get business from girls who want pictures for their instagrams. \n\nI know some people may think that’s shady to begin with but I’ve been through the account and he consistently shows me if he thinks anything may be misconstrued as inappropriate.\n\nI do trust him, I’ve told him that. I’ve never had an issue with him hanging out with female friends, his ex’s or even random girls that he shoots half nude, never said a thing and genuinely don’t mind.\n\nHowever recently he matched with this girl who is also creative and asked him to plan a shoot, nothing strange there. Except now she’s asked him to get coffee and drinks twice in a two week period to “plan something creative”, he’s taken a rein check both times because he was actually busy, but still plans on going.\n\nMy issue with this is that they matched over tinder, (no where in his bio does it say it’s for business only and he still hasn’t told her that he’s with anyone) she’s asked him out twice for things that can be considered first dates and he usually plans shoots over text or email, not in person. They’ve also begun texting casually about things other than the photo shoot and he now follows her personal Instagram. \n\nHe’s told me that he wants more creative friends, the meet up would simply be to start a friendship, and if she were to make a move he would stop her and clear it up immediately, yet he refuses to confirm that’s it’s just as friends before he meets up with her.\n\nI’ve pushed the topic now, that not only for my sake but also to avoid leading her on he should clear it up before going, but he simply claims that I don’t trust him and if the situation were reversed he’d be fine with me going.\n\nI’ve tried to explain that’s it’s less about trust and more about respect, that I trust that he wouldn’t do anything but I’m disappointed that he’s intentionally letting himself be put in a situation where I need to trust him.\n\nHe says confrontation gives him anxiety, but then in the next breath claims she see’s him as just a friend as well so in that case it wouldn’t be confrontation, simply confirmation. Then in the next breathe said he didn’t want to make her feel awkward and ruin any chances of friendship by turning her down. Why would he even want to risk a chance of her making a move instead of sending a text to clarify beforehand? \n\nSo basically AITA here for not being okay with him going on what this girl most likely thinks is a date, and instead expecting him to make it clear it’s just professional or friendly before he goes?

      "description": "So disclaimer, on mobile so if it's formatted weird or whatever, I'm sorry.\n\nContext:\n\n I'm currently attending a highschool my mates and I are pretty gay. We have a few less boundaries than normal friends would. my best friend, which I'll call Beth, kiss, hug, etc It's nothing romantic, we're just close.\n\nIts kinda the same for a few of my other close friends which is the start of this problem (?). So one of these friends, I'll call  Cheryl, was my ex-girlfriend a while ago (like a year or 2) and recently felt a little left out and so we started greeting each other the same though I didn't feel as comfortable doing that with her as I would with Beth.\n\nSo i just hugging her instead of kissing when we were leaving, etc So she started staring at me or hugging me close but so we could see each other until I kissed her. This happened loads of times and they kept making jokes about having a crush on me or me on her. I tolerated this and laughed along even if it was weird\n\nIt was Beth's birthday, she planned a party  and invited me, Cheryl, etc.\n\nCheryl ended up drunk (kinda fake tho) &amp; It was funny at first but she started getting to a point where she was annoying everyone at the party so I sat her down and made her drink water and eat. \n\nShe kept hugging me while I was talking to other people and taking me from conversations and kept backing me against a wall (party was outside) and doing that thing where she'd stare until I kissed her though she'd escalate it into making out and I felt too awkward and uncomfortable to not reciprocate since I didn't want her to feel bad or to kick off at me/ cause a scene at Beth's party. \n\nI just avoided her after she got distracted but she kept returning and dragging me away, following me. \n\nI got little more tipsy later on with Milly and another close friend and eventually got a little drunk.\n\nCheryl kept trying to kiss me and I will admit I did kiss her back but only because I felt awkward to just stand there and a little pressured which is stupid, I know, but its whatever.\n\nIt comes to the time I gotta go and I hug everyone goodbye and it comes to Cheryl, gives me the look and makes me kiss her and turns into her biting my neck. I feel too awkward to not do it back when prompted so I did.\n\nWhen i just had enough, I just made an excuse to leave. She followed me and it took two other mates to drag them back and I could finally go. She had given me hickeys and I got into a lot of trouble, despite not really wanting it.\n\n I began to avoid her and she started getting people to pressure me to talk to her, and texted that it was a mistake/the drink (despite doing the exact same thing to two other girls a week after the party) \n\nShe had purposely avoided me and moved in lessons and I'm still being blamed for her mood tho I'm still willing to put this behind us.\n\nSorry its long but its really messed me up the past few weeks and I need to know if I'm in the wrong or overreacting.",

      "description": "It's a long story, so I'm going to try to keep it as short as possible with as many details as possible.\n\nMy SO (28m) and I (25f) have been together for almost 7 years. We have a child together, live together, and share all our bills/money. Financially, it wouldnt make sense for us to get married. Our health insurance, taxes, and student loans would sky-rocket. This sucks because we both want to be married, but we understand that it's just not a smart choice. So, my idea was how about we just get engaged? He tells me all the time he wants to marry me, so I thought it was a good idea. I was looking at moissanite rings on etsy that were decently priced and showed him. His reaction caught me completely off guard and I ended up with my feelings hurt. He says that rings are pointless, he doesnt want to be engaged forever, I want it for the wrong reasons, and I only want one because all my friends are getting married. This is not true. I want one because it would remind me of him everytime I looked at it. It would represent our love and commitment to each other. In the 7 years we've been together, he bought me one necklace (that I had to ask him to get) and I wear it everyday because I love it so much. He says we love each other and it doesnt matter if I have a ring. Of course I love him with or without one. But I got some extra cash from a settlement and just thought it would be a good idea. I ended up crying because it made me feel stupid for even bringing it up. He saw I was crying and has been giving me the silent treatment since last night. AITA? Part of me feels like I'm being a stupid girl and the other part of me feels like I'm not. ",

      "description": "Backstory: I(M) have a son(10) with an ex-girlfriend. We have been broken up for about 8 years and have both moved on in our own lives. About 5 years ago, she met the man who she is currently married to while working in the County right underneath where we are from. \n\nShe married the guy, moved down there with him, which is about 50 miles south, and they had a kid. I also got married and had my own kid as well. \n\nWe’ve always been civil and would meet halfway to switch my son off every weekend. I would get him Friday after school and return him Sunday afternoon. \n\nAbout a year ago my EX got a job at a hospital in her city that required her to work nights. Her husband took over switching my son with me on the weekends. This was working for us. \n\nJust recently, maybe 3 months ago, she and her husband separated. He stopped putting as much effort into caring for my son. And while he still does watch him while she works, he has refused to drive halfway to switch off with me anymore. \n\nThis has me driving 100 miles round trip to get him for 2 days and then driving 100 miles round trip to take him back. 200 miles total. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to tell my ex that we should maybe work it out to an every other weekend visit, (which is what the courts mandated. I only get him every weekend because I obviously want to and to help her not have to worry about him.) Or have her reimburse me for gas or something?",

It would be more of a formal thing, than full on house party.\nIt sounded perfect as i’m not a big drinker and don’t like going out that much.\n\nMy oldest friend (Let’s call her Jess) called me up and said that she had nothing to do on new years, and i felt bad for her. I said I would ask Tina if she could come, and she could.\nOn NY jess called me and said she had invited over our old friend (lets call her Laura) and lauras bf (Matt).\nI had never met Matt, but I knew that Laura was a bit of a drinker. \nJess said I should ask Tina if they also could come.\nI felt a bit stuck. Both Jess and Laura are very old and good friends of mine, but Laura is a horrible drunk and will drag other people down with her\nI told jess that this would be a small and formal party and that they would have to control their alcohol. Jess told me that everything would be fine.\nI asked Tina and she once again told me that it was okey.\n\nTo be clear, Tina has never met Jess and Laura, and I had never met this Matt guy. But I hoped for the best.\n\nFast forward to the party, everyone is having fun and talking. A bit of alcohol is served, but everyone is talking it slow and we have a great dinner.\nI get a call from Jess who tells me she, Laura and Matt are on the way. I get a bit worried as I can tell on her voice that they have been drinking quite a bit. I asked her how she was feeling and she just blurs out that ”IT’S NEW YEAR GUUURL, EVERYONE SHOULD BE DRUNK, WE ARE BRINGING THE PARTY B*TCHES”.\nI start to panic and tell my bf that they sound waaaay to drunk to fit in. He tells me not to worrie yet, and wait until they arrive.\n\nWhat follows is me having to babysit 3 grown people as they come in, put up 3 full bottles of alcohol on the table, make themselfs more drinks and are loud and obnoxious. They spill on the floor, on the carpet, scream and almost brake all of Tinas wineglasses, and Laura and Matt start to argue. \nThey have not even been at the party for an hour befors Tina comes up to me and tells me that my friends has to leave.\nAt this point I am so embarrassed that I wanna die, and i tell them to leave.\nIt takes a solid 30 minutes before they go, and Matt startes to say how I’m a bad friend for throwing them out from a party on new years eve, and I should expect people to get a bit drunk.\nThey leave and i can do nothing but dit and stare as my bf comfortes me. \n\nThe next day (today) my friend told me that she was so mad at me for throwing her out, and she would never do that to me. I was the worst person for not taking care of her when she needed me.\nI told her that it wasn’t my party and not up to me, but she said that I should be on her side, sinne we are friends. \n\nI have been beating myself up for this all day, I don’t know if I did the right thing..",

      "description": "So my mom never developed good eating habits, and I think because of her, I’ve made a big effort in my life to learn to cook and eat healthy. I’m also a SAHM and very much enjoy meal prepping and planning, her meals were always roast beef, chicken, potatoes, corn and/or peas growing up, or stuff from a box/freezer. We barely touch that stuff if I don’t need to(the stuff from a box or freezer, we obviously eat beef and chicken) . She is overweight and because she lies so much, we can’t believe her on anything she tells us. She’ll tell me she’s been doing great on her diet, and then tell me she’s diabetic, and then tell me she’s been cured all in the same day depending on her motives at the time. She’s recently injured herself partially because of her bad health habits and has come to stay with me for a few weeks since she can’t do much on her own. All the cupboards have child locks on that she can’t figure out (as I have 3 kids). Our meals are mostly healthy here. I’m refusing to give her certain things, not ordering take out, not giving her pop, not buying her sugar crap that has no other nutritional value(example donut) , forcing her to eat multigrain bread instead of white, etc. Her calorie count is way down since she’s been sneaking McDonald’s and other fast food for years all well telling us all the time how great she’s doing on her diet, but now she can’t sneak food. I’ve never really pushed her diet, it was mostly my sibling as they live with her full time and I had no patience to deal with her lying about it. Am I an asshole to cut her calories so drastically? She’s probably gone from eating 2,500 a day(guesstimate from the stuff we find out that she’s hidden) to maybe 1200. (She’s 4’10). I feel bad it’s so extreme but I know if I give her an inch, she’ll take a mile. She’s eating what I’m eating, however I’ll take a pop or handful of candy sometimes when she’s not around. I’m also breastfeeding twins and 110lbs and need the calories. She has access to apples that she brought with her. \n\nFurther info - her dog also just passed away so she’s even more inclined to emotionally eat. But my older son is keeping her super busy instead of moping so I’d like to think that’s a moot point given she has something to focus on. But maybe relevant because I feel guilty I’m doing this at a very sensitive time for her. ",

      "description": "No she’s not crazy, per se, that she argues with her boyfriend over their son. Because it’s not that kind of baby drama, rather than she gets super jealous of other people boasting about their babies. So first off, my nephews first name initial is E, and my sister calls him her “little e”. She had some girl on Snapchat, who also has a baby with a first name initial of E, who also was calling her baby her “little E” as well. My sister went ballistic and started talking crap on Snapchat about her, and then blocked her. Last month, she made a shady ig post about people hyping up girls who don’t work or go to school, and just sit around all day. I texted her asking what was wrong and she hesitated at first, until she told me that a friend of a girl with a baby, said that she had the cutest baby in the world. And then my sister began to talk crap about the baby, saying he’s bald, and not like my nephew with a head full of hair. Today she texted me all mad saying if I seen so&amp;so’s post since she’s expecting a baby. When I saw the post, it was her posting about her upcoming baby shower, which was a sailor theme. My sisters baby shower for my nephew was also a sailor theme, so I told her why is she making such a big deal and always getting mad at girls with other babies. She then said “never mind” and started ignoring my texts, which I know means she mad at me for not agreeing with her. So I’m wondering, AITA for not agreeing with her hysterics over literally nothing? ",

In my mind, \"yes\" either means that I am fine, or I don't want to talk about it.  Either way, don't ask again.  I really hate games, so I feel like I should not have societal pressure to ask again if someone says they are fine, even if they look miserable.  If they wanted to talk about it, they wouldn't say \"yes, I am fine.\"\n\nLooking for some outside opinions!  Thanks :)",

      "description": "Ok I know this sounds bad but hear me out. One of my closest friends has a problem with blackheads all over his face. I’ve known him for over a year and they’ve been there pretty much that whole time. It’s nothing crazy, there’s only about 5 or 6, but they are pretty big and noticeable and very obviously blackheads that can easily be extracted. One of them is right above the corner of his lip and is probably 1/8” in diameter, so it does stick out pretty significantly when you look at him. \n\nHe also has a lot of confidence issues and probably some body dysmorphia. He’s a VERY attractive guy but hasn’t had a lot of positive experiences with girls. Personally, I think it’s because of his confidence, because if he was more confident I think girls would be all over him. \n\nHe often vents to me about his insecurities but has never brought up the blackheads. I honestly don’t think he even realizes what they are or how easy it would be to remove them. Even though he has never specifically brought them up as an insecurity, I’m sure if they were gone he would see his beautiful clear skin in the mirror and feel a little better about himself. I have some blackhead removal tools and would easily, safely, and painlessly be able to get rid of them in around 10 minutes. WIBTA if I offer to extract them for him or should I just leave it be? ",

      "description": "Growing up I had gotten along with most of my family pretty well, however there was one cousin that I got along with more than others. We'll call him Adam for anonymity. Adam and I didn't really hang out until into our twenties, but we were the cousins that were similar in age growing up so we hung out at family gatherings and things like that. He had always been on the heavier side, so I think he had a bit of a self esteem issue when he was younger. Into his twenties he began losing the weight, and with that came confidence, or more prominently, ego. He would be condescending when he talked to people. If he thought that he was even slightly more knowledgeable on a subject, he would amp up the sarcasm to 10 as if you didn't know anything that was going on. He was a manipulative narcissist. He then became a pretty big \"hippie\" type guy. Smokes a bunch of weed and psychedelics and drinks a bunch of beer everyday. (nothing too wrong with that, but he thinks he's going to be reincarnated as a fruitful tree when he dies and doesn't have the greatest moral compass) \n\nRegardless of those things, I could still tolerate to be around him. I'd spend time with him helping around his place. He had some rabbits and quail so I would help him clean the cages and pens since I didn't live far away. So I was at his house quite a bit. He had this girlfriend, we'll call her Amy. Amy lived with Adam at the house and had a little girl 3 year old girl from a previous relationship, Josie. Whenever I would go over to Adams house, Josie would always want me to run around and play with her as most little kids do. I would happily do so. She was adorable. \n\nSomething that bothered me a lot was Adam would always talk down about Amy behind her back. He didn't necessarily call her name's or anything (a bitch once or twice) but he would talk about how she wasn't very smart, and how he didn't think he was going to stay with her. She \"wasn't the girl for him\" and he mentioned that even from the very beginning of them dating and talking that he didn't think they were going to last, and he really didn't mind. He said the girls only really lived there for convenience sake.. that and the fact that she was pregnant with his child. \n\nI would visit Adam's house pretty frequently as he would ask me to help him with the animals. So I became close to Amy and Josie. When it came time for the new baby girl to be born, Beth, I was at the hospital shortly after delivery. I got to hold her just a couple of hours after she was born. She was awesome. \n\nA couple weeks after his own little girl was born, my cousin again showed his disinterest in continuing a relationship with his girlfriend. Even though she just had his baby, he didn't think they should be together. Out of the blue one day a few weeks later I saw on Facebook that they had split up. One night after putting the girls to sleep, Amy had overheard Adam in the bathroom and he seemed to be talking to someone. So she opened the door to him taking a bath, video chatting with another woman. \n\nHe had been cheating for a while. He started a new job and said that he just kind of \"fell in love\" with this other girl, Taylor that he had met. Instead of leaving or ending the relationship. Adam pursued a relationship with another woman on the side, constantly cheating while simultaneously telling Amy that he loved her and had a \"family\" with her. When Amy found him cheating, she left to stay with family a town over. She was devestated, but she didn't stop him from being the dad still. So she still let her now 4 year old stay with him (she had grown to know him as dad since her biological father isn't really in the picture.) and their 3 month old baby girl.\n\nLess than a week after being caught cheating, with the kids at his house, he had the Taylor girl in his bed. Josie actually walked in on this other woman in bed with him. Another woman in the same bed that \"mommy and daddy\" sleep in together. He called me and told me what happened and I immediately told him how much of idiot he was. He was giving up an awesome chick for some fling at work. I told him he really needed to drop the bullshit and do whatever he could to work things out with Amy. He told me that he had no interest in fixing things. I texted Amy and let her know that even though things had happened the way they did, that I was sorry for what happened and I wanted to reassure her that even though my cousin has fucked up, I still wanted to be a part of the girls' life and that if she needed anything I was there to talk. After all, I had became close with her as well. \n\nShe pretty much brushed me off because she was hurt. She didn't want to talk to anyone but Adam, and rightfully so. The father of her kid(s) had just cheated on her and actually ended up staying with the mistress. She didn't want to talk to anyone besides him because she was so hurt. After making sure she was okay, I left her alone. \n\nA couple months after the incident, Amy contacted me and thanked me for being kind to her when she was going through a rough time. She told me she was really hurt by what had happened, but she was doing a little better and she let me know that she still wanted to be friends and I could still be a part of the girls' life. I was happy to hear that. I hadn't been able to see them in a while.\n\nOver the course of the weeks following, Amy and I kind of hit it off. We began texting more often. About little stuff. Big stuff. Pretty much everything. We would talk about what life plans and we eventually ended up meeting up to hang out. We really hit it off. She made me feel amazing, and it was pretty apparent that she felt the same way. We began hanging out quite a bit. \n\nIt wasn't an ideal situation, talking to my cousin's ex girlfriend and \"baby momma\", and we both felt a bit off by it but we agreed that we wanted to pursue something together. So after talking for a while, I called him and expressed my feelings for her. I told him that it wasn't just a fling and that we both mutually wanted to be together. He egotistically replied \"I doubt she wants to be with you, but if you guys make each other happy then she's an adult and it's not my place to stop you guys.\" He wanted to make sure the girls were taken care of, and I promised that no matter what if I was with Amy I would take care of those girls and protect them and show them how their mom should be treated.\n\nAmy and I began dating. She was introduced to the family as my girlfriend. She took me to work events as her boyfriend. We spent nearly every day together for 9 months. Her and the girls would stay the night at my place for sometimes almost a week at a time before returning home. Josie loved me and would talk about how excited she would be to come over. I got to watch Beth learn the first year and a half of her life and everything that entails.\n\nWhen Beth got hives, I gave her an oatmeal bath. We went together to urgent care with her Josie. I watched them alone a few times. If I stopped to get my girlfriend flowers I would make sure to stop and get Josie some too to make sure she felt adored as well as her mom. I would play with her when we went to the playground. Running around with them just to make sure she knew she was cared for. The girls knew my family as their family.. I worked hard every day to be able to save to get a place of our own for Amy and I and the girls. I didn't get to spend every day with them, because they still went to their dads, but I got to spend months and months with them. I wasn't like my cousin. I knew after a pretty short period of time who I wanted. I wanted those three incredible girls. I adored Amy. Any past ex girlfriend or experience felt immeasurable compared to her. I finally found this incredible reason to get up and go to work in the morning. \n\nOn my hard days waking up in the morning, all it took was for me to look over at my beautiful girlfriend or hear Beth cry or Josie wake up and want to crawl in bed with us and it gave me the motivation to get out of bed and go to work. On my long days where I wanted nothing more than to just come home after work and crash and go to bed. The thought of spending time with them gave me enough energy to keep going. I fell in love with Amy. She was hesitant at first. Expected considering her two baby dad's had cheated on her. But she expressed how happy she was  with me. She talked about how she loved that she could call me any time of day and it didn't matter what we talked about, I would answer and be happy to talk to her. She talked about how she loved that I would include the kids in dates and never make her feel like they were a burden to have around. She was still hurt from the past, but she was letting her walls down. She began sneaking in I love you here and there.\n\nWe had something great. We we're both working. We we're both talking about the future. We we're having fun and building something with each other. We had a great sex life. We wanted to see each other succeed. We bettered each other. She said in the beginning that she was done having children and honestly, even though all my life ive just wanted to be a husband and a father. I was more than happy doing life with her if I knew her and those two girls were all I was ever going to get.. one day she looked at me and said \"you know what? I know I said I don't want anymore kids... But I think that I can see myself having a baby with you.. she told me she loved me.. \n\nThen something happened. She got a little more distant.. she wasnt talking as much and she had started saying things that I knew we're things my cousin had said to her.\n\nAfter nearly a year together, my cousin's relationship with Taylor had failed... Who knows, maybe he cheated on her too.. he then started trying to pursue Amy again.. it confused her. He didn't give a ",

      "description": "On mobile and typing quickly so I apologize for any spelling/grammatical/formatting issues. \n\nContext- I have a 5 month old son. My coworker “Jane” has a son who is a few months older than mine. \n\nWe had a catered lunch today and when Jane came up to get food she was eating right next to me. Jane looked like crap, red eyes and nose, sniffling and coughing. \n\nI asked if she was okay and Jane said that she caught RSV from her son and she had not gotten any sleep because she spent the night watching him sleep to make sure he was breathing.  Jane said that she was “highly contagious” and that she had not been to a doctor yet. \n\nI commented about if Jane should really be at work if she’s so sick. Jane said “what’s going to happen here if I don’t come to work? They need me here!” She is in a leadership position and we do not have a replacement really so I let it slide. \n\nI got up and walked across the room and Jane followed me, at which point I asked if she could please not be so close to me because if my son gets RSV it could kill him. She acted offended and ended up leaving the break room and another coworker told me that I was out of line and an asshole and that I’d be “fine” since Jane did not directly touch me. \n\nThis was a serve yourself catered event so Jane touched all of the utensils to serve her food that other people touched after her.

      "description": "AITA? So i was watching a movie at the theater with my girlfriend the other night. The theater policy goes that ones allowed to buy seats assigned to those with disabilities whens the movie starts previewing trailors. So thats exactly what we did we waited for 10 mins until 8:45pm got 2 tickets which were in the disabled section and headed in. When I got in I found to middle aged folks (male and female) sitting there. So i naturally told them hi these are our assigned seats. The man said that his wife or sister (not sure), was disabled and thats why they sat here. Honestly i sympathized in the beginning and asked them ok thats fine but were are your assigned seats. They pointed literally to the two seats all the way to the corner of the front row by the screen. Seats had I seen when booking would never pay for. My girlfriend starts walking to those seats but i tell her theres no way i can watch the movie from that angle. I know being limp legally isnt a disability since i work in rehab but I didnt mind initially until i saw their seats. I felt like they pulled a disability card and suggestively said indicated that they needed it more knowing fully well that they would ask us to sit in terrible seats. I went back to them and told them \"Im so sorry but i honestly cant sit there, and I really apologize but can we please switch\". My girlfriend stood away from me as I was talking to them because she didnt agree with what I was doing. Shes like just let them sit there for the greater good but I paid money with intent of watching a movie from a reasonable area. I felt like an asshole when we sat down because i wasnt disabled at all and his wife did have a serious limp as they walked of the the front row. What you guys think, was I wrong to tell them to get up?",

      "title": "AITA for sacrificing a 4-year relationship to music?",
      "description": "Ok, so I (25M) have recently made a decision to give up on a 4-year relationship with 24F in order to start making music and to transform it into my main activity. It was my first long relationship, and it was not smooth sometimes, but I loved her and still do. Or maybe I think I do.  \n\n\nSo our first year was alright, except she became jealous of all my female friends and she asked me to stop communicating with them because she didn't like the way I'm talking to them (she felt like I was flirting, but I was not). I tried to explain to her that there was nothing to worry about since I'm with her, but she didn't want to hear anything. Since I was \"in love\" and all, I swallowed it and had to inform my female friends that I will have to limit our communication. I still had short conversations with them, but it was done secretly and was limited to social networks only. \n\n(I guess this is where it should've ended).  \n\n\nThe second and third years still felt fine, the above limit was live and nothing special was happening. I continued to secretly message my old friends, but not often. It was mainly them asking me how it was going and me replying. With my ex we had many trips here and there, started living together. All seemed to be fine, no major arguments. An important thing, all this time I was working full-time, and occasionally did some gigs with my band. I really loved concerts and I was complaining to my ex that I wanted music to become my career. She started to ask me if I was going to continue doing it and how serious I was. Here is another important thing: Idk if it's the case for all, but for me, our concerts were bringing more and more female fans which irritated my ex. So she was completely pissed because of this fact since she was jealous af. Hence, her questions and some scary things she did which were led by her emotions. I told her that small gigs are enough for me and I was not going to become a McCartney.   \n\n\nLast year was quite difficult since I noticed I started spending more time on music than on anything else plus I got some mental problems with questions like \"What to do next? What is the purpose of all this? Do I want to do what I want to or what I have to?\" I've left my job because we moved to another place and I had troubles finding a new one. Gigs were gone as well. So I was more into myself which made me start heavily doing music at home. It felt like our relationship was something that always existed. She wanted me to be more romantic and attentive, and I was busy trying to deal with my existential crisis. At this moment, she proposed to start living separately thinking it would change something, and I had to move out. Since then, I completely fell out of reality - non-stop writing, recording, thinking. Even wanted to invest all my savings into a studio and instruments, but decided to stop myself. As for the relationship, I was bringing her flowers every week (and it was not a forced move - I really wanted to make her happy with that), but we saw each other during weekends only spending time walking or driving around. And at some point, she comes to me and asks if we are done. I'm like \"Why? We're fine, no?\" And she says \"No, we are not\". Adds, \"if we want to become a family one day and have kids and stuff, I need a stable man that can earn money and make sure the family runs well\". And me with my uncertain music stuff and depression, I am not the one she can think of. So she gave me some time to think it over, and me, after weighing pros and cons, I told her that maybe I should solve all my issues before committing to something serious as this, otherwise, I'll make everyone around me unhappy. She bursts into tears and leaves.  \n\n\nI am still uncomfortable with the decision I made because I had really hard times deciding. On one hand, you just work, make children, die (all of this beautifully wrapped), and I can't say I hated working. I loved what I was doing and I was pretty successful. On the other hand, you're just trying to pursue something you were always dreaming of, and you have no idea whether the result will turn out good or bad. But maybe this tells something about my maturity?  \n\n\nTo give you some more background, I've been doing music occasionally as a hobby since long time but in the past 2 years I've become quite prolific in writing, so I decided to start investing money and time in this activity with no guarantee it could bring me any financial return, and my ex didn't like that. She was hoping I'd become more mature and would work on our relationship and myself to finally become a family with kids and stuff. Of course, she wanted me to think about how I was gonna earn for a living and come up with something stable, and of course, she considers music as something childish and infantile. The same does my family. But it is something I really want to finally spend time on. And something that makes me happy (most of the times).  \n\n\nOh pls, kill me, why being an adult is so complicated?  \n\n\nTL;DR: had a 4-year relationship, found I wanted to change my main activity to music because it made me happy, my gf didn't like that for her reasons, chose music over the relationship after all, although it was a black box with no clear outcome or stability in the future, hurt myself and my ex in the short term\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for grammar - not a native speaker :( ",

      "description": "Hello. I've really been struggling with this... So my dad has been in prison since a week after my 10th birthday. His brother has been helping him out and for awhile was pressuring my family to get us to have a relationship. My uncle finally stopped when I told the family that I would cut anyone out who tried to pressure me into doing that considering his convictions that I'm not allowed to post here.\n\nSo last Summer I sort of caved and agreed to talk to him on the phone a few times. It was going well and we agreed that I'd fly down (he's stuck in my home state for 15 years) and meet him for the first time in ~10 years. \n\nHe got a girlfriend, and she's... Pushy. He put her on the phone without ever asking me and she added me on Facebook as a way to allow my dad to talk to me via internet since he's technically not allowed but for work purposes (used to be a programmer or something). Would comment on my posts and it was just weird.\n\nI brushed it off because I figured it was nice he could find happiness and a partner. \n\nWell, he buys the plane tickets I think. I'm not really sure on that but it makes me feel bad the cash could've been wasted because I decided not to go.\n\nHe calls me one day and announces that they're now engaged after 3 months of dating, and they want to get married when I fly down and visit him, because they want me to be there... I hadn't seen him in 10 fucking years and he wants to make this trip about him and his new girlfriend-soon-to-be-wife?! Needless to say, I called back after giving it some thought. I could have discussed it with him, but I didnt- I outright cancelled, because he was so inconsiderate to what this meant in the first place as to ever ask that. No conversation, nothing, and told him to never speak to me again and that I don't need his goddamn money (he had sent $200 since we started talking) since I've survived all these years without his support and will continue to do so. After a few texts and blocking his GF on Facebook, he hasn't bothered me. He's never even made an admission of guilt for all he's put me through, instead turning the focus back on himself and how he suffered in prison.\n\nSo I won't be there for his wedding or whatever. I feel bad because he's gotten the last photo we took together tattooed on his back and everything. I clearly mean a lot to him in some weird way. \n\nI'm all about communication. But that felt like a bad line to cross so I didn't give it a chance. AITA?\n\nTl;Dr Agreed to see father for first time in 10 years. Cancelled the trip without giving him a chance to discuss it when he announced he wanted to get married to this new woman on this trip. Told him to never speak to me again.",

      "description": "I (20M) go to college 9 hours away from my home state where my girlfriend (19F) lives. We started dating over the summer and have kept our relationship running smoothly through the fall semester. Winter break has been the first time we’ve been together for more than a week since college started in August. I leave to go back to school on Sunday meaning that today (Friday) is the second to last day we’ll have together before we have a week for spring break. \nHer best friend (19F) invited her over for a girls night tonight and my girlfriend agreed to go without talking to me. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue but I can’t help but feel offended because it’s my second to last day home and she’s spending time with her friend who goes to school 30 minutes away and neither of their winter breaks end for another 2 weeks. I told her that I really wanted to spend the night with her because we only have a very limited amount of time left and she could see her friend after I left but she said this was something she really wanted to do. She reminded me that she rarely sees this friend despite how close they were in highschool, however, that doesn’t seem like a good reason to me because if they really wanted to see each other more often then they could do that with minimal effort. A more valid reason she gave me was that we’ve been spending almost every night together lately, which is true, but it still upset me because after tonight we only have one more. She clearly felt bad that she upset me but it didn’t change her mind about going to spend time with her friends. I don’t want to seem clingy or controlling but I really feel upset she didn’t make me a priority when we have so little time left together. I’m even more mad because I feel like I have to suppress my feelings so I don’t ruin our last day together. AITA offended that she didn’t make me a priority when after tommorow she won’t be seeing me for months?\nTLDR: I’m upset with me long distance girlfriend who spent the night with her friends, who live in the area, instead of me on our second to last day together until Spring Break.",

      "description": " I have four friends: I drive my own car, two friends drive their own car, one could but doesn't drive, and the other doesn't drive at all. The two that don't drive usually bum a ride off of this one guy who drives (he will be R) and the other that drives (H) sometimes takes them home but not often. I never take them home because of strict parents who don't like me off on my own. Anyways we decide to go to the mall; when we walk out the parking lot R says, \"Welp I have 1/8 tank left so I can't take you guys home.\" The two look at me and H. I say I'm not and H doesn't really want to either. They keep pestering me for some reason until I finally say I'm not taking either of them home. H ends up having to take both of them home even though he didn't plan on it. Am I the asshole for not giving in to their leechy ways? Gas isn't cheap and parents aren't very forgiving. Thoughts?",

      "description": "Every Christmas, my family goes up to my great uncle’s cabin in the mountains. On Christmas morning, my brother and I are given the task to replace all of the wood that was used in the fireplace. Usually, we need to stack wood 5 feet wide and 6 feet tall. Last year, however, my brother got mad, (we don’t exactly know why, but it was something about me not doing it his way) and he went inside, only having brought up about 3-4 groups of 3. Mind you, we are on a mountain, so climbing many steps ~50 times (When we work together) with about 3 pieces of wood, sucks. I did it all by myself, meaning I climbed about 25 steps ~100 times. I worked a long time (maybe 8:00-1:00, if I recall correctly) until my brother came out near the end. He brought up one group of wood, even though I had just finished. I’ve been arguing with him, and he hasn’t denied this number. This year, I have an injured thumb on my dominant hand, which makes it hard to pick up objects AND he has not tended to the fire once. I told him I wouldn’t help him bring in wood. I see this as fair, and he thinks I’m an asshole. AITA?\nTL;DR: brother refused to help carry wood; I’m making him do it by himself this year, because it’s karma and I have an injured thumb",

      "description": "So I often drink a couple of beers after work to wind down (not every day, but it’s a normal thing for me). Tonight I was watching tv and my son asked if he could try some. I held the bottle and let him have a small sip. I thought he might spit it out but he just kind of made a small face and that was it. \n\nMy wife was right there when it happened and she gets this horrified look on her face. I say “he just had a small sip”. She said nothing and ends up putting our son down to bed and proceeds to let me have it in a the weird hushed/scream voice she uses when she’s upset but wants to be quiet. \n\nShe said she thought for sure I would tell him no when he asked and she can’t believe I gave him alcohol. I explained why I didn’t think it was a big deal but she’s still pretty angry. I guess I’ve always been more easygoing when it comes to parenting...\n\nAnyway I’m just wondering if what I did sounds so terrible to the average person. I mean, it’s not like I let him chug the whole bottle! I figured he was just curious about the taste, and now he knows. Literally one sip and that was it. (Although if you ask my wife she’ll say he had a “gulp” of it). \n\nSo was I the asshole in this situation?

      "description": "So some background here I've been working a 9 to 5 job for almost 5 years since I was 16 and I've been paid reasonably well. I pay rent towards my parents which equals out to around £550 per month.   \n\n\nIt's fair to say my mother is somewhat bad with money and sometimes needs the odd £50 to get something paid off or fixed. However last year around September she had me take out a £1,500 loan because she had multiple bills which were coming out the same month we got a new car. I did it and she took the payments out of my rent which seemed fair. Maybe 3-4 months later, she needed a £3,500 loan because she had been missing rent / other bills, I told her no because I already have one and I don't wanna be worrying about two loans when I am only 18 which aren't even mine. She begged and pleaded and I gave in. The payments came out of my rent, and so on.  \n\n\nSo in total maybe £410 was off my rent and I was giving her £140 per month. All fine, but I now have two massive loans I need to pay back. The £1,500 loans has now been paid off a while ago and I am now a couple months off the £3,500 one. No big issue. However just before my sister's birthday came up in October, my mum asked me for £500 which she would pay me back within 3 weeks. I said no because I'd be living bare minimum for the next weeks as I'd just have enough money for travel and lunch at work. I thought that was the end off it.  \n\n\nTurns out she found my wallet and took out £500 out of my savings which I only discovered on the night of my sister's birthday when I was checking my accounts. So I was obviously pissed as I told her no and she did this behind my back. She said it'll be back in my account by the Friday. Friday comes, still no £500 back in my savings. So it's now been 2 months, since my sister's party and I've lost £500 from my savings and my mum has repeatedly asked me for money to loan out to her \"that she'll pay back\". I've said no because I am still missing my £500. She now goes on to about how we are family and family should help each other, and that I am being spiteful. To be fair, I've threatened to tell my dad about the whole situation about the loans and savings as he is totally unaware.  \n\n\nSo here I stand, a mum who constantly asks me for money and being made feel guilty about not being able to lend her money because I am her son. My sister who is 18 is taking my mum's side and saying I am being disrespectful but I feel like I am being totally just. I just don't want to have to repeatedly wait for my money back knowing that my mum is just gonna end up asking me again. I've told her the past 2 months I am not giving her any money at all, and despite this she keeps asking.   \n\n\nTDLR: I've taken 2 loans out for my mum who misses payments, meanwhile she asks for money frequently. One time I said no, she took money out of my savings without telling me. Hasn't paid me back. Now accuses me of being spiteful and disrespectful to her and the family. Meanwhile I just want my money back and for her to stop asking me for money, I almost 21 years old and I don't need to worrying about lending money to people.",

      "description": "One of my roommates is also one of my best friends. I love her to pieces, but she sometimes acts in a way that I find to be incredibly disrespectful and upsetting. She has a really bad habit of making plans, and then at the time of the plans she’ll be doing something else, and not responding to my texts, essentially leaving me hanging. Now this doesn’t happen very often, but often enough that it really gets under my skin. \n\nI know that description is kinda vague, so I’ll give a specific example. Last night when she got home we talked and made plans to go to the library today. I said I was going to get up and come early in the day, and she said that she had a dance practice until 2 and would meet me after her practice. So I went to the library, and at about 1:30 I saved her a spot and sent her a text basically saying “hey, I’m at (X library) if you’re still coming after dance”. \n\nBy 3, she hasn’t texted me back or arrived at the library. We have each other on find my friends, so I checked where she was, thinking maybe her practice went late, and saw that she’s at her friend’s apartment (they’re mutual friends, I’ve been there a bunch and recognized the location). I don’t have any issue with the fact that she went to her friend’s place, but I find it incredibly disrespectful that she didn’t bother to let me know she wasn’t coming when we had plans and I was saving her a seat, especially since this is far from the first time she’s disappeared with these friends when we were supposed to do something. \n\nSo, WIBTA for basically calling her out on how upsetting and disrespectful I find this? She’s one of my best friends plus we live together and I really don’t want to cause drama if it’s unnecessary, but I also think it’s super rude to not let me know. It would take all of 30 seconds to send me a text saying “hey sorry, I’m actually hanging out with (X) after practice”, but it just feels like she doesn’t care enough to let me know. This is not the first time she’s done something like this, where at the time of our plans she’s not there and not texting me back, and I just feel like she thinks it’s not important to let me know, but maybe I’m just overreacting?

She would say that I probably dip her toothbrush on the toilet or some other awful thing like that. For the record, I never did anything bad to her things. I simply ignored her.\n\nOne night, my mom got mad at me because I didn’t want to wash the dishes she left on the sink because I had to study. She always left her stuff on the sink cause we’re the nieces and nephews so we apparently had to clean up after her. I got full of it and basically confronted her. She said a few choice words and I said a few choice words as well. I don’t exactly remember what I told her but it really hurt her and she slapped me and I slapped her back. She got so mad that she basically smacked me in the head multiple times while screaming at me.\n\nIn my culture, it’s an asshole move and I feel more of an asshole especially since she had a miscarriage a few months later. I’ve been shamed by my aunts and by grandmother for being a bad kid and I feel like shit to this day.\n\ntldr: Aunt and I got into an argument over dishes, I said some words that hurt her, she slapped me, I slapped her back and I possibly may have caused a miscarriage.\n",

      "description": "Sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on mobile. \n\n\nSo, long story short, we haven’t been doing all that well recently because I genuinely HAVE been an asshole for a good chunk of the year. Anger issues, it’s not fun. I’m working on trying to see a therapist as it currently stands but setting up a new doctors appointment and running through insurance isn’t fun. \n\n\nWell, we live together. And we’ve been dating off an on for a while, decided to make it official this year by moving in together and blah blah. I just recently learned my anger has become an issue, and a lot of it for the past month has been randomly directed at her. She’s an angel, did nothing wrong, and took it all without a word. A couple of weeks ago she finally said to me “I’m not sure I can do this anymore” which was a massive eye opener for me, and I began to work on trying meditation and other forms of anger control until I could get on some anti depressant medication. \n\n\nBut back to the story. The other day I noticed she was on her phone, like a lot, and at one point I had glanced over and she was sending pictures, not nudes just general selfies etc, to some guy with a nickname on her phone. And his response included the word “princess” so I asked her about it. She immediately got self defensive and began to raise her voice, to which I did as well and things got a little heated and I said “hey look, can we talk about this like adults instead of screaming at each other?” So we did. Her response to the so called “flirting” was that it was “Helping my self confidence issues, and it’s not like I’m seeing him in person. He’s just a customer from work who gave me his number and I decided to text him because why not” \n\n\nI take issue to this, and I said so, to which she HAD called me an asshole, and has now taken off from the apartment for the night. Not sure where she’s going, she blocked me and she’s been gone for about an hour now. I don’t think she’s coming back home tonight because she took her laptop and everything with her. \n\n\nWhich begs the question, AM I the asshole? Because I honestly don’t know. My anger IS an issue but part of me says she shouldn’t be doing that, regardless of whether or not she’s “not meeting him in person”. But I could also be overreacting, and I’d rather not talk to my friends about it because I don’t like to bother them with personal details. ",

      "description": "Ten years ago my stepmom accused me of stealing money from my stepbrother. I was 19 at that time, my stepbrother is a month younger. The whole thing was a set up, my stepmom told me it was. She and I had a fight the day before and she told me to just watch what she can do. The next day I got back from work and was met with the accusation that I've stolen thousands of dollars from my stepbrother. My parents kept our money in a lock box in their room with the key hidden. I also had a bank account so I had my own debit card for gas and a little spending money but 90% of my money went into the box. Stepmom claimed thousands of dollars were missing from my stepbrothers money in the lock box. After days of fighting it was determined that there was no proof I stole it but I would be punished anyway. My dad sat me down at the kitchen table to tell me my punishment as my stepmom stood behind him with the biggest smile,dancing and flipping me off. First was that they were cutting off paying for my college. They had already paid for my first and second semester at a community college but they took that money back out of my money. They also took away my debit card and gave me a strict allowance of only gas money to get to work, this included keeping track of my odometer calculating it down to the mile. This was to go on until I moved out which I did about a year later. \n  News was spread around that I was a thief and friends and family distanced themselves, plus I could not go out with no money and being tracked. I was doing well in college but I was not allowed to go back until I moved out and could have control of my own money. There are many reasons I rarely have communicated with my parents the past 10 years but this is one of the bigger ones. My dad has been trying to get me to meet with him and talk things out, mostly because he wants to see his grandaghter. My brothers car broke down so Ive been giving him rides to my parents house. This time I got stuck there talking to my dad. He asked me whats going on with me ignoring him and everything so I tried to talk. First thing I brought up was the situation explained above and my dad and brother laughed out loud at me. Dad said he cant believe I still think about that and that its a long time to hold something agaist him. I told him if we cant even get passed that there's no point talking and left. My brother texted me throughout the night and today trying to get me to come back and talk more, he says 10 years is a long time to hold that against my dad and I should leave it in the past. They say even with what happened its my own fault for not finishing college and moving out. Just thinking about it, 10 years does sound like a long time to hold on to somthing and plenty of people do put themselves through college under worse circumstances. So now im wondering if I am wrong to hold this particular grudge from ten years ago against him. \n",

      "description": "My dad's side of the family is kind of a lot and to be honest, I don't like spending time with them. We don't agree on politics, religion, or basically anything. I see them twice a year, give or take. They get a little drunk and loud and judgmental. I try to change the subject to neutral topics like baking so that we can avoid any drama, like the time I declined a burger with a brief \"I'm vegetarian\" and my aunt wouldn't hug me goodbye because \"animals were put on this earth for our use\" and I was going against the will of God.\n\nMy sister (30) is dating an older man (45, I think?) and when my aunts found out, they freaked out. There was a lot of drama and now they won't talk to her. \n\nI am gay. My immediate family is super cool and supportive about it, but I know that my extended family would not be. My dad is encouraging me to come out to my extended family.\n\nHere's where the (potential) asshole part comes in. I think that if I came out to them, I would never be invited to one of their family events again. It seems like it happened to my sister. It would be so great to not have to spend time with them. We have nothing in common and they are kind of crappy people. So I leave it in your hands: WIBTA if I came out to them so that I wouldn't have to spend time with them again?",

      "description": "I was in a long distance  relationship with a girl (I'll call her Mary. She started taking over my life and my time, to a point  where I was in my phone at family gatherings, parties, etc.\n\nNot  only did she consume my time, she also started to try and stop some friendships, specificaly, this girl (Rebecca). We were friends since before I even started dating Mary, but the thing is, Mary hated her.\n\nShe  hated her with a burning passion, She'd wish death uppon her several times, called  her a Whore, a Slut, and several other things, but  Rebecca had no idea of this, since these 2 never even talked.\n\nOne  day, Mary and I had a fight about my  friendship with Rebecca. The fight ended with Mary saying something like \"That bitch is dead to me\" and I thought \"Oh well, If Rebecca is dead to her, why should I even mention her?\"\n\nWrong move\n\nMy  friendship with Rebbeca continued normaly for a few months, but I never told Mary about being friends with her, and I never told Rebecca that my gf wished death uppon her without even knowing each other(Rebecca had some self-love issues at the  time).\n\nBut Mary came to visit me once though\n\nWe  were having a nice time, when she saw Rebecca in the  distance. She asked me \"Are you still friends with that bitch?\", I told her I still was. She got real mad. We fought and cried for a while, until she decided to test me: Either it was her or Rebecca, couldn't be both.\n\nSince  I thought I loved her, I had to talk to Rebecca and tell her the truth: my gf hated her and that we couldn't be friends anymore. She was devastated, and so was I. I talked about the  situation with my mom, and she said that if my girlfirend was setting up  stupid conditions like that, then she didn't love me as much as she  said she did. I told this to Mary and she got in the mindset that she  had fucked up, at least partially. She then let me be friends with  Rebecca, but still didn't want to know anything about her, but before that, I had to inform her that Me and Rebecca were going to see The Killers live, since the ticket was my brithday present, She got super mad but could't do nothing about it.\n\nAt  this point, my relationship with Mary was fucking me up in every way  possible, but that changed on the day of the concert.\n\nMary  and I didn't speak for most of the day, so, we went to the show and had a great time, mostly because Mary and I didn't talk that much during the day.\n\nBut as we were returning home in the van we rented to take us to the concert, it happened.\n\nLSS, Rebecca and I made out.\n\nAt that point, I was already certain i didn't love Mary, not after all the shit she put me trough.\n\nWe broke up less than a month after that, she didn't knew I cheated.\n\nTLDR  (Context is recomended though) : I cheated on my abusive, long distance  gf with my best friend she hated with a burning passion.\n\nAITA  for this one? I hope y'all can help me out. Also, sorry for grammar mistakes, english ain't my first  language.",

One of his go to’s is to say “what are you doing?” in a very exaggerated manner when someone is doing a certain step in a lab. Imagine a tone similar to “wHAt aRe yOU dOiNG.” At first we all thought that it was funny, however, this had been going on for around a month an a half and it had gotten to the point where it was just getting annoying. So one day, when I was pipetting something for a lab, J decides to say “what are you doing” in the same exaggerated manner. I was not having that great of a day, so I was a little passive aggressive in my reply. I said, “If I’m doing something wrong, why don’t you try?” J then told me that I didn’t have to be so pissed and that it was just a joke. I replied saying that his statement wasn’t funny and if he could refrain from saying it in the future.

      "description": "When my boyfriend gets drunk he will try and kiss his friends and sometimes succeed. Most of his guy friends will try and back away no guys really try and kiss him back nor do they go up to him and do the same thing. I got a little upset because I don’t want him to kiss anyone no matter if it’s a guy or girl considering that would be considered cheating to me. Also it has made me question his sexuality. He said he’s comfortable with himself so he doesn’t care if he gets called gay, he thinks it’s funny and likes seeing a reaction from his friends. He is in a frat and we are 19 and 20 years old, attending the same college. AITA? ",

      "description": "It might not seem that bad but I’ve been doing it for the past two semesters and I’m at my limit. \n\nSo I’m in my junior year of college and I’m a “traditional student” (I’m 20). My classmate is a non-traditional student and she’s 40 with four children all under 12. We’re both majoring in public health. \n\nI find the material pretty easy to grasp because it’s something I genuinely love. My personal favorite class is epidemiology. However, my classmate has a harder time and is always asking me for help with upcoming exams and homework. As soon as an assignment is due, she texts me asking if she can see mine “as a reference”. I had to show her to make an excel spreadsheet and how to interpret a table and graph. \n\nThe thing is she constantly talks in class about how she worked 25 years at a prestigious hospital where she was an administrative manager. I’m fairly busy trying to balance work and school so I can’t handle it when she wants tutoring every single day for the most easiest of problems. I feel like she doesn’t even try to do them on her own because she knows I’ll be there to help.  I get that I have a much easier time in the class but that doesn’t mean I have the time or energy to explain everything all the time. \n\nShe also tries to intervene in my personal life which irritates me even more. She had a failed marriage with someone of the same background as my boyfriend and tells me not to be too serious because my boyfriend would leave me in a heartbeat. I’m just sick and tired of it but I feel like a dick because I know she’s older and I think that if it were my mom in college, I wouldn’t want her to feel bad about asking for help. ",

      "description": "I'll try and summarize the best I can.\nTo give a few starting details;\n\nI'm a 21yo male living in Canada. Been living alone since I was 16, had a rough upbringing. Military father thought it was okay to take out his anger, stress and PTSD on his son by mentally, emotionally and physically abusing him. Punching, kicking, slapping, death threats, names, the works. Was an only child until I was, about 14.\nParents figured having kids would fix their crumbling marriage, which was only getting worse, because by the time I was hitting 14 I was a foot taller than my father and a lot more muscular than him, and he turned the abuse to my mother as a result. \n\nSince 16, I've had very basic contact, mostly visiting to see my younger siblings. Reported the abuse to the cops and protective services, he was charged with assault and plead guilty. From what I remember, he got a relatively light sentence, under a year, allowed to work to support his wife and my sibs so long as he reported to prison each night and for weekends. Honestly, the details are fuzzy for me, I didn't really care to hear them. He ended up allowed afterward to still live with the mother and my sibs. \n\nI'm 21 now, and from the sparse things I've heard, things have only gotten worse. \n\nAnd I don't.. Really care anymore. My siblings are about eight and six. I love them, I really do. They didn't deserve any of this.. Mess. This bullshit. \nThe mother recently fled the house to a women's shelter with both of my siblings to file police reports and for safety, and.. Well, asked for help. \nBasically said if the kids were taken away, to volunteer to raise them. And my response was basically, a very blunt fuck, no. As much as I love them, and they deserve better.. \nI'm not willing to take on that burden. I make 30k CAD a year. I can't support two kids. It's not my job. I don't believe either of the parents are fit, but neither am I. I don't know where that leaves me. I'm not willing to get involved again, I already left that part of my life a long time ago. \n\nAm I the asshole for being tempted to just, walk away? I'm honestly asking, I'm not looking for ass pats here. If I should step up for them, by all means, feel free to tell me that I'm an asshole for being heartless. Or tell me I'm not. I'm torn on this. \nThank you for any reply. \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Last year, this woman (26 F and me (25 M) hit it off. We got each other's rather cynical sense of humor and I thought she was just raw awesome at the time. I didn't even realize I had fallen for her until the fifth time I found myself fantasizing about her. (In my defense, I was incredibly sheltered by my family who either were really extreme Catholics or used it as an excuse - I didn't even have a kiss until I was 22 and no one really bothered to explain the birds and bees to me. Had to learn everything myself.)\n\nWell, she had given up on relationships and was not looking for anything serious at the time we were hanging out.\n\nI copped on, thinking \"you can still be friends, you're an adult\" meanwhile still pining for her like an idiot and not even knowing. Kept trying to be happy with the decreasing time I spent with her as she found other people to hang out with.\n\nFinally, I ghosted her after sending a message where I admitted it to her and told I was sorry for not being able to get over it. Deleted all my social media and about three months in started dating. That is literally the only thing that has changed: I'm still at the same job, same glasses and same damn haircut.\n\nTwo weeks ago I finally got back online. She then tried to reach out to me on my new social media page and wondered where'd I had been.\n\nTold her about my life to be polite and she got weird about me mentioning the fact I had been dating in the time since we last talked.\n\nAfter a few turns of \"I never thought you'd be like that\" and her trying to steer me into flirting like when we first met and brought up when she had a crush on me, I got fed up and said:\n\n\"Why are you so concerned about my romantic life all of a sudden? I was willing to do anything for you once, and that wasn't good enough to even bother to call me. I tried to respect your beliefs even as my unconscious mind fought against me. You had a chance to be my friend, but you didn't want to be that either. If we're going to play this shit again, please just block me now.\"\n\nBlocked her, then she posts the conversation on her wall and now everyone is tearing into me for getting so hostile with her just trying to be friendly.\n\nI don't think I'm wrong but given the absolute volume of responses I got from other people, I'm not sure I'm reading the situation right.

      "description": "&lt;apols for the long one&gt;\n\nMy best friend and I hang out almost every day after work and over the weekend. Usually going to the cinema or at each other's place and we usually get dinner too. Either eating out, ordering in, or cooking for one another.\n\nWe usually take turns to pay and it switches back and forth generally regardless of the value of the previous dinner, unless she or I paid for something bigger say that included a bunch of drinks, then the other will pay twice in a row. Pretty casual agreement, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\n\nRecently she announced she wanted to start saving to buy property, and she would eat out less etc. That's fine, though I didn't really believe her, she says this often. But she has terrible impulse control when it comes to trying to save. \n\nSo to be sure I'm not hogging her money, I suggested we use an app to keep track or who buys dinner and who owes who what. (Not sure if this is relevant but I make 4 or 5 times more than her). She agreed and we kicked it off and I kept reminding her to log what she spends, but she was flippant and dismissive, saying it didn't matter, while I logged all the meals I paid for. (I mean meals, not soda or candy we might grab and share at the cinema or at home)\n\nNow that we've been at it for a while, she is in debt by about 70 quid. Because she isn't logging but also the meals I happened to buy we're more expensive.\n\nNow I feel a bit shit, coz my main intention was to be sure I didn't make her overspend, and to help her budget a little. But I also can't help but be a little miffed that I feel like I'm paying more. On the other hand I don't care, I have more disposable cash, and it could just be the luck of the draw for this period of payment.\n\nIt feels a little like Pandora's box now, and I wish I didn't start the tracking, but here we are. \n\nTldr am I the asshole for tracking spending between my and my friend? Would I be the asshole to keep doing it?",

      "description": "For reference: I am in college and working full-part time\n\nI'm asking this because my older sister actually told me I was being selfish and not thinking about how my mom would feel. Let me explain this situation.\n\nMy mom recently (sometime around January) quit her job to go and search for an RN position (she worked as a PCA II in a hospital but recently got her RN certification). Good for her, I'm insanely happy and I don't mind it. She told me and my older sister because of the lack of her income we need to start paying out own health and car insurance which I don't mind. The bad thing that happened with this shift is that before I used to be the one that always took care of the house. Ever since my dad passed away, I took care of the house. Mom worked, I came home from school, fed my little sister (who I practically helped raise), cleaned the entire house, and studied. This went on for a good while until recently.\n\nOnce she quit and I started paying for my own things, my mom has become more and more...controlling over certain situations. She berates me on how I spend and save my own money (she can see my checking account because when I opened my bank account it was under hers), how I act, how I dress, basically everything. It's escalated pretty bad to the point where anytime she begins to talk to me about anything that went wrong in the house with my little sister I automatically apologize even when it isn't my fault.\n\nI have had many breakdowns as a result to this and talked about it with my boyfriend. He suggested the idea to move out because even my little sister is starting to tell at me how my mom yells at me, telling me I'm worthless and that she doesn't understand why my boyfriend is still with me (she's 10 and has had anger issues in the past). I chalked it up to her growing up without a dad. This of course was a mistake to bring it up to my mom because she immediately started telling me she's the last living piece of my dad she has left and that she would never do anything wrong (dad is stepdad, I don't actually talk to my birth father). \n\nThis has gotten to the point where I'm terrified of even asking my mom for any kind of help or even to go out with friends because all she will reply with is 'clean the entire house first before you go' or 'you don't deserve to go out anyway' and my personal favorite 'you have no friends, who are you even gonna go with?'. I talked to my older sister about this and all she said was \"suck it up, you're being selfish and an asshole for even thinking about leaving mom. It isn't even that bad.\"\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "We used to work together with these people (3 guys). I have to admit that we became more than co-workers. We became close friends. With time, I advanced in my career while they couldn't. It's not because I was better than them. Actually I really believe one of them is better at this job than me and for the rest, we are in the same level I think. But I managed to advanced in my career because I was trustworthy, my employers knew they could count on me on any task, and I was never afraid of taking risks and responsibility. One day, they thought they are not getting paid enough at where we work and I can't say that they were wrong. But we were newbies in this job and we had to learn it properly first. 3 of them left work together. They wanted me to leave too, but I rejected this offer because I had promised to firm's founder (When he asked, of course) that he could count on me at future in-coming projects and he doesn't need to worry about their scales.\n\nAfter few years, I had some great business relationships in the entire sector, both local and international. I became the head project manager and the general quality assurance lead in the firm. I was representing my company in conferences etc. I think they had learned this.\n\nOne day, two of them visited me and said they both are looking for job, they can't find any and if I can recommend them to anyone. I said of course. Later that day I called some of my friends. Actually every single one of them told me they aren't looking for anyone. I managed to convince a company owner who offered me a job a year ago, to employ my two friends with 40% more salary than the average market.\n\nBut I quickly realized that was a really bad idea. Apparently they were always late to work. I knew what they were capable of, I knew they were good at their job, but they never showed that there. At the end, they left that firm few months later with some bogus excuse. And caused my relationship with that company owner to get bitter. I am pretty sure he won't jump on to my advices ever again.\n\nI asked them the reason and they told me that they weren't earning as much as I do. I tried to explain my friends without breaking their hearts that I am in a managerial position while they aren't. But they can quickly advance as I did in the past, and I told them I am willing to help them in this process. They said no, thanked for my help and left my office.\n\nThis was a year ago. Few days ago, three of them contacted me by saying they are looking for a job. I didn't even bother to pick up the phone. I didn't call anyone. After a day, I called them and told them no one is looking for anyone at the moment. I am 100% sure I can find them a job, but also I just don't trust their work ethics anymore. I am sure they will embarrass me.\n\nAm I The Asshole here for not helping them out... Again? I feel bad.",

My sibling chose to give up eating land aninal meat.\n\n  \n\n\nMy sibling and I are in high school, and neither of us can drive or have jobs, so we eat the same dinner, snacks etc. Since my sibling chose to give up land meat for Lent, this means that at home I will essentially have to adhere to their diet, because our mother decided to accommodate their resolution by planning out fish based meals for next week. Also, during the school week, my lunches are primarily dinner left-overs, and I don't have big breakfasts, so I'm very reliant on family dinners. I've brought it up to my family, but my mom and sibling both think I'm being sensitive, selfish and unsupporting. \n\n  \n\n\nBasically, I feel like my sibling is forcing me to follow their resolution. From a religious standpoint, it's rude to interfere with someone else's resolution, but I have my own to adhere to. Am I the asshole for wanting my sibling to pick a different Lent resolution?",

      "description": "I’m single (24F) but seeing a guy (40M) casually. He pretended to be some guy that sent a wrong text to me. Since I’m single and wanted to expand my network and also, I’m looking for a potential lifetime partner, I did respond to the guy. I had a feeling that this guy was trolling me or maybe knows my fwb or he could be this guy. \n\nWe were talking decently but we kept on going despite each other's goodnight. As soon as I sent a photo of me (not sexy, just my face) he immediately switched into a thirsty dog who wanted to have sex with me. The rest of the conversation revolved around him just wanting to fuck me. From there, I lost my interest and did not talk to him anymore. But he kept on pushing me to my limits (this went on for 3 days) - I still did not meet up with him. He also sent a photo of him (which my fwb googled, who knows lol)\n\nHe was persistent to meet me. I told him, I could meet him as long as we’re not going to have sex after or what if he’s not attracted to me. He agreed. We didn’t meet as he was late and this fwb of mine texted me that he will be within the vicinity that night. I was having a feeling that this guy is him. I played it cool. So we (fwb &amp;I) met. He kept asking why I was at the mall at that time. I was going to tell him that my date ditched me but I chose not to as I don’t want him to think of anything. But don’t get me wrong, if this guy was really existing and we had something, I would tell him, of course. I’m a free bird, after all.\n\nHe didn’t admit that it was him until last night, the guy kept on texting me. I was still cold as ice to the thirsty guy. He gave up finally. Then I tried to flirt with him (at least I tried) and told him that I’m not really feeling it. He sent me a dick pic lol. So I sent an old photo of mine (not nude) and told him I’m going to sleep. I was not really turned on, honestly. \n\nMy fwb was texting me that night, also but I noticed the delayed in his responses and that him and this guy have the same format of texting. I knew it was him.\n\nAs soon as I said goodnight to the guy, he texted me saying that I was talking to somebody and that I sent a picture of me. I didn’t admit at first, but then I asked him why he was doing it. He said what the hell was I talking about. I said just admit that it was him. He finally admitted. He said he has trust issues as his ex-wife cheated on him with his best friend.\n\nI understand why he did it but he was guilt-tripping me for sending a photo to the guy and trying to met up with him and have sex. I told him I was not going to have sex with him and that I only sent the photo just so he can shut the fuck up and let me sleep. \n\nHe doesn’t want to commit with me but keeps acting like he owns me. I like him a lot but I think what he did was too desperate. He doesn’t hold my heart so he doesn’t have the right to get mad at me for doing it. So AITA in this case or is he? \n",

      "description": "Long story but the title is pretty much the gist of it (Alt for obv reason)\n\nMy friend for whatever sudden reason was getting gradually depressed because he was single and a virgin. To help I put him on this thottie I knew. I fucked her last year and still kept the nudes. Anyway, they hit off well after awkward bumps and I finally set them up on a \"date\" at his empty house. (I paid for the food and even gave her a ride) I picked her up and she just said \"it was fun\" I didn't want to be obvious in what I was asking for so I left it at that and assumed he did it. The next day however he said he didn't want to talk about it but eventually told me after making out when she saw his dick she started LAUGHING. This story was confirmed when I eavesdropped on them at lunch a few days later and heard them talking about how small he was. To retalliate I posted her nudes w her face clear as day (Both pics exposed everything, tits and vag) and said \"This thot made fun of my homies dick so we boutta make fun of her tits crying emoji\" she and her buddies started dming me some Bs but I blocked all of them cuz I didn't wanna hear it. This was on friday so after the weekend when we came back I didnt see her in school. Apparently she attempted suicide and is now taking counseling I think. She also exposed a couple of guys who she got dick pics from yet ig to get back at them over the weekend causing THEM to get mad at ME. I then found out one of the said boys exposed her friend (we dated but that was in middle school so it doesn't really count). We didnt see her in school but she posted how \"depressed\" she was and deleted her instagram. Anyway the thot came back yesterday and it was really awkward. She got the typical \"cold shoulder\" \"lauging behind back\" reaction but that's just high school. Later her friends got mad at ME for not apologizing. Later that day I heard she fought someone talking about her nudes now her along with a couple of the aforementioned exposed students and the girl she fought are suspended for 3 days. This morning her white knight beta ass fanboy club started threatening me telling me they're gonna jump me after school. I told them and her friends I'll apologize when she apologizes to my bro and give him some pussy he deserves. I also found out today a couple more people got exposed by the already exposed people mentioned above.",

      "description": "So I’m in an organization with tons of people. We have bigs and littles it’s co Ed. Anyways, my roommates and I have the biggest house because it’s off campus so we usually have parties and kick backs here. Anyways, I posted here awhile ago about this same girl. Story is she cheats on her boyfriend, she cheated emotionally and physically on her boyfriend with ME. She then got too fucked up one night with her best friend and they crashed in my bed and because I was in the same room as them she falsely implied I sexually assaulted her friend(there were witnesses who have my back and know I didn’t). \n\nFast forward to today one of my roommates has a bday and she’s coming because she’s part of the “family” he’s in since we have four separate families within the .org. I’m totally fine with her coming today even though her boyfriend came to town. However, I kinda want to ask my roommates if next time she’s not allowed in my house especially with her boyfriend. The reasoning I have is because I met him before he was cool, she told me she liked me more than a friend and hinted their relationship was bad then she said she loves her bf and now she’s posting on Instagram, she also accused me of sexual assault yet still asks me to buy her alcohol? \n\nI don’t want her in my house because of what she did to me, I especially don’t want her boyfriend here because I feel bad for him. I’m not the first guy she’s cheated on him with and in my head why would you bring your boyfriend to the house of the guy you were fucking and also accused of “possibly” assaulting her best friend.\n\nI know she’s a part of my organization and I hate to exclude someone(not really) I don’t want to be a dick tho. Knowing her she would act like I’m excluding her for some other reason. But it’s just I KNOW it will be awkward when I see the boyfriend because I DONT want to act like nothing happened. I somewhat want to be distance from him so he knows something is off. She’s never going to tell him and even tho I’m an asshole for sleeping with her boyfriend I do feel bad because no guy deserves it. I think she’s also dangerous to be around if she’s so scared of being found out she’s cheating she’s willing to potentially ruin someone’s life. \n\nI’m wondering maybe I can just let her come over sometimes if there’s an event but restrict her form alcohol yet I still would not want her boyfriend over ever again. I just can’t stand them acting lovey dovey knowing that she’s a huge cheater.\n\nAm I an asshole if I make a rule like this? I know at least one of my roommates and his girlfriend would agree with me but my other roommate who has a girlfriend who is friends with her may not. ",

      "description": "So I’ve been talking to this girl for a few weeks, I’ve known/known of her for a few years since she’s related to my cousin’s SO and worked at a store right by where I used to live. So I’d see her every now and then and say hi, you could say she and I had an acquaintance-ship with each other. \n\nWe both recently (within the last year) have gotten out of long term relationships, so we started texting earlier this month, but we were just hanging out as friends/maybe more than friends sometimes. This was only for 2 weeks, I only hung out with her maybe 4 times until the issue. \n\n5th time, I get there and she’s clearly high. She has bloodshot eyes, half closed eyelids, walks like a zombie, and tries to tell a story that should’ve taken 2 minutes yet took 15 because she kept going off on tangents or losing her train of thought. \n\nI honestly don’t care, do what you want, the being high thing wasn’t my issue. My problem was she started getting really upset about random things and wouldn’t listen to me trying to reason with her or even just talk her down. Like how dare I help her with the dishes because I got some water on my shirt and that was apparently the worst thing ever for her. She wouldn’t let it go and yelled at me for offering to help, despite her originally accepting it gratefully (3 minutes prior) and kept bringing it up over the next hour and a half.\n\nWe were only at her place plus her friend for about 20 minutes bc we had a specific time to go pickup our food. All I really did in that time was ask where the bathroom was three times because she’d forget to tell me halfway through her sentence. \n\nLots more went on, mostly her wigging out on me for nonsensical things while I was just trying to eat and leave ASAP. \n\nI texted her the next day and asked if she wants to talk about what went on and work things/whatever went on out. She doubled down and accused me of all sorts of things that did not happen: me yelling at her, me being so obviously rude that her friend picked up on it and said I was awful (her friend was there for about 10 min picking something up, she and I talked about her kids and we got along fine), me demanding she do things, ordering her around, etc.\n\nThe only time I did anything close to pushing her buttons was saying that I knew she was high, and I’d rather talk about it tomorrow when we’re sober. She then claims weed doesn’t affect her like most people, and that she functions better when high vs sober because she “doesn’t get high anymore”. \n\nI just said okay, I understand, but I was very uncomfortable with how you treated me while you were “high” and I’d just prefer if we parted ways. She’s been losing her shit at me for the past few hours through various phone numbers/texts/facebooks. \n\nAITA for not responding anymore? I’m going through a bunch of really shit life events that are stressing me out, and all I’ve seen from her is drama and indications of more to come.  ",

      "description": "Hey, everyone. I’m just gonna get to the point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 16 year old (closeted) transwoman in my junior year. I've been using things like Kik, Skype, Discord, all that to communicate with my friends and find communities for certain topics. I've always been smart about this, and the furthest I've gone in telling people my personal information was my time zone. I'm not an idiot when it comes to personal security, and I don't leak any of my information.\n\nHowever, ever since I got a phone when I was 14, my entire family (mostly my mom) have been checking it. I get why, even if it's a bit awkward at times. They'll go through all my apps, and even though it always makes me uncomfortable and go all \"what do you have to hide?\" on me when I ask them not to.\n\nRecently, I started to use Skype for talking to my friends about personal stuff. Things like insecurities, my work, my home life, all that, and I came out to them too about my identity. I have asked my family (especially my mom) to please stay off my phone in the past, and clarified it wasn't that I was hiding something bad or illegal, it's just that I want some privacy in my life. Naturally, they ignored it. So it's not that they *didn't know* I was against it. But either way, I was using my phone at school once, which isn't often since I like to believe I'm a good student. I got caught, family took it away. \n\nBut at school, I was told my account was online. It freaked me out, since it wasn't just my personal stuff that they would see, such as me mentioning I  have a lot of issues with my family, and that I'm trans and have into dudes, but all of my FRIENDS secrets as well. All of that stuff, violated. \n\nAs a result, my parents forcibly outed me. They believed I was being preyed on by weirdos over the internet (the people I talked to who I didn't know in person). Regarding talking to my friends about my life, they said that wasn't necessary because I could do that with *them*, or my therapist. And don't get me wrong, I talk to my therapist about everything (but that's once a month) and my mom about stuff like school, but  I'm not going to talk to my mother about mental health when I regularly get shut down.\n\nAfter several months, I finally got back on Discord. I said I would only use it for gaming with my real life friends, and they can check it all they want. But what they don't know is that I've been using an alternate account to chat with my friends about serious real life issues.\n\nIt should be noted that I'm fully aware that yes, family doing stuff like stalking your social media and checking your phone every night with no semblance of privacy is \"abuse\". They've read my journals and letters I've gotten too, but even then, I honestly don't see it. \n\nI'm also aware that I'm lying to my parents, and that's not good. But I just need to talk, and they're not making it easy, especially when they reject every attempt for me to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. AITA?",

      "description": "While I was a student i had a part time job at this charity as a carer for kids with disabilities. We had a new project that was being developed and I was very excited to get the role of project coordinator. The project was set up to last a year, but about half way through I finished uni and qualified as a nurse. I had planned to continue my part time job while working full time just to see the project to completion, but unfortunately this would beach the terms of my new nursing contact (couldn't work for any other care company). I handed in my resignation but stayed on as a volunteer to see the project to completion,  help them bid for another years funding and train my successor. At first I was still coming in every week (we were only open one day a week any way) but as I got busier and busier in my new role I started coming less and less. The project finished in December (though it was successfully renewed for another year) and I haven't been in since then. I said I would still pop by and help out every now and then but I've been very busy with work and somehow it's now march and I still haven't been in. \n\nLate December I found out they nominated me for a young leaders award for my continued support as a volunteer. Today I got a message saying that tickets for the award ceremony had arrived, and would I come and collect them or did they need to post them. I'm not actually working the day they want me to collect them, but... It's my only day off, if I pop in I'll feel obliged to stay and help out, and I feel like an aashole for not collecting them. Especially because the award was for my continued voluntary service, which has now basically stopped since I got the award. I didn't plan it that way, and honestly I think I'd feel less guilty if they haven't given me an award at all. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I let them post the tickets, collect my award then essentially wish them well but cut ties (and no longer continue to visit to help out). It's too late to nominate someone else for the award. Out should I suck it up and continue to occasionally help out and visit for a few more months so it doesn't look like my leaving is coinciding with collecting my award?",

      "description": "Long time lurker first time poster, obligatory comment about mobile formatting. \n\nTo give some background, she’s a year older than me and came into my life when I was around 13(now 20). She was a pretty bad influence on me through my teen years but also helped me out a lot through this time as well. \n\nShe moved to a different state after graduating high school and always pestered me to come visit her which was difficult as I was recently graduated as well and living paycheck to paycheck, not a lot of excess income to pay for plane ticket. I ended up making it down there once and during this time she would always suggest that we go out to eat and then pressure me into paying, which I also couldn’t really afford,  on top of the fact that I’m allergic to cats and she had several at the time. Naturally, I wasn’t that excited to make a return trip and was just never in a place with work that I could go visit for a justifiable amount of time. \n\nLast summer she had planned on returning to our home state to purchase a car and I was going to drive back down with her and then fly back ~2 weeks later. In the days leading up to the trip she was distant and hard to get ahold of, the night before she calls and says she’s not coming as she’s getting evicted from her apartment. She calls about a week later and offers to help me pay for a ticket transfer, and I told her I couldn’t as I had already told my work that the trip was cancelled, and I was planning on taking the trip before the start date of this new job. Didn’t really hear much from her about it after, so now I’m out the cost of a plane ticket at a time when I still didn’t have much money. \n\nPresent day, she’s back in our home state and travels between two homes between 1-2 hours away from where I live. She would show up to my house uninvited, make ridiculous messes that she left for me to clean up, and eat my food without asking and justified it by saying that she let me stay with her when I came to visit. She also has asked me to lie to my mom multiple times to cover for her general antics. At this point I’m fed up and have completely cut off contact with her without really giving her an explanation. I feel like talking to her about it would just lead to an argument and I don’t have the patience for it. \n\nTL;DR: step sister says I owe her for things she’s done for me, I got sick of her childish behavior and ghosted her AITA?\n",

      "description": "To start things off, I'm a 19 year old male who recently had to move back in with my parents after a pretty nasty breakup. My brother is 24 and so is his friend.\n\nMy brother had been renting a room from his friend (also my friend, I'm not just randomly moving in with him) but he never actually used the room because of a long story about his own personal stuff. \n\nMy parents' home isn't exactly what I would call luxurious, it's actually really dirty because nobody here cleans or anything, and it's too big a house for just me to be able to clean by myself. We've been riddled with financial problems, and as a result of that we don't have heat and our power got shut off for a few days. I don't believe I can stay living in a place like this.\n\nI had talked to my brother's friend about the possibility of me moving in with him because the rent would be easy for me to afford and I know he has more than enough space for me, and he was more than willing to let me.\n\nAround this same time, my brother stopped paying his friend for the room he was renting, and told his friend he could no longer pay for it since he doesn't think he'll ever actually move in. \n\nI told my parents and my brother that I was moving out of their house in a couple weeks and that I would be going over to this guy's house, and I knew my parents would be slightly upset because I know they like having me around, but everyone is absolutely furious with me instead of just being upset. The reasoning? I'm \"betraying my brother\". My mother yelled at me for at least 3 hours, and even today she's still making time to scold me for this regularly. My dad has relatively calmed down about it because he understands, but the first thing my brother did was storm out of the house and call his friend telling him to not let me move in. When he was told that it's already decided that I'm moving in no matter what, he begged his friend to let him have the room back and not give it to me (there's multiple empty rooms so even if he got his room back, I'd still be moving in). \n\nSo now I've got 3 days before I start moving, and my own brother and mother will no longer speak to me. AITA reddit?\n\nTLDR; Moved back in with parents, decided I want to move in with my brother's friend instead of staying here, and now everyone thinks I'm betraying my brother and nobody will talk to me",

      "description": "Me (f) and my current boyfriend have been in a relationship for 4 months now and he is expressing concerns about me being friendly with my ex. \n\nMe and my ex were together for 3 years. He helped me through some tough family issues and we moved country together. The relationship started to fall apart when it became apparent that we had different life styles and aspirations for the future. This was a long process and both my ex and I lived in denial for a long time before dealing with the inevitable break up. In other words, this was a peaceful end to our relationship with no hard feelings. \n\nThe lengthy break up gave me a lot of time to think things through (Do I still have feelings for him? Would I regret leaving him? Is breaking up the right thing to do?) and I felt certain that ending the relationship was a good thing when the decision was made. I have no romantic feelings towards him anymore but I do still care about him, like you would care about a family member. \nTherefore, I am still in contact with my ex. \n\nMy ex and I live in the same town and go to the same university, so I'm happy that we don't have that \"typical\" awkwardness between us like most people do towards their ex. I would however like to add that I don't think we have an unhealthy relationship either. We don't text regularly or hang out. I don't ask my friends to gossip about him and I try to stay out of his way as much as possible (societies, cafés I know he likes, pubs I know he frequents). Despite this, there is the occasional text (usually practical things like \"Do you know where this thing is?\" etc) and we do sometimes run into each other on the street/at the uni. I also used to play dnd with my ex and his old friends regularly, but decided to quit that as my current boyfriend found it uncomfortable.\n\nMy current boyfriend is however still finding it difficult to digest that I don't hate my ex.\nWhat sparked this discussion recently was that my ex contacted me and said that he had bought me a Christmas gift. I was surprised that he had gotten me anything at all since we're not that close anymore but also appreciated the gesture. I didn't get anything for him in return, but agreed to meet up for a coffee so we could chat and I could pick up the gift. Haven't spoken to him since. \n\nI understand my boyfriend's concerns as we haven't been together for that long and as a result have not been able to build the proper trust. Furthermore, we are currently in a long-distance relationship which puts even more pressure on trusting each other. \n\nI don't want to ruin what we have together, but I also don't want to be a bitch towards my ex as he has done nothing wrong. \n\nSo, I want to ask you guys. AITA here? ",

      "description": "Okay so let me start with me being sick. Because that's important. So I suffer from a pretty sever chronic illness called gastroparesis. As well as a whole other host of stomach issues caused by it. Bassicly I have really really delayed stomach emptying. My stomach only works at a 25% rate. This causes a LOT of nausea, vomiting, and pain. I go in &amp; out of flares. But when I'm in a flare? It feels like having the constant stomach flu. I feel 10/10 absolutely sick to my stomach from the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to sleep. \n\nSo my mom has become really good friends work a lady from work. And she kept trying to introduce me to her son. Because he got into a really bad car accident, and suffered some brain trauma. And because of that, hes disabled. He can walk and talk and everything for the most part. But he has definitely lost some of his motor skills, and some memory issues. But ours moms collectively thought we may get along, both struggling from being young &amp; having some form of disability. So we started talking on Facebook. And hes a really nice guy. He also grows weed. (I live in northern California). I talked to him about how weed is one of the only things that makes me feel better, and he told me he has a bunch of extra laying around his house. And he dosent smoke, so I can have it. I expect it to just be like a little bit, but he brought me quite a bit. At least 4 or 5 ounces. As well as some shatter. A few weeks later, he came over to hang out, and brought me like another 4 ounces. I didnt even know he was bringing any the second time. I am VERYYYYY thankful for this. It has helped me SO much. And I've definitely let him know this. I have tried to pay him, and he wont accept it. And I never once asked for any of it.\n\n So he grew quite a bit this year. And sense the prices are so bad, he couldnt really afford to hire trimmers. And it's just him. He asked me if I would come trim, and I told him I would be totally down to help him out. So I went and trimmed for him for a few days. He tried to pay me, and I refused it. \n\nEver sense Christmas, I've been in a REALLY bad flare. I've lost 20 lbs sense then, just from not being able to eat/keep down anything. He asked me if I could come trim for him yesterday. He said he needed to have a certain amount ready by Monday, and there is no way he can do it on his own. If I was able to? Hell yea I'd go help him! And i told him that. But I'm just not physically able to do anything at all right now. I can barely get out of bed.. Plus his house is a hour and a half drive away, on a windy ass road. I get SO carsick. So that, on top of already being absolutely sick to my stomach? Would be MISERABLE. I would 10000% puke the whole way. I really thought he would understand. As he knows what it's like to have a dissability that stops you from doing things. But his demeanor changed right away. He usually is very talkative with me. But started giving me like a one sentence, a couple word, answers. I asked him if he was upset with me, and he went on this huge rant about how he Is done helping other people. Because when it comes time for him to need help, nobody ever returns the favor. And how hes givin me hundreds of dollars worth of bud, and the least thing I could do is to help him trim some more. I never once lost my temper with him. I just calmly tried to explain to him, that I'm sorry, I really am, but I'm way to sick right now. I can barley get out of bed. I cant keep down any solid food. I'm dropping more and more weight each week. I barley have enough energy to function as a human, let alone go sit up and trim for 2 days straight. And he just wouldn't listen to me. \n\nIdk if he thinks I'm lying to him or what.. I mean hear friends with me on Facebook. So he could easily see all my recent status updates for the last few weeks talking about how sick I am. I just dont know. And i honestly do feel so bad about it. I really truly do. I know he really needs help.. And he really has helped me soooo much. But I never asked him to help me. I never asked him for any of that weed. But because of the type of person I am, I can't help to feel like i am being an asshole.. ",

All the jobs posted by our college are also posted at another university that offers degrees for computer science. So what ends up happening is that most business' choose the degree students first. It is almost the end of our academic semester and only one of has a job all the way out in Alberta. Since the start of my semester, I have been conducting my own personal job search for an internship, and have applied nearly everywhere. A couple days ago my parents said they know a person who works for a company that is only a ten minute drive from my house. I e-mail the employee and he tells me about the job, saying that they often skip the diploma students, and that the work environment at the company is pretty hostile. I told my parents this and they said that I should still take the job regardless of everything that the employee said. So what I am asking here is: AITA for turning down a job offer?",

      "description": "So, I have a really good friends group—we are six people (me included) and get along extremely well. We are like siblings and do lots of things together. Basically, they are my best friends, so we hang out a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, my friend D. from our bff group became friends with someone at work and this someone (we'll call them R.) had just moved to our city at the time, so they were pretty much friendless. D. became her first friend and soon began wanting to introduce R. to the group. We were all enthusiastic about it because we love meeting new people! So R. met us at the restaurant and it went well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, R. started become really possessive of D. I'm really close with D., she is the sister I never had and we always have each other's back. R. is bipolar and a big extrovert while I have Asperger's and am an introvert. While they is really nice, it's... exhausting to be around them a lot to be honest because they talk a lot and is really loud; also, they bring everything back to themselves on a regular basis. They really are looking for validation in everything (on instagram especially) and I'm absolutely not blaming them for it!! I totally get that. But it's becoming really obsessive and crushing. They make you feel like they know everything about the world (they are gifted—aka very high IQ) and it is really annoying (I also am gifted and have a very high IQ but I don't like showing off? Idk, anyway).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, a little before Christmas, we went to the restaurant just the six of us (so, the bff group) aka a normal evening of hanging out as we always do. And R. saw that I. from our bff group posted stuff on insta in their story about us hanging out and R. lost it, sent us a very aggressive message the next morning telling us they cried all night and felt rejected by us because they thought they were part of the bff gang. We felt very bad about it because we didn't mean it at all—we were just hanging out together as usual? And we saw R. a total number of maybe four times, so they didn't exactly felt part of the bff group. Also, R. has BPD (borderline personality disorder) and I feel like it doesn't help their feeling of rejection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since this happened, D., who was their first friend, has been really distant with R., and R. keeps asking me about D., if she's ok, if she said stuff about them, etc. And I feel very uncomfortable and awkward because R. really sounds jealous and I don't like it one bit. They keep making things revolve around themselves and it's starting to get on my nerves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: am I the asshole for being fed up with this situation and with R.? ",

A couple years ago I moved away from our hometown to a different state well across the country. Being in a long distance friendship where we went months without seeing each other, she would often snapchat me pictures of her cats as a conversation opener and a way to keep in touch, and I would reciprocate as well. This past summer, she ended up moving about an hour away from me for work and (unrelated) personal reasons. We now get to see each other (and each other's cats) a few times a month depending on our schedules. It's been awesome having her and her furry companions close at hand... however, the snaps of her cats have only increased in frequency to the point where I get anywhere from five to fifteen a day, every day. Often they are not really \"unique\" pictures (her cat laying on the bed or sitting on the couch in the same pose, day after day) and usually don't have any captions. (Or if they do, the captions are merely commenting on the cuteness of her cats.) I understand her sentiments, Reddit! I love cats passionately and she has objectively adorable cats. But it's annoying to get flooded with so many snaps... especially when I've stopped responding to them in any capacity but they haven't slowed down. I've gotten to the point where I'm sick of seeing them period. WIBTA if I asked her to stop sending the snaps altogether?",

      "description": "So I was in a hurry cycling in a no car area/zone. There were a bunch of people around and I was cycling a little to fast to be honest. There was this kid on a step/scooter (not sure what you call the thing). He was heading in the same direction as me and I was looking at him to make sure I wouldn't hit him. He looked back at me, so I thought; \"great he knows I'm here, that means I can safely pass him.\" Just before I pass him he makes a hard turn to the left -he's still looking at me- and I hit him so he hits the ground. Even if I'd have started braking when he started that turn, I still would've hit him.  \n\n\nHis mom wasn't mad at me actually, although she did seem a little bit scared of me (I'm a big guy). But many bystanders were very angry at me. I stayed with the mother and the kid and apologized to her (and to the crying kid). But because of the other bystanders berating me, and the mother saying it was alright, I kinda fled the scene and hurried onward.   \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for cycling too fast? Was this just a kid being a kid? Should I have apologized more or offered to help?     \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I am a professional reddit lurker, I like to read posts, see what other people say, take the advice and move on. I now need advice and I’m not sure where I can get it so be gentle reddit. It’s long and I’m on mobile so I apologize if the formatting sucks. \n\nBackground: My step-daughter (SD)is in middle school. I’ve been step-mom since she was in preschool so our relationship isn’t newly forged. Lately, she’s been the classic moody pre-teen and has been considerably hateful to her father and I when we implement consequences for her attitude (e.g. taking her phone/computer time away, trying to implement logical consequences for her actions when we can). The big rift is that at our house, there are consequences, but at her moms house, there aren’t and her mom does everything for her - whereas at our home, she is expected to do 2 chores a day except for Saturday’s (we have her 50% of the time).  This isn’t judgement, both SD and mom have confirmed this (we have a pretty good relationship at face value with mom, but she does a considerable amount of shit talking to SD about her father and I - which of course gets back to us when she thinks we are being unfair.).  So everything comes down to the fact that Dad and I are mean because we don’t tolerate disrespectful behavior. \n\nOn to the story - SD has a project for school due tomorrow. She told me about it today. It was assigned last Monday.  After her hour of computer time (which she was not happy that her hour was up and let that be known), she told me she can’t do it because she needs the iPad the school provides and she left that along with her binder (with all the work in it) at school. She asks for her phone - which has been a sensitive issue because she has been unable to use her phone due to her attitude (it’s a privilege not a right). I let her know that no, she can’t have her phone and asked her if she can do her project on her dads computer (which is fancy). She responded with “no I can’t it’s an app genius” \n(I’m sure you can hear the snotty teenage attitude with that. \nSo I’m done. That statement along with her attitude about getting off her computer has me at my wits end. I said fine, I’m not going to try to help you if that’s how you’re going to speak to me. \nShe goes on a tirade of how it will be my fault if she fails this class. I explained to her that I didn’t leave her stuff at school.  She continued on with her rant and said some pretty hateful personal stuff about me and her dad. After her rant, I simply asked her, if you can tell me why I should help you after you’ve been incredibly hateful, I would love to hear your position and perhaps change my mind about using my iPad to do your project. For an hour she blamed everyone else for her problems and took zero responsibility for her words, for leaving her supplies at school, and for waiting to the last minute to do her project. \n\nSo - am I the asshole for not letting her use my iPad to complete her school project?

      "description": "Buckle up buckaroos... you’re in for a ride. \n\n**TLDR** at bottom\n\nI(31F) met ex(26F) AJ on a dating app (tinder)... after meeting I realized pretty quickly I wasn’t in any position for a relationship and tried to maintain a friendship. She developed feelings that only blossomed and grew from that point on. \n\nWhile admittedly I did too while we were friends I knew that her addiction and my addiction past / future potential for alcoholism would have been a terrible combination. \n\n(I started a relationship with a woman I never thought I had a chance with while we remained friends... the woman and I didn’t have similar life goals... so that didn’t last.) \n\nFast forward 8 months - AJ is sober. And I want her. She seems positive, engaged, driven, passionate... basically all positive attractive attributes that I love! On top of that she is superbly intelligent and we could talk about so many different things. \n\nWe get together. And BOOM - dysfunction. She remained jobless because she just graduated and was working towards “studying for her boards for her career.” ... but she didn’t. She sat at home and smoked weed and didn’t do anything productive. Then she dabbled lightly in the alcohol at first... then naturally the alcoholic in her completely lost control. I know she was depressed. In therapy working through years of abuse I wanted to be supportive. I was the only person she vented to about her abusive parents. \n\nI drank an insane amount during the time we dated so I was horrible. I was inattentive, I was resentful, I was unhappy, I couldn’t understand how someone could be my best friend and seem like a perfect partner and then to have it fall apart so easily. I understand depression but I wanted her to snap out of it and just be the woman I knew she could be. I felt like due to her depression she was not able to be a productive person. I don’t fault her for that. So to help all of that I drank... and so did she. \n\nWhich obviously was completely toxic and terrible. We only dated 6 months which ended in an explosive break up she moves back near her abusive parents. \n\nFast forward a year... she find me on PlayStation while I am gaming. Initially I panic and sign off. I usually don’t keep exes in my life because it’s painful to try to have a friendship especially if things ended badly which they usually have for me. \n\nAgainst my better judgment I started talking to her again via PlayStation. Now she is constantly putting me down and emotionally manipulating me trying to rehash things from the past. I absolutely do not want to do that. I would have been fine if it came up after months of playing in an adult way such as “I feel like you mistreated me and didn’t respect me... here’s why. I just want you to know.” Her approach is accusatory and lacks space for actual dialogue. It’s the blame game and I sign right up to play every time. She knows where my buttons are and pushes them all the time. \n\nPlaying video games is fine with me but every boundary I put up she pushes right through and then is shocked when I call her out. I hate this situation. I put too much emotional energy into it already, I’ve tried to be friends but it will not work. Am I the asshole because my mode of operation is to ghost people and cut them out of my life ? \n\n**TLDR** - Ex found me on PlayStation and wants to rehash the past. Am I the asshole because I just wanted to play GTAV and not fight about who did what wrong in the past? ",

      "description": "Quick background.  My husband has two children (stepdaughter 15 and stepson 13) with his ex-wife and she has two children from a relationship before she met him.  My stepson lives with me and my husband and my stepdaughter lives with her mother.  We get stepdaughter every other weekend. \n\nEx-wife’s oldest son (OS) got his license about six months ago and ever since, he and stepdaughter have taken to driving around and stopping by our house randomly.  They also are doing all the pick-up and drop offs for ex-wife when it’s her weekend to have stepson.  The problem is that OS and stepdaughter never knock when they stop by.  They just walk into the house.  They have almost walked in on my husband naked (stepson was at a friend’s), did walk on me wrapping stepdaughters Christmas gifts and have scared the crap out of me several times because I walk into people just standing in my living room when I thought no one else was home.\n\nI want to ask my husband to have his daughter at least knock to let us know someone is there before she walks in.  I’m nervous about it because in the past he has accused me of not understanding what it’s like to have divorced parents (true).  We got into a huge argument when he went behind my back and gave stepdaughter a key to our house several years ago.  My thought process was that she had no need for a key because there has never been a time that she was at our house with no one home (husband always picks her up for his weekend visits).  Also, ex-wife goes through a lot men and they always wind up living with her for a while.  Before OS got his license, these random men would be the ones picking up and dropping off stepson to our home.  I didn’t feel comfortable with a key to our house being accessible to these people we didn’t know.   Husband said it wasn’t fair that stepson had a key (he lived with us and needed one) and stepdaughter didn’t.  It was her house too.   I still don’t think “fair” is a good enough reason but whatever.\n\nNow, I just want to know if I would be as asshole if I asked my husband to talk to stepdaughter about knocking first.  I don’t mean that she has to wait for us to answer the door, but just as a warning that someone is coming into the house.  My husband is very sensitive about anything to do with his kids.  If the consensus is that I’m an asshole, I just won’t bring it up at all and avoid the conflict.\n\nBeing a stepparent isn’t always easy, I don’t want to be the “evil” stepmom but I also think that it should be ok to have boundaries.\n",

      "description": "A bit of background: I've had a bit of an odd social life - in high school, I had my group of friends, but we weren't very popular (or at least I wasn't). I recently started university, and I started to open up, and this brought a bunch of new opportunities, including my first case of friends with benefits. We started hanging out right when second semester started in January, and we've been seeing each other like twice a week since then. We'll call her Sarah from now on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth Sarah and I don't want a relationship, but recently she's been asking me more about how I'd feel if she slept with other people. At first, I was accepting of it, but over time, I've realized I can't really deal with it, and I expressed my concerns and asked why we couldn't keep it exclusive for the time being. This was met with a somewhat angry reaction from her, and thus leading to us having a small falling out. I'm mostly worried about both my safety and hers, as if she has multiple partners, that would put me at the same risk as her for contracting an STD. Also, I feel like if she sees other people, I will be seen as unnecessary, thus making me lose a friend as well. She doesn't seem to understand this, and thinks I'm being selfish about it. She thinks that I'm being a restraint for her sexual ventures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite this, I still want to be her friend, but the idea of her sleeping with other people stings right now and I don't know how I should handle it. Reddit, AITA for not feeling comfortable with this?",

      "description": "Not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?",

I acknowledge I’m a Hapa but I identify very much with my heritage. \n\nI work at a large staffing agency and we have to share cubicles with one other person. I despise my cube mate. We don’t get along and I think he looks down on me because I’m a woman and I get sick of the way he talks to me. I also think he’s a closet racist because I see him watching clips on his phone from shows known to be racist. \n\nWe’ve had a major problem over the last two weeks because he started dating this girl who’s real name is Sandy. Whenever he calls her or she stops by he calls her “San-San.” In my grandmothers part of the Philppines that is a deeply, deeply racist term used against the people who didn’t accept Spanish and American imperialism. It essentially is like calling someone dumb,  backwards and provincial. \n\nI told him right away that the term bothered me. He said it’s his girlfriend’s nickname and he was only referring to her. I told him it’s still unacceptable to use that term around me or ever really. He told me he’d try to check himself. Well not only did he not, he actually got worse and started saying it multiple times a day. I told him on Friday I was going to HR if he did it again. Well this morning he did so I went strait to HR. Good chance he may be fired (he’s had other issues too).\n\nMy floor is pretty much split on whether or not I did the right thing or if I was just being an over sensitive asshole. What is your judgment? Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "So I've (15M) been going out with a girl (15F) for about 6 months with a separation of about 3 weeks in the middle of it. I know it's getting near Valentine's day and I don't exactly want to break it to her during or after the holiday so I decide to do it about 3 hours ago.\n\nAt first it seemed like a normal conversation but after about 4-5 messages I laid it out there with the much expected, \"I'm sorry.\" This hurt her feelings quite a bit so me being me I try to cheer her up and she gives a tone of, \"I love you but you don't love me!\" I continued to try and help and tell her it'd be fine and she'd find someone.\n\nI also told her not to ruin my reputation because my best friend is her cousin and he gets very mad very easily. Another friend of mine is going out with her best friend and he has almost cooked me to death because I jokingly said, \"Don't leave me alone he'll kill me!\" She said she wouldn't because no-one would ask.\n\nWhen I told her I had lost interest in her she continued to say things like, \"You've treated me like a game this whole time?\" And, \"I'm sorry I couldn't keep you interested.\" I continued to tell her it wasn't her fault and that she would find someone else because she deserved better than me (I barely talk to her when we see each other at school, definitely an asshole for that, but this post is about the breakup). We finally ended the conversation with me saying that I still loved her just not intimately, and that I hoped we could still be friends. She had the tone of, \"Yeah, yeah. Keep on lying,\" even though it was the honest to God truth.\n\nPlease tell me. AITA?",

      "description": "So, I’ll start with my father. He left me with my mom when I was 3 months old, and left my mother struggling financially. Since then, I’ve seen him a total of maybe 10 times. Mainly around holidays, because I always wanted to see him when I was younger. As I’ve grown and changed, I realized that if he wanted to see me, he would make the plans. So I’ve pretty much cut him from my life. Only time I see him is when I do stuff with my half sister, because she sees me as a role model and wishes I could see her more often (she’s somewhere around the age of 9). My mother disagrees, and says I should try to see him more often, and my stepdad is on my side. He’s been more of a father in the 6-7  years than my biological father has ever been. \n\nSecond part, is my mother’s side of the family. Particularly, her mother. She’s a completely awful human being. Her youngest son (20) completely ignored everything she said to him while he was growing up and managed to do fine. The other, (23) is a mess. Doesn’t have a license since she told him that there’s no use since he’d end up dead or killing someone else, took awfully long to graduate high school because she always puts him down, telling him he won’t amount to anything. She also had convinced them that her daughter is adopted because when she had to give birth, she told the family she had appendicitis. I absolutely refuse to see her, but my mother is begging me to see her. Last time I was with her, she told me to never come back because I gave her attitude, and has told my mom that when she visits, not to bring me. \n\nSorry about the massive amount of text, but I had to get this off my chest and figure out if I’m doing the right or wrong thing.

So they did the best they could to help some kids but I was called over under special request by one of the 9th graders. She was having trouble and class was almost over so I had no time to help her. \nI asked her if she wanted to meet after school for some help. She replied yes. Can we meet every day. Keep in mind she was not one of my mentees. I said yes. Later that day I got called to my counselors office to talk about some stuff. It was Friday and also a short day so lunch was at the end of the day. After 6th period I was called to my counselors office. I was in there for a while and by the time it was lunch was also over and I decided to just go home. Something about the way she said she wanted to meet after school every day for help was weird from the look i got from her she wasn't the prettiest. She was clearly into me and I wasn't sharing the same feelings. So I decided to not see her after school at all. She was also a 9th grader and I'm a 10th grader not much of a difference but still.

He says:\n\n\"I would like to buy the dresses on one condition: I would like to take you to a dinner at a high end restaurant all expenses payed by me\"\n\nI say :\n\n\"I'm not an escort do you want the dresses or not. I'm assuming not\"\n\nHe goes on some tangent about how he only has good intentions and just wanted to do this because he's at an elevated income level. Whatever, man.\n\nJust before I block him he replies that he still wants the dresses because they're for a charity auction. I don't believe this but whatever, I don't give a fuck. So we arrange a time and place. I say to meet at a subway station near my boyfriend's apartment, he says cool the station is near his work. He gives me the address of said work and his phone number and says \"call me when you're near I will buy the dresses and can give you a tour of the office\". No thanks buddy lmao. So in the days leading up to this and the morning of I confirm 3 SEPARATE TIMES. I lug this heavy ass bag with over 10 dresses to the station, boyfriend in tow because I'm not an idiot and I'm not gonna meet this guy who expressed sexual interest in me alone.\n\nI get to the station and call him and it goes straight to voicemail. I-messages send as texts, he leaves the messenger conversation and either blocks me or deletes his facebook. \n\nIDK if he ever even intended to buy the clothes, but to be honest the whole \"give you a tour of the office\" thing in combo with the dinner request creeped me out and the backing out (probably) because he saw my boyfriend thing makes me think he had nefarious intentions.\n\nNow comes the decision to be made - I found his Linkedin where he posted what company he works for - address matches to the one he gave me. Would I be an asshole if I sent an email to the HR of his company letting them know he is using facebook marketplace clothing ads to scope out young women and offering to buy their clothes in exchange for dinners and offering to give them office tours to try to make himself seem more safe?\n\nHalf of me is doing this because I'm petty and mad that I had to carry around this fucking bag all day but the other half is genuinely concerned that he is a predator trying to take advantage of women and using his company to lull them into a false sense of security.\n\nlemme know pls :)\n\nPS I've pre-emptively blocked him on Linkedin so he can't retaliate but I get that I'm not bulletproof here",

      "description": "I work in a big centre full of restaurants, all of which share the same same set of bathrooms, like you would find in a shopping centre or mall.  The toilets are in a long hallway in the corner of the building, with the accessible cubicle closest to the entrance, followed by a parent's room, the ladies room, and finally the gents. It's worth noting I'm a fully abled male.\n\nMy job is in hospitality, so a bathroom break usually has to be pretty brief, and wiping urine off the seats in the men's bathroom gets old pretty quickly, so I like to use the accessible bathroom. \n\nA couple of days ago I was doing my business and as I'm getting ready to wipe, I hear someone try the door. Knowing it's potentially someone who needs the accessibility, I get my hustle on and leave no more than thirty seconds after they tried to get in. \n\nAs I was leaving, I saw what I figured to be an elderly mother and her middle aged daughter. The daughter kind of scoffed and asked me in an entirely unfriendly tone:  \"Where's your disability?\"\n\n I was caught off guard a little and just said \"Thank you!\" and walked away.\n\nAITA for using the accessible bathroom?\n",

When my mom invited me to go a few months ago I told her I may not want to go because of the semester I had planned. She surprised me with the trip for Christmas, and I had to scramble to request time off from work. When she gave them to me she said “let me know if you don’t want to go, I’ll have someone else take your place.” Knowing my mother I knew if i did this she’d be pissed. \n\nMoney is also very tight, and it has been since my father passed away. I live at home with her and I work full time to support myself and help her with some bills. I don’t appreciate knowing that I help support my mom so she can afford to plan expensive vacations. \n\nI’m in my senior year in university with a heavy load of classes in order to graduate (a whole year early with a double major!) I’m already planning on buying some sort of internet package for the ship so I can work on assignments. I already see her getting upset about it when she sees me doing that. This semester has been kicking my ass and I’m not even a month in, I feel like its a very uncomfortable situation for me to be in and I wonder if I should have just dealt with her being upset if I couldn’t go. By the time I received the syllabi and workload from my classes it was too late to back out. \n\nAITA for being upset with her, or for not telling her I wanted to go ahead of time?\nI love my mom and I wish I could spend more time with her. Since I’m still living at home with her and I hate creating unnecessary drama between us, but sometimes she doesn’t understand how overwhelmed I am. ",

My fiance has been placed to intern with a K-4 Elementary Music teacher.\n\nHer internship teacher has been very forward about the fact that he wanted an intern so that he wouldn't have to do his job. He immediately began giving her tasks such as being in charge of videoing the students for announcements, teaching full grades, spontaneously letting her know it's her turn to teach (all in the first week), having her fulfill duties regarding his non-academic YouTube channel. He went as far as to say \"You're paying me for you to teach my class.\"\n\nSome of it is good experience, if my fiance was ready for it. She has come home almost every day, beaten and mentally exhausted. Today, in week 3, she came home and informed me that her teacher told her \"I don't think I'm getting my return on investment with you.\" She is a very nonconfrontational person so she held it in until she got home.\n\nWhen I got home, she told me the story and that she almost went in to change her degree. My response was \"Email Professor [in charge]\". My fiance believes that it will be a waste of time and that she is going to be told to just change her major. After a bit of back and forth about her emailing a few of our professors for help, she finally blew up on me for pushing her to do something when she just wanted to vent.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

I believe this to be true. She was very upset when she found out, but as soon as she told the boyfriend, she became excited.

Nothing she does is for her own happiness, it's all for her boyfriend. She could have a great job with her degree, but because her boyfriend wants her to work at \\[insert big department store here\\] with him, she won't look for another job. He wants her there so she doesn't make much money and so that they are eligible for government assistance.

      "description": "This is on mobile so sorry for formatting. \n\nI'm a junior at my university and I live with a roommate in an apartment provided by our school just across the street. We have lived together since August. We don't talk much at all but so far we've gotten along just fine with no issues that I'm aware of (i.e. If he asks me to do something I'll generally do it within a reasonable time frame and vice versa).\n\nI have depression and this past week has been difficult as some of my classes have been busy. Consequently I've been zapped of energy and have had a hard time keeping up with life. \n\nEarlier this week my roommate asked me to take out the recycling later and I said not a problem and I'd do it. However I never did it, either because I was busy doing school stuff or I procrastinated on it. Last night he posted a sticky note on my door asking again if I could take out the recycling and also the trash later. I noticed this rather late and told myself I'd do it in the morning since I don't have school on Saturday. \n\nI slept in quite a bit (another consequence of depression), and woke up to my roommate at around ten to eleven knocking on my door. I was still in my underwear, dazed, and overall not in a mood to answer the door. I'd figure after a couple of knocks he'd back off and assume I wasn't home and would leave a note or something. \n\nHe was relentless and knocked (I counted) around 33 times in the span of a few minutes. Each knock was louder and more forceful than the last one; this almost frightened me and if anything lowered the chances of me answering. By the last few knocks he was basically slamming on the door. \n\nHe brought his girlfriend over, since she lives nearby and she helps him write a note which they slipped under my door (I'm still in bed, frightened to do anything at this point). The note said that if I don't carry my own weight he'd contact the housing department. They also took the trash and set it outside the door to my room so that when I'd open the door it'd be right there. \n\nAfter they left, I did what I should have done a long time ago and took out the trash. On my way out I noticed that on that same sticky note from last night he scribbled out \"later\" and put in \"today\". \n\nWhen I got back, I sat at my desk and wrote a note back to him. I told him I admitted fault for being a bad roommate and that I'd start contributing more. However the knocking resonated in my head and got the better of me. I also wrote firmly that the knocking was rude and disrespectful as it awoke me and probably other units in the complex due to how loud it might have been and how persistent it was. I wrote that if I don't answer after a few knocks he should let it go and that he should leave a note, email, or a text. I finished the note by saying if it happened again I'd be contacting the housing coordinator, stating that what he did felt like harassment. \n\nAs a P. S., I left him my schedule and wrote that I'd be willing to chat with him if we were both home. \n\nI taped the note on his door (during this entire time he was out of the house) and at the time of writing this he has not come back. \n\nSo I admit that I was not taking care of the chores as I should and that can be considered assholeish  and I own up to it. But am I an asshole for my response to what happened this morning? \n",

      "description": "One of my good friends is a part time babysitter and she had to look after some kids over the weekend.  Yesterday as I was driving home I did a quick stop at their place (I needed to give her something). The family is very wealthy so they have maids and w/e. I knocked on the door and the housekeeper opened who told me that my friend was upstairs in room X. \n\nSo I went upstairs and walked into that room. My friend was there with the kids. She was brushing her hair in front of the vanity mirror and I immediately noticed that she was practically naked. She was wearing tiny booty shorts and nothing else. Not a shirt, not even a bra. I was like woah wtf and subtly asked why she’s naked in front of the kids. The boys she’s babysitting are 7, 10 and 12. It’s not like she’s looking after a newborn who doesn’t even understand the concept of nudity. She looked at me like I’m crazy and said that they’re just kids, they don’t sexualize bodies etc. Then she said that I’m a creep for even suggesting that it’s wrong. She kept saying that they don’t even pay attention which was ridiculous because all 3 of them were clearly paying attention. \n\nWe kinda started arguing and I told her that it’s not appropriate for someone our age (we’re both 20 yo college students) to do that in front of minors. I just find it so creepy and predatory. I asked what she would do if the parents walked into this situation. She shrugged and said that it wouldn’t be a big deal at all. I asked if she does this frequently and she said yes, sometimes she tries out new clothes she bought or when she comes out the shower. \n\nWhile we were talking she proceeded to take off her shorts and underwear too. Like she was fully naked. \nI felt **really** uncomfortable and told the kids to watch TV in the living room. They weren’t listening to me and my friend was very offended, she was like “it’s really not that deep, can you stop being weird now”. I was very annoyed and left after that. How am I the weirdo?? \n\nNow I’m just utterly confused. I know in some cultures nudity is not that big of a deal but I don’t think that’s relevant here. Was it wrong of me to call her out? \n",

      "title": "WIBTA if I call the city in to enforce code on my neighbor? Without talking to them first?",
      "description": "I moved into a house in a rural, small-but-growing city two years ago. The back yard of our house abutted a lot in the center of the block where the owners kept some junk cars and stuff. It's a rural area, so whatever, that's how people roll here. Over the past two years, the way they've been using their property has gotten more obnoxious. The number of junk cars has multiplied, including wrecked demolition derby cars. The owner lets any of his friends with junk vehicles leave them there. A while back, an old full-size excavator showed up. They tend to make a good bit of noise with engines in the evenings, which I find inconsiderate but isn't illegal before 10pm.\n\nMy main annoyance is that we have a lovely view of the mountains out our back window from our main living space, but with a predominant foreground of our neighbor's amateur junkyard. Every time I sit down at our dining table, I see this growing tumor of decrepit junk in the middle of the city. We're going to be selling our house in a few months, and I am sure anyone looking at it will see the lot of junk ~75ft behind the house as a negative. So while I don't have to live with it long term, I do expect it will have a financial impact on us by affecting how buyers see our property.\n\nOn a whim, I searched my city's land use ordinance, and was surprised to see that keeping junk vehicles is illegal in the city. It's pretty cut and dried that what they're doing is forbidden, it just hasn't been enforced. I'm now thinking of taking action. Either talking with them, and/or asking the city to enforce the ordinance. The junk-loving neighbors won't like this; the junk-loving kind of lifestyle has been the norm here for ages. However, the city's growth and gentrification is showing in our area, with new homes being built and more people moving in that aren't down with the truck-nuts aesthetic and lifestyle.\n\nI am a bit loathe to go over there and make my request before going to the city. These neighbors haven't exactly been conscientious about their impact on others in the past: they left their dog out in 0F weather, barking all night (waking us and our toddler every night- that was a fun week), for many days- we did eventually get animal control involved after they didn't answer the door multiple days in a row.\n\nSince my request now would be for a radical change of lifestyle, I doubt it'll be productive- I'd essentially be saying \"Hey, would you undertake a huge project of finding another place out of city limits to keep the few dozen vehicles and machines you've been accumulating for years?\" I really doubt they're going to do anything unless forced to, and honestly I'd rather let the city deal with it and not let the neighbors know that I'm the one raining on their parade.\n\nThat said, I know it's good manners to approach people directly and give them a chance to work the issue out before taking things to the authorities. Is going straight to the city without trying them first a jerk move?",

      "description": "read before downvoting.\n\nThis was quite some years ago in 6th grade and this situation still bothers me. \n\nBasically I was friends with an kid that had autism. I don't remember what kind of autism he had, he just couldn't register stuff right and he kind of had a lack of respect and no boundary for what he said. But I put that aside because it's not his fault he doesn't know when or when not to say stuff. \n\nOne day I was taking a piss in the stall (I am a male) and not a urinal, because I was scared of using a urinal. I heard footsteps and didn't think of it, because it's a bathroom. I finished peeing and zipped up my fly, when I see a freaking head peeking out from under one of the walls (they were low, but not that low). I freaked out and let out a scream, not loud though. I did what my reaction told me to, and knee him in the face. It didn't break anything, but it obviously hurt him as he started crying and ran out. Note that I didn't know it was him before I kneed him, I just knew \"hey someone crawled into my stall\".   \nWe shared the same class for that period so I ran back to the class and he was outside with his aid. She was upset, which I can't blame given the situation. Turns out all he told his aid was something along the lines of \"(my name) kneed me in the face!\". However she was very understanding, and I had to explain to her that he crawled under my stall door on all fours and peeked at me. Nothing in terms of punishment happened, because she was very understanding and she thought that what I did was terrible, but given the fact that he crawled under my stall she accepted it. I apologized to him and he was indifferent about it. He didn't seem to hold a grudge on me though, it seemed like he forgot it or something.  I later told his parents because I was friends with them, and they understood that things like that could happen, so nothing bad happened to me after that. \n\nwhat do y'all think? was I in the wrong here, or was my action justified based on the situation?",

We're engaged, but, as we keep going along, I feel myself loathing the idea of spending the rest of my life with him. There are several reasons why I don't like the relationship - he can be a bit bipolar, he can be hypocritical, he's condescending - but I know I'm not perfect, and in the end I think it just boils down to the simple fact that I (probably) don't love him anymore and I don't want to continue the relationship.\n\nThe problem is he's highly dependent upon me financially. I'm the only one who's making money. I pay the rent. I pay for the food. I even own the car he drives. If we break up, he'll be jobless, he'll have to quit school, and he'll either not have a car or he'll have a car he can't afford.\n\nI feel like an asshole for leading him along into this situation and then not wanting to see him and the relationship through it.

      "description": "For a bit of context: My wife and I adopted a small dog (~10lbs). When we first went to visit my mom and family I brought the dog to stay with us, which my mom was okay with (at least, she didn't offer any protest about the situation). The dog has come with us (almost) every time we have visited mom without any protest from her.\n\nMy mom has a dog of her own, much larger then my dog (20+ lbs) but otherwise no other pets. She also does not take very good care of her home, in my opinion. The house is often not just messy, but also *very* dirty.\n\nThis year my mom came to visit us at our home for Thanksgiving. She asked if she could bring the dog and I declined because:\n\n1. Based on my experience the dog is somewhat house trained, but not very well. I also cannot expect my mother to do well to clean up if the dog had an accident because also in my experience she does a poor job taking care of her own home.\n\n2. There were going to be a lot of people in the house and her dog is very playful. Another animal in the home would be a nuisance.\n\n3. We have two cats that live with us that would be anxious over having a large, unknown dog in the house.\n\nI didn't explain these reasons, but my mom accepted I wasn't comfortable with the dog coming at Thanksgiving without much questioning.\n\nNow my mom is getting ready to come next week for Christmas and she just texting me asserting that she would be bringing her dog. Not asking, asserting. She did mention she would bring the dogs kennel, which will help mitigate some of the concerns I have to a small degree, but my cats will still be anxious, and the dog will still be rambunctious and potentially messy. Thankfully there will be much less people in the house.\n\nI am very uncomfortable and don't know what to say to my mother but AITA for having this double standard that I should be allowed to bring my dog to  my moms house but my mom should not be allowed to bring her dog to mine?",

      "description": "Forgive me if this sounds like a typical elopement story. \nI recently got engaged to the love of my life. Everything between us couldn't be better and we're best friends. We have no problem being open and honest with each other and talk regularly about what bothers us in the world.\n\nThe relationship I have with her family is a bit more rocky I'm afraid. She has quite a large family that all live in the same city and strive for the 'perfect family' appearance, at least on the outside. My relationship with her siblings, parents, step-parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins ranges from the utmost respect and friendship to not being able to stand being on the same city block due to some personal events that would compromise the anonymity of the story. \nI wish it were mostly the former and not the latter, or even that it were 50/50, but it is not. \n\nThis takes me to my main objection to having a wedding at all. There are a few people that both my fiancée and I agree we never, ever want to be allowed at our wedding, but seeing as the family has such an adamant policy on \"sticking together\" (even though most of the family absolutely hate each other and constantly say awful things about whoever isn't in the room) there is no way we can exclude anyone without having the collective wrath of the family brought down upon us. \n\nThe biggest problems that I have with this fake image of perfection is that there is so much dirt in their laundry that you could use it as compost in the garden, and I am also routinely reminded that I'm not a 'real' part of the family and that my problems are my own without any hope of support or inclusion from them. \n\nWe've talked about it at length, and my fiancée feels the same as I do, albeit to a lesser degree about her family (something about you don't have to like your family but sometimes you can't help but love them anyways). She has said she is happy to swing by the town hall or to elope somewhere, but I can see in her eyes how much it would really mean to have a small wedding. \n\nStill, I feel like a selfish asshole to want our wedding to be about us and I feel like we'd be letting many of our close friends and family members down to exclude everyone for the sake of minimizing our exposure to a few toxic people. It's also not easy for us to confront her family about how we feel since we both currently live in a different country from our families and are fairly non-confrontational people with a decent amount of social anxiety to boot. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here?\n\n",

My wife knows I hate fighting for attention against Instagram, she’s usually snaps at me for calling her out as she always claims she is doing something legitimate on her phone. So when she got her phone out and used it directly over my face I gave her the benefit of the doubt. After 5 minutes, she showed me a picture of some random celebrities kid, and I told her I would just let her do her thing and I would do my thing. She asked what was wrong and I told her I would have liked to spend the night doing something together, and she told me to just drop it and to not be dramatic. We went to bed without talking much more. This morning I told her this weekend I would put as much energy into doing things together as she did, instead of me always suggesting things to do. She really did not like that and played the victim card as if I were way too dramatic.\n\nFor total honesty she is both sick with a cold and pregnant.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "When I was still in school, I was getting really good grades without doing much for it. I barely studied for it and forgot my homework all the time. One day during break, a girl in my friend group, Laura, started talking about our native language class homework and I realised that I had forgotten to do it again. I asked if she was okay with me copying it. We did this all the time, letting friends copy homework and tests. Laura said sure I could copy it, as long as I changed some things up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the next unrelated subject, I started reading what she had written. I hated it. It was supposed to be an analysis of a text we had talked about, but it read more like an overview, so I actually didn't really use it. I got out the source text and actually did an analysis that went more in-depth, complete with quotes (Laura didn't have any), writing three times as much as Laura had. Next lesson was the native language subject. Now our teacher wanted to talk about the homework by having one student read our their work out loud, and dissecting it sentence by sentence, having the whole class have a discussion about it. He picked me to read what I had written, and I did. In the end, he said that my analysis was spot on so I joked that he should give me a good grade for it then (teachers here can sometimes grade a student on quality contributions to a lesson). He said \"why not, actually\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was feeling good until my friend next to me whispered \"Laura isn't happy about this\". Laura looked shocked and angry. So after the lesson I walked over to Laura and said \"Hey, I hope everything's okay between us.\" and she said \"no, you stole my grade.\" I explained to her that I had planned on only copying her homework, but through reading what she had written I remembered what it was about and wrote my own analysis. I said when I read it out loud she must have noticed that it was pretty different than what she had written. Of course though, there were some similarities because we wrote about the same source text, but we shared these similarities with probably every other student. She was so angry still and apparently started bitching about me the entire day and the next. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to reinstall the peace between us, the next day I asked her what I should do and she said I should talk to the teacher and make him give her this grade. She apparently had done pretty awful in the last tests so she hoped she could improve her final grade. I actually went to the teacher to talk to him about it. I can't believe I did it in hindsight, because it's like I acknowledged I did something wrong. He was pretty confused about what I wanted from him, and he told me that Laura never contributed to the lessons, and I did almost every time, so she didn't deserve it, and that was the end to it. I told Laura what he had said, but she went on to hate me and bitch about me until we graduaded. ",

      "description": "I’ll refer to my best friend as “M” and her other best friend as “V”. \n\nM and I are extremely close. She’s always there for me when I’m struggling as I’m always there for her. M and I are really similar in personality, we’re both extremely empathetic and selfless because we had similar childhoods where we had to take on a lot of responsibilities at a young age. I really appreciate M and she’s probably the only person in my life I’d consider a real good friend who’d probably still be with me when we’re old grandmas. \n\nThere’s been this problem bugging M for about a year now, and it’s gotten to a point where it started affecting me as well. Her other “best friend” V, makes everything really complicated. I don’t even know where to begin because there’s just so much going on with her. For one, V just seems like she uses M. Like if her other friends are not there and she’s all alone, she’ll come running to M acting like they’re besties. She treats M like a substitute and it pisses me off. And it’s not just me noticing this or making an assumption that she is using her as a replacement to not look like a loner, but M feels this way as well. She confided in me multiple times telling me how V makes her uncomfortable and how she feels that she’s only using her. \n\nSecond of all, what really annoys me, is that V seems to lack basic consideration for other people. V recently moved, so she had to transfer to another school. We’re seniors in high school, so it was our last homecoming and M and I were planning on making the most out of it with just us two going out to eat together and enjoying the time. Our school has guest forms to invite students from other schools to our homecoming, and V asked M at the last minute to guest her and eat dinner with her, even though she knew that M and I already had plans together. It was kind of infuriating because they had literally gone to every dance together in the past years and she can’t even let me spend one dance with M? \n\nYou’re probably wondering why we can’t just go all together, but it’s really awkward and uncomfortable. I don’t really know how to explain it, but I keep getting these vibes off of V like she’s jealous of how close M and I have been getting because whenever I’m with M, she’ll start acting overly clingy to M and keeps calling her “my number one best friend” while glancing back at me. \n\nV also had a pretty fucked up childhood because her dad sexually abused her, and I feel really terrible about that. She struggles with depression and had bad problems with cutting . So when V asks to hang out, M always feels like she can’t say no because she doesn’t want to hurt V’s feelings. I’m also afraid of hurting V’s feelings so I have never said anything of what I feel towards her. I’ve always been really nice to her but I feel bad that I’m being fake in that way when I truly don’t like her at all. \n\nThese days M has been really stressed out not knowing how to deal with V because their friendship is honestly just super toxic. V calls her best friend, but she really doesn’t treat her like one at all. M has been asking me for advice on what to do, and I told her to just start distancing herself from V. But I know that’s gonna be really hard because we’re both scared of hurting V since she’s so sensitive, and we don’t want to make her fall into an even deeper depression. She may not be the best person, but we still care about her. She’s gone through a lot worse things than M and I could ever imagine. But I don’t want M being friends with her just out of pity. AITA for telling her to distance herself from V? ",

      "description": "Let me explain myself before you offer judgement please. \n\nThis is driving me absolutely insane and turned into a fight for the first time last night. My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.",

      "description": "Hi all! This evening I was driving home and saw a stray pit bull eating trash at the dumpster at my townhouse. I happened to have a slip lead dog leash in my car, so I figured I’d stop and see if I could get the dog. She was super friendly and came right over to me when I bent down. \n\nI walked around the area for a bit to see if I could find an owner that was looking. I could not. The dog was in good shape and super sweet. I knew she had to have an owner, but she was not wearing a collar with tags to call anyone. \n\nDue to having other animals and a 4 year old who is terrified of dogs, I was unable to bring her into my house. Obviously this would have been my first choice, but it was impossible in this scenario. \n\nI called the local animal control. We live in a small town and the shelter system is not crowded/overrun. They’re really responsive and work hard to reunite animals/owners. They came and picked her up. \n\nI posted a picture and some information to a local missing pet Facebook group. Within an hour or two a woman said she was hers. I let her know she was with the shelter and gave her the number to call. She also said the dog gets out frequently and that she is usually able to find her within a few hours. \n\nThis woman then FREAKED out on me for taking her dog to a shelter. She’ll have to pay a fine for the dog being out, but she’ll be able to get her tomorrow. She’s livid that her dog has to spend the night in a shelter, even though the alternative was her dog on the street or getting hit by a car. \n\nI feel bad that this woman will not have her dog for the night, but I feel like priority number one was making sure the dog was okay. \n\nSo, am I really the asshole for making sure the dog was safe?",

      "description": "I do feel like this needs some context, sorry if it turns out longwinded!\n\nMy mum broke her elbow about 3 weeks ago and since then I've been doing everything for her. I even sleep in her bed, just in case something's up at night (I have gotten up in the middle of the night a lot, without ever complaining. Even though I already get a max. of 6h of sleep mon-fri). However, I'm an adult myself and have things to do as well. I'm very stressed about a ridiculous amount of college deadlines all ending in the same week, have had to recover from my 3rd burnout since last summer, have depression and anxiety (which have been pretty bad for the past 2 months) and am also on the autism spectrum (important in a minute). We don't have close friends or even family at all where we live, but my grandparents took a 7h car ride to be around to help.\n\nWhenever she asks me for help, I jump. I do every tiny little thing for her. But I also have things to work on myself and can't just neglect college assignments just to help her with something like dusting off a shelf. She gets irrationally angry at me every time I don't help help her do something. If it's something I know she can't do, like get her medicine out of the containers (as well as opening any sort of container or bottle for that matter), or getting her an ice pack because of the pain, I do it immediately. But whenever I know that she can do the task herself and I'm working on something important, I refuse. And mind you, if I'm not busy, I usually help with that stuff as well.\n\nHer most recent fit of rage was about me not wanting to help her wash her hair, because for one she can do it herself, that's a fact, and secondly it's sensory hell for me. This is where the autism part comes in: I don't particularly like touching other people much and am mildly phobic of germs and dirt (greasy hair is a nightmare). I have, however, helped with that at the beginning when I knew she couldn't do it herself. Now she can, though, and I don't have to trigger my usually non-existant gag reflex. I do help with putting care products in her hair, brushing her hair, everything but the actual washing part. She knows why and still gets angry at me.\n\nBack when I had to get surgery on my ovaries and got out of hospital, but still was in immense pain, she didn't help me a single bit and even sent me to school (which I was still in back then) while barely being able to walk. Don't get me wrong, she's always been a good mum, but apparently didn't understand that back then. Now that she does understand the pain of post-surgery, I could have totally done the same, but didn't. I help out as much as I can, but sometimes the amount of help doesn't satisfy her wishes. Plus my grandparents are also present.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my friend not to let her young sons around her abusive stepfather which triggered a public panic attack?",
      "description": "Some background:\n\n- This is referencing myself and 3 friends. We are all moms in our early to mid 30s with young children.   \n\n- One friend has previously shared with us her history of abuse, both sexual and verbal, from her stepfather, as well as the extent of enabling that took place with her mother.  She has a very toxic family.  \n\n- This friend has two sons, 8 and 5yo. \n\n\nTonight the 4 of us went out for a mom’s night.  At dinner, our friend shared the latest instance of verbal abuse coming from her stepfather.  Somehow the conversation lead to us talking with her about the fact that she allows both her sons to visit her mom and stepfather without either parent there to supervise.  We tried to lovingly convince her that this was completely unsafe.  \n\nI was more insistent than the others because I’ve carried some guilt over not speaking up sooner about it.  I don’t completely recall everything I said, but I did tell her that she had normalized the situation and didn’t realize how dangerous it was, that she can’t trust her mother to protect her sons because she didn’t protect her, and that she won’t know that something bad has happened until it already has.  I also said I wasn’t trying to judge her but to be a good friend.  She was tearing up during the conversation but didn’t ask us to stop. \n\nRight after I said the part about not knowing something bad has happened after it already has, she excused herself to the restroom.  Fifteen minutes later we go to check on her and find out the following via text: \n\n- She had immediately left the restaurant and started walking home, in the cold, with no coat.  It’s a 25 min drive.  \n\n- She called her husband to come pick her up.  He had to load up the kids at 10:30pm, past their bedtime.  And they had to see their mom in the midst of a panic attack.  \n\n-  She had a panic attack and was spotted crossing a bridge by a stranger who called the cops.  5 police officers waited with her until her husband arrived.  \n\nBy the time we got the info from her, her husband had arrived, so we weren’t able to go check on her in person.  \n\nI’m wondering if I’m the asshole for being part of this conversation in such a public place, especially since it triggered such a traumatic response from her and lead to a very unpleasant evening for her and her family.  Honestly the way it all played out was so surreal, none of us expected it, but I’m not sure that excuses us, and especially me because I was so insistant?",

However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "description": "About a year and a half ago I moved nine hours away from my hometown for school. My mother, understandably, contacted me a lot to make sure I was alright and eating enough. In the beginning this that fine because I didn’t have any friends and contact with anybody was nice for me.\n\nOf course as I settled into life I school I made friends and started to get busy. Now, a year and a half later, I have plenty of activities between school and friends and I find myself missing texts from everybody because I’m doing something else and not paying attention to my phone.\n\nI was at a get together with my friends when the conflict started. She text me and I didn’t see it until about two am, at which point I felt it was useless to respond since it would be three am where she was and I didnt think she would see it. She knew I was hanging out with my friends that night playing video games and the like so I figured there wouldn’t be an issue with me not responding to her text of “what’s happening tonight?”\n\nThis isn’t how it went though. In the morning I woke up to a text stating that if I didn’t start replying to her text messages that she would have to phone the police.\n\nAdmittedly I think I overreacted her since I don’t believe she would actually do this but the rest of the conversation progressed with me saying that I was an adult now and didn’t always have time to respond, her saying I always had my phone on hand and it only took two seconds to respond, me saying I didn’t always have my phone on hand and sometimes I just forgot to respond, her saying that it was rude, and me telling her that if she felt like that then she didn’t have to contact me at all since I was on my own now and could take care of myself.\n\nIt didn’t go exactly like this and I could get screenshots of the exact conversation if anybody is interested, but this is the cliff notes version.\n\nTl:dr my mom made a hollow threat to call the cops if I didn’t respond to her text messages and I asked her to stop messaging me.",

      "description": "Not sure if this should be posted here or /r/relationships but here goes: \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together now for 8 years, having lived together for almost 5 years. Recently, I had received a contract/job offer that would require relocation. It's not my 'dream job' per se but definitely a solid stepping stone that would set me on the right path towards it. And hey- it's only one year. \n\nThey pay is slightly better but I think there is more value in building my reputation, establishing a larger network and using this opportunity as a journey of \"self-discovey\"/ finding my own independence.  \n\nWe're both in our mid to late twenties with no kids. As for obligations, it would only be towards our cat as we don't own a vehicle or mortgage. \n\nOur currently living arrangements are complicated. We're living at his parents' house to save money while they live in another property a few towns over. They're very nice people but it can be strenuous as they often come to visit every other weekend. \n\nAs such, before we moved I together, we had plans to buy a house within 5 years. At the time, he was in school while I worked. That was about 4.5 years ago. While I understand that school was a priority and took up roughly 3 of those 5 years, he has since found a stable job that he enjoys but has shown little to no interest in house hunting or talking to me about plans for the future. \n\nI've been doing my best to express that this is something that is of great importance to me but am often rebuffed and told to stop nagging so much. \n\nAs our 'deadline' approaches, he has shown more interest but I'm not sure if it's because he genuinely wants to live together, or because his parents want to come back to the main house after the 5 year mark.\n\nAfter discussing this job opportunity with him, I thought that he would be happy for me but he expressed that he would be against long distance relationships and unwilling to even try. For two people who have been together for almost 9 years, I figured that 1 year away would be considered a small time apart. I had also mentioned that now would be a good time as we're both still young and aren't commited to things like a mortgage for example. He became even more upset and reassured me that he would like for us to grow together and that he would like for us to marry in the future. \n\nWhether it's something trivial like going to bed early or promising to do more things together, he's been known to say things with the best of intention but has a hard time following through with the action. \n\nThat said, I'm not sure if he's all that committed to a future together even after talking about it... AITA? ",

He got a job, stacking stuff, lost it in less than a month. I don't really see him much any more, and it feels like we don't really have anything to talk about.\n\n\nAnother saw the first guys girlfriend, and thought, \"I'd like that.\" and that caused a bunch of shit, and he says he's not into her now, but often states that she never said that she doesn't like him... Oh, he was also living at my place for a while, and if I'm honest, I was getting sick of him being around constantly, especially since I was paying more rent than him. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\nThe last guy started dating someone, so now he and the first guy keep comparing them and I'm tired of hearing it. Besides that he's alright, even though I don't get to see him often.\n\nSorry for the rant, but to get to my point, the few times I hang out with them lately, I've noticed that I'll be having a conversation with one or more of them, and someone will just abruptly change the topic, usually to ask me a question. For example:\n\nMe: So that's why Revenge of the Sith is my favourite film.\n\nFriend/s: I was hanging out with other friend last night and he said the best joke / hey, how do I do this in this game?\n\nI get that I might not be the most interesting person, or have the most interesting hobbies, but isn't it rude to just not acknowledge that I said anything at all?

      "description": "  \n\nWell, this one has a lot of details but please bear with me! \n\nSo me and my GF met around 18 months ago, she was about to immigrate to Israel from Russia. In Israel this process (for Jews only) comes with a lot of benefits, among others you get a yearlong program to help you settle in better (learning the language, history, culture and so on), another benefit is that you get some kind of an Israeli born and raised sponsor. In this case me, and a shitload of money when you finally immigrate.\n\nIt took some time but around the world cup final, after knowing each other for around 10 months just before she went back to Russia to prepare for her permanent stay, we decided we want a relationship.\n\nShe is very smart and very pretty, and resourceful, after the program ended we coupled up, but she had to leave for 3 months. I was used for people hitting on her constantly, and as she is a nice person by nature she always let them down easy enough they wanted to stay around her as friends (or sleeper agents waiting for the right time). Also, she was very outgoing and popular and had many friends regardless. \n\nOne of them, we will call him David, was also an immigrant but he immigrated 6 years ago and shared a place with his Ex-roommate-turned-GF. Since thing ended badly between them, he had a spare room at his place and he offered it free of charge! I was surprised but I wanted her to take this suspicious and great deal because I trusted her. \n\nLittle did I know that the reason David and his Ex broke up was the feelings he had to my GF, and that his Ex didn’t fully moved out, she comes back every Saturday to sleep there. While she does, my GF and Fucking David shared a bed. That went on for 3 months… \n\nShe came clean about all of it and told me noting physical happened and I tend to believe her. However, I told her I needed a complete break of two weeks (I didn’t answered her phone calls). I was mad and hurt that she didn’t tell me that immediately, and they had a secret they kept together from me for a long time. Needless to say that if she would have told me I would have found a solution. \n\nAt the end of the two weeks, she was really mad at me. I asked her in which bed did she slept on the last two Saturdays, and she said that in David's. I broke up with her on the spot. AITA?",

      "description": "(New account)\n\nEnglish is my third language (be gentle) sorry for errors, typos, and grammar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little bit of a back story; My mom and I live together. One day my mom tells me that my cousin will stay with us for two months. My moms room has been converted into a place for her hobbies, while the other room is mine. I told her it was a dumb idea to convert her room into that and where would she put her bed? \"In the living room\". (it's a small bed) so she told me its fine. I just went with it. My cousin arrives and since he has no-where to go because my uncle was going to start charging him if he stayed at his place again.\n\nHe's there for the soul purpose of getting enough money to buy a plane ticket to go to Spain (where his wife is)... Why cant his wife send him the money? - I don't know. Why can't my aunt/ his mom give him the money?.. I don't know\n\nI don't know about him and his situation, all I know is that he's getting money to go Spain and that he'll need two months to do so. So, two months go by.. Later I find out that his aunt tells my mom that he'll need another month to get enough money to leave. November comes and goes. I find out again that he'll be leaving in February (two more months) until he decides to leave. My mom has been sleeping on a recliner for three months, I've had enough and tell her that I would talk to him. Five months is a really long time, what has he been doing with the money, and why does he come from work so late? She tells me not to say anything and to just stay out of it.\n\nDuring the first month my sister finds out that he's been going to work (somewhat) but that he's been also going to other places, sight-seeing, and maybe (huge maybe) been with another female. How did she find out? He has her added on a bunch of social media and she's tracked him down on where he has been going. We confront him, while surprised that she found out, he swears that everything was for work. He ended up blocking her and removing her from everything. The second month goes by and he said he quit his job for a better paying one(he went from roof repair guy to painter). He came home intoxicated once and he has a liver problem. He can't be drinking.\n\nI got tired of it today and asked him... \n\nWhere are you working? - As a painter. \n\nHow much are they paying you? - $100 each day. \n\nThey give you $100 each day as a painter? Yes, but they pay me after end of the week.\n\nSo they pay you $500 each week but you need until February to leave? Yes.\n\nWhy? Because I also pay for my car back home, I give a bit to my mom, and I owe the bank.  (I don't believe him but I go with it.\n\nI tell him \"five months is a long time, my mom has been sleeping in that chair for 3 months, she can barely sleep, and because we have loud neighbors they sometimes end up waking her at night\". I look at her every day she wakes up, It's really hard for me just to keep pretending. So I told her yesterday that I would leave my room spotless for her, so she can take it (I am the A-hole for not offering it to her in the first place) and that I would sleep on the sofa in the living room because I was not going to sleep in that chair. I told him \"I'm not attacking you, we're just talking, I don't want you leave right away, I'm not saying I can't stand you anymore and that I don't want you here. I just wanted some answers as to why you're taking so long especially since you have a wife in Spain all alone and waiting for you.\"\n\nHe got mad, he said he'll move out at the end of the week, and that he didn't mean to disturb us (with an attitude). I told him that \"I wasn't telling him to leave, you have all of December still, just don't waste your money and save it\" He's been packing for a bit. I told my mom, she got pissed and now we're waiting for her to talk to him and me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShort story; Cousin need money for Spain because wife is there, need two months but now wants to spend 5 months (while being sketchy), Mom has been sleeping bad for 3 months, we're tired of him but mom tells me to stay out of it. I ask him what's taking so long, he gets upset, starts packing, and now were' waiting for my mom to get home to talk to him and me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I am the a-hole then I'll apologies to him and my mom and leave him be, I just needed a fresh outlook.",

She would occasionally come to our house to watch the kids but most of the time we dropped them off at her home.\n\nAt the time of our childcare arrangement we spoke about all the normal stuff i.e. payment, drop off, and also tax reporting as this isn't my first go around. When you've paid for childcare expenses in the past they add up quick. We just want to utilize the proper tax benefit.\n\nAbout 2 months ago she cancelled with a two week notice (better than none) and we have not used her since. \n\nWhile preparing taxes we requested the proper tax forms that she should produce upon request. Her response was that she hadn't kept track all year (we have) and that she does not feel comfortable giving us her SSN as this is how we report to the IRS if they do not have an EIN.\n\nMy wife was the one who made the request and let me know what our previous provider said. \n\nI then contacted the previous provider and let her know that my wife and I; through our taxes will report her for her lack of due diligence as well the income she made from us. (We are required to report our childcare benefit differently due to her refusal to identify)\n\nMy wife is embarrassed I'm her husband now.\n\nOn mobile so please forgive formatting or whatever else is wrong.\n\n\nAlso I have not posted much so I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I have two sisters who are each divorced with 4 kids. This year both sisters started new relationships with men who have children from previous marriages. I'm sincerely happy for them, but hate how they're pressuring me to treat their new boyfriends and their kids like family. \n\nI met my older sister's BF &amp; kiddos around Halloween. My sis introduced me to everyone and told his 10 &amp; 12 yr olds to call me Aunt HaloandCurves. I think she was trying to make them feel comfortable with me, but it was super awkward. The tweens ignored me most of the night despite my efforts to entertain them. I was somewhat resentful since I would have rather been focusing on my real neices &amp; nephews.\n\nMet my other sister's new man and his kids this summer. To be honest, I can't stand them. His kids are younger and not well behaved. They get into everything and beg nonstop for treats. My sister's kids are fantastic and try to keep them out of trouble. It just seems unfair that my older neices and nephews basically have to babysit his kids any time they come to visit. It sucks for them and I hate it.\n\nIn the past I've always hosted a holiday party for family at my apartment. I took care of gifts and food because I didn't want my sisters to stress. They were both single moms trying to find a way to give their four kids a good Christmas. It was the least I could do. But now I'm dreading Christmas with my sisters and their \"entourages\". There just simply isn't room for seven more people, and I don't want to buy gifts for 5 kids who are practically strangers. Please help me. Should I cancel my Christmas party to avoid what sounds like a hellish ordeal, or am I being a selfish asshole who needs to suck it up?",

She talks badly about children a lot. Not even bad kids, just regular children. She is one of those \"children are to be seen and not heard.\" Her first born child was born out of wedlock but she has no problem calling anyone who had done the same a whore or a sinner. When I was growing up and going through puberty, she would always look at me in disgust. In the summer, if I wore shorts, even shorts that were right at my needa, she would call me a whore. When I started wearing bras she would always grill me about what grown man's attention I was trying to get. Later in life, I found out that was abusive to my mother as a child as well. But her life has been plagued with a lot of sadness. She is the only surviving member of her family of her mom and dad and twelve siblings. She has outlived her first baby daddy and later my grandfather. She had six children and two of them (including my mother) have passed. And she has outlived all of her friends. She was diagnosed with cancer last year and chose to forego treatment. She doesn't have much time left. But I don't really care to try to recover any relationship. I hear from my family that she asks for me a lot and I visited a few weeks ago when everyone thought she was going to pass. But other than that, I don't really feel any grief from it. Am I being too immature? Should I go visit her more? I'm afraid of it being too late if I change my mind later in life.",

I also have to keep the register/photo department in an extremely clean and organized way, per our new mangers expectations.\n\nBefore all of this, we had an absolute shit show of a store. We had a old manager who was always in the background, and didn’t truly care about shit. We were always running out of dispense items like plastic bags, photo supplies, and most importantly, media sets. A media set is our paper and ribbon for our printers. In a box comes 2 ribbons and 2 rolls of paper. For the entire 2 years I have been working here, I have always been taught to change both paper and ribbon tighter, no matter what the computer says. The computer can either say “replace paper” or “replace ribbon” depending on which one runs out first, but again, you always change both. This keeps our boxes and counts even. \n\nNow here is the problem, some of my coworkers don’t change the both together. This causes us to have excess rolls of paper, that they end up hiding in the back of the photo department cabinets. Which I end up having to throw away when I work, because a roll without a ribbon shouldn’t be used. When I started noticing this, I asked my manager if she could talk to the other employees about how to change the media. A few days later, she said she had discussed it with everyone. After there was still no change, so I had left a very nice note that said “please remember to change both ribbon and paper:)”. A few couple weeks later, it’s still happening. So now I got our label maker, and write “please change both ribbon and paper” and stick them to the inside of the cabinet where the printers are. There is 0% chance you could miss this note. Still this is happening.\n\nSo now I’m annoyed. My new manager is getting annoyed with me because I’m supposedly ordering more media sets than our store should be using. Only problem is that if I don’t order X amount a week, we will run out. So yesterday I wrote a note that said “Whoever is only changing either paper or ribbon only, please stop. You must always change both, no matter what. It ruins our counts and leaves us with rolls that will just be thrown away.” I taped this to our computer, which you shouldn’t be able to miss. I am now thinking that this may have been a bit assholeish because I am not technically in any higher position than them. \n\nSo I am wondering AITA for leaving this passive aggressive note? ",

He consistently reiterates that he is attracted to me, despite the fact that I have told him I am in a committed relationship with a wonderful person. He constantly tells me to play Runescape with him, and when I try to tell him that I don't want to play it for any more of the day, he mentions his epilepsy making him have seizures. (Which I'm starting to think he's using to fish for sympathy- he smokes, and refuses to do rehab because he doesn't have money, and he refuses to save up money to do so.) And he pulls this really subtle thing I hate where he thinks apologizing will make me do stuff with him, so he does it incessantly and just makes me feel guilty. I have received unsolicited lewds from him and I think he's trying to guilt me into spending time with him, in an attempt to sabotage my existing romance.

      "description": "I walked in to the tea room in my workplace today to find two colleagues who I generally get on very well with, who are married, in the middle of a conversation regarding outlandish workplace pregnancy rumours that had them in stitches. \n\nAlmost as soon as I entered the room, they added me into the joke, laughing that maybe I’m pregnant. \n\nThe husband (Dave) had a quick laugh and moved on, but the wife (Susie) carried on with the conversation, noting that I frequently ask to be moved out of areas at work using xray, am of childbearing age, and often complain that I can’t eat first thing in the morning because it makes me feel unwell.  Dave actually said to her ‘stop now, or this rumour will stick’ and others said the same, but Susie carried on, thinking she was being hilarious, and getting payback for me briefly hiding her pen yesterday.\n\nAs we all know, fake pregnancy pranks are rarely funny, and you often don’t know what people around you are going through in regards to pregnancy and fertility. I know, for example, that one person who was present, but not involved in the conversation, fell pregnant when we were at school, was forced into terminating by her parents, and regrets it.\n\nPersonally, I love kids and desperately want my own.  I am very aware that the way things are going for me it seriously might not happen, and that feels like a failure, but I try not to let on how upsetting it is for me.  So I tried to get her to knock it off by joking ‘are you saying I look fat?’ but she carried right on.  Someone else said quite bluntly ‘pregnancy rumours aren’t funny, you don’t know what people are going through’ and I chimed in ‘right! maybe I’ve been trying to get pregnant for years’ but she still tone-deafed away, laughing ‘I’ve got three teenagers, which one do you want?’\n\nSo I lost my shit.\n\nTold her ‘well aren’t you lucky to have had three kids.  Not that it’s any of your business, but I’d desperately love to have a child but it really looks like it’s never going to happen and I worry that the miscarriage I was so relieved by when I fell pregnant at uni might have been my only chance. But sure, laugh it up, I’m sure I’ll have a super fun time explaining to all the people who hear your hilarious story that no, as much as I’d like to be pregnant, I’m a big ol’ barren failure and Susie was just having a funny joke. hilarious! look how we’re all laughing!’\n\nthen I finished strong by telling her stunned face to get stuffed (I know, harsh words) and turned heel.\n\nAITA? I feel like I overreacted, but then I also feel like she was given plenty of opportunity to take a hint before I blew up at her, and clearly wasn’t going to let up. ",

Second girl I started seeing in the end of Jan I just broke things off with 2 days ago because she graduated with a BA in history in June and same scenario worked at a clothing store with no other plans. \n\nI mentioned this to one of my friends after she asked me why I keep dumping these girls and I told her why and she called me a huge prick, a douche, and said that I think that I'm better than them \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hi everybody, apologies in advance for formatting - not on mobile, I've just never been good at it.\n\nMy mom has a history of doing really shady things and then coming up with decent reasons when she gets caught. When I was growing up, she'd take money out of my piggy bank every now and then claim that it was going towards my college fund (Which, I found out when it was time to go to college, did not exist). When I would get checks for my birthday from family members, she would cash them and then use the money to buy my birthday presents (which she assured me was totally reasonable because I was still getting something).\n\nAs a family we weren't exactly hurting for money. We lived in the middle class area of a nice town, always had food and heat, etc. But my mother was/is absolutely terrible at handling money. It's not that she doesn't know what to do with it, it's that she spends it on clothes, cigarettes, and drinks with her friends the second she gets it. Which meant that when she needed money for food, rent, and taxes, she would \"borrow\" (steal) money from me and my sisters. Her lack of financial responsibility played a huge part in us having to move out of that middle class neighborhood to go live in a dangerous area, where her bad spending habits continue to this day. \n\nFast forward to today. I've long since moved out of the house and made it on my own a state away from her. I'm going grocery shopping when I stop to check on my bank account and see that a check for $250 has been taken out. I rack my brain trying to think of any checks I'd written recently but I can't think of any. Then I remember that I can take a look at a picture of the check with the mobile app, and what I saw made my blood boil. \n\nMore backstory: There was a small student loan that she had taken out in her name for me, and I told her I'd be paying for it. She told me that the easiest way to do that would be for me to pre-sign a few checks for the monthly amount ($50) for her to send into the account every month. Obviously wary of this given her history but not wanting to insult her, I agreed, but watched her fill out the check to make sure it was going to the right place. When I wrote in the dollar amounts, I lined out the unused space on the line so that nothing could be added - or so I thought.\n\nWhen I looked at the picture of the check, it was one of the ones I had pre-signed for $50. Except that she had written THROUGH THE LINEOUT the words \"Two hundred and\" in front of the \"fifty\", and then cashed it herself. I was blown away - both that she had literally committed forgery on a check, and that it had worked even with the bold lineout through most of the amount. \n\nI called her and she acted, as always, like she had done absolutely nothing wrong. She told me that she needed it for taxes (though according to my little sister who still lives with her, she \"bought clothes like crazy\" around the time the check was cashed).\n\nMy father in law is a fraud inspector and he assures me that this was, in fact, a \"very illegal thing to have done\" but told me that pressing it with the bank would have serious legal consequences for my mom and instead I should just avoid dealing with her in the future.\n\nI am fortunately not in a spot where $250 is going to break me, but that isn't the point here. My mother has been stealing from me all my life, and this flagrant disregard for the law and my trust is the final straw. If she had called me and asked for the money, I would have given it to her. I've given her much more than this in the past. Why she felt the need to lie and steal is beyond me, and I feel like I just need to cut her out of my life. WIBTA?\n\nTLDR: My mom forged a check to steal money out of my bank account without telling me, and I want to cut her out of my life because this has been a pattern all my life. ",

      "description": "The title already makes me seem like a major cunt but hold on. Throw-away acc btw.\n\nA few weeks ago I broke up with gf and this specific moment came to mind. On our first date as an actual couple, we were talking while she was sitting on my lap. We were making out and talking about life when she starts to talk about her recent trip to disneyland, how it went and how good it was. It was all fine until she started to talk about a certain guy, saying he was \"the best one week bf I've ever had\" and that they wanted to date badly and would be a couple right now if it wasn't for the fact that he lived in another state.\nShe just kept talking about him and how good he was, how she liked him and that they dated for that week and still talked to this day.\n\nThis got me unconfortable for obvious reasons and I really disliked the whole conversation. I changed subject quickly after she stated that she still wanted to date him and didn't think much of it. She then grabbed my phone to see how many messages we have with each other via WhatsApp and stumbled upon a certain number from a friend. The number was saved only as \"Hummingbird\" so she clicked on it and saw that we had 15K messages with each other. She asked with jealous tone who it was, to which I answered \"Ah, it's just an old friend that I once had sex with in a bathroom, crazy stuff.\" She quickly changed subjects after that. So, AITA for doing this as a petty and harmless \"revenge\" on her for making me listen to how she would date and fuck another guy if he didn't live so far from her? It's been bugging me this whole time and I want to know, some people say I am, some don't but I really don't know anymore.",

      "description": "I apologize, this is quite long, there is a TL:DR at the end.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is this local restaurant in my city (located in Europe) that market itself as healthy, environmental friendly and serves organic food. I never went there, but I ordered some times and all the food came packed in plastic.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I decided to contact them and suggest to switch to a more environment friendly packages. They didn't answer, but I followed them and - surprisingly - I see on their facebook page that all their packages are made of compostable plastic. The posts stating this are even one year prior to my orders. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeird - I thought, at touch, it did feel as regular plastic. Also here, for example in supermarkets, organic plastic is full of labels screaming it is organic or compostable.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I decided to order one more time and examine carefully the packaging. A quick google search proved that it was indeed regular plastic, except for the sauce container, which was of compostable corn plastic. The main dish and beverage lid was regular plastic.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo during all this time (it went for 3-4 months) I contacted them on Messengers three times. I left a comment under a picture that I contacted them in private. I called the restaurant and addressed directly the issue, the waiter told me she can't really help me on this, that the owners live in a different country and I should try to contact them through Facebook or mail, without giving me any contact information to help me getting in touch. The reason why I never went in person is because they only open at lunch and I am at work at that time, and I don't really have time to walk around and complain.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I decided to forget about it and never order from there again, until yesterday, when I saw a post of theirs on Instagram, and still they were claiming the compostable containers.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn't stand it anymore, so I left a 1 star review on Facebook, with the picture of my last order proving my point.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSurprise surprise, this morning I get a message from the restaurant, the owner apologize saying he was sick and couldn't answer (yet could post continously on the feed), that they're sorry, sometimes bio plastic can be expensive, that's why they can't use it for everything, inviting me for a free lunch etc.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI politely answered that I don't need a lunch, I just want them to write the truth on their website and social media.  Also even if he was sick, someone was posting, even if it is an external Social Media Manager, they must know how to handle inquiries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few more back and forths where they say more excuses, such as the majority of restaurants only use plastic, that they are trying hard enought etc. But really all I want from them is to write the correct information.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the end of the day, a guy contacts me, apparently his gf works in this restaurant and is in charge of supplies and now is in big trouble because of me. Blames me for everything, says that as an enterpreneur myself I should support other businesses instead of bringing them down, that my words hurt an entire team and that I was unfair to their hard work, since they employ a lot of local people. Also he told me that they order the containers from their country and pay for them 5 times more than the normal ones and this should be appreciate, since here the majority don't even bother to recycle (I must add, the owners are from a richer European country and generally people from there tend to act as they are above the locals).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR After attempting to contact a restaurant privately several times to ask them to correct their misleading marketing about \"compostable\" packaging, AITA for outing them publicly and potentially causing troubles to the employees?",

I didn’t want to go through lecture smelling smoke, but I also didn’t want to blatantly change seats after they sat down. My friends were conveniently behind me and to the right, so I got up and engaged in conversation with them, moving one seat to the right, trying to make it look like it was just to talk to them.

At this point, we all know it’s not good for our health... I feel like it’s justified even to not cover for just moving. I wouldn’t say anything.

      "description": "I have these two friends, both males, that were dating for around 2 years, they moved in together (about 1 year into the relationship) and decided to try be as independent as possible and not ask for much financial help from family or friends.\n\nFast forward about half a year after they moved in together and they are both miserable and are constantly fighting over the smallest things. Their financial situation was getting worse and worse due to one of them losing their job as an IT admin and having to live off Centrelink (Australia welfare) until he could find another job. They loved each other and were happy when they first got together, but I just kept seeing them at each other's throats 24/7, one pushing for the other to get a job and the other one getting frustrated before snapping back.\n\nDuring small parties or lunches, they were constantly nipping at each other, making people uncomfortable due to the insults and how even the smallest thing started the arguments/insults. After a few months of this sort of behavior, I sat down with one of them at lunch and told them that I see their relationship becoming hostile and toxic, I suggested that they should give each other space and come back to it after a a couple weeks. \n\nA couple weeks pass by and everything seems fine the next time I visited them, until I made a small mention about how I got promoted after one of them asked how my job was going. They were straight back into it, arguments and insults that could stretch from West Australia to New South Wales if they were written down. After listening to them go at it for 30 minutes, I got up and left without saying a word. I received a few phone calls from them separately and suggested to one of them it be better to split up, instead of continuing their toxic relationship.\n\nTwo weeks go by and I get told via a (very angry and rude) Facebook message about how they split up and are now living apart from each other. The message read along the lines of \"why did you make my brother break up with he, they were happy, you should feel ashamed of yourself\" and was blocked from messaging before I could even reply. A few hours pass and the messages start rolling in, the rumors spreading like wildfire, some said that I was sleeping with one of them or that I was jealous and wanted to break them up so I had a chance of getting with one of them. I still talk to both of them and one of them is happy to be out of the relationship while the other is devastated and refuses to speak to me or his ex. I received these messages from family friends, school friends and even an old boyfriend of mine and I slowly started to believe I was the asshole in the situation and needed someone not from my group to tell me if I was or not, which led me here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAm I the asshole for suggesting that my friends should split up because of how toxic their relationship was and how it kept getting worse and worse without an end in sight?",

My dogs on leash, I’m very far away from the other dog and keeping an eye on everything. I turn my back to take a picture of some flowers, and next thing I know I hear this silent fighting and look to see that the other dog has run all the way across the park and nipped my dog in the butt playfully. Well my dog wasn’t paying attention either and took the nip as a bite and got mad. She didn’t bite back nor did she growl but I had to pick her up (she’s 85 lbs) to remove her from the situation because the other dog would not leave her be. I call out to the owners and they just stare at me. Finally the woman saunters over and tells me I shouldn’t bring an aggressive dog to the park. \n\nI didn’t have it in me at that point to explain anything to her. I feel like if I’m staying away and keeping my dog on a leash then you should respect my boundaries and my dogs boundaries and quickly come to get your pet if they stray from you.

      "description": "Here's the story. I (F) met this girl at college last semester. Let's call her Dani. I began talking to her because she started hanging out with some of my friends, after they met her at some student organization. Dani seemed nice, witty, smart, and was fun to hang out with. After a week or so, she added me on Facebook. After a month, Dani and I started opening up and talking about our hobbies, friends, and families both online and irl. One of the things that Dani got to know about me from our talks, was that my roommate and best friend, let's call him Vlad, lives with schizophrenia (this will be important later on). It seemed to me that she was an understanding, trustworthy person whom I could talk about a ton of things with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few weeks and she starts complimenting me (frequently) on my hair, eyes, freckles, etc. I tried to seem oblivious to her advances, given that I wasn't attracted to her, I only thought she was a cool person that I had just met, whom I could maybe become good friends with. I thought that if I didn't compliment her back, she would figure out that I wasn't interested in her in *that* way. Besides, she hadn't said directly that she was interested in me, so I couldn't really 'reject' her. The only sort of obvious hint was that she had asked me a couple of times if I thought Vlad was handsome. Both times I replied something along the lines of ''Yeah, why not''. \n\n\\[By then, Dani knew how important Vlad is in my life, as I had talked to her about taking him to the ER when he started feeling sick (he's asthmatic), or about a sleepless night trying to calm him down a bit after he saw some frightening shadow-like being coming towards him (visual hallucinations)\\]. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, Dani kept trying to make advances on me, without directly asking me out. I started to drop not-so-subtle hints that I was not interested in her (encouraging her to go on a date with that cute girl that she told me had asked her out) while also distancing myself from her, to avoid giving her mixed signals. I didn't ignore her messages nor ignored her in person. I just kept our conversations short and avoided talking about deeper subjects. \n\n**This is where Dani's odd behavior started.** One day, she hit me up on Facebook messenger with this message and a picture of a stuffed toy: ''*Hey, onesocktwobrains, guess what? I saw one of the campus counselors today, and I told her that I scream, shout at people and hit things out of nowhere, so she prescribed this toy to me, so I can bring it to class and hug it when I feel the need to scream or hit''.* It came across as strange to me that a therapist would prescribe stuffed toys for a 20 year-old to bring to college and hug, but ok. I just told Dani I hoped that this treatment plan would work well for her, without asking her for more details. The conversation ended there, but she pushed the topic whenever she could, and I just tried to brush it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, like a week or so later, Dani sends me a message that read: ''Are you free this Tuesday at 8? I need to talk to you about something. It's important''. I agreed to meet her at that time in campus, and turns out she wanted to talk to me about her feelings. Long story short, I told her I didn't feel the same way. She said that there were no hard feelings, and that she still wanted to keep talking to me. I made it clear that I think of her as a nice girl, but that I didn't want to be too close to her as friends either, that we were just too different (I didn't want to straight up tell her that I was a little creeped out and suspicious of her stuffed animal story).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the coming months after that, we've been messaging back and forth, intermittently.  To clarify, she was the one to always initiate contact, except when I wave and say hi if I see her around campus. I don't want to be rude to her, because I see her as a nice person, but I also don't want to feed any sense of closeness between her and me. We make small talk via Facebook, and she seems overly interested in Vlad and how he is doing. She says she wants to meet him and hang out with him and me at our apartment. Everything seems innocuous but I feel something is off. Dani always turns the conversation around and makes it gravitate towards her *therapy stuffed animal*, her frequent urge to scream and kick out of nowhere (although my friends who hang out with her much more than me, told me they've never witnessed one of these episodes). And suddenly she has started speaking about allegedly having hallucinations too, just like Vlad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after that (like two weeks ago), Dani got fed up with the college counselor because she wouldn't diagnose her with anything besides stress (her words). She eventually found a psychiatrist who diagnosed her with an anxiety disorder, and put her on meds. Since then, she makes sure to mention her meds every time she finds an opportunity. For example: I tell her that I'm stuck on traffic, and she replies that she can't drive because she's on meds. She sends me pictures of her prescription, to complain about how she can't find her meds at the pharmacy. I feel like she is pushing the topic on purpose, no matter how much I try to talk about something else. \n\n**Yesterday**, I got a bit too tired of it, and told her that I'm not qualified nor comfortable to give her advice about her condition, and that I would appreciate it if she stopped talking to me about her mental health, because I really don't think I can be of much help regarding that. She went bonkers and called me insensitive and selfish, among other things. She topped off her rant saying that she wasn't attracted to me anymore, as if that had something to do with the main issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, I haven't replied to her messages. I don't even know what to make of the whole situation, given that I don't quite believe her stories of her screaming and kicking episodes, nor the tale of the therapeutic stuffed animal. It's also a big coincidence that she began having visual hallucinations shortly after learning that Vlad had them. She says she has psychosis even though the meds she was prescribed are for anxiety. I have also spoken to her closest friend from college and explained the situation to her, and she told me that Dani has never spoken to her about having these issues. Why would she share sensible information with me about her mental health but not with her closest friend?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like an asshole for thinking she is faking mental illness in order to win my sympathy, but I'm starting to think this is the case. I really just want to ghost her without providing further explanation, because when I tried to explain how I felt with her oversharing, she just shifted the blame on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I feel like an asshole because I believe that a girl I met 4 months ago, who used to have a crush on me is faking mental illness to win my sympathy. My roommate and best friend has schizophrenia. I take care of him. After learning this, she started to make every conversation about her mental health issues, and I tried to explain to her that I can't help her with that, and that I would appreciate if she stopped talking to me about it. She called me selfish and insensitive. We are nothing near to close friends and I think I'm not obliged to her in any way, so I want to ghost her and forget about her drama.",

      "description": "My friend has been living with her boyfriend for 5+ years, they have dogs and cats and are a cute little family. Well they got engaged, which came as a total surprise to me, as neither of them have ever indicated (around me at least) that marriage was something they ever wanted. They’ve really seemed just happy with where they’re at, and that’s great. When she told me, I was surprised and excited, told her congratulations, ooh’d and aah’d over her ring, etc. That was around Thanksgiving, and she and I were catching up at a White Elephant party when I asked her if they’ve looked at venues or thought of a date. She then told me that they don’t know when they’re getting married, but it’s not really anywhere on the horizon. Like, literally no idea if it’s one year from now or twenty. They’re not waiting on anything, they’re just not too concerned about when they’ll get married.\n\nNow, long engagements are whatever, I understand it can take a long time for things to line up and get everything in order. But to me, if you get “engaged” without even an actual intention of getting married, it means little to nothing and you’re basically just bf/gf with a ring. But OF COURSE I keep this to myself.\n\nNow this doesn’t affect me AT ALL, as she and I are definitely not close enough that I think I would be asked to be in the wedding party or anything, but probably invited to pre-wedding events such as a bridal shower. However some mutual friends started talking about planning said pre-wedding events, and I guess something about my uncertainty about when would be a good time for a shower (soon after engagement vs closer to the wedding once it’s decided) came off as “meh”about their engagement.\n\nLet me state again that at no point have I shown anything but enthusiasm for my friend, but my real feelings about it do actually lie closer to “meh, nothing’s really changed”, so AITA?",

      "description": "The other day, I was talking with cousin over the phone about Smash Bros, and he was very vocal about how much he hated it. He talked about how toxic the community was, how bad the game mechanics were, and then he expanded how bad games have become so bad because there's so easy and shorter than before since unlike with old games, you don't have to start the entire game over again with newer games if you lose a life. He went on to tell me for the 5th time that whenever he plays a game, he makes sure to reset the entire thing (meaning erasing all save files and resetting all options)whenever he loses because otherwise it wouldn't be \"perfect\". I told him games are like this now because nowadays people don't have the time nor patience to dedicate hours to playing games like they used to, so forcing players or yourself to restart the entire thing is just really impractical. He then went on to tell me how he can't have it any other way because God calls him a loser if he doesn't reset the game every time he loses. I then went on to ask \"Maybe you're wrong about this, God isn't telling you anything, and you're telling yourself this?\" He then said \"I'm a fucking Toontown noob, I will never admit I'm wrong.\" To this, I said \"okay then, bye.\" and hung up abruptly because what he said really bothered me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like what I did here was rude since I should be more considerate of someone who's clearly angry over something, but at the same time he's given me similar rants for the past year and they haven't seem to change much so I wanted to give some kind of negative reinforcement.

I was in a BST group on Facebook and someone recommended one that we hadnt used before and it was a running a Valentine's day special - so I thought, what the hey? \n\nDropped him off at the parlor, me and our kids got dinner and then went to Chuck E Cheese to wait out the hour massage.\n\nHe arrives a little later and the first thing he says is \"Im gonna need a blow job tonight.\" I smiled and said \"Was she sexy?\" (Im bi. I dont mind if he looks.) And he said no and then told me that he thought I knew I signed him up for a tantric massage. Which is basically massaging around (and on) his genitals to give him a semi and then massage elsewhere to let him go flaccid. Even though the ad (https://imgur.com/a/cyYX5aH) listed no such \"treatment\".\n\nI was stunned and didn't quite know what to say. Then he told me about what she said when he got in there. \"Oh your wife signed you up for this? She must be pretty awesome.\" \"Some guys have to relieve themselves in the middle of the procedure. Just let me know and Ill get you a towel.\"\n\nHe went along with it because he thought its what I signed him up for. We have a good strong relationship, and theres a very slim potential that I could have signed him up for it. We'd been in seperate polyamorous relationships in the past, we watch porn together.\n\nWe get home, he shows me the massages she performed and I pretend to be ok.

      "description": "Yesterday I struggled through the work day and afterschool activities with a migraine. I havent had on in quite awhile so it really took me off guard and I did not handle it well. As I tossed and turned trying to sleep last night I realized the migraine is most definitely stress related. I then tossed and turned in my mind about whether I should take the day off tomorrow (now today). At 5 am I got up to send my boss an over thought out text and planned on going right back to sleep. Of course then the alarm clock in my bedroom goes off to wake me up for work (to which I just called in to) which then woke up my toddler crying. \n\nBut its all okay, I'll just get the kids up and off to school/daycare early and then I can enjoy an almost full day of well overdue alone time. \n\nThen my phone rings. It's the automated  phone line from my kids school. They've left a voicemail.  Another snow day. That means no school OR daycare for my kids. And that means... No school for my friends kid. \n\nJust as I have processed that my day off alone has become the exact opposite of what I had planned, a message from my friends spouse pops up in our group chat damning the school for closing yet again and asking what our plans were for our kids. Which is an inadvertent way of asking if we are staying home with our kids and if we will keep their kid too. \n\nThe school has had at least a dozen 2-hour delays and snow days combined this year so far. Each one of them that we were asked to keep their kid we did. No questions asked. They work 8-5 jobs and didn't have any time to take off work. My spouse and I have had a little bit more flexible work days lately so we didn't mind helping when we could. We also understand that making childcare arrangements on the spot like that is hard, add in the fact that they don't have any family around here to help.\n\nExcept today. I just wanted to be left alone and recover from my migraine in peace and quiet. I can still recover some it by being a bad parent and letting my kids stare at a screen all day. But if I said yes then the third kid in the mix will change the whole game. Kids will be kids, and kids will be rowdy and needy. \n\nI decided not to respond to the message until my spouse was awake to talk about it. In the two hours that passed my friends spouse called and texted my spouses several times. We agreed I was justified in saying no to watching their kid today, especially since I already am tomorrow after school while they work.

      "description": "Ok, so long story short, my boyfriend lives with me, he's autistic, and it's taken some work to just get him able to live on his own. That said I love him and am willing to put in that work because I know what it's like to suddenly be an adult and realize you neither want to be, nor do you really know how.\n\nThat said currently due to transportation issues, I work and he can't (no public transport and we're not in walking distance of anything)\n\nSo as a trade-off I have asked him to assume a fair bit of the domestic duties (I cook and do our laundry, most everything else is supposed to be his job). To put it plainly, recently he just HASNT, he spends his days playing PS3 games or on the PC, today he started cleaning up, and I'm just LETTING him, it's my day off.",

      "description": "I am quite concerned about my privacy especially in relation to technology, my parents are not.  This has caused quite a few disagreements between us, and the biggest issue they have with me is that I hide or turn away from them whenever I enter my password in their presence. It's not that I don't trust them so much as it's become second nature. My dad yells at me whenever we're doing anything together on the computer if I turn the screen away or ask him to look away from him whenever I log into one of *my* accounts (especially the latter). Basically, his reasoning is that he sees this as me wasting (I assume his) time by \"making a simple thing complicated\", mostly because he doesn't really believe in taking extra security measures online. The thing is, that wasn't my intent at all. I don't suspect that he will log into my accounts without my permission, and it's just instinct at this point, and it makes me feel more comfortable. It literally takes maybe one extra second to do, so I don't think much time is being wasted.\n\nI should also mention that I am over 18, so I feel they don't have any excuse to know my passwords anyway.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?",

He’s mentally abusive and i don’t want to be around that type of person. For background on how he’s mentally abusive, he’s come to her house in the middle of the night and has taken pictures of peoples cars in her driveway, has drove by her house to see who she’s with (if she isn’t with him), or to see if she’s home if she doesn’t reply to him in a timely manner. He’s also accused her of cheating, repeatedly calls her a cheater (even though she doesn’t talk to the opposite sex because it makes him uncomfortable). He’s messaged me saying some prettttty mean stuff about her too. They had broken up for a couple days and literally not even a day of them being broken up, went on tinder. When he got caught he said he made it, but didnt use it because he knew how much she meant to him... even though he liked multiple girls on there. He also asks to go through her phone, isolates her from her friends, gets upset if she hangs out with others without him there. For a little insight on my friend, she thinks everything he does is perfectly ok, because it means “he loves and cares about her sooooo much”. I don’t specifically like him, and I’ve told her before but I’ve given bim chances because she’s my bestfriend and I want her happy. But he’s too mentally exhausting, and too mentally/emotionally abusive I don’t want to be around him. I feel like the asshole though because she gets upset when i say i don’t want to be around him. Her birthday is coming up and he’s gonna be there, which makes me feel like a bigger asshole because it’s her birthday! I want to be there but being around him is too much. AITA? \n\n",

My GF and Blake still know each other and see each other in person and wave to each other, but never really talk anymore. \n\n\nI've always been paranoid with Blake and my GF still talking in secret since she's always mentioning him and saying things about him on purpose to piss me off, but she also always promises that they stopped talking and never do anything anymore. 5 months later today, she comes up to me and asks me if over the summer while I'm gone, she can hangout with him since he was always nice to her and was a lot of fun. She's promising me that nothings going to happen between them and that they're just going to be walking around and hanging out outdoors. This is a big no from me, but she keeps begging me saying she won't do anything with him and that I should trust her. All of her friends are saying I should trust her, but all of my guy friends are saying to not let her hangout with him. \n\nIm super stumped at what to do. I told my GF to please not talk to him or hangout with him and that any other guy is fine since I can trust all of her other guy friends since I know them closely, but don't know Blake that closely. \n\nMaybe I'm being petty, but I really don't want her hanging out with her EX alone over the summer.",

While there my girlfriend starts feeling like she's going to be sick, I go in to the girl's bathroom with her and start taking her gauze out when a kroger employee comes in to use the bathroom and starts yelling at me for being in the girl's bathroom. To prevent a scene and diffuse the situation we walk out of the bathroom and go to a water fountain outside the bathroom. The kroger employee walks out and gives me the stink eye, as I start changing her gauze she passes out and faceplants in to the floor. People start staring and I hurriedly get her up and conscious and she says she needs to puke. I take her in to the bathroom, and as I start to go in the bathroom with my girlfriend the same employee comes and yells at me again, except this time I am entirely ignoring her running around trying to get paper towels frantically. (I am 20, and she is 18, we have never been in this situation and have absolutely no idea what im doing) whilst I run around like a psycho this employee continues to yell at me. \"Sir you can't be in here, sir this is the womans bathroom\" \"sir she can be in here but you cant\" This is while my girlfriend is holding on to the toilet for dear life, this woman gives no fucks. I've fucking had it, I turn around with bloodshot eyes and scream along the lines of \"THEN CALL THE FUCKING COPS, SHE JUST PASSED OUT FACE FIRST AND IM NOT FUCKING LEAVING\" followed by some other choice words, none of which attack her personally. But this employee is RELENTLESS, she agrees to look after my girlfriend but I am still told to leave the bathroom. My girlfriend explains when I left the employee just stood a good distance from her and watched her, a simple \"you ok?\" after a couple minutes was all this employee offered her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 minutes pass of me pacing outside the bathroom, more angry than I physically knew I could be.

      "description": "There’s a lot of backstory to this. Over the last 30 years, my mother has been married and divorced 5 times. Every time, she rushed into it and hardly knew the guy, and things blew up within a year or two. The last 2 marriages were in my teen years, and both husbands were abusive. In both cases, she let a guy that I had met once or twice move into our home after dating a very short period of time (3-4 months), which, as a teenage girl, made me extremely uncomfortable. Once she moved us all the way across the county. I met the guy one time before we moved. In all cases, I was vocal about how I felt, but every time she told me about how “this time is different”.\n\nWhen things inevitably crashed and burned, I had to be the adult and help get us out safely. It was really traumatizing to have to literally pack up and leave my home while my moms abusive husband was gone for a few hours, or to try to get him to let go of her during a fight. \n\nI’m 26 now, and my moms last divorce was 2 years ago. It was a really shitty one. I figured she had learned her lesson, and she had sworn off dating (which she had done multiple times before).\n\nBack in February/March I noticed she was acting different. Very upbeat, almost manic. This was definitely concerning because it’s usually the first stage of a new relationship. She was talking about her boss a lot, which was weird. After a few weeks, I put 2 and 2 together and asked her what was going on. She told me that they were just spending time together but nothing official was happening. He was separating from his wife of 30 years. \n\nFast forward to June. She sent me a text that she had sold her house and that she and her boss were moving in together. I was disappointed but not surprised. They had been dating 3-4 months at this point, so pretty much right on track for her. Of course, “this time is different” and so on. I politely told her that I hope everything works out for her, but that I wasn’t ready to meet him yet and I would let her know when I felt ready. She was okay with that. \n\nIn August, my SO and I moved to a new city because I got a new job. It was really exciting for us and we decided to have a casual “housewarming” for family and some friends just so they could come check out the new place. My mom invited her boyfriend without asking me, and when I told her that I didn’t feel comfortable having him there, she got upset and didn’t talk to me for weeks. \n\nA week ago, my SO proposed (yay!) and obviously everyone is super excited.\n\nNow, my mother is trying to force me to meet her boyfriend, probably because she wants him involved in the wedding.\n\nI absolutely don’t want to meet this guy any time soon. He’s still legally married FFS. I’m trying to be as polite and respectful as possible, but my mom will not drop the issue. Am I the asshole for wanting to stay out of her relationship for once?",

      "description": "So to give a little background, I am working 2 jobs while getting ready for my wedding (woot woot) one of them is a kitchen job that is my main job and then I work at a gas station/subway on the side.\n\nThis story will take place at the gas station. I try and stay out of everything, I try to just be a good worker and keep my head down but one of my coworkers let’s call her Jane, is so toxic that nobody ever wants to work with her. \n\nSo the other day I came into work and Jane is already there along with our GM and another worker, who leaves after I’ve clocked in, within five minutes of being there Jane is already talking about how she’d been “ripped a new one” for being 4 minutes late. (Our GM is pretty strict and everyone knows this) I just nod my head and get to work this isn’t the first time she’s bad mouthed him and I just tend to ignore it. So I start working on stocking shelves and other things like that while Jane is on the register, GM has gone outside to make a phone call or something so I guess Jane felt save to start talking about him. She straight up start shit talking about him to some random customer! I couldn’t believe it. As I said before I just want to do the best I can and stay out of trouble, but I felt obligated to tell the manager what happened and he said he’d have to take the issue to corporate. Am I the ass for telling him what happened? Should I have just not said anything.",

      "description": "The building I work in has a small gym. Its nothing fancy; there are a few treadmills and ellipticals, a weight rack, some weight machines, etc. It is a pretty basic spot, and its not widely used; It is free and open to anyone who works in the building, but as far as I can tell, traffic is really limited to like 15-20 people a week.\n\nHere's the thing, there is no cleaning supplies anywhere in the room. There is a sink, but no paper towels. There are no towels, spray bottles, rags, ANYTHING. Now I'm familiar with gym etiquette - clean the equipment that you use, but what are you supposed to do when there are no supplies? So when I'm done exercising, I just leave. I don't wipe down anything, I don't disinfect, because there is nothing to clean WITH. \n\nThis one woman is also a regular there, and I see her almost ever night, always running on the same treadmill. Apparently, she brings her own cleaning stuff, clorox wipes or sometimes paper towels and some sort of spray, and she will wipe down her equipment with it. And she will shoot me really evil glares when I leave my equipment after using it. Recently, she has been staring at me and scoffing when I'm done walk away. Its getting to the point where I can swear I can hear her mutter under her breath about how I'm so rude for leaving the equipment dirty.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Yes I'm leaving the equipment all sweaty, but there isn't anything for me to clean it with, and I'm not about to go purchase clorox wipes on my own to clean equipment that like, 20 other people max in the entire building use.\n\nTL;DR Small gym at work doesn't have any cleaning supplies, so I don't clean the equipment I use. A woman is being really passive aggressive about me not cleaning the equipment I am using.",

      "description": "This just happened.  My brother and I live together.  Almost everything we split 50/50.  Our place has two refrigerators, one in the kitchen (the main one) and another in the basement.  I'm trying very hard to lose weight and the best way that works for me is to not see any sugary junk food around, otherwise it haunts my mind.  So, I moved all my food into the basement fridge and informed my brother about this.  I tell him the main fridge is all his and that I have a goal to stop opening or looking inside of it.  He typically has ice cream, pudding, donuts, and similar stuff in there.  The basement fridge is slightly more inconvenient.  Ownership of the fridges are also split 50/50, so he seemed cool with that. \n\nYesterday, I cooked whole wheat spaghetti that's been sitting around forever.  I told my brother he's free to eat some.  Afterwards, I finish cleaning up and I put the leftovers into the basement fridge.\n\nThe next day, I open the basement fridge and see the spaghetti is missing.  I ask him if it's in the main fridge.  He says it is.  I ask, \"Could you take it out for me?\"  He says no.  I'm flustered by this but I ask again politely, \"Please, bro.  I'm trying to take the fridge thing seriously.\"  Reluctantly, he gets up and goes to the main fridge.  He's giving me shit and calling me childish the entire time.  Im waiting around the corner because I dont want to see inside the main fridge.  He opens it and holds the door.  \"Take it,\" he says with his arms up and eyes wide like I'm crazy.  I explain that I don't want to even look inside, but I suspect he's trying to test my resolve or something.\n\nHe refuses to take it out and I just explode at the top of my lungs, \"TAKE IT OUT!!\"  I was actually a bit shocked about how loud I was.  I'm usually quiet and reserved for years at a time.  Anyway, he takes the spaghetti out, gives it to me, and then flips out on me saying I'm crazy and childish and that he doesn't give a fuck about my goal.  We argued so hard that I felt lightheaded and he said he might throw up.  It was intense.\n\nI seek wisdom.\n\n AITA?\n\nI want to add that we both have plans to move out on our own in the very near future, and we are usually not in each other's way about things.",

      "title": "AITA for being frustrated with a friend for constantly bailing on DnD for poor time management skills and for his attitude?",
      "description": "Disclaimer: Every person mentioned here, including myself, are second-year college students (19-20), and as the title says, this involves Dungeons and Dragons, so if you need me to explain any of the DnD jargon, I can happily explain (though hopefully the sentiment is apparent without too many definitions).\n\nAlso, writing on mobile at 3 AM, so please bear with me. I apologize in advance for my many-word-itis. **TL;DR at bottom.**\n\n\nSo, as a semi-novice DnD player myself, I thought it would be fun to kick of my Dungeon-master career with my group of friends at college who’ve never played before. We sit down one night, I help them craft out their characters, and that’s about all we have time for. Cool, no worries. \n\nFor the first couple of sessions, I spit out some random one-off adventures, like they have to break out of prison, fight some goblins, investigate a spooky drug mansion, etc. It seems as though everybody is having a good time, and so am I. I enjoy seeing them have fun in their characters.\n\nIt’s important to note at this point that as a group we did not have what many DMs call a “session zero” — effectively a pre-campaign sit-down where we discuss our expectations for playing together - how heavily we role-play, how we want to schedule it, and, most importantly, attendance. My thought was that, since it was a modest group, we’d schedule for when we would all be there, because I thought we were all equally invested in the game and were willing to make time for it with our college schedules.\n\nSo I decided after the first few sessions that I wanted to do a real campaign, like a fully-blown months-long, continent-traversing campaign with evil gods, cults, and the whole shebang. As you can imagine, this takes a lot of planning, determining the plot points A through Z and how the characters will hop from point to point, creating NPCs to fill the world, creating the environment and buildings, and all the rest. If you don’t know, rest assured it’s a lot.\n\nJust as we’re picking up steam in the campaign is when this whole AITA situation comes in.\n\nBasically, one of the players continuously gives excuses for why he can’t play the game. It’s things like “I have a party I’m going to,” or, “I have an exam/paper I need to study for/work on,” or others. The former is a matter of priorities, which I will get to later, but it’s the latter that frustrates me to no end.\n\nYou see, I can understand if you have an exam or paper to work on. There’s even another person in the group using this excuse this week, and I completely understand, as she’s overworked and stressed and wants to do well. That’s fine, I get it.\n\nBut this guy, he’s a procrastinator like you’ve never seen. Like, writing a 10-page final paper the day that it’s due. Putting off work until the last ten minutes. Not reading assigned readings for his classes and acting like he had (this last part doesn’t really matter to me but helps paint the picture of him). \n\nSo I already don’t have a speck of pity for him complaining about papers or giving me excuses for not being able to play DnD, but then he has the audacity to send a Snapchat to our group the day before DnD was scheduled  of him going on a trip to the nearby harbor (about a 20 minute bus ride) “because he was bored” for the afternoon, when he had cited an essay due Sunday as the reason he couldn’t play with us.\n\nRightfully (or so I thought), I was pissed. At this point it seems clear to me that he has shitty time management skills and clearly would rather go (alone) on a casual trip to the harbor than finish other work early to spend time with his friends playing a fun game.\n\nTo put icing on this metaphorical cake, when I originally asked him why he couldn’t join us, his response was word-for-word “I think the answer to that is pretty obvious lol”, and after his harbor escapade we mention getting dinner and he says “I’m getting pho with [insert club group he’s in] because you all never want to get pho with me.” At this point, I’m internally fuming, because there was such an air of apathy for the game that I care about, that I put a lot of effort into making fun for him and the others, and I just couldn’t stand it, and then he berates US for not wanting to do something HE wants to do.\n\nSo, in typical me fashion, I vent about it to my friends over dinner, saying that he was being disrespectful of me and the effort that I put into this game, and that he clearly doesn’t want to play and should just tell me, and that I have no pity for him if he can’t be smart about how he spends his time.\n\nI’m immediately met with arguments from my other friend about how I’m overreacting, that I can’t control how he spends his time, that I’m being over dramatic, that if DnD isn’t his priority I shouldn’t care, and that I should just let it go (I will say it was the second time I’ve ranted about this particular issues to them in two days). Meanwhile my girlfriend, who hates confrontation, sits there awkwardly and eventually leaves the table early, telling me later in a phone call that “I just don’t understand why it’s such a big deal to you.”\n\nSo they basically say that I’m a dick for being frustrated at this guy for having a shit excuse for not playing DnD and having an even shittier way of delivering that to me. I thought his attitude was super disrespectful to me and my hobby, and I’m pissed that he doesn’t give the same consideration and sacrifice that the rest of the group gives to play the game that, as far as I’m aware, everybody enjoys playing.\n\nSo, I apologize for the long rant (make that third time I’ve ranted about this), and I humbly ask,\n\nAITA?\n\n**TL;DR — Friend says that he has a paper to write as an excuse to miss DnD, but then turns around and sends Snapchats of him going on an afternoon (~4 hour) trip “because he’s bored”. Also responds to question asking him why he can’t go with an attitude of “that’s a dumb question and you’re an idiot for asking it lol”. I rant about it twice to my other friends at dinner, but I’m the jerk for trying to control his time and being over dramatic over just a game.**",

      "description": "TL:DR at bottom\n\nSo my best friend (20M, let’s call him Mike) and I are about a 2 hour drive away from each other because we go to different colleges. We see each other about once a month during school and much more during the summer. He recently met my new friends from college and Mike is CONVINCED they’re assholes, however, I have been hanging out with them for 6 months extensively and not once have I seen a shred of assholiness from them. \n\nI’ve tried rationalize with Mike and truly see things from his perspective, and what I think it ultimately boils down to is Mike takes my college friends jokes seriously when in no way are they meant to be taken in a serious context. Of course this is subjective, but I don’t think it’s hard to see that the jokes aren’t meant to be offensive at all. \n\nThe issue is Mike now associated me with my college friends and says I’ve changed in dramatic ways and essentially have become someone different than the person he became friends with. Yes, of course I have changed after spending many hours with my college friends, but nothing that should create a rift between Mike and I. \n\nMike regularly points out faults he sees in me, and God forbid he ever admits any of his own faults. It’s very one sided when it comes to criticism, but when i do speak up and ask him “could it be possible that you’re in the wrong here?” (Of course with more tact and specifics) he gets defensive and even more critical and it turns into an argument. Suddenly it’s my fault we aren’t on the same page.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning, Mike prides himself in his “instincts” always being correct so if he feels a certain way about something (even if he knows nothing about the topic), it’s indisputable fact to him and he will take his claims to the grave with him. He does not trust anyone’s subjective input but his own and it’s causing heaps of issues and I simply cannot give ground when I know without any doubt that I am in the right. \n\nThis whole thing is putting a massive stress on our friendship and I think I have identified the issue as Mike not even considering being wrong, especially when it comes to subjective interpretations. \n\nHow do I go about this? How do I tell someone who thinks they know everything that they aren’t always correct? Any input is immensely appreciated. \n\nTL;DR: after moving 2 hours away for college, my best friend for years has become very critical of me and thinks he is in the right no matter the situation",

      "title": "AITA for turning my lamp on to get dressed while my roommates are still sleeping?",
      "description": "I live in a small dorm room with two others. I have a class three days a week at 8am, so I get up at 7am to brush my teeth/wash my face/get dressed etc. Today was the first day of my new class schedule, so I woke up at 7am, left the room to brush my teeth and wash my face, came back and turned on the lamp in my desk. Because of how the room is set up, in order to avoid the light, anybody in bed would have to turn over to face the wall. I kept my lamp on for light as I got dressed, got ready to go, and then turned off my lamp and left the room. My light was on for maybe 20- 30 mins total. \n\nWhen I got back from class, both of roommate were gone. When one of them came back, they said ‘Hey, can you not turn on your lamp in the morning anymore? It wakes me up every time and I can’t fall back asleep.’ Normally, I would completely understand and apologize, and work to find another solution. However, this roommate consistently keeps their lamp on their desk on until 3am, keeping my other roommate and I awake. \n\nI told her that I need the light for getting dressed and for getting ready at my desk, and she said ‘you have a flashlight on your phone, just use that!’. She kept talking over me when I was trying to tell her that I didn’t think that was going to work, so finally I said that I would try it the next time I had class, but wasn’t going to guarantee anything. She then said maybe I could look into getting a dimmer lamp instead of the one provided for us by the school in the dorms.  \n\nThis roommate isn’t very considerate of either of us that live in this room (giggling until 2am, when all of the lights are off and we are both clearly trying to sleep, refusing to take out the trash, etc), and we have done a lot to accommodate her sleeping schedule. She goes to bed very early in the morning (anywhere from 4am- 6am), then will sleep until the afternoon, once sleeping in until 5pm! During this time, I make sure I am keeping quiet as much as possible, I don’t open the blinds or turn on any over head lights, but my desk lamp if I’m working at my desk. When she says ‘it wakes me up every time’ I know she means when I turn my light on around 9am on weekends or days where I don’t have early classes too. I don’t think it’s fair to ask me to get dressed in the dark, or to sit in the dark until she wakes up so I can finally do something. \n\nThe school year is almost done, and despite this, she’s a very dear friend of mine and I don’t want to cause a huge problem if I’m being an asshole. I just want to see if I am causing a problem, in which case I will work to finds another solution. AITA?",

      "description": "For starters, I’m in a state where pot is still illegal. That’s a big one for me. Secondly, I’ve never smoked. I grew up being taught how terrible it was, and how it was a drug, and you just don’t do it. I’ve formed into that thinking and believing it. I hate the smell of it. I hate the stories of “oh we were so fucking high and this happened.” I’m probably just a prude. So here’s what happened. \n\nBoyfriend works where there’s drug tests. He’s probably getting a new job which is a great opportunity for him, and I really couldn’t be more excited for him. However, it’s a job that he won’t be drug tested. He used to be a big smoker back in the day before he got his current job. Talks about how much he loved it and it helped with his anxiety and stuff. \n\nI told him that I’m excited for him, but yes I am really paranoid and nervous that he’s gonna be this pothead again, and I’m just not attracted to that. So we started bickering about it and I finally just told him “do what you want, babe and if I decide that I don’t want to date a pothead, then I will leave.” \n\nThis infuriated him because I would throw everything we have away over him “occasionally” smoking. I told him it’s just my morals and standards and I was raised to believe it’s a drug and I don’t want to be with someone who does drugs all the time. \n\nWe never agreed on anything anytime we tried to talk it out and ended up going to bed angry with each other. Honestly, I feel bad like I’m preventing him from doing something that he enjoys and could potentially help his anxiety. But I just can’t get over how gross and unattractive I think it all is. So, AITA for not wanting to date a pothead?",

      "description": "To be up front about this, I’m still frustrated by this situation. Due to this, I’m genuinely not sure whose at fault here. \n\nContext: I’ve been friends with this girl for a little over a year now. We met at the local community college. She’s becoming one of my closest friends. We agreed If either of us needed to talk day or night, we could call one another. \n\nWhat happened: I’ve been having a really rough weekend. There was a lot of family drama and it wore me out. I needed to talk/vent it out with someone. I texted her asking if she could talk sometime tonight. She said she was going to crash tonight after work. So I texted another friend to see if they could talk. Sadly, they couldn’t. Since those were the two people I felt comfortable talking about this kinda thing with, I decided to cry it out and go to bed. \n\nI get a text from her wanting to know if I’m okay before she goes to bed. I answer no. We text back and forth for a couple minutes. She seeming distant at best. Since we agreed we could call and talk to eachother at any time if needed, I texted her asking to talk on the phone. I explained how alone I felt, how I needed to talk to someone and no one was available, and that I was crying. She responded with “I’m sorry. I’m going to bed.” \n\nMy opinion: This honestly makes me upset. If she needed to talk to me, I would’ve called her right then. In the moment, I needed someone to tell me everything will be okay. We didn’t have talk for hours. Ten minutes would hav been fine. Yet, she refused and made me feel even more alone. I understand if she wasn’t in the best place to handle this kinda conversation, but why communicate that? This honestly hurt my feeling a lot. \n\nTLDR: Friend and I agreed if either of us needs to talk day or night, we can always call one another. I legitimately need to talk to her because of how alone I’m feeling. She, fully aware of how I felt, won’t talk to me. ",

      "description": "So a little bit of backstory, I guess. Me and my girlfriend of about two days had made out a couple times before we started dating but nothing too far because I wanted to wait until we were actually dating until anything more happened. So after a couple of days into our relationship I finally made a move and went down on her. I don’t mind too much if they’re not shaved down there, as it’s enjoyable either way, but I do have a preference towards shaving bc it feels a bit cleaner. After the event, I told her I thought it was important to communicate about things and preferences in bed, and asked her if she would ever consider shaving down there.\n\nThe mood immediately changed and she became pretty angry saying that she took offense to me telling her what to do with her body and that it was her right to do what she pleased with it. I agreed with her and tried pointing out that it was just a suggestion and I didnt mind too much either way, but I did have a preference, but she still seemed pretty upset.\n\nLater, she texted me saying that it was “rude” and “disrespectful” that I had asked her to shave especially after the first time I had seen her naked/done stuff. \n\nI guess I can see why suggesting it could make her uncomfortable, but I think it’s important to have these talks and open communication especially about sex.  So AITA?\n\nTLDR: first time I went down on my gf I asked if she would consider shaving and she didn’t like that",

      "description": "Sorry if the formatting is messed up, I'm writing this on my phone. Also, It's gonna be long, because I wanna be as accurate as possible - so saddle on for the ride.\n\nFor context, I am a 27 years old PhD student, and I work 2 jobs( some days I work 11+ hours). Money is not tight, yet not that glamorous either. My father is older than average (75+ yr old), and has several health conditions, few of which he is refusing to treat. He is not disabled, but not that able to leave the house often, either. He lives with my mother, who is about 15 years younger than him and still working.\n\nRight now I live about 5-7 mins walking distance away from my parents (important). I'm in the situation where I can't afford my current rent anymore, so I had to find a cheaper place to live. The one i did is a tad further, 20 mins walking distance away (or 15 by subway).\n\nMy parents are not ok with the place I found, and are currently trying their best to pursuade me to move into the same building they live in. They even offered to pay a third of my rent and all my bills.\n\nI politely refused, and here's why: they are extremely needy people. Also, they have no sense of boundaries. Also, also, my mother is very controlling.\n\nHere are a few examples: \n\n(1) if they know I'm at home, they will randomly call me to go buy them things from nearby (e.g., cigarettes, bread), even though they are perfectly able to do it themselves; (2) they will insist on me visiting them daily if possible, no matter how busy I am, and get mad if I don't do so \"because I'm only a few minutes away, why is it that hard?!\"; (3) they ask me to show up in person if they wanna tell me stuff that can easily be discussed over the phone \"because I'm not that far away\"; (4) my mom generally likes knowing what I do and who I do it with, and is always criticizing the way i live my life - not sleeping enough, not eating right, not hanging out with good enough people, not having the right gf, not spending my money right, and so on. The only way I can do damage control on this is having my own space, that she can't access whenever she pleases.\n\nNow, for the tricky part - my dad has severe health anxiety and agoraphobia, both of which he refuses to treat. I've tried all I could to get him treatment, to no success. If i make appointments, he ghosts. If I try to educate him (I'm a psychologist btw), he doesn't listen. If I bring him self-help materials, he doesn't use them... you get the point. Because of this, he is really scared to be alone and craves constant company. This is his main reason for me moving in - so he can *quote* \"easily knock on my door whenever he needs help with something\".\n\nNow, I'm torn. I really want to help him, he's my dad and my hero, and I love him a lot. But I also wanna have some independence and be able to live my own life, without being ar my parents' beck and call, and without being financially dependent on them with my rent and bills.\n\nThis is why I very politely refused. Now my dad is really angry at me. AITA?\n",

      "description": "One of my friends has been dating this guy from her church for almost two and a half years without telling her parents. We live in a very small christian town and her parents are incredibly religious, so they wouldn't approve of her dating anyone, nevermind her current bf. He's 22, and she's 17. The age of consent here is 16, so their relationship is currently legal but it wasn't when they first started dating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently broke up with my bf, which caused issues in our friend group because some people took his side and some people took mine. She took his and refused to talk to me. I was really angry because I thought we were close, so I sent her mom a message on fb about her bf. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's really mad at me because her parents want to go to the police to break them up. I feel kind of bad because they seemed happy but I think it's her fault for getting involved in my relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I told my friend's parents about her relationship as revenge and now she's furious with me.

      "description": "Context: I live in some townhomes that are independently owned, but many are owned and rented out. We rent and the people next door rent as well (from different landlords). The HOA rules state that no dogs are allowed. We got an exception because I have a ten pound, very well-behaved dog. He barks when someone knocks on the door but other than that I doubt anyone in our neighborhood knows he exists. It’s important though that we actually have permission to have a dog. We didn’t sneak him past anyone. Most of the neighbors do have dogs. It isn’t a well kept secret, but it doesn’t bother us. \n\nThe neighbors directly next door, though, are starting to be a problem. They have two big breed dogs in a ting apartment. They only let them out on to a tiny patio. It’s the kind of dog we want- but refuse to get yet because they deserve (and need)  a massive yard. When the owners aren’t home the dogs whine / groan all day. It’s a sad sound that makes my dog pace. For hours a day. When they come home they put the dogs upstairs and begin band practice. \n\nBand practice is another issue. For a townhome with thin walls I don’t know why they’ve decided to practice here every night. It’s gotten louder as time goes on. At first, we were just like “well they pay to live here too”. But then it started going later and later and getting louder and louder. To the point where we can’t watch tv because we can’t hear it. We’ve asked them to turn it down twice and they’ve been very nice and complied. But I don’t think we should *have* to ask. \n\nDuring band practice the dogs are even more worked up, too. They know people are home so they bark to hang out. And then get yelled at to shut up. The yelling makes it even worse. \n\nI can’t really drown it out. White noise isn’t enough unless I’m wearing headphones. I shouldn’t have to wear those 24/7 in my own home though. \n\nWIBTA if I turned them in for having dogs, even though I have one? I know it’d result in them violating the lease and being made to move immediately (or sadly giving the dogs up, which I don’t want- but they are not being cared for) while complaining about the music would be a slower process.

It was perfect.\nI’ll admit I definitely had engagement fever and was dying for him to pop the question.\nHe is my best friend and my favorite person.\nNow that we are engaged its all very really. I am still head over heels fir him and can’t wait to call him my husband. However, in the brief exploration I’ve done into weddings, I’ve realized how crazy expensive it all is. \nAs a kid, I always thought I’d want a bug fancy wedding. I’m realizing now that all I really just want a celebration of us. I don’t care about all the bells and whistles.\nI’ve decided that rather than a traditional wedding, I’m actually more keen to the idea of eloping. I know my fiancé also likes this idea as we’re talked about it a bit.\nRecently, he told me that he was told if we did elope we would possibly be disowned by his family. \nThey’re southern and pretty traditional. They’re good people and the one’s I’ve met are nice. But I also think it’s a bit unfair to expect all these people I’ve met once or not at all to be invited to this wedding and expect us to pay for it when it’s not what we want.\nI want our wedding to be reflective of us and be what we want. Sorry, but I don’t think throwing a party for everyone else is a priority. All we want is a very simple ceremony.\nI’ve even suggested and extremely small ceremony followed by a party of sorts. He thinks that still won’t cut it for them.\nThis actually really pisses me off. They’re not paying for it at all, it’s all on us and I don’t think it’s fair for them to threaten that on us when they aren’t contributing to our wedding.\nSo, AITA for not caring at all about being disowned by his family?\n\nTL/DR: Fiancés family threatens disowning us if we don’t have a wedding rather than eloping.\n  ",

She's financially able to take care of herself, but she still wants to live with me. \n\nI don't want her to live with me because:\n1. I am a 3 minute walk away. That's really the closest I want to live to my parents at 24. \n2. She says she might need help in case she needs to go to the hospital and might have trouble filling out paperwork, but I don't see why she has to live with me especially considering she doesn't have any immediate medical problems; she's a healthy, able-bodied 50 year old.\n3. My parents HATED my gf of 4 years before any trouble started because they thought she was beneath me and my gf hasn't forgotten that, so I know I would have to choose between them eventually.\n4. Growing up in that household was just awful, things were not good before they got worse and I really don't want to be reminded of the past.\n5. I'm frustrated with her because she's had 2 years to plan for the worst, but just kept putting it off. \n\nI'm not talking about cutting myself off from my Mom, but it's hard to communicate with them because they're so deceptive and lie a lot and I can't stand it so I want some distance from them.\n\nAITA? I feel like it because they're guilt tripping me pretty hard, but I really hate dealing with my family, especially with these latest developments. I'm emotionally and physically drained having to deal with my parents and there's honestly a lot of days where I can't even.

      "description": "Early yesterday morning I got a friend request from an old buddy of mine. We’d been friends for years, and were quite close. He and I had a brief (no sex)  fling (I was having one of my first manic episodes, and, with also being borderline, it’s not like it was that meaningful), which ultimately ended with an event I don’t know how to describe. Technically it was rape. I didn’t want the particular act, and I tried to suggest other acts and tried to wiggle away and “get back to class” but I never said no, due to childhood trauma making it very hard to speak up, especially when it would upset someone else. I don’t think he realizes what happened.\n\nI was trying to process it, bc with it came CSA memories, and yesterday I talked to a social worker for the first time ever about a child I work with, bringing back more issues. I finally mentioned it this morning because I thought I was ready to work through it, but she demanded to know his name.\n\nI refused to tell her, because it didn’t seem like her business and I have doubts and honestly, a week before he added me I had been reminiscing the friendship we’d had from 5th-10th grade. I was also scared of what she would do with the information, because she was so adamant on knowing.\n\nI know this is long and probably doesn’t make sense, but am I the asshole for keeping who he is to myself?

So I went back to the location I purchased it in, but they were out, but validated inventory from another location across town. \n\nSo I go to the other store to process a return exchange from the defective unit, and purchase two more boxes anyway. The manager told me they couldn't process return from another Michael's: I had to go back to the original store to return the defective unit. So I bought the boxes and went to my car, but now I'm like 3 hours into this fucking sticker ordeal. \n\nI checked the website in my car and the return policy said nothing about accepting returns at any store, but it did say to ask the cashier for a full copy of the return policy. So I went back in rather than driving across town and asked the cashier... Some events later; there is no official policy about location returns, but the managers boss told her not to take returns from other locations. \n\nSo then I was getting pissed because 1) they are already better off, I bought more stickers 2) she's borrowing authority from someone else to basically tell me to kick rocks and 3) it's fucking $10 worth of stickers (which is where I feel like an asshole for this) \n\nEventually I told her *calmly, \"well then tell your manager that I was a jerk and refused to leave without a refund, because nothing in the policy...\" and she reluctantly, shakingly, processed the refund, and made it a point to say loud enough for everyone to hear \"I just hate being yelled at by men\". To clarify, I didn't yell or get irate, but I was speaking sternly to her about the fact I'm not driving across town to return a defective product I'm buying for someone else just to abide by an arbitrary rule not enforced by corporate policy.\n\nShould I just have driven across town?

      "description": "Sorry if I go a little overboard with context. I am a 20 year old young adult. My immediate family lives 40 minutes away, any other family lives in a different part of the country. \n\n\nI am not close to any of my family really, especially the ones that live away. I've never known them too well, I don't feel a connection to them at all. I am polite and have visited them with immediate family and have short chats on the phone if they call but nothing beyond that. \n\n\nMy aunt is very overbearing, especially. She does deal with mental health issues, and I sympathize with that (I'm not certain whether this is relevant so I thought I'd mention it), but where I barely know her I find the way she contacts me very uncomfortable.\n\n\nShe has sent me drunk texts for years about random things, usually trying to make me feel guilty about something. She tried to guilt me into getting my mother to take our whole family to their part of the country for Christmas at a time when money was tight by saying my grandmother was dying (I was shocked but turns out this was a lie) and asking me not to tell my mom she'd told me. I, of course, told my mother and learned this was false. So due to several interactions like this and learning she stole money from my parents and tried to guilt them over it, I'm not too fond of her. \n\n\nAnyway, a few weeks ago I was drinking with friends and she started spamming my Instagram photos with likes and comments. I'd remove her comments, and she'd put them back within minutes. She didn't say anything of consequence but being drunk I just decided to block her.\n\n\nShe texted me within 20 minutes a huge text saying she was hurt and disappointed and she'd \"stay out of your life since that's what you really want.\" \n\n\nThe next day, sober, I called my mom to ask what to do and she told me to ignore her. Instead, I decided to text her back and say it was nothing personal but I'd prefer to keep Instagram for my peers and facebook/text for family. She accepted this and replied that she loved me and thanked me for the reassurance. Okay, cool. I feel kinda weird that I have to reassure her? But whatever. \n\n\nThen the past few days I've received multiple texts from her begging me to allow her to follow me again. I haven't responded to any at this point. In one she sent today, she said \"I just tried to add you to Instagram but found no results and you're on [Uncle's] so could you please add me back....😟😇🙏🏻🤗😘\". I promptly blocked my uncle, too, as I hadn't even known he was following me. \n\n\nI hate dealing with this drama. I'm not trying to hurt her but I don't want her following me. This whole thing seems absolutely ridiculous and feels very middle school. AITA? ",

      "description": "  Our relationship hasn’t been perfect but I was deeply in love with her.  We had not been intimate in quite a while.Recently, I was late getting to her to take her daughter to school and then getting her from work as well. I work overnight, had started taking online classes, as well as working out, and was just exhausted. It was an honest mistake and I understand some anger/irritation. But she was livid and shut down on me. Didn’t want to speak, refused to say I love you back and was just being an a**hole in general. \n  During the several days she acted this way I also caught her in a lie regarding some merchandise and putting a few clues together,realized she had planned to go out without telling me. I have no issues with her going out, hell would prefer it as she has been really crabby lately. Just would have wanted to know when she made it home. \n  After the weekend she decides she’s ready to be nice to me and we enjoy a day together. Everything is great but at the end of the day I just wanted closure on the last few days. What was going on and how can I never solicit this behavior again. She then exasperatedly says that I’m soooooo dramatic. Why couldn’t I just let the day go and that I always have to ruin things and bring shit up. I say no it was really just a simple question as I’m trying to learn how to interact with you but apparently you want to be able to do whatever, treat me however if I make you mad, and shut the hell up, leave you alone until you feel like interacting with me again. That’s not cool. I had asked several times what was her deal and had I done anything else to make her mad and the only response I got was the middle finger emoji. She says this relationship is exhausting and why do we even do this. I tell her relationships are work to which she replies that with me it’s 100% work. She says I just simply have an issue with the way she deals with things and she doesn’t see a problem with it. I respond that you couldn’t possibly see a problem because your way of dealing with things focuses on yourself and never takes into account how I feel. Sweeping things under the rug is not the way to deal with conflict and suggested counseling. She called me insecure and refused.\n I feel that if I’m such a burden to her then we should go our separate ways. I haven’t spoken to her except to decline a request and don’t really intend to speak to her again. AITA?",

I considered it a family favor. \n\nHe laid out instructions in text form on what and how to feed the parrot, and he even followed up a couple days later asking if I had gone over. I told him I would go back over a second time and, and I did. \n\nHis house is a complete mess. He has stuff everywhere. I didn't volunteer to clean. \n\nWhile I was over there, I took the liberty of moving the heaters around for three reasons: so the parrot would be more comfortable, so nothing would catch fire, and so the electricity bill wouldn't be so high. In this process I closed an open door to an old (and I assumed unused) bedroom. \n\nHe calls me AFTER HE GETS BACK, and tells me they have a cat. At no point during the instructions or the follow up did he ever say that he even owned a cat, let alone that it was in the building. He never told me any instructions for taking care of it. \n\nThe cat went without food and water for 2 days, because I closed the door on it. AITA?",

      "description": "So my GF (30F) and me (31M) have been together for over 12 years now, and for most of her time with me she has suffered from depression on and off and has been manifesting itself in different ways every time.\n\nEarly in our relationship she wanted to become a teacher, I expressed my concern that It's mentally challenging but if shes really wants to i support her!\n\nShe goes though education 5 years, get a job and loves it and after 3 years crashes into a combination of depression and burnout.. First they tried half-time but it didn't help, panic attacks and anxiety started to manifest every other day so shes on sick-leave for 3 months and has no energy to do anything most days...In short.\n\nMe I'm going to a different path, after a electrician education goes thru military training, get a temp-job as a security guard and stay there to clime up the ladder so i get a full-time job at the best position in the company it took 6 years to get where i am today.. And i love it! Basically I sit at a reception during nighttime and play video-games with friends thru internet and scroll reddit and netflix :D It's the most lazy job on the planet and because its all nighttime i make above average pay and more then any of my friends have.\n\nThe only downside I work every other weekend and is 12 hour shifts.\n\nThis means 2 weekend a month she is home alone with our kid and I'm only with my family a few hours, it tough but it's my job and I have come to accept it.\n\nShe however doesn't, she thinks i should take almost any job that includes daytime and no weekends.. regardless of pay or working environment. Just because she needs my support during weekends. I understand it's hard but should i sacrifice all that I've worked for? \n\nShe gets mad every time we talk about it and starts to tear up.\n\nAm not all that against changing my job but i at least want a job that i might like or I'm worried I might get depressed.\n\nI'm trying to support her the best i can when I'm not at work, making dinner, cleaning, laundry. etc. But some days i feel like I'm the only parent taking care of my kid and my GF and the household all alone..\n\nAITA for not wanting to help her? Everyone i asked just says it's a hard one..",

      "description": "TLDR: Me(27F) and my SO(27M) went on a double date and it was just okay, he thinks we should try again I think it’s not gonna change anything. AITA for not wanting to go on another date with them? \n\nSo me (27F) and my SO (27M) went on a double date on Saturday with his coworker (25F) and her fiancé (26M). This was our first double date with them. My first inkling that me and his coworker wouldn’t be lifelong besties was when she didn’t know who Ted Bundy was. To me, a lifelong true crime fanatic this was a bad sign for future topics of conversation. \n\nAbout an hour in it dawns on me that she hasn’t asked me a single personal question about myself, while I’ve been asking her questions, laughing at her stories etc. being generally polite. She’s been talking about herself, her cats (I’m a diehard dog person) or talking to my SO about work stuff. Her fiancée at least tries to start a convo with me at this point but it’s brief. \n\nAnother hour goes by and she has finally gotten around to asking me what I do for a living. I answer and she moves onto how much she loves cruises and all the cruises they’ve been on. At this point I’m just waiting for it to end. \n\nFast forward to driving home with SO and I am completely honest and say that I found her self centered and didn’t see a future friendship happening. He laughed it off, said no big deal and I thought that was that. (For what it’s worth, he did agree about her being self centered and not being too interested in me) \n\nWell, the other night my SO gets wind that his coworker is worried that I didn’t like her (this is a complete surprise to me) and because of this my SO would like to try another double date. I couldn’t hide the annoyance on my face and I could tell this hurt him a bit. His argument is that he still has to see her and doesn’t want to make things awkward at work. My argument is that I just didn’t jive with her and have very little middle ground and I didn’t see the point.\n\nI asked him if he could recall one thing she asked me about myself or my life (besides what I do) and he couldn’t come up with anything.  We just kinda left it there so now I’m wondering AITA for not wanting to see her again? HALP! ",

      "title": "AITA for not engaging in small talk over text",
      "description": "Sigh. How to start? I consider myself a socially competent person; many might even describe me as \"thoughtful.\" Despite remembering birthdays and volunteering to chat up all the elderly relatives at family functions, the one type of small talk I can't stand are rhetorical greetings. (best example I can find linked below ).\n\n\nI met a someone at church and we exchanged numbers because I thought we could become friends. As expected they started texting me \"happy Sabbath\". Sigh. I replied with \"happy Sabbath to you too\". To which they responded with \"thanks\" and then the convo died. \n\n\nThis dance continued for 3 weeks before I decided to reveal my true self. \n\n\nI explained that rhetorical greetings give me anxiety. I get that some use it as a polite conversation starter before asking for something - which is fine - but I'd rather no text if they didn't really need to speak with me. \n\n\nWhy? I'm programmed to be polite. If you text me, you either want something specific or you're lonely. \n\n\nIf you want something, go ahead and greet me and make your request in one text. Don't wait for me to do the stupid \"I'm good. Sup?\" It's a waste of time and quite honestly my hands hurt from being on the computer all week. (currently have BOTH hands in splints) \n\n\nIf you're lonely, have something to talk about. Don't make me do all the work. I didn't summon you, you summoned me! I couldn't be resting my hands while watching a video but nah, I'm here racking my brain trying to generate small talk. \n\n\nMy friend advised to not reply but that gives me anxiety. What if the person needs something? Not replying might make me appear busy or otherwise unapproachable. (I'm looking at you, people who text 'can I ask you something?' Bish, ask yo' question.) \n\n\nIf someone is lonely and awkward I don't want them to become depressed and more lonely because they think I'm too cool to chat with them. \n\n\nSigh. So finally, at the end of that long explanation, I typed \"if you want me to know that you're thinking of me but don't necessarily need to chat just add 'no reply' to your rhetorical greeting\" \n\n\nThey responded that every message is important and they never send empty greetings. Yeah whatever. \n\n\nI didn't hear from them for 3 weeks after that. Just as I was about to feel like an asshole I received another \"happy Sabbath\" text. This time it was in a group chat. WTF. \n\n\nWorse, my texting app isn't dynamic so there was no way to remove myself, only mute. This wasn't helpful because the chat rises to the top whenever a new message comes in. \n\n\nIsh was so cringe. My friend would greet the group of 10 people but only 2 would respond. It was a long thread of \"happy Sabbath\". No small chat. After a month I asked to be removed from the group. \n\n\nWHY YOU PUT ME IN THE POSITION TO BE A BITCH?? WHYYYYY\n\n\n6 months go by and this friend has started with the happy Sabbath shit again. We no longer go the the same church. Twice I responded \"thanks same to you\". To which they didn't respond. On the third time, I didn't respond. \n\n\nNow I have anxiety about being a dick. So Reddit, am I the asshole? \n\nShould I block their number leaving email as the only form of contact? \n\nExtra: I also don't respond to generic holiday and birthday greetings. Especially if you text me \"HBD\". FOH with that laziness. I also don't respond to my mom's rhetorical greetings. She's since learned to be a better conversationalist. I admit the mom thing is slightly dickish but I text her almost daily. Lol. \n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Y4vel6TdfJg",

      "description": "Together about 6 months, long distance. His birthday was a week before mine and we celebrated by meeting in Vegas. I got him a nice watch and a card. We had a great time!\n\nI asked him for a card at the least, and told him the gift itself doesn’t really matter to me (it doesn’t). My birthday was about 2 weeks ago and he still hasn’t sent me anything. I brought it up to him today and it seemed like he got upset that I was asking.

      "description": "Am I the asshole? For the past year, my grandparents have gone downhill. They truly need 24/7 care. But my grandfather is too prideful and stubborn to change thier situation. They don't want to move somewhere with assisted living. Thier insurance would cover a 24/7 nurse, but they say they don't want a stranger in thier home. My grandfather is killing himself trying to care for my grandmother, who has a degenerative disease and can barely move. \n\nSix months ago, he is told by his doctor that he cannot drive anymore, so this means neither of them can drive. He gave the car to my parents. Since then, he has treated the family like a cheauffer service or Uber. He literally called me that. A month ago he changed his mind and took the car back. Half the time, they endanger others on the road and drive around. The other half, the call me or another family member. \n\nThis morning, I told them how much seeing them like this and in this self destructive situation is killing me, and that I wasn't enabling it anymore. This whole situation is what I'm gonna remember most about 2018. I don't want to spend 2019 watching them deteriorate and feeling like I'm not doing anything to truly help them. It makes me so sad to be around them, when they could have such a better quality of life. When they come up with a plan, I will help them of course. But I am not sitting back and watching them hurt themselves when that's not how it has to be. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "throwaway because some work colleagues know my real account.\n\nLast weekend I (22F) went to a club with a few of my best friends. My friends all look absolutely gorgeous and get approached by men a lot. I’m going to be completely honest and say that I’m definitely not as attractive. I’m not overweight, but I’m definitely chubby, I’m 5’11,  and I have a large, crooked nose and small eyes. I know I’m not that attractive, but I’ve come to terms with my cruel hand in the genetic lottery. Anyways, I never usually go clubbing, but it was my friend’s birthday. Let’s call this friend Eva. We were all dancing and having a good time when Eva approaches the club photographer and asks him to take a group picture of us. I hate taking photos because I feel really self-conscious, but it was Eva’s birthday so I smiled and posed in the group photo. Fast forward a couple of days later. The club posts all of the photos from the night, including our group photo. Literally all of the other photos had no caption, but our group photo had the caption, “Who’s up for a game of Russian Roulette?”. This was obviously alluding to the fact that I am ugly whilst my friends are all drop-dead gorgeous. Random people found the post hilarious and started sharing it on Facebook and tagging their friends. The photo had about 300 laugh reacts before I messaged the club’s Facebook page and asked if they could take the photo down. They told me to lighten up and that it was just a joke. I got really annoyed because they didn’t even apologize, so I messaged the club owner (his Facebook was public). He told me to “get a grip” and to “understand the humor of the situation”. Now, one thing about this guy: he’s quite short. Like, 5’1. He shares all of these Facebook posts about Tinder and how unfair it is to short men and how “fat landwhales can find a man easily”. So, I knew that his height was his biggest insecurity. But I was angry. So I told him to fuck off and told him that he would never find a girlfriend due to him being a short little leprechaun. Eva thinks I went too far, and she’s scared that our entire group will get banned from the club. AITA?",

      "description": "So to set the stage, I am FTM transgender, but I'm not out yet, except for to my best friend. My mother is a social worker that works with kids and teens, so naturally, she has always been very accepting of me, and I know that whatever I do, she will support me. However, my father is the opposite. He is a frequently unemployed, emotionally/physically abusive jerk who makes homophobic and transphobic \"jokes\" all the time and makes fun of me for damn near anything I do.\n\nI have been wanting to try and go on hormones for a while now, and I finally got the balls (heh) to make an evaluation appointment to hopefully get a prescription for testosterone. However, I believe I will have to come out to my mom before the appointment, as I am still under her insurance from her work. I don't have a huge problem with this, because I think she'll be fine with it, and not judge me or anything. However, she has been known to not keep secrets from my dad very well. One time, I confided in her that I was scared of my father, and she told him about it. This has made me slightly distrustful of how confidential our conversations really are.\n\nSo my plan is to tell my mom, on the condition that she keeps it a secret from my father, or else I will cut them both off. This would not be an easy decision, because I really do love my mother, and they are helping me pay for college, but if my dad knew about me being trans before I was ready and prepared for him to know, I think it would destroy me, because of his mocking, emotionally abusive behavior. His blatant homophobia and transphobic already strain our relationship, so it is imperative that he doesn't know, until I'm ready to accept what comes at me, probably when I'm in a more secure mental state.\n\nTLDR: WIBTA for cutting my mother off if she doesnt respect my wishes of keeping my trans-ness a secret from my abusive father?",

      "description": "I go to a fairly small private US college. The food isn't bad by any means, and in fact I like it for the most part. \nCome lunch time yesterday I order my typical Italian sandwich and go to the cooler to grab a drink. I set my sandwich down for a second when the wrapper unfolded. Lo and behold, [one of these little guys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_stink_bug) was hanging out on my sandwich. \n\nI then approached the counter where I got the sandwich, where the employee tossed it and made me a new one. I didn't think it was a big deal, I hadn't even paid for the sandwich before I noticed the little insect chilling on the cibatta. Before my new sandwich was even done the head chef approached me and said I could have a free lunch, anything I wanted, \"sandwich, chips, drink, whatever\", to paraphrase him. \n\nNormally I get a bag of chips, a small soda, a sandwich, and perhaps one of those Naked smoothie things for later. I grabbed all that stuff atop a pack of Altoids and went to the cashier to be rung out for my free lunch. \n\nThis is where I started to feel kinda guilty about my choices. The typically kind and cheery cashier, who knew of the free lunch situation, told me that I'd have to pay for anything extra as she thought I was just getting the sandwich for free. I then told her that the head chef guaranteed me a \"free lunch, whatever I wanted\". She called for the chef to confirm, to which I didn't find it necessary. I was willing to pay for the extra stuff myself, but she had already gestured for his attention. After he saw what else I was getting, he confirmed it was ok (a little hesitantly), but the cashier's demeanor changed from cheery to begrudging. \n\nA day later I still feel like a greedy asshole. I almost don't even want to go to that dining hall because I feel bad. Am I an asshole?",

I invited Gina and some other friends over to remember our friend who passed. During the gathering Gina said “we should all get laid it will help us feel better.” It made me and the others extremely uncomfortable.

I ignored Gina the rest of the day and for the next week. \n\nFast forward to this past weekend. Gina came over to visit and asked how Thanksgiving was. Before I could reply she said, “I had the best Thanksgiving hookup and one night stand Friday night.” I told her that I was tired of her always talking about her sex life and that it’s been difficult being friends with her the past several years because I can never have a conversation with her without it being brought up. I also mentioned how I was still upset for what she said during the event which we were trying to remember our friend who died.\n\nShe got defensive and started insulting me.

She apologised and tried to explain but I told her the words she said weren’t acceptable and to leave my home.\n\nAITA for cutting her off? Is this behavior normal or acceptable? ",

I suggested that we stay friends as I did enjoy his company even if I didn't feel anything romantically. He shot me down on this, which I guess in retrospect wasn't too surprising but whatever I can't be responsible for people's feelings like this.  \n\n\nThen in mid-Nov he reaches out and wants to hang out, I figure sure. My friends and I go see a weekly movie so I invite him to join us. He gets along well with my group of friends and with me. All is going well.  \n\n\nWell, over December I met this guy and he's really sweet, nice, and I see things going far with him. Well last Friday (the 4th) we went to go see a movie and I invited the guy I've been seeing. Everyone was really getting along with him except the guy I dated in Sept.  \n\n\nHe told me that it was rude of me to \"rub his failures in his face\" which I don't feel like I'm doing. I invited him into my friends circle, and with my friends (and most in general I assume) you share parts of your life!  \n\n\nEither way he's ignoring all of us, and obviously I know where I'm coming from, but perhaps I'm missing his perspective and maybe I'm the one that effed up here.

I said that I was also planning to get up at 7 AM because I wanted to start my day early, although I didn't have to. Later, we watched an episode of GoT together. Afterwards, my SO wanted to watch another episode, but I said no since it would get too late (the time was 10 PM or so). We went to bed, cuddled, and had sex. (S)he then turned around to try to sleep, and I picked up my Kindle to read for about twenty minutes. Reading helps me fall asleep, and there's not a lot of light from the Kindle, but still it annoys my SO a bit (I understand this, but I think it's something one has to accept as long as it's not unreasonable.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finished reading at about 11:30 PM and put away the Kindle, planning to sleep. We then started talking for some reason (don't remember about what), it got a bit late (maybe 00:10 AM at this point), and I decided to postpone my alarm by 30 minutes and said this. After a few minutes (s)he got furious and rushed out of the room with the pillow and blanket to instead sleep on the couch. We then had a fight, and in that fight I certainly made mistakes (got angrier than reasonable et.c.), but I'm wondering about my SO's reaction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(S)he thinks that I (essentially) was an asshole who \"promised\" her that I'd wake up at the same time as her, and then postponed the alarm, which she couldn't do due to class. Both of us agree that his/her reaction was over the top, but (s)he still thinks that I was wrong to postpone my alarm, and says that I should have held my \"promise\" to wake up early, even though I didn't have to. The argument for that is that \"we both kept each other up\", and so we should both suffer the consequences of that. I argue that my SO has some responsibility too, and had (s)he at some point mentioned that (s)he thought we should go to bed or sleep, the issue would be very different, but (s)he didn't. I did, on the other hand, by opting not to watch another episode of HBO. (S)he argues that a reasonable reaction from me would instead be to wake up at the same time, stay up until SO goes to school, and then go back to bed if I wanted to. I think that's ridiculous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My husband has been planning a party at our home for about three weeks now, scheduled for today. \n\nThe past week, however, our house has also been pretty mess. I work full time, he currently does not work, so I asked him to clean it up and told him that I wasn’t comfortable with the place for company. I also told him that I probably wouldn’t help that much, because I would be working 6 of the 7 days leading up to the party.  \n\nThe cleaning didn’t really happen. I ended up cleaning the kitchen for him, but each time I brought up the rest of the house, he told me that he still had a few days to go... and now this morning, the house still isn’t clean, he hasn’t done any shopping for party snacks, and I’m fed up with it, so I made him cancel the event the moment he woke up. He’s furious and told me that making him call it off the day of was absolutely uncalled for, and that telling him to clean our house was too much of a burden.  \n\nAm being unreasonable? Should I have just let it go and let him have the party, or sucked it up and cleaned for him so he could have the party? ",

      "title": "AITA for overlapping romantic relationships?",
      "description": "**TL;DR The end of my last relationship overlapped with the beginning of my current relationship. Girlfriend wasn't happy about it.**\n\nI got into a dispute with my girlfriend 'May' a few days ago. I apologized and things seem to be fine now, but I still am left with a feeling of uneasiness about the whole thing.\n\nShe learned that I was still in a relationship with my previous girlfriend 'April' while I was beginning to see her. Some important points:\n\n1) My relationship with April was in its death throes. By this point, she and I were seeing other people and kind of deciding for ourselves if our relationship was worth salvaging. April and I were both aware that we were seeing other people and were ready to accept the relationship ending if one of us wanted to.\n\n2) Meeting May was a chance encounter. There is a strong likelihood that I never would have seen her again had I not set the ball rolling then and there.\n\n3) I officially broke things off with April before my third date with May. May and I were officially a thing by the end of our fourth date.\n\n4) April and I kept contact during this time, but she and I did not at any point meet nor did either of us have the intention to.\n\nFrom May's point of view:\n\n1) I was obligated to let May know that I was seeing someone else. April and I not seeing each other notwithstanding, the mere fact that April and I were still a \"thing\" was pertinent information.\n\n2) In not telling May that I was seeing someone else, I was depriving her of the freedom that I had to see others. Even though May and I were not officially exclusive, there *is* an expectation that we *were* unless otherwise explicitly stated.\n\n3) The way I handled things made May feel that I was \"giving her a test drive\" and holding onto April as a safety net if things didn't work out.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\n1) I don't think May would've agreed to go on a date had she known that I was still somewhat together with April. Besides, I didn't think it would be pertinent information until she and I were seriously considering a relationship. Up until that point, both May and I were effectively single and eligible. It wouldn't have bothered me if she went on dates with other guys before we became a couple. I don't feel like I deprived her of anything more than the info itself.\n\n2) I definitely did not see my dates with May as a test drive. I took the relationship seriously from date #1. That I was together with April is merely a formality.\n\nIn the end, I apologized to May. It's clear that whatever I did bothered her so I assured her that she could trust me. It seems to have made her feel better, and I'm glad.\n\nBut I can't help but wonder. Am I the asshole for overlapping relationships? If so, would there have been a way for me to not be the asshole *and* still date May?\n\n",

      "description": "Okay. So this situation has been over for a while but I’m in need of some outside perspective as it’s still stuck on my mind. \n\nMonths ago I was dating a wonderful person that I loved very much and in that time he bought up that his female friend at the time once lead him on before dating his best friend. It made me uneasy that I’d known her for a while before finding that out.\n\nI noticed that even though she had a partner, if I was with my boyfriend or if he told her he was busy with me when she wanted to see him she would go a bit manic. To explain she would lash out at him saying he didn’t care about her and that she was going to commit suicide and that it was his fault etc. she’d constantly be paranoid and say really messed up stuff to him.\n\nAround this time I tried to ease the tension she was putting on him by being there to support her so she’d lay off my boyfriend. In conversation I mentioned that I wasn’t going to lie but that I was made somewhat insecure about her behaviour with my boyfriend because he had a history with her (in that she would flirt with him, touch him etc) and her reply was “good” so I told her I didn’t want her to contact me again as I didn’t want that bullshit in my life or anyone who thinks it’s okay to make me feel that way. \n\nI tell my boyfriend, he thinks it’s fucked up and ends up deciding to cut her off as well because she intentionally tried to hurt me and he knows this now. \n\nShe later blows the fuck up at me telling me I’m selfish, that my ex and I were inconsiderate and blinded and that all his friends hated me (which isn’t true. I was close with his CLOSE friends just not the ones she knew) and it really upset me that she pulled this on me.\n\nWhen I broke down how manipulative and childish her behaviour is and was she threw her instability in my face and told me I was practically making her suicidal by saying what I did. \n\nShe still to this day believes that I genuinely am an evil person and she’s done no wrong and honestly it’s so far out and delusional to me that I’m afraid that I’m wrong at this point because others are starting to side with her. I’ve heard that it’s because of my “timing” of what I said to her but I literally did not reach out to speak to her. She reached out to me and I simply told her to fuck off and why. \n\nMy perception on the situation may be skewed because I suffer w mental illnesses myself and live by the code “my sickness makes me sick, not a cunt” and held her to the same standard. For reference I have schizophrenia and she has pretty bad anxiety so they are super different and I genuinely am scared I may be the asshole in this because of it.",

He knows this, and has for a few years now, since I got the gaming PC.\n\nToday, he asked if I like old school type RPG's. I say some yes, why? Says he wanted to get me a fun one, Doom and Destiny. I tell him I own it and the 2nd one on PC already. I say this twice in the conversation. I then get an email saying that he gifted me a copy for XBone.\n\nTold him I'd never use it because I already own the game, again, twice. I don't even currently have my XBone or PS4 hooked up. Haven't in a couple months. Now I feel like an asshole for telling him I'd probably never use it or redeem the gift and he wasted the money, but I did make it known that I have it already, and that my consoles are for exclusives only.

Sadly, they have a cognitive disability which makes them difficult to cooperate with, they tend to say things, socially unacceptable, which to a point you can sympathize with but to another point you are inevitably caught between having to understand and trying to get work done.\n\nThey don't work well in teams, myself and a colleague were matched with Robin to work on a \"project\". I was tasked as the project manager, This was bad as Robin seems to direct anger and dislike at me... I asked boss not to do this and all he said was \"your the most patient, please bare with it\".\n\nRobin would refuse to do any work under me. I asked my colleague, Jacob, to try talk them into doing the tasks and it worked once but then robin would refuse to do what he said as well. Even simply scanning 2 pages took Robin an hour... I know for a fact they are more capable, when working alone. They were like this when working in a team with someone before. I ended up just siding Robin tasks that didn't matter too much if they were done or not and I felt awful at this but we were on a short timeline and if we took one hour to write up a colourful to do list with pictures on it and then another two hours everyday to encourage Robin to do things then this project was doomed and we'd all get our heads bitten off.\nThis project was for a relatively big client and we only had a few weeks.\n\nIt was basically just me and my colleague who did EVERYTHING. We pulled all nighters and slept at work to do what should have been a four person job... But we did it and were very proud of the result... the boss was aware this was happening too as we asked for help and advice... I think he was scared of any consequences of higher ups.\n\nRobin shouting things is awful too. She misheard a conversation OTHER people were having and turned to me (Who was opposite of this conversation) and shouted \"I cant believe you said that \"IamTrash\" you're a RACIST\", which shit me up because my bosses' head shot up and looked me dead in the eye. And I, panicking, snapped \"Don't say thing like that, I said nothing, dont get me involved!\" \n\nThat's a brief inlook to four years of working with Robin. I like them as a person but i cant handle working with them.\n\nFast forward to now, i am in a way better job, central and feeling pretty good and Jacob and another colleague are at the same place.\n\nI got a message from Robin asking for connections to work there. I said there was none when i knew our director was asking if we have any mates who can help out on the team. But i want to add that i know Robin on her own does not have the knowledge to use the equipment we are using without help and assistance... which you can't get here.\n\nSomehow... Robin must have emailed or applied, and got the interview...\n\nOur boss dont look at stuff here until the interview, i know this because they asked me for my CV, and portfolio on my interview day.\n\nSo here is the kicker... I'm planning, if my boss asks me, (as i guarantee Robin has messaged to say they know me and Jakob) to say to my producer that Robin doesn't work well in teams and hasn't enough experience or ability for the role she's applying for.\n\nI've talked about his with Jakob, a lot. I'm scared of the repercussions but if Robin comes here for work I'm worried that it will change the dynamic, that I'll be bunked with them, they'll shout more awful things out and worse I dont want to be saddled with extra work again, god forbid there is enough as it is... etc I feel awful but i dont know what to do.\n\nIn short...\n\nTldr: WIBTA if I tell my boss about my bad experiences with a disabled, potential employee who I feel is not fit for the role and have emotional bias against.",

So we tried to plan spending an entire day together but everything was cancelled because my mother wanted me to visit my family first, they were understanding when I told them and agreed to reschedule.\n\nHowever, I went to visit my relatives and it didn't took as long as I thought it would and I ended up going back relatively early, so having already planned to reschedule with my friends I didn't wanted to change plans so suddenly and thought about going out with my other group of friends just a couple of hours (because they were having a small gathering and asked me to join them).\n\nNow they (girlfriends) found out because someone uploaded a IG story and they're mad with me for not going out with them first, Am I the Asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Originally me and my friends were going to have a New Years party at one of our friends house but that got cancelled due to family coming over to his or something.\n\nI mentioned to my friend (let’s call him Jay) that my house might be free since I thought my house was going to be free since parents were going to my aunts house. I didn’t say if it was or not just that I’d see.\n\nHe then starts making plans in our group chat with my house as the venue. I said sure since we didn’t have a place yet but I figured I’d probably have a place. But I didn’t want to even mention it yet due to my family’s tendency to cancel plans and the fact I hadn’t confirmed anything yet.\n\nThe next day my parents plans are switched and my aunt is coming over to ours. I tell my group chat that my aunt will be over but that we could still crash in the lounge  ( we have two lounges.)\nJay starts getting annoyed saying I’m confusing him and changing plans not too much I can say to that so i said well if you don’t have a better venue it’ll do.\n\nJay then says we should buy fireworks for it. And in the group chat says oh flarebomber can buy them. He just said I’d get them without asking me. (Only two of us are old enough to buy fireworks but I figure parents wouldn’t mind if we were paying)\n\nWhen I joint the group chat and read through I’m annoyed at jay since it’s twice he’s kind of just assumed that I can do things house and fireworks. \n\nI say I don’t really want to because I’m already sorting the location of it out someone else could do fireworks. Normally I’d be fine with doing it since it’s not a big deal but I was annoyed that he had just assumed I would do it. \n\nWe started arguing over it I was being a bit stubborn in not wanting to buy the fireworks because I felt he wasn’t contributing anything (neither were other) he kept saying well your the host so you should sort it out. I was saying that I don’t want to be host then because I’d only planned to have it when my house was empty but since we were out of time and no other places I left my invite open. \n\nHe then goes on a rant about how I should have just said no to the whole thing then and how I was being lazy not buying fireworks. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\nThe above is the part I want to know if I was being an asshole on but I’ll carry on to finish the story for the interested.\n\n\n\nAnyway at 5 pm today he says oh I can’t come anymore. ( he was originally going to drop off 2 other people) because his mom was taking the car and going out with friends. (He said he d get here for 7 to help set up)\n\nThere was only going to be about 10 people it was a small gathering so with 3 people not coming some more people said oh I’m not coming and then everyone cancelled. \n\nMeanwhile I had already set up the room bring chairs and tables and a tv down.\n\nI was confused why he was suddenly cancelling I offered to pick him up and the other people if people still wanted to go but he ignored the message and others said oh guess not then.\n\nI look on snapchat and I see on a mutual friends story that he’s at their house party with some of the people who said oh I’m not coming anymore. \n\nJay never told me about the party neither did the other people. And the house they were at is still a fair way away that they’d need to drive to get there. \n\nMe and jay have had our snapchat maps on with each other for awhile and he suddenly wasn’t on it and neither were the friends st the party. Idk if I’m being paranoid but it just feels like they all wanted to ditch me.\n\nI think I was being a little stubborn but I didn’t think I deserved being ignored and ditched like that.\n\nMe and jay have been best friends for like 6 years and even though we’ve got into fights both physical and mental, this easily hurt the most.\n\nNot looking for advice just figured people might want to know the ending. Or at least where it’s got up to.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Excuse format and grammar. No native on the phone. TLDR at the end.\n\nI would like to preface this by saying that I have a very good relationship with my sister. However our family has a history of kidney problems so we were discussing what would happen if we ever needed a kidney.\n\nAs she has type 0+ she can receive a donation from a 0+ or a 0-, that would include me as I am type 0-. However I can not receive from her. So I said I would not donate to her. The main reason is not because I want reciprocation but because I think I have it much harder and I dont want to risk being on a waiting list if my other kidney fails. Also she can do hemodyalisis.\n\nShe was visibly upset and maybe I did not worded my thoughts appropriately. Please I want to know if I did not consider other reasons.\n\nAn important note. 0+ accounts for 40% of the population but 0- is only 7%. That is why I will have it much harder if I am ever waiting for a transplant.\n\nTLDR: I am 0- my sister is 0+, so she could never donate a kidney to me, I would not give her a kidney because if she ever needs one she can do hemodialysis, and she has a higher probability than me of finding a donant.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my overweight coworker to go on a diet?",
      "description": "My coworker, Annie, is a very nice person. However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far. \n\nAnnie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8\". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.\n\nAnnie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself. \n\nI asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit. \n\nOver the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.\n\nAnnie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.\n\nSo the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, \"It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!\" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.\n\nSince, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight. ",

      "description": "Long story short, my boyfriend and I used to heavily abuse drugs and most of our drug use together was done with his sister who is still to this day using....a lot.\nDuring our time spent getting high we did reckless things and even had an ongoing war between the three of us, her against my boyfriend and I. A stupid war of stealing important stuff from one another, talking a great deal of shit about each other but still managing to get extremely high together. \nThat is until my boyfriend and I decided to go treatment and get clean.  During my time in rehab I realized that even though his sister did some petty shit to us and the other way around, I still considered her family and wanted the best for her, because really she's just as sick as I was when I was strung out and we had bonded over some similarities in our lives.\nFast forward to now, my bf and I have an almost one year old daughter and we're both still clean. We have our own place, he's working, and life is the polar opposite of what it used to be. She on the other hand, is what their father likes to call a \"train wreck\" and I believe it. This girl doesn't sleep for days on end and never stops going. It's exhausting even thinking about. Anyways, the bf and I try to see family as much as possible because we think it's important for our little to be around loved ones. That is until his sister comes around. I really don't want to be around his sister anymore. She's a major trigger for me and I just don't want our daughter around someone who is constantly high. The family knows she is like this but make comments to us about inviting her over and how maybe our daughter will be what motivates her to stop using. I don't want her coming over. I dont want her bringing her drugs in my home I have worked really hard for. I don't want it around my daughter. And I don't want to be triggered.\nSo to compromise we have decided to take her with us to the zoo this Saturday. At the time it seemed like a good compromise considering we might not be triggered at a public place and she won't act like a lunatic in public, but now I'm having extreme doubts and I want to cancel even though she's super excited to see her niece, my daughter, and spend time with us. Am I the asshole for not wanting to be around her anymore, not until she gets clean at least?",

      "description": "Ok so I got a calligraphy pen recently and have been practicing with it. I have terrible handwriting so I have been using the small amount of free time I have while doing other things like watching youtube, playing games, or cleaning and cooking to practice on whatever I have available. Things like post it notes, letters, paper etc. Well one night I was practicing but I was also playing a game called heroes of the storm. When you die in this game you have some time before you respawn generally 10 seconds to 1 minute. I use that small amount of time to grab the pen and some paper to practice. One of the words I spelled was my girlfriends name. I spelt it wrong.\n\nNow, my girlfriend and i have been with each other for a little over a year and when I give her gifts and letters or write her name in any other was I spell her name right. But in practicing I am more focused and the way it looks and how quickly I can do it in my time I have left. Her name also has many variations of it and her variation is slightly odd. For example if her name was haylei, but I spelt it haylie. Or if her name was Sarah but i spelt it Sara. Etc. I did this and this last week she came and visited and saw that i spelt her name wrong.\n\nNow i can understand being upset about it and i did apologize. She asked how I would feel if she spelt my name wrong and i honestly wouldn't care and told her as much. In my eyes it's not like I was very off of the spelling and I didnt do it with the intent to hurt her. I was just practicing my handwriting. But now we are two days into this fight and i am tired of apologizing and think it's kind of ridiculous that this is still continuing. AITA?\n",

So as a joke a friend asked me to draw Undertale hentai (DON’T JUDGE ME WE’RE IN 7TH GRADE) and I thought it was funny so I agreed. He offered 20 kr (around 3 dollars) and the price would rise depending on how good it turned out. So I was almost finished when this absolute mad lad raised the price to 400 kr (45 bucks) for some reason, well i didn’t complain. So I finish my drawing and he accepts it. But then it takes him like 14 months to pay me. So now I usually don’t want to draw for him for free. Now he will often ask me to draw covers for the games he makes occasionally and i often do so because I thought it was fun. But now I’m getting a bit sick of it and I wondered if I should start charging (just like 5 bucks or something nothing crazy) so that he doesn’t abuse my help. So am I the asshole for wanting payment now? ",

      "description": "So this happened about 8 years ago and still has ripples of tension in the family.\n\nMy great-grandmother gifted me her old car.  The car was a bit of a lemon, had several things wrong with it, but I was very appreciative.  I put several thousand dollars of repairs into that car over many years.  Eventually, it was getting to the point where I needed a new car.  I asked her if I could buy the car from her so I can use it as a trade in for a new car.  \n\nShe said sure and she was willing to sell it to me for the value of trade in and had me sign a napkin stating so.\n\nAs it turns out, the trade-in was only worth like $1000 because of the physical and mechanical damage.  I told my grandmother that I was able to trade it in for $2500 because I didn't want to hurt her feelings and I wanted to repay her kindness for letting me use the car in the first place.\n\nWell, about $1000 into paying her off, she passes away.  About a week after the funeral, I get a notice from my Aunt who has been appointed the executor of the estate and asks what my plan is to repay the $1500.  \n\nI tell her the full story and politely ask if the debt can be forgiven.  She gives me a very brash \"NO\".\n\nWhen my grandmother passed she had no debts. She had about a hundred thousand in stocks and bonds that all went to my aunts on top of about $250,000 in real estate.\n\nThere was a lot of back and forth about \"It's not about paying us, it's about her estate\". My argument was \"My debt was to her and she's gone.\", and I fulfilled my obligation of paying her the trade-in value of the car.\n\nAfter that, I got an email saying \"You can either pay this debt or you can be out of this family.\"  I told her politely to pound sand.\n\nThe tension dissolved over the years but it still gets brought up in passing occasionally.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "This feels ridiculous, but bear with me. I really love this cat.\n\nI am a college student. I live in a college-owned apartment and as a result cannot have a pet, but my family as a whole considers the family cat to belong to me and my sister. Following the age-old tradition, when we were kids my parents allowed us to bring the cat home on the condition that we took care of him, but my younger sister, who is still in high school, gets out of doing cat-chores as often as possible. As a result, my parents get up at 5am to feed the cat and empty his litter box probably 75% of the time when I'm not at home, despite it being my sister's responsibility. \n\nNaturally, they are frustrated. Every time I come home for breaks, they threaten to take the cat back to the shelter because they're tired of taking care of him. They claim that they've gotten *very* close to doing so on multiple occasions, though they only tell me weeks after the fact. This makes me super anxious, as I'm worried that I'll come home for break someday to find they've gotten rid of my pet (whom I love very much, and they know that) without so much as giving me time to try and find him another home.  \n\nAt the same time, this is an unfair burden on my parents, and while I do the cat-chores when I'm home, am planning on taking him with me as soon as I move into pet-friendly housing, and have tried all manner of things to get my sister to pull her weight, there isn't a whole lot I can do to make it better for them. \n\nI'm really devastated at the the thought of my childhood pet going back to a shelter (he'd already spent years in one before we adopted him), but is there anything I can do without being unreasonable? Am I the asshole for begging my parents to hold onto this cat that I can't help take care of right now? ",

My friend will already be in that country for a few weeks due to other reasons, but I will join later on to travel together and eventually fly home together. At the same time my SO asked me if we could go on a holiday together, but I told them I already promised my best friend to go together but we could plan another holiday to a cheaper and closer destination. My SO got a bit upset and sad, since they would want to go to the same location as my best friend and I had planned. My SO did accept it, but I could tell that going together on my vacation would be something they wanted.\n\nAfter this I talked to my best friend in just enquiring, not pushing at all, if there is a possibility for my SO to tag along. I emphasized if my best friend is not comfortable with my SO tagging along, i would not even invite my SO but in the talk it became clear it would not be a big problem for my friend. Sure it would be nice to travel together just the two of us, but understanding I have relationship, my friend has been kind enough to say if I invite my SO, my friend would just invite their own SO so it would not be a possible awkward trio holiday. My SO and best friend have known each other since before we became a couple, and get along quite well.\n\nAfter confirming this again with my best friend, if they honestly would not mind me inviting another person, in which they reassured me its okay I thus invited my SO to tag along, which they gleefully accepted. However my best friend's SO does not want to go together anymore, which leaves the three of us again. I honestly could not think of a better way to spend my holiday than with my best friend and SO travelling together, but now I am getting worried how my best friend will not have the vacation they wanted and I will unintentionally wil make them feel like a third wheel or vice versa with my SO.\n\nI feel my best friend would be the happiest if my SO would not tag along, since we in that case would be only the two of us which they wanted in the first place, but to be honest I do not want to de-invite my SO. I feel like both my best friend and SO will be worried about some arrangements, like seatings and sleeping arrangements. Am I the asshole for not de inviting my SO and wanting to take both of them?

Well, he tries getting back together with her and she tells him that she doesn't want to lose me and that they could still be friends which I was totally fine with. Then some time goes by and he keeps hitting on her and telling her he loves her and that he wants to propose so I ask her to stop going over to his place alone without me cause one time the dude took her phone and started \"touching her\" (her account when I asked him he denied it), but I was still okay with them talk but recently he's been texting her every day saying that I'm so controlling and that she should leave me. He also said some grade A+ asshole stuff about me when I went to the hospital when I overdosed, pretty much he said something along the lines of that he wished I died and that when I get out of the ER he hoped that I would kill myself. So needless to say I asked her to block him but recently he's been threatening to report me to our school for \"being manipulative and controlling\" which I responded to by telling my gf that I would report him for harassment and show them the text in which he said all that bullshit. So judge me am I in fact the asshole.",

      "description": "This happened a while ago, but it's eating me inside.\n\nI have a dog shit relationship with my parents (my mom especially). Mom is abusive and neglectful, Dad is borderline abusive and is neglectful. I'm an adult now and I don't live with them anymore, so the bad stuff all happened when I was living under their roof. Since this is about my dad, I won't go into detail with what my mom did. \n\nMy dad denies that my mom was ever abusive and gets mad at me for making her feel bad. I have PTSD from how she treated me, and I've told him this. He doesn't care, it seems. When I got an abscess (basically a cyst on steroids), he took me to the doctor once. They didn't know the problem. The pain was so intense that moving an inch made me scream bloody murder. He seemingly didn't care and forced me to go to school every day. The only reason he called a doctor again is because I collapsed in the hallway and the school nurse noticed. He also makes fun of everything I eat, despite my constant telling him to stop. His comments gave me an eating disorder that made my BMI drop to 15. He also made weird sexual jokes and comments around me, and wouldn't let me go when hugging me and kissing my cheek.\n\nSo one terrible day, he asks me what's wrong because I'm crying in the car. After fifteen minutes of me refusing to spill it, I finally break because I want someone to cry to. I ask him if he's ever noticed how I eat in secret, don't eat a lot, how I've been getting thinner, etc. He says no. Finally it clicks and he says, \"What, do you have an eating disorder or something?\" I scream, \"YES!\" \n\nHis response is denial because I'm gaining weight and yada, yada, yada. I snap and say something like, \"this is why I hate opening up to you! You always make it worse, just like when I tried to tell you about Mom!\"\n\nAgain, denial. This is where I might be the huge asshole. He's being as calm as possible while I'm screaming at him, telling him how much it hurts to not have your own father protect you from abuse, how it's like he's dead to me, how he and Mom made me want to die, how he probably doesn't care, all this stuff that would make any sane parent feel horrible about themselves. After I lose my voice, I sob into my hands and apologize for yelling. I ask him to promise me that he won't tell my mom about my eating disorder. For some reason, whenever I have a problem, my mom thinks it's an attack on her, and she goes crazy. Like, kicking open the door to the point where I think she's going to kill me crazy. It'd also give her a new thing to insult me about. He knows this.\n\n\"I can't promise that,\" says Dad.\n\nThere it is. I feel like he doesn't care about me at all. He's willing to throw me under the bus, risk my safety. I look at him and say, \"I will never tell you about my problems ever again.\" He says no, it'll get better, we can talk about it, it's just a bump in the road. I shake my head and reassure him that I will never open up to him, that he's lost his chance forever. I'm sticking to my word, no matter how much of a cunt that makes me. \n\nStill, I feel horrible of denying him deep conversations and opportunity to help me. I honestly don't think he's malicious like my mom, but he's just apathetic. I've spent years opening up and trying to beg him for help, and it's just blown up in my face every single time. This was the final straw. Am I the asshole for giving him such a heavy blow to his pride as a parent?",

      "description": "I won't give my mother pictures of myself in uniform. I'm sure she's proud of me and and she could show off the way moms do but the pictures themselves aren't the issue. I got upset about her demand for them and I haven't been able to swallow my pride and give in to her.\n\nI separated from my wife 2 years ago. I kept kind of quiet about it, but it was public knowledge that we had ended things.\n\nI live across country so I don't visit often, for Xmas usually. That Dec I was visiting and I noticed that my parents still had pics of my wedding and my ex displayed in their home. They may have thought that we would work things out, or maybe it was just something they hadn't thought; we weren't divorced yet, but we had separated for 10 months. I said that the relationship was over and they should take the photos down, as I found them inappropriate now. \n\nMy mom responded that maybe she would if I gave her some nice photos to replace them with; I thought this was a shitty thing to say to a valid request, but I didn't think she was serious about it.\n\nNow I've been visiting friends and family for about a week and I see my parents again; I happen to see the pictures remain in place. I ask my mother about them again, assuming she forgot to take them down, but she replied that she already told me only if I gave pics that she could replace them with, me in my Uniform. This irked me, but we didn't fixate on it anymore. \n\nFast forward a year to this Xmas visit. The divorce is finalized. I've been in several relationships and now I'm seeing someone very seriously; my ex-wife now is a distant memory.\n\nPrior to flying home I called my mom about my plans for my visit, asked if they had a bed for me, what days were good for dinners, etc.. When I asked about staying with them I made a joke about how it would be more comfortable this year since my wedding pictures were obviously gone by, now but my mom replied that they were still there because I never fulfilled her demand. I told her clearly why I didn't want them displayed and how it made me feel that having those pictures displayed isn't appropriate. I said I get her side but that it hurts me that she would continue to display them after I asked her to take them down. Most importantly I vocalized that she was manipulating me by trying to extort my emotions to make me bend. She seemed receptive to this.\n\nLow and behold when I arrive the pictures were still hanging. It took everything I had to not just rip them off the fucking wall myself. I made a remark about them and I got the same response. Tension was high anyway, but I ended my vacation early and returned home. I haven't spoken to my mother since. She knows she's hurting me but she won't concede. I wouldn't maintain a relationship with anyone else if I felt like they were treating me this poorly.\n\nI know I'm being prideful but it would hurt me more if I were to visit and saw images of myself knowing how my mother manipulated me to get them. \n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "The past year with my boyfriend has had major ups and downs. We are long distance and in different countries. In August we were going to move in together, but we got in a huge fight and I called the whole thing off. We have a long history of him calling me a cheater (never cheated) and I felt wildly unhappy moving to another country to be with somebody who continues to feel that way about me. I wasn't able to be there for the move in day for our home and this sparked that fight. We took some space from each other, and then he told me if we're not living together by Spring of 2019 then he's leaving. This made me panic and I said I'd try to find a home or something where I live and we'll make it work. He was on my ass about it and also on my ass about me visiting him again and I ended up freaking out because he kept making me promise I'd come over and over numerous times a day. I didn't visit and here we are now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been going to therapy and my therapist advised I take some space and think about my problems and the problems with my boyfriend. We literally talk every second of the day on Skype, well anytime we're not working. This kind of is hard on me, if I don't drop what I'm doing to get on Skype he usually get upset with me. Either way I took some space, we still talked but things sucked because he was incredibly upset I didn't visit. He wanted to get married when I visit so he could get a green card and all of that. I said I wanted to, which I do but the manner of which things were going on made me really uncomfortable. I should have expressed this to him but I didn't, I just had a mental breakdown instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been going over our relationship in my head and there's been a lot of unhealthy things that have happened and he responds to a lot of things in a very pushy manner. Am I the asshole for refusing to visit him until he can show he's not going to keep treating me the same way? I asked for like a month of us being healthy and then I would visit. I just don't feel secure with where we are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe tells me he can't trust me anymore because I didn't move in and I didn't visit him in October. I told him I understand why he feels that way, and I've tried explaining how he's hurt me and pushed me into things and it makes me really anxious and makes me panic but he says for us to continue I need to show I'm committed to him so he can have some trust in me again. I'm just tired of proving myself to him because of one reason or another. It started with me needing to do sexual things, then proving I'm not a cheater, and then even after I gave him half my belongings to move with him and paying the downpayment for renting a home and getting a visa, none of that mattered I always continued to get shit about him doubting me. Am I the asshole for being tired of proving things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Using my throwaway because I'm pretty sure I'm about to be roasted. \n\nI had a long distance boyfriend. We were on and off for a couple of years from ages 15-17. Yes. It's as cringey as it sounds. He was a year or so older than me and we were cringe. \n\nThe relationship was blatantly toxic. I couldn't hang out with guy friends without him crying on the phone to me. Big fits were thrown over me not being available all the time, if I was grounded and he couldn't reach me, if I was too busy to text.. And I put up with it because I thought he was the love of my young life and just troubled. \n\nHe threatened multiple times to kill himself. I suffered from a couple mental disorders and he told me he did, too. So I would stay on the phone for hours trying to talk him down. This probably happened once every two or so months, sometimes more, for two years. \n\nWell, one day I had enough of everything and left him - when he proposed to me. I realized that spending the rest of my life with this guy made me want to vomit and I ran for the hills. I'd been begging him ti get help for years and was always met with a million excuses. He did not handle it well, but I didn't care. I mailed his stuff back, wiped my hands clean of him, and moved on into another abusive relationship that was also chock full of threats and abuse. Don't worry, I had a nice healthy relationship after that with a man I still regard fondly, and I'm also now married to the real love of my life. \n\nA few months after the breakup, I get a call from him. He's sobbing. I'm out with a friend, who later told me that my eyes rolled so far back in my head.. \n\nMy ex told me he tried to kill himself. I lit up a cigarette and asked him why. He said he loved me, could never get over me, you know the drill. Then he told me he tried to shoot himself with his mom's gun. The first words out of my mouth were \"So how am I talking to you right now?\"\n\nHe told me he got the gun, went to his room, put it under his chin and pulled the trigger (all in great detail).. But the gun clicked and nothing happened. \n\nGuys, he forgot to load the gun. \n\nI muted the call and laughed so hard that I couldn't breathe. He was still sobbing, my friend was really fucking curious about what was happening, and I was trying not to roll around in a dirty Waffle House parking lot. \n\nYears of proclaimed or obviously fake suicide threats and attempts just boiled down to \"I forgot to load the gun.\" \n\nI still don't know if I believe him. I really don't. Suicide is such a touchy subject for a damn good reason and questioning whether someone really wanted to die is very taboo. \n\nSo. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "We've been close friends for 4 years. During that time we both hit our lowest with depression and he was one of my strongest anchors during it (I relied heavily on my friends as they were my main support). We both got better, I left school for the rest of the year to 'survive' and recovered within approx. 6 months (no longer depressed) and he got better but not 'cured'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrough the depression I had a migraine every week or so. But that then got worse and for the past year and a 1/2 I've had chronic migraines with it starting at 4 a week and now for the past 3 months being everyday. These were almost always (are now always) severe, incapacitating migraines, being constant 9-10/10 (pain) migraines Also due to a rare diagnosis of spinal leaks, they're very prone to get worse with any kind of vertical movement i.e. sitting, standing which essentially caused me to be bedridden and not able to attend classes or do much of anything for the past 6 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring this half year my friend's depression got worse. Not as bad as it had been but really bad (took medical leave multiple times etc.). He was already bad at online communication but with school which he somewhat despised and the worsening depression it got worse. He and most of my friends dropped communication with me due to my physical absence. I did however reach out to them enough to have a kind of social life. Wasn't the case with him. Despite me trying to text/talk with him, he almost never replied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis changed when he got a girlfriend who is also depressed. I was friends with her so this created a new cycle where the only responses I got from him were either asking me to help talk her down when they struggled and the more common one of 'help gf'. She was my friend so I obviously helped and ended up doing so a lot. I don't blame her for any of this because she needed help and because of her partner who wasn't able to deal with it majority of the time (depression) and an unhealthy relationship with her parents, she needed more. I ended up doing a crap ton of chaos management.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy only hopes through this half year was that when breaks happened he and I'd get to spend time together online. During breaks the responses I got were either today isn't gonna work because of business, attempted coping or variations of 'maybe' aka no. Near the end of the break, he confirmed with me that today was the day, we'd hang/play games together. We arranged a time and I started getting excited. After about an 2 hours past said time I texted asking whats going on and he replied that he was playing with a friend that he'd had over at his house twice in the break for a few days at a time. It was also a game that could host 4 people online. This along with the rest resulted in me going ham over text and getting really upset (swearing etc.), and insinuating that something needed to change or I wasn't going to continue the friendship.",

She's in pain so I offer aspirin, I can go real quick to the pharmacy or we can go to the doctor. She wants none of that. She complains her lips hurt, she has cold sores. I offer sympathy and hugs. She asks me what she can do about it. Idk, I say , why don't you ask your friend that knows lots of herbal remedies. She yells at me, I want you to Google it, you like to brag how you problem solve using google. I'm sick and I never ask you anything and if I do it's because I can't do it myself! You just don't care about me. \n\nI left to cool off, looked up a homemade remedy, gave it to her. She was crying cause her head hurt.

I should add that I'm sensitive, as in my feelings get hurt pretty easily. Nobody likes getting yelled at, I take it especially hard.\n\nShe's done many good things for me and I want to be there for her when she needs me but it's s bit too much for me. AITA? ",

      "description": "Okay, so, at my university I've been best friends with this guy and girl (call them Joseph and Bea) for about 4 years now. We've done plenty of stuff together, had a lot of drunken and high moments, etc. All that stuff.\n\n2 years ago I got a girlfriend (lets call her Lucy), and as time came to tell it, she was a very toxic person. Jealous of everyone, always minding other people's business, tried to manipulate me a bunch of times (as in, if she invited me to dinner and I said I didn't want to go, she invited ALL my friends so I had no one else to go dinner with but her. I never gave in to this kind of thing, fortunately). Overall I really regret having dated this girl.\n\nWe broke up in December. She asked to be friends, I said okay, within reason. But as of late she's always asking where I am, who I'm with and if I'll be at univ at night studying. She even started coming to study at night too since we broke up, and in 4 years I've never seen her do it. I've also met a new girl (which is a female friend's girlfriend, lets call her Marcia), and when I added this Marcia on facebook, later that day, who woulda known, Lucy sent her a friend request. There is absolutely NO WAY Lucy and the new girl would meet, ever, at all. I severely apologized to Marcia, and she said I had no reason at all to apologize as I had done nothing wrong. I still felt kinda bad about it.\n\nNow, tomorrow is a dinner party of my class (Lucy, Bea and Joseph are all in my class too), but since the three of them are not attending the class dinner, they invited me to have dinner at Lucy's house. I told them I wouldn't go for personal reasons, and Lucy just said \"Why do you have to make everything so hard, you're very selfish you know?\" and stormed off. Bea insisted for me to go as it would be fun, to which I said \"I'm not very comfortable with Lucy around, so I'd rather meet you afterwards\". She was said about it and asked what would make me go, I said \"Lucy not going.\" and Bea said \"Well she's part of the group now, so tough luck, you have to handle it.\" I simply said \"No, I don't, that's why I'm not going\" and I walked away. Now I'm seen as the bad guy by all 3 of them because I refuse to go to this dinner party.\n\nAm I the asshole here? I want to know because I think it's getting to the point when I need to confront them one by one and I want to at least be sure I'm in the right.",

      "description": "\\*\\*THIS IS REALLY LONG IM SORRY\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Friend is abused. Me too. Friend has meltdowns where he gets mad if you dont make him feel better, accuses you of lying/hating him/talking behind his back. Says its due to his abuse. 1st fight, he lied about a friend's words to him and tried pressuring me into agreeing with him by asking whether or not I agreed he was a attention w\\*\\*\\*\\*. Compared friend to abusive father. Belittled my abuse. Made up a week later, he started accusing me of hating him/talking behind his back, snapped and told him it was rude. Told me he can't help it due to abuse. He got mad when I suggested a therapist and made the whole thing into how bad of a friend I was. Blocked him. Met him and a friend by chance a month later, gave second chance. Within 24 hours he made me feel like shit and attacked my girlfriend so I blocked him again, only much more rudely this time. Later his friends told me that he can't help his behaviour due to abuse and that some of it was due to past experiences with friends. Now I feel bad, and I'm watching him lose friends day by day and I hope he's doing okay. I'm not sure if I'm the jerk who abused an abused kid, or if I had justification for blocking him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello. I'm 14. I'll try to keep this as unbiased as possible, but feel free to call me out if I accidentally slip as the whole thing has kinda spun me around. I've created a throwaway and changed a few identifying details like age as I don't want him to know I've posted this. I'll call him...Ezra.\n\nLong story short, me and a friend...we've had a rocky relationship. We fought once, back in August, and that was the beginning of the erosion of our relationship. See...he was verbally abused by his father alot when he was younger. I don't know the specifics of it, but I do know that he has lots of issues in terms of self-esteem and depression/anxiety that stems from it. As a result, he would sometimes have these meltdowns...nothing big, but they'd pop up unexpectedly as he had the tendency to go quiet, stew, and randomly get up and leave/end the conversation with an \"I'm upset\". He would get kinda passive aggressive if you didn't check up on him or continued with what you were doing before he did this, as he saw this as proof that you hated or disliked him because he was a bit paranoid on whether or not his friends actually liked him. \n\nIf you did check up on him, however, it would last about an hour of just trying to convince him he was a good person and he wasn't ugly, or stupid, or whatever bad thing he was thinking about himself at this time. During this, he would attack me, say I secretly hated him but I didn't want to admit it, and call me a liar. He was very strict on lying with all his friends. He basically lived by the slogan \"People Lie\" and made sure everyone knew that, because he has trust issues due to his father. That's not unreasonable. Thus, we had to \"prove\" that we weren't lying every time this happened. \n\nThe issue kind of began once summer started. These episodes started to increase in frequency, and if I missed any of them, he'd get really, really angry with me...and, I don't wanna be mean, but start...guilt tripping? Things like \"I guess you \\*do\\* hate me then\" and stuff like that. Doesn't matter if I'm sleeping, with family, swimming, on a plane, or on a date, he kinda expected me to keep doing this whenever he told me about some problems he had, or whenever we spent time together, alone or in a group. I let it go, as while I'm a victim of child abuse myself, everybody has different experiences and I guess, everyone reacts to it differently. Plus, he's younger than me, and I kinda saw him as a \"kid\" and I felt bad, you know? Because at his age, I was also kinda reacting to my abuse, just in different ways. I'd apologize if I missed a session, and continue. It was kind of really emotionally draining to keep doing it....as bad as it sounds, but I still kept pushing myself to, as he really only trusted 3 friends to talk to his problems about: me, my girlfriend, and his other friend, who he looked up to like an older brother. He'd go to my girlfriend first, before me, and then the friend. I didn't wanna keep pushing his issues onto the friend, as usually when it gets to the point where he vents to him, he's at the suicidal/self-harming stage, and I know that's stressful so I tried to help as much as I could at the time. \n\nI'd like to make it known at this time that at this point I started to bring up some stuff that I found kind of hurtful with Ezra, and asked him to stop. Such as the \"ha you hate me\" and the guilt-tripping. He said he couldn't help it due to his abuse, but he'd try. I didn't want to offend him or be seen as insensitive, because hey, abuse is shitty. I don't know if he can or can't help it for sure. If I brought it up again, he would keep repeating that he was trying or that he had already stopped the behaviour...when really, he didn't. So nothing changed. \n\nI don't know...one day, I snapped or something. We were hanging out together...Me, Him, and another friend, I'll call him Ishi. We were playing a team game online when he felt bad about his score, and left abruptly...for the 3rd time that day. And I broke. Instead of helping him like I should have, I cried...because if I was being honest, I really, really hated doing this so much. I told Ishi all about it while I cried -he had no idea before that- and \\*I didn't know he was also texting Ezra at the same time.\\* I just heard a flurry of furious typing and him comforting me. \n\nEzra called me, in bawling, claiming that Ishi called him an attention w\\*\\*\\*\\* and a selfish b\\*\\*\\*\\* and asked me if I agreed. He wouldn't listen to anything I said, he just kept asking \"do you agree with him? Do you agree?\" etc until I caved and told him that he hurt me sometimes when he accused me of hating him and being a liar, when I was only trying to help. At this point I was still with Ishi, and he shared his screen with their texts.\n\n\\*He said none of those things. He just told Ezra that he hurt me, and I was crying. When Ezra said \"I can't help it, I'm trying\" Ishi told him he really...wasn't, and that he was going to end up hurting more friends with his actions if he continues.\\*\n\nTelling Ezra he hurt me...ohhh boy. He went on a rant about how poorly his father treated him, then compared me and Ishi to his father, then yelled at me for not telling him what I was hurt by earlier so he could have stopped (I did) and told me that I hurt him badly by siding with Ishi because out of all the people, I should've understood his actions the most because I was abused. I told him I didn't understand, and he told me I didn't sympathize enough with him and belittled my abuse. This hurt me alot, and in the heat of the moment I called him abusive. He then ranted about me to my girlfriend...for some reason, expecting her to side with him, only for her to get \\*pissed\\* and yell at him before cutting him off. He then went to the last friend, who later confirmed Ezra gave him a really one-sided story.\n\nWe made up a week later, but I held him at a distance because hey, we just fought. It's weird to be super close ASAP. He also agreed that we wouldn't talk about personal issues...which he gradually broke. I spent time with him and Ishi separately because Ishi despises him and Ezra \\*compared him to his abusive father\\*. I kinda fucked up there because that lead Ezra into believing I hated him, and that I was talking about him behind his back with my girlfriend, who still hadn't spoken to him. (I hadn't.) He would drop things like \"Sorry, I just keep thinking that you hate me haha\" or \"My anxiety keeps making me think you and Girlfriend are talking about me behind my back, I'm so silly\". He'd also talk shit about my girlfriend and get mad when I told him that was unacceptable, and say things like \"I cut myself the other day after we fought haha\". One day he just straight up accused me of gossiping about him behind his back. \n\nI was pretty much fed up at that point...I didn't feel like comforting him that day, so I behaved really rudely. I don't know...I was just really stressed and kind of mad that he made me miss my anniversary with my GF because he would keep threatening to commit suicide to her to keep me from talking to him. I told him that he was being really rude, as he kept implying that he couldn't trust me...and that hurt. He told me that due to his abuse, he couldn't trust anyone. I could put the most trustworthy person in the world in front of him and he wouldn't trust them. He told me how his anxiety was so bad he can't attend school. How he tried to kill himself in June because of his depression. When I told him that therapy can help, and asked if he had gone to the school counsellor or his mom, he got offended by how I was implying and assuming he did nothing about his mental health, how he had gone to both but his mom can't pay for it because she won't \"make sacrifices\", whatever that is. How his counsellor was incompetent. \n\nHe ended it with an \"Honestly, just shut the fuck up because you don't know me.\"\n\nI felt awful, and I still do. I can't tell if he's using it as an excuse, or if he really can't help it, because if so, I'm a horrible person for tiring of helping him. But I was hurt. And later than night...I told him I didn't want to be friends with him, and that the last straw was him flipping the whole thing on me after I recommended therapy. I didn't let him respond, I was scared he was going to flip it on me again. I knew he was going to, he told me I should've told him earlier so he could stop, and, in a panic cause I thought he was asleep, I blocked him.\n\nI lost 90% of my friend group that day. He went around telling them extremely onesided stories that I didn't even want t",

That's why I decided to confront him, at first he did not give much importance but when I notice that I was very upset about this he finally told me that none of that had happened and that it was just people with nothing better to do, looking to interfere in our relationship. We discussed a lot about this and although now we are better I don't know if I just let it go, I understand that someone may want to generate drama but there are so many people telling the same story.\nTo add, I know how he behaved in his previous relationships, he did some questionable things but we must consider that he was very immature since I have known him since we have 13.\n\nAITA for not knowing if it is the best thing for me to trust him?

      "description": "For lack of a better term, she’s not my ex, but we dated exclusively for 3 months. And we’ll call her Sadie. Sadie ended things with me a week ago citing that she didn’t have time for a relationship and also felt very cynical about them. Sadie wanted to remain friends. We are supposed to go to my close friend’s NYE party. To be clear it’s his house. I’ve been close friends with the host for 8 years. Sadie’s been friends with him for 2 months and got his contact info at the host’s Birthday party two months ago that we went to together as each other’s dates. My friend group will be there. Sadie’s won’t. The only person she shares a mutual friend with in my friend group is her step sister. We were supposed to go together as each other’s dates well over a month in advanced until she ended things. Today she warned me that she would be bringing her new guy she’s been dating the past week as her date. I was confused since she said she didn’t have time for a relationship; didn’t believe in relationships and love. Sadie told me she met him the day before she decided to end things with me. Sadie has gone on several dates with him over the course of the week and intends on bringing her new guy to the party as her date. I told her that I’m not okay with this. Although I’m upset she’s dating someone else, that she ended things with me for someone else, and completely went back on the reasons she didn’t want a relationship, she’s well within her right to date whomever and whenever she wants. I made this clear multiple times. But I don’t want her date at the party. We got in a huge argument about how she feels I’m being unfair. But I told her I don’t care who she’s dating, I just don’t want to see it because it’s hurtful and unfair to me. That her bringing this guy to my friend group’s party is extremely inconsiderate of my feelings. I told Sadie that she knows I still have feelings for her, and seeing her with another guy only a week after she ended things is hurtful and painful to me. Especially since she replaced me with him and was supposed to be my date to the party. And if the roles were reversed, I wouldn’t be doing what she was. I made it clear that if it was her friend group hosting, she’d be well within her right to bring whoever as a date. But Sadie’s bringing this new guy into my friend group. This is my friend group. Not hers. And that she’s overstepping her boundaries. I think that out of respect for me and my feelings, and the fact that she’s coming to my friend group, and not hers, she shouldn’t bring the guy she left me for. And if she wants to do something with the guy, that’s perfectly fine, but she should do it with her own friend group and make her own plans. The date and two additional friends she’s bringing weren’t even invited on the Facebook group for the party and aren’t on the guest list. Sadie is. Although when the host gets drunk he’s not concerned with who comes. She wouldn’t be going to this party if I didn’t suggest us going together months ago. She usually does NYE with her friend group. So AITA? \n\nTLDR: Ex ended things last week. Is dating someone new despite breaking up with me because she has no time for a relationship. Wants to bring her new guy to a NYE party we’re both going to where we were supposed to be each other’s dates. I’m not okay with it. Party hosted by my friend group. Not hers. New guy isn’t on the invite list. ",

We started talking over text for about a week and then I finally asked her out (I asked her on Monday and the date was the next Sunday) For the first week of us dating, everything was perfect. Then after one week of us dating we kissed for the first time (nothing much just a quick peck on the lips) and the Monday after she just started being super distant. This continued for three weeks, just like she was almost bored with me. During this time, I constantly asked what was wrong and how to fix it. All she said was that she felt stuff was going too fast, and I respected that, I truly did. Then today we broke up and I said to her why was it when I kept asking her how to fix thing and she never tried to do anything or tell me her absolute feelings and I finished that with \"what gives\" and she got pissed.

      "description": "My friend Dave and I are both 29 and have known each other since we were in elementary school, we've lived together the past 3 years. We had discussed whether or not we'd be renewing for a 4th and I wasn't sure because it depended on if things were going well with my girl. He's not happy about it because he doesn't want to move, but worst case scenario he can move in with his grandfather. I got a girlfriend back in August and things have been going well between us so we both agreed I can move in with her instead of renewing my lease in mid February. I told Dave this in early December. Fast forward to yesterday, I'm prepping to move in with my girl and Dave has purchased a house that he'll be moving into in 2 weeks. I'm at work telling a coworker about it and she said I'd be only saving about 300 a month by moving into my girlfriends place that's nearly a 3th the size of the one I'm in now. Why don't I just keep the place I'm in now? So I call my girl and she'd prefer to go to my place since it's way bigger, then I call another friend of mine who needs a place to stay and hes down to move in to help with rent. It's a 4 bedroom townhome. So I bring this idea up to Dave and he flips out calling me a shitty friend and shitty adult with the timing of this plan. The way he sees it I gave him very little time to find a new place to live then changed everything at the last second when he was definitely moving out. Like I pulled strings in order to change out who my roommates are. After things got calmer he recognized that that isn't the case, I'm not pulling strings, I'm just going with the flow, hes not as mad but he's still definitely not happy. AITA?",

      "description": "One of our college professors, among others, likes to joke when lecturing. Unfortunately, some of his jokes are quite disrespectful (i.e. \"Ultrasound is emitted by women who get their whims denied\") - and, unlike other joke types, these also don't bring anything useful to the lecture. I've tried telling him about it several times but he dismissed my concerns with indifferent \"Uh-huh, sure, of course it's not funny\" and, clearly, it did no impact. \n\nI can't skip his course or just be absent because, while not really important, it's still mandatory and he requires us to show notes of his lectures for a grade.  \nI don't think bringing this up to faculty leaders will result in any effect because telling such jokes isn't a crime or something, so why would they bother.  \nI can, technically, suck it up with \"ah, this guy's just a prick\" - but while I want to have a good grade like any student, I would still also like it very much if professors didn't belittle others, including myself, in the process of teaching, no matter how petty their insults are.\n\nSo, I want to get more vocal, maybe even mirror the joke as last resort, in trying to signal him the message or at least get it off my chest (nevermind the *quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi*) when he says something like that again. Would that, however, make me no better than him in the end? ",

Her eyes were wide open and she and she appeared paralyzed. At this point I'm freaking out asking her \" are you okay?\" and \"do you need a glass of water\". She wouldn't respond to me at all, and continued to faintly hyperventalate/appear paralyzed. At this point I'm getting really scared, and ask if she needs me to call an ambulance. She then finally responds by shaking her head no, and saying she just had a terrible nightmare. My worry turns into anger. I tell her to, in the future, please let me know that she's okay when I'm asking her if she's okay. She responds by being upset that I didn't seem at all concerned about her nightmare.\n\nSo Reddit.

      "description": "Sorry for the long post.\n\nI met my ex in a vidoe class in university and we were project partners for the entire class. We hit it off and we liked a lot of the same things. When he asked me out, I said yes because I had a crush on him then. We dated throughout the summer even though we were about 4 hours apart (He went home for the summer). At the end of summer, he asked me to be his girlfriend which again was an yes from me. \n\nBut at some point, the relationship started to fade on my side. It was my first real relationship so I was mostly confused and I thought it would pass. It didn't and I started to close off more and more. \n\nI still stayed with him, trying desperately to see if I could maybe fall in love with him. Eventually I realised that the warm summer crush feeling I had was gone and it wasn't going to come back. I was scared to break up with him because I didn't want to lose our friendship, hanging out with him was still fun but any intimacy he tried didn't do anything for me.\n\nI realised that I had to break up with him but didn't have the courage to do it until a few days before Christmas. We agreed to meet up to play some tabletop games (an interest he got me into) and I made up my mind then that I would break up after the game. We met up and he kept telling me about the plans he had for Christmas. It was getting painful and I just decided to pull off the bandage. I got him away from his friends and broke up with him.\n\nHe wasn't surprised because he said he could tell when a girl was having second thoughts. I felt so guilty and apologized for putting him through this. Then he asked me, \"Why didn't you take the out when I gave it to you?\" That made me a little upset because at that point I still had feelings for him and I was trying to push forward with my slow pace in the relationship. I didn't say anything about it though and just apologized again for hurting him like this.\n\nAt the end of the day, he asked me more uncomfortable questions about our relationship with questions I didn't have answers for. I went home feeling so gulity and upset, he made it sound like I was never interested in our relationship. Am I an asshole for feeling like this?",

      "description": "When I was like 15 (now 19M) I had a small crush on a girl from the other class. Kind of nerdy and shy, but didn't get to know her then. Fast forward 2 years and we end up in the same class. Im usually shy too, but after a garbage fire of a year I kind of stopped caring so I thought i should get to know her at some point. Turns out she is a bit shy and nerdy, and also very good w/ art which I'm really a fan of, as being able to draw has always been something i wanted to get into. Started chatting to her often, for the delight of teasing friends.\n\nAs I got to know her throughout the year though, I started noticing I didn't click much w/ her apart from those mutual interests. I was getting the impression she was very shallow, always judging people for the littlest of things and not giving a damn about what they might think. In my mind it just screamed brattiness. When we were talking she'd almost always go on about how \\*random male actor\\* was handsome and she wanted to marry him, or talking about superheroes or Supernatural (how come that never ends??)\n\nWe started hanging out and it became obvious to me that I lost interest. It was always the same fangirling and listening about her husbands getting married. Later I heard from a classmate that she wanted to hook up w/ me. I really wouldnt know since we'd never talk about anything that'd suggest it. I guess she was waiting on a move from me but dammit it'd feel like forcing myself.\n\n More than once I got in a crossfire w/ her. She once was sure a mutual friend of ours was a psycho for loving guns (despite \"loving guns\" being true, even with some political disagreements we have he never disrespected me, hell he once told me Im one of the only commies he respects) and was pissed when I disagreed. One other time she was arguing with a friend because he was objectifying his (girl)classmates for saying some of them were hot and I find this particularly stupid because nothing in the texts indicated he was demeaning the girls for being hot.\n\nTo the point now. I volunteered to help her in a uni project in which she'd show me characters she made in The Sims and ask what I thought of them, what career they were in etc. I could tell it was something to do w/ prejudice, turns out it was body and sexualization. Earlier, a girl friend of mine posted on her status a pic of a cat with his hands up saying \"her ass was like this big\" and i thought it'd be a nice break from the seriousness of the theme, maybe start a banter even. After I send it, she replies saying \"Wow thats awful. Why do u keep that pic around?\" At that point I got mad red, but only said \"I got it from a fml friend, i thought it was cute and fit the situation\", and after that I havent had any incentive to talk to her again. Shes been sending \"how are you\" texts and I mostly say Im good and tell a pun or smth, but today she said \"its hard talking to me\". Ive yet to respond but honestly, I cant give one fuck. AITA?",

She’s my best friend. \n\nAt the beginning of the school year, something changed in her. She used to be very innocent, she hadn’t ever kissed anyone or been in a relationship of any sort. This year, she started talking to a guy I’ll call AJ. My cousin is a sophomore and AJ is a senior. They started off as friends but they were always really touchy-feely, even as friends. However, my cousin did have feelings for AJ and would talk about him every night. Here’s the thing, AJ is a player, and my cousin knows this. She says she doesn’t have a problem with it because she doesn’t want a relationship, she just “wants him.” \n\nSo my cousin and AJ had made out a couple of times when he invites her over to his friend’s house over spring break. She accepts and long story short, she ends up giving him head. She was 15 at the time and I was led to believe he was 17. On the same day, they did it again. They took a break for awhile but about a month later, AJ asked my cousin to meet him in front of the men’s room at their school. She went and met him there. AJ then leads her into the bathroom and there, she once again gives him head. However, the third time was a little different. She regretted it and told me she was done with him. At this point, she had turned 16 and he had said he’d turned 18. She told me that she didn’t really want to do it but she felt that he expected it, so she did it. I was completely on board with this and so were all of her other friends (we all have a mutual hate for AJ).\n\nAbout a week ago, my cousin tells me wants to fw AJ again. I get pissed, so I get distant. I told her I was mad but then didn’t answer her calls because I needed some time to cool down. We ended up in a group call with a mutual friend who I’ll call Jack. Jack happens to be friends with all of us, including AJ. He informs us that AJ is actually 19, as stated on his student I.D. I “jokingly” said I should call the police (by that I mean I said it sarcastically but at that point I was considering telling my aunt/ her mother). We had an argument while Jack kind of moderated the whole thing.  My cousin said that she understands that I don’t agree with what’s going on, but it’s her life and her choices. Jack said basically the same thing. He doesn’t like what’s happening, but there’s nothing we can do to stop it. \n\nI’ve tried to not say anything since then because I don’t want to lose my cousin/best friend, but I’m really worried. I’m still considering telling someone, but again, I don’t want to lose her. \n\nSorry if there’s more info needed. The story is a lot longer than this but I wanted to try to keep it simple.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I told someone what’s been going on?\n\n",

      "description": "So today I had to take a 4 hour flight. I am a 6 foot tall woman, so airline flights are usually not very comfortable. When I booked my ticket I paid extra for the roomier seats, but unfortunately the seat I really wanted was already taken. So I decided to go with the seat next to it. For reference, [I wanted seat 12F, I went with 12E instead.](https://i.imgur.com/rwS5AUU.png). As you can see from the seating chart, 12F doesn't have a seat in front of it because exit row and a Flight Attendant has a little mini seat on the back of 10F. Unlimited leg room.\n\nSo I board the plane and get to my seat, and the guy sitting next to me in 12F is like seriously 5'6\" MAXIMUM. He was even wearing boots that gave him an extra 3\" or so (not by accident, I'm sure). His head just barely touched the luggage compartments above us when he was standing up straight. Literally the amount of distance to the next seat in front of him was probably longer than his whole body.\n\nSo we take off and of course it's uncomfortable. The guy in front of me immediately reclines, my knees are hitting the back of the chair, and I'm in a middle seat. For the first 30 minutes or so of the flight I kind of readjust myself every few minutes and I am in obvious discomfort. But the guy next to me ignores it and pretends like he can't see the pain that I'm in.\n\nSo I turned to him and said in a very polite tone, \"Excuse me sir, but would you mind switching seats? As you can see my legs make it very difficult to sit in this seat, and I'm sure you'd be just as comfortable here.\" I had looked and he'd have like at least 5 inches between his knees and the seat in front if he was sitting here.\n\nHe snapped back at me in an annoyed tone, \"I booked this seat. I'm not switching.\"\n\nI managed to keep my polite composure and asked again, \"Sir you aren't even using all that leg room and I could really use it. I'm in pain here and I will be for the next 3 and a half hours. Will you please consider it?\"\n\nThen he practically screams back at me, \"Well, some of us get to be tall and others of us get to have comfortable airplane rides! Get what you get!!!\" Then he put on headphones and leaned against the window to pretend like he was sleeping.\n\nI was absolutely taken aback and just kind of sat there in awe. Like this was /r/PublicFreakOut material. This guy thinks that just because he's short and I'm tall, he gets to treat me like shit for asking politely to make my life a little more comfortable? I paid extra for this seat, and he's sitting there with literally his own height in leg room and he sees me suffering and he finds joy in it. Why are short men so jealous and vindictive?\n\nAm I the asshole here for trying to make my life a little more comfortable? He wouldn't have lost any comfort at all.",

      "description": "So I’m working overseas and the company provides transportation to work. Lately there have been a couple issues regarding this. \n\nA couple weeks ago, Coworker A let the driver know he wouldn’t be joining us on the bus. The driver got our names confused and thought he meant me, so they left without me. Coworker B likes to serve as the copilot of sorts, so I messaged him saying that we can’t rely on someone who doesn’t speak our language, and that he shouldn’t have trusted him because I always make a point to message a coworker when I’m not riding (happened only twice so far). I explain that we should all just message the group chat.\n\nFast forward to yesterday and we’re all waiting to leave work. Three coworkers were not on the bus yet, including A &amp; B, and time to leave was approaching. So I sent out a message asking that if anyone isn’t riding, please just let us know. Coworker B responds that he told 3 people he wouldn’t be riding, and I can message him personally if I’m wondering about him. He didn’t realize there were others not on the bus yet. \n\nSo I respond that no one told us about him, and that he should just message the group chat so anyone can verify it easily. He continued to insist that we can just check on him individually and made a big deal about me being short with him, especially after I was mad when they left me two weeks ago. He accused me of wanting them to do the same and check on me, which wasn’t true, I was mad because I thought someone made some shit up about me not riding, not that they didn’t ask me.\n\nOf the three coworkers whom B instructed to relay his message, one wasn’t on the bus yet, and the other two were not being clear whether B would be with us, phrasing it as a question, “B won’t be coming?” No idea why they decided to play that game, but whatever. \n\nSo AITA for asking that everyone just message the group if they’re running late or will be absent, rather than relying on in-person messengers?",

      "description": "As can be told from the title, I'm married and we have a dog.\nHe's a long-haired breed and needs to be trimmed regularly, and also a rescue who's been through some trauma. As a result, while he's lovely with us, he's quite difficult when it comes to strangers. After searching, we found a 'dog salon' that specialises in cases like this, but it's quite far from our place- so getting the dog groomed is basically a day-trip.\n\nNow, the last time I got him groomed, when I went to make the next (recent) appointment it turns out their schedule was packed. The only open time anywhere near where I would have wanted turned out to be my wife's birthday (a Saturday). Before making the appointment, I called her and asked if it was okay if I locked that in. She said fine, no problem.\n\nI thought great, all good, we'll do her birthday the day after. I made reservations for dinner on Sunday and considered the matter resolved.\n\nHowever, come the Friday, she asked me where we were going for birthday dinner tomorrow. I reminded her I was getting the dog groomed on Saturday, and I'd made reservations for the day after instead.\n\nAll hell broke loose. She had understood that we'd be going to dinner after I got back from the trimming, She said that unless we celebrated on the actual day, any gestures meant far less, and I loved the dog more than her. \nI had just figured that rather than forcing it after a trek out to the salon and back, starting Sunday fresh would have been more fun for both of us.\n\nAITA here? I was surprised with how upset she got, but I'm pretty clueless in general so I'd like some objectivity.",

      "description": "So in freshman year in my high school, I made a friend named \"julie\". We were best friends for 4 years. Now I do wanna say that she was usaully deppressed and sometimes suicidal and she would vent to me about her problems. Now what she would say would make me feel sad. Not that any of the things she vented about would involve me, but her personal problems. Now I'm a kind, respectful guy, I'll try to help my friends whenever I can, but the thing is, I liked her a lot, so I wanted to do my best to help her. I would become sad because I cared for her and she kept saying \"I can't wait to die\", which I didn't like hearing. It just would make me sad becaused I liked her and would try to make her feel better. \n\nWell me taking her vents made me depressed sometimes aswell. Sometimes causing me to be stressed out and thinking about death. I was in high school so that was a normal emo phase I guess. But she made it worse.\n\nSo my other best friend, became her bestfriend and she came to like him (Now, I  was jealous because I liked her for 4 years and have actually asked her out multiple times and was rejected all those time. We did date one time but ended quickly because she saw me as a friend, but I still asked her out because I wanted a second chance). The thing is he was getting those vents too, so he will tell me how it made him depressed too, trying to help her feel better and not think suicidal and all that stuff.  So he blocked her on everything she had with him and I kept it a secret because he didn't want her to feel bad about her self because she would think it was her fault. Sooner or later, she found out and did feel bad about herself and so did he. She also found out I was part of hiding him because I would tell her lies about not knowing of him. Before this however, I finally came to myself and knew I wasn't gonna have a chance with her, so I stopped my interests with her and stopped talking to her on a daily basis. The only reason why I dealt with her depressive vents is because I liked her.\n \nSo I apologized about me lying to her and she says \n\n\"ig we're not all friends anymore huh?\"\n\nSince I've lost interest in her and was tired of the stress, there was no point in talking to her, so I say \"up to you.\" Letting her decide.\n\nShe claimes we aren't friends anymore because friends talk to friends but I stopped talking to her anyways, but I felt like I was the asshole because I said \"up to you\", instead of saying \"yes of course\" and dealt with her problems but I didnt want to handle with her vents that made me stress and depressed.\n\nNow, I've just been feeling bad because I was usually there to hear her vents and help her out but now idk who she talks to with her vents. It was me and her other female bestfriend but she's usually busy. As you may know already, she was pretty suicidal and I'm hoping she doesn't do anything to harm herself because now I can't help her because of me.\n\nAITA for letting our friendship die and left her to deal with her problems?",

      "title": "AITA for asking my wife to see a mental health professional after she repeatedly asked me not to",
      "description": "Some background. We are both in our late twenties. She is from an east Asian culture.\n\nMy wife recently graduated with a PhD in an engineering field that isn't doing great economically. She has been self-studying and participated in a well-known bootcamp to change careers into a better paying, higher security job in the tech sector. It has been about a year since she diverted her efforts into a new field.\n\nShe is very stressed out every day. She worries constantly about each interview, to the point where she has trouble falling asleep. Today she had a headache, which stressed her out since she couldn't focus on preparing, which made her headache worse. Her outlook on life has gotten very negative, and almost every time we talk she tells me how she feels stressed because she can't find a job. Most of the text messages I get from her have to do with feeling stressed, or feeling inadequate. She also beats herself up for not acting more confident, saying that it hurt her chances when talking with companies.\n\nFrom my perspective:\n\nOn one hand, I think she is overly pessimistic. She has made tremendous progress in her newly chosen field, but has received a lot of rejection letters which really hamper her confidence and drive her thoughts to dark places. It's hard to change fields, but she thinks she should have found a job by now.\n\nOn the other hand, I really worry about her because it seems like her health (both mental and physical) is suffering a lot. I want her to succeed in whatever she chooses and lead a fulfilled life, but... what I see her living right now is not a life I would wish on anyone, let alone my wife. As a couple, we are doing fine financially thanks to my job (money will never be an issue as long as I am employed, and think I'm decent at what I do). I want to help her with the stress she endures, but I don't know how. I also don't think it's an instance of that stereotype that \"women just need to vent, not solve problems\" -- she can't sleep! I genuinely worry for our future together and whether she will be alive for it, at the rate things are going.\n\nThis is where I genuinely need help to see clearly. She has repeatedly asked me not to ask her to see a mental health professional, and after a certain amount of time, I have always eventually asked her to see one. From her perspective, it is disrespectful that I have repeatedly gone against her wishes. I see her suffering every day, and it seems so painfully obvious to me that she needs help beyond what I can provide. My position is not coming from a place of disrespect, but from a place of concern. It is true, however, that I have repeatedly gone against her wishes.\n\nWhy doesn't she want me to ask her this? Well, there was a period of time when we weren't doing as well as a couple, maybe 2 years ago. I insisted we seek counseling. After a time, it didn't seem to be helping our marriage, so I asked for a divorce and refused to see the counselor further. Eventually we worked things out, but ever since that time, if I recommend seeking professional help for any kind of problem, she says it reminds her of that time.\n\nHonestly, I do think IATA for what happened before. I regret it a lot. I broke her trust by asking for a divorce -- something one should never, ever do unless they are 100% going to go through with it. It will take time, a lot of time, and a lot of work to rebuild that trust, and it will never be the same. But I know I can do it now, even though I couldn't before, because I've worked on myself *a lot* learned how to manage my anxiety to the point where it's basically not an issue anymore. I don't get worked up by things like I used to, which is probably the main reason I had previously asked for a divorce -- I didn't know how to cope with my own feelings and thought it would be easier to run away.\n\nBut this isn't about what happened before. That's just context for this situation. I think she's justified somewhat, if bringing this up is indeed a trigger for trauma, but I also think it's just something we need to work past in order to address the current problem. (I mean, it does need addressing right? She's not sleeping!)\n\nSo AITA? If I am being an asshole, are there any ways for me to be a support for her in this situation beyond just listening and watching her kill herself slowly?\n\nMore generally, I am open to any and all feedback, advice, and *constructive* criticism.\n\nPS. I'm not asking her to finance treatment herself, obviously.",

      "description": "I started a job at a high-end grocery store in September and it’s been an absolute nightmare. \n\n1. My coworkers are cruel. Incessant gossiping even when I made it clear I was uncomfortable (told me about miscarriages, divorces and inner dramatics). They guilt trip everyone about time-off, back handed comments and the works. It’s just been toxic for me. \n2. My commute is 1.5 hours each way totaling 3 hours per day of traveling. \n3. We work outside all day, everyday. Rain, wind, homeless people have threatened us multiple times. We don’t have a space to work inside so we basically reside in a covered tent with a heater for 8+ hours everyday. \n\nOkay now for the asshole part: \nI LOVE my bosses. I have 2 of them in my department and they’re awesome ladies! The only issue I have with either of them is that they argue with each other constantly and it makes the day intense but that’s only when they’re together. Even my store director is amazing and comes out to check on us regularly. \n\nI’ve been planning on putting in my 2 week notice on December 15th so my last day would be Sunday December 30th, that way I wouldn’t leave them completely hanging for Christmas and New Years Eve (two of our busiest days) BUT we are already pretty short handed and one other coworker just up and quit yesterday leaving us even less covered. \n\nWould I be the asshole for adding to my bosses stress load by quitting or should I do what’s right for myself?",

      "title": "AITA for playing Dungeons and Dragons?",
      "description": "I have been playing in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign for almost a year at this point. The group originally started as a bunch of strangers who met on Meetup. It was a pirate themed dark and gritty campaign, and we swashed and buckled our ways to glory and adventure. I even convinced my sister, long time closet nerd, to come out and play with us. Things were going great until last session.\n\nFor the past couple of sessions, my character was going through some trauma. His best friend died (one of the players had to leave the campaign for work reasons), the new party member was being rather confrontational to him (she claims she didn't know it was affecting me as bad as it was), and to top it off, due to a curse, he aged 25 years, going from age 24 to 49 in an instant. And even though I tried to joke it off, I was really bummed, and my character was pretty bummed too.\n\nCue the events of last session. We discovered that we were being duped by our employer, and had one of his henchmen tied up. A character that we had shared many a laugh with. We determined that he was not complicit in betraying us, and was just an innocent guy. He was clearly not a threat, so we untied him. That's when one of the other players decided that he was still a liability, and nuked him with a Blight spell, instantly killing him.\n\nI basically proceeded to lose my shit. Tempers flared, harsh words were exchanged, and when the dust settled, I had to leave the session to calm down. Later, when things had calmed down, I got in contact with the DM of the game and apologized for losing my cool, but let him know that I don't want to participate in an Evil campaign. I'm not for that at all. \n\nI was summarily belittled, talked down to, and kicked from the game. The DM claimed that I should have known the game was an Evil campaign, though it wasn't marketed that way, and that if I clearly couldn't handle something 18+. That last line was particularly hurtful, as I have been mocked for a while because I was the youngest player at the table by 10 or so years, something they have mocked me for in the past. \n\nI feel bad about the whole situation. Especially after getting my sister involved. And while I shouldn't have reacted the way I did, I do think that it's not alright to just decide on a whim to make the campaign Evil like that. But everyone involved in the situation is painting me to be the villain, where the murderer player and the DM that let it happen are in the clear. Even my sister (who is still going to play) has been blaming me for stepping out of line.\n\nI just want to know what others think. Just how wrong am I in this situation? \n\nTLDR: I stayed in a DnD campaign with people whose playstyle didn't line up with mine for too long, and things boiled over. Now I'm being painted as the villain, even though the real instigators still get to play. AITA?",

They then called me the next day saying he has been slowly dying for awhile now. His liver was failing, he was starving and wouldnt eat (extremely malnourished), and he couldnt move. I was sobbing as i knew this kitty for a year now. I went in and held him as he was put down, i couldn't stop crying but i gave him kisses and sang to him and he went peacefully. My fiances brother found out and told me pretty much that i was a murderer and to take responsibility. Me being a very sensitive gal who loves all animals, hid in the room while my fiance went to the family who had oddly put up posters of the missing cat and told them which they seemed not to care. I still have problems with myself and i feel like a terrible person. But everyone is saying that i did nothing wrong. ",

      "description": "About eight months ago my friend and his fiancé asked my wife and I to be in their wedding party. At the time, my wife was pregnant but since the wedding is in April she would have already had the baby. We ended up having a miscarriage, and after taking some time to get each other through it we’re back for round two. \n\nThis time around the baby is due two weeks after the wedding. When I told him we were pregnant again I expressed that it was going to “be a little interesting” being so close to the wedding, but that was the extent of our conversation. That was about two months ago.\n\nLast week, he told me he wanted to meet up, and he asked me what we were thinking about being in the wedding party so close to her due date. I was honest with him, I told him that we were a little nervous because she’s never been 8 months pregnant before, and after losing our first kid we’ve been doing everything possible to mitigate stress in our life. I followed that up with “but we love you guys and we would do anything for you.” And also added that if they were uncomfortable with us being in it that I completely understood. \n\nUltimately I spoke with my wife and we decided to take the bench on the wedding party. He said that was fine and that they just wanted us to be happy and enjoy our time at the wedding. \n\nFast forward a week, a mutual friend of my wife and the bride to be says “bride is very hurt that neither you or your husband reached out to her personally about the wedding.”\n\nSo, now there’s nonsense talking behind backs, and my wife’s gut feeling was that they wouldn’t have brought it up if they didn’t want us out of the wedding.\n\nSomething I might add, is that the bride hasn’t ever texted my wife in the four years we’ve known her as far as I can remember. I don’t even know if they have each other’s numbers.\n\nThoughts? Opinions? Did I fuck up here? \n\nTLDR: wife’s due date is two weeks after buddy’s wedding, so we opted out of being in the wedding party. Now bride to be is upset because we didn’t go to her directly.",

      "title": "AITA for inconveniencing my group of friends by having someone in our social circle blocked?",
      "description": "Lengthy post, TL;DR is at the bottom. \n\nFor context, none of us have ever actually met the person that I have blocked because he lives across the country and was introduced to us through online gaming by a mutual friend. I’ll refer to him as David. I have never considered him a friend. The rest of the group consists of my close personal friends who I’ve grown up with and known since childhood. \n\nMy friends and I like to play PlayStation with each other and communicate with the “party” function. Someone creates a party and we can all join it and talk to each other through voice chat. About a year ago David was introduced to the party by a mutual friend and he’s been interacting with us ever since. Admittedly I never liked him from the start, he’s not someone that my group of friends would like had we known him in person, but I tried to be nice at first. One day my dogs were howling loudly and it was coming through the party chat so I muted my microphone because I think it’s rude and David said “you know what would make your dogs be quiet? Rat poison”. He says stupid stuff like this a lot and my friends do shit talk each other for fun, but I really didn’t like that especially coming from someone I don’t really know so from this point on I avoided dealing with him whenever possible. \n\nA few months later he gets in an argument with one of my friends about a mistake that was made in a game to which David says “yeah well your daughter was a mistake”. When we talk shit to each other it can get pretty degenerate, but I don’t ever talk about someone’s family. This crossed the line and we all yelled at him. Some time later when I wasn’t there one of my friends went off on David and we all blocked him on all forms of social media. Life was good. \n\nDavid has what I think is kind of a weird obsession with the sort of “glue” member of my friends group who everyone gravitates towards so eventually everyone unblocked him except me because my friends are too nice. I say they’re too nice because in our group text most of us have agreed we don’t like him and don’t owe him anything since we don’t actually know him outside the internet, but I’m the only one who cut ties permanently. This is where the inconveniencing starts.\n\nWe suspect David has his phone set to alert him whenever the “glue friend” logs on to PlayStation because David almost always immediately starts a party and invites him so everyone ends up in there. Being that I have David muted to where we can’t hear each other I don’t want to join his party because it would seem weird to me, but he’s *always* there. My friends think this is annoying because it usually leads to them having to create a new party before I’ll join even though I ask them not to and I just tell them I’ll play another time. It also leads to general awkwardness when we play games when both David and myself are there. They say I should grow up and just unblock him, but I have zero desire to have any interactions with someone that I detest and I don’t know why they won’t tell someone none of us really like to begin with to fuck off. Am I the asshole for not just making things easier by unblocking him?\n\nTL;DR\nAm I the asshole for causing general awkwardness for my friends by having someone I don’t like muted when we play online games?",

      "description": "My wife was at a friends at the weekend and the friends husband got too drunk and told my wife about the incident on my stag weekend, 18 months ago, about us both being caught by a doorman taking coke in the toilet of a nightclub. (He conveniently left out the part about him taking drugs)\n\nThe doorman couldn’t have been nicer about it to be fair. Just told us to stop it and maybe move on to a different club if that’s what we came here to do. We left and nothing more was said. Guy even recommended a few other bars as we walked out.\n\nThe next day my wife’s giving me a lectures about irresponsible it was. She knows I’ve taken drugs socially in the past and never really cared. All I keep hearing is what it id been arrested and charged with possession, what if the bouncers has beaten me up, what if her family had found out about it...?\n\nI’ve explained it was 18 months ago. Nothing bad happened. Nothing like that has happened since and I don’t plan on taking coke again because I’m now married with a kid and put my family before anything else. \n\nShe’s dragging this on and on, and says I should have told her as soon and I got home and need to be 100% honest straight away about things like that. It makes her wonder what else I’ve not told her. (Which is nothing because I’m actually a fairly boring guy)\n\nAm I the asshole for not telling straight away?  Which would have potentially cancelled my wedding going by how she’s reacted 18 months on. ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to play with my younger brother anymore?",
      "description": "For  a little bit of background, I'm 15, my half-brother is 10. My parents  split up when I was a year old. I live with my dad throughout the week  and stay at my mom's on weekends. About a year or two after that she  married my step father (kind of a douchebag but I guess it could be  worse). Anyways, my half brother was born when I was 5 and we've been  getting along okay for the most part except for when we fight.\n\nYesterday, we were playing Mario Kart on the Switch that *I*  got for Christmas from my dad. I was beating him every round we played  and I could tell he was getting angry so I told him that we should take a  little break now. Really I just didn't want him to start screaming and  crying because I knew that I'd be getting yelled at before anyone even  asked what happened. I told him to just relax, we'd play later. He gave  in but not without ranting to his dad who said that I was mean to just  stop when \\[brother\\] had so much fun. Well, I don't know about you guys  but a 10 year old dark red in his face being so upset he was shaking  does not look to me like someone having fun.\n\nI was pissed but okay, I went into my room to relax a bit. Some time later in the day my brother came into my  room, took \"his\" controller (the one I usually lend him) and asked if we  could play again. I told him that I didn't feel like playing Mario Kart  anymore today. He was getting upset and kept begging. I didn't give in  so he demanded I give him my Switch so he could practice. Once he  realized that that wasn't gonna happen either, he tried to grab my  Switch. I got it first and put it somewhere out of his reach. He got  furious and slammed the controller he was holding on the ground, then  ran out of my room crying and screaming how much of a jerk I was. Well.  Turns out he pretty much destroyed the controller now, I checked. There seems to be some kind of malfunction, you can't play with  it properly anymore.\n\nA few moments after that, my mom came into my room yelling at me how horrible I was yadda yadda.\n\nNow I'm fairly positive I wasn't an asshole in this situation.\n\nWhat  I do wanna know is, AITA for not wanting to play with my brother at all  anymore? Shit like this happens every single weekend and I'm sick of it. I  pretty much only get in trouble with them when it's about  their \"golden boy\" (which in turn makes me the rotten boy or  what?). I know this isn't really his fault, he's just a kid with  anger issues but still I can't stand it anymore. I'm sick of spending  my weekends stressing about doing something small to set off my brother  and then getting yelled at. I know at first I will get into trouble for  making him cry because I won't play with him but in the long run I think  it will benefit me.",

I said sure let me see a pic but she said no she wants it to a be true blind date. I thought this was interesting and she set it up for us to meet infront of this restaurant downtown. Long story short we met and she was this nice black girl, and we went in and had a good time getting to know each other, I was a perfect gentleman and I paid and everything. At the end of the night when we were taking an uber back to where we live, (we live walking distance apart coincidentally) I didn't like initiate any intimacy or anything and just gave her a hug and said have a good night.

And I had to break it to her while trying my hardest to not be racist that I'm not into black girls.

      "description": "This happened last night while on a date with a girl I was seeing.\n\nIt was around the 10th time we've had a date and we decided to visit a new Bar/Restaurant in our area. We went in and the place was very busy, but the bar itself had some space so we decided on that. I am a Detroit Red Wings fan (NHL Hockey team), and was wearing a hat with their logo on it. As we went to sit down a guy sitting at a table nearby said, \"The Red Wings are shit and we don't want their fans here\". I turned and looked and he had a big grin on his face. Figuring he was just joking around I grinned back and we sat down.\n\nWe had a couple drinks, and maybe an hour had passed. We were talking and I hear from the same guy, \"Must not have heard me when I said the Red Wings are shit\". I heard him the first time and I was hearing him now. My back was towards him and I chose not to acknowledge it or turn around. All of a sudden I took a massive smack to the side of my head. It was hard enough that it knocked my hat off, which seemed to be his intention, and nearly knocked me off the elevated bar stool I was on. \n\nI was angry of course, so almost immediately I grabbed my hat and headed for the door. I only got about 2 steps before he grabbed the hood part of the hooded sweater I was wearing, and pulled me back towards him. I spun around and threw a punch that hit him in the mouth/jaw area. He fell to his ass, but instantly got up and headed towards me before a few people close by got in between us and said that's it that's it. \n\nThe guy went the other direction and into the washroom. The bar manager came over and said he wasn't going to call the police, but that I needed to leave. I paid and we left. We took a cab home which was a completely silent ride. We stopped at my house first, and I asked if she wanted to come in and she said no. We said goodnight and I went inside.\n\nAn hour or so later she called me and said she didn't want to see me anymore. I obviously knew the reason, but I didn't think what I did was unreasonable so I asked, why? She said that I embarrassed her, and that she doesn't want to spend time around someone who uses violence to solve a problem. I asked her what she thought I was supposed to do, and she said I should have just walked away. I just said ok, and that was the end of the conversation.\n\nI don't feel like an asshole and I wouldn't do anything different if it happened again, but AITA? ",

      "description": "I'm Korean fully bilingual in English and Korean, but I look Japanese and I live in an area known for Japanese population.\n\nI have been going to a neighborhood Korean grocery store every week for almost a year, and I am certain all the employees think I'm Japanese because they always speak English to me and never in Korean, which they will do if they assume the customer is Korean.\n\nOne particular female Korean cashier always shit-talks at customers by mumbling in Korean while checking out. But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.\n\nCouple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.\n\nUnsurprisingly she then mumbled \"Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke\". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.\n\nShe does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.\n\nI just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.\n\nAITA if I report the manager about her?\n\nTL;DR Korean grocery store cashier doesn't know I'm Korean and always shit-talks at customers, did it to me recently as well, want to report her to the manager but don't want her fired.

      "description": "So here’s the situation. My partner (M/29) and I (F/31) have been looking into adopting a dog for awhile. Last week we found an adorable sweetheart of a pit bull, 3 year old female. She came home with us on trial and was so well behaved. We wanted our family and friends to meet her as part of the trial. Everyone loved her until my partner’s parents came over to our home to meet her. As soon as they entered the house, there was this immediate tension. His mother made a shocked comment about the dog’s breed and both of his parents stood glued to the door obviously uncomfortable. The dog picked up on the tension and started acting skittish and even growled at them. \n\nThey left quickly and soon after we got a message from his mother stating that they would never enter our home with the dog present and refused to be around her. At this point I’m angry and completely confused. \n\nMy partner finally explains that his parents have preconceived opinions. He also tells me that he personally had a bad experience with a pit and was not comfortable with the entire adoption. \n\nAm I in the wrong here for being extremely angry that, first off, he didn’t tell me his family’s opinions or his own experience? And second, he didn’t tell his mother before coming over so she would have know what to expect? \n\nIn the end, we have to end the trial and give this sweet girl back. In addition, I am worried if his mother’s opinions are going to make such a huge impact on our relationship and decisions? AITA? \n\n",

      "description": "Not brief backstory: I'm the youngest of four, and the only girl. My brother's are 5 -8 years older. When I was 10 my family moved to another town my mom told my dad he wasn't going to be moving in with us. We lived in a very rural town and my dad moved to a nearby city.\n\nAt that time my brothers were in their late teens and weren't around a lot. After the move my mom became incredibly emotionally abusive and manipulative, especially towards me. Without getting into too much detail she tried to convince me that men are evil and would only ever be interested in me for sex, implied that my own dad shouldn't be trusted around me b/c 'he thought of me the same way he used to think about her', she repeatedly would talk shit about my dad to me and my brother's and encouraged us to join in, told us stories that painted him in a horrible light, would coax me to skip the weekends I was suppose to see him, ect. When I asked for money she would tell me to get a job but when I wanted to apply to one she wouldn't let me a because it would be too much of a burden on her and my brother's to drive me to work. As well, from the age of 12 onward I wanted to move in with my dad and when I told her she would tell me things like \"if you move in with him I won't get anymore money and I won't be able to afford the house\", or \"you'll have to go to court and tell everyone in court why you want to live with him and not with me\".\n\nWhen I was 16 I was dating a guy for 6 months and wanted to go on birth control, we weren't having sex yet but I wanted to be safe. She REFUSED to take me to the doctor. I tried to talk to her, even asked my boyfriends mom to talk to her, and she wouldn't budge. She thought me going on birth control was an excuse to be a slut. So my boyfriends mom said she would take me after school without my mom knowing. The morning of I took a $20 from my mom's wallet thinking I could pay for the birth control. I knew my bf's mom would offer to pay, but I felt so not in control of the situation I just wanted to do one thing for myself, even if it was paying for it. (I know that doesn't justify it, and what I did was wrong, I just remember feeling so helpless.) My mom caught me and yelled at me and I panicked out and ran out of the house. I was genuinely afraid of her. That day I called my dad, told him everything and lived with him from that point on.\n\nI've tried to give my mom another chance. And when we talk about what happened in the past she dismisses it and says she did nothing wrong. \n\nSo 3 years ago (I was 21) she came to see me, spent the day with me and my boyfriend, and when she left I decided I no longer wanted her in my life, and haven't spoken to her since. Not even to tell her why I haven't reached out. Just kinda of ghosted her. My dad and boyfriend think I should reach out to her.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: my mom was emotionally abusive and manipulative, 3 years ago I decided I wanted her out of my life and ghosted her.",

      "description": "Bit of a back story,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are immigrants, and can barely speak the language here regardless of being in the country for 30+ years.\n\nI was severely abused as a child (beaten to the point of hospitalization on a couple occasions). I took these beatings often times for myself and to protect my little sisters (all of us are girls). My dad is an alcoholic and my mom has joined him in drinking over the years. He's had multiple DUI's caused a lot of family issues, financial issues for us, my mom never was willing to leave him, I stuck around to protect my sister because my mom was always working. We are all adults in our mid-late 20's now, great jobs and making a decent amount of money enough to support our own lives. \n\nMy dad recently got out of jail, we used this time to get my mom back on her feet, she's working again now and seemed to be \"okay\". We've tried to put my dad in therapy, rehab, everything to waste money we didn't have and it's been a long hopeless road that we are not willing to die on.\n\nI got a call while at work this morning, my dad was wasted, stole my moms car, drove himself to the probation officers office and was not able to understand what was required of him. This is not a new things for us, I pick up and the probation officer told me that he had denied the fact that he drank or that he drove (he hasn't had a license in 10 years due to multiple DUI's). I asked her to put the phone on speaker, explain to him what she was saying and hung up. He's been calling me to help him, I've been ignoring it, my mom's been calling me, which I'm sure is to leave work and go help him, but I really don't want to, I've wasted enough of my time on this BS. I'm happy, siblings are safe and happy, I'm not willing to deal with this.\n\nThe issue is that my mom is doing well, going to work properly and getting her mental health in check, if I choose not to help, my mom will fall back into drinking with him, stop going to work to drive him around to these appointments, and I'll end up with 2 alcoholic parents again.\n\nAITA here if I continue to refuse to help?\n\nI don't know what my options are..I'm just tired after having made soo many sacrifices for my wellness and my siblings wellness.",

      "description": "I met \"Jeremy\" about a month ago on Tinder. We had a nice first date and agreed to see each other again and in the last month I've seen him maybe 2-3 times a week. It's definitely not a \"fireworks at first sight\" situation but I like him and it's one of those relationships that are great for what they are, and MAYBE there's a chance of something more developing someday. But I just don't feel any real spark but I like him more and more every time I see him  so again, MAYBE there will be a spark eventually. \n\nI saw him on Sunday and he took me to a hockey game which is my favorite sport. I had to work so I met him there and as he was walking me back to my car he asked what my Valentine's Day plans are. I told him very directly that it's not really a holiday I care to celebrate and I preferred to work anyways since it's usually really good money. We aren't really to the kiss goodbye point so I gave him a hug and thought that was that. \n\nI'm super busy this week so I didn't plan on seeing Jeremy at all but then last night I got this call from him at like 8pm and it was clear he'd been drinking. He first asked me if I'd reconsider. I told him that I was sorry that I was already on the schedule for work. He then went into this tirade that he'd spent the last two weeks getting dinner reservations at the nicest restaurant in town (as an aside...thanks dude...made me feel good that the restaurant I work at isn't the nicest even though we have a Michlelin star), a carriage ride and then a rose petal bath back at his apartment (we have not been intimate yet!). I told him that I was very clear with him that I would rather work and aside from that I'm just not into the holiday and after seeing me for almost a month, I hoped he'd get the idea that I'm way more of a hockey game followed by hot wings girl as opposed to rose petals.  \n\nHe then literally told me I was acting like an asshole and told me that the relationship had two parts and maybe that HE liked rose petals and baths and romantic dinners. I told him that was great and I'm not opposed to those things, but I really wanted to work because I'm saving money for my Eurail trip this summer. That caused a whole other thing because I guess I hadn't told him that I'm leaving for the summer. Anyways he hung up on me.\n\nThis morning he texted me sort of like a non apology/apology and that made me feel bad and that maybe I should give him a chance especially if he did work so hard to get a reservation and make these plans. But on the other hand I was pretty clear with him what my plans were when he asked and it's really not my fault that he made elaborate and romantic plans for what was a two week old relationship at that point. \n\nI'm very, very torn. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: using a new reddit account. Pray for Moja. \n",

      "description": "I'll try to be as concise as I can, it's not that long of a story but there's a lot of backstory. I apologize in advance for spelling mistakes (english is not my first language) and for formatting (I'm on mobile). tl;dr at the end\n\nI have this group of friends and we are all pretty close since we were 15-16 (I'm in my twenties); we hang out together almost every weekend, spend holidays together and go all on vacation. Last year one of the friends in the group, let's call her S, met this guy, O, and they started dating. Pretty fast she started ditching us for him, making up excuses to not go out with us, missing birthdays, not answering texts on the group chat and straight up ignoring us. Other things happened and we all fought with her for stuff she did all throughout the year; in October we decided to all talk to her to try and solve the situation (she was not only ignoring us and fighting with us for everything but she started to talk behind our backs too) and we had a fight, with her leaving the group chat and blocking some of us on social media. \n \nYesterday we were together for one of my friend's birthday party: we went to eat a restaurant and then stayed all at her house to spend some time together. Around 1 a.m. I decided it was time to leave because it takes me 20ish minutes to drive home and I was also giving a ride back home to one other friend (let's call her E). We jumped in my car and a couple of blocks after there was this car parked on the side of the road with the lights on. Now, I forgot to say that O's car is very recognizable: it's red, has a lot of bodywork and a spoiler. And the car on the side of the road was exactly the same. Both me and E recognized it as his car and we looked inside when passing by; inside we saw a guy looking a lot like O and a girl, who was definitely not S, kissing. We were both were so shocked I had to turn around and check again if it really was him. We still were not 100% sure but there's not many cars like his, plus it didn't make sense for him and S to meet there since she lives in another town. We write everything in the group chat and we are all pretty shocked and bummed for S, because even if she was kind of a bitch to us we still think of her as a friend. \n\nThis morning one of S's closest friends in the group, M, decided to write her to meet up and talk to her about what me and E saw and asked me about all the informations; I told her everything and totally supported and pushed her decision to talk to her. I wanted to do it myself, but S blocked me on all social media. M tries to convince S to go out but S doesn't want to, saying that if M wants to talk about her boyfriend then they don't need to talk because her boyfriend did nothing wrong (which is a very weird thing to say when someone wants to talk to you). M told her about the kissing situation and S started telling her off, saying things like \"my boyfriend is not a monster, he loves me\" \"you just want to ruin my relationship\". After that convo, S's dad called M and told her to back off and that he would sue her and beat her up for calling his daughter (yeah, it's a pretty fucked up situation). \nNow I feel like I'm totally responsible for what happened and for involving M in the situation. M is undestandably very scared that something might happen to her because of S's dad and I think it would have been better if I didn't convince M to talk to S. \nSorry if this is confusing, I hope it's still understandable enough to give me some advice and tell me if I am the asshole or not.\n\nTl;dr I saw my ex-friend's boyfriend kissing another girl, convinced a mutual friend to tell her and my mutual friend ended up fighting with her and got threatened by my ex-friend's dad because of me.

      "description": "I really hate that I even have to ask, given how small I thought this was. At this point it has come up multiple times and I just need another perspective on it.\n\nThis happened a couple weeks ago.\n\nI'm drinking with my friend Brittany and Drake. We're all having a nice time just sitting and shooting the shit. To give some background, Brittany and Drake dated back in high school. We are now in our senior year of college for context. They are no longer dating, and haven't been for awhile now. Drake is aware that Brittany has since dated other people and are now just friends. They hook up occasionally, but that's the extent of their relationship. \n\nWhile we're all taking Brittany brings up her friend Kyle. Kyle has been very open about his attraction to Brittany. At one point last year he even mentioned to Drake how he couldn't keep his eyes off of her at a party. At the end of October Kyle kissed Brittany in an attempt to get with her I guess. Brittany tells me about it the next day very casually, not as a secret nor in confidence. \n\nBack to when we're all talking. Brittany brings up our plans for new year's and how we plan to get a hotel and go out to a a nice club. She mentions trying to convince Kyle to come out with us. In response to that I ask \"Dude, how has that been since he kissed you?\" The room goes silent. As it turns out, not to my knowledge, Kyle and Drake have been best friends since childhood. As you can assume, making a move on a good friend's ex does not bode well with him. They (Brittany and Drake) then start to fight for a good 2 hours over the whole ordeal. \n\nOriginally, I felt awful. I really had no intention to start any drama, nor did I know this was some big secret. But now it has gotten to the point where this has been brought up multiple times. It's been brought up how I'm a blabbermouth and don't know when to keep something secret. Now, while I still feel bad, I don't know how I was supposed to inherently know this was a big deal. I was not aware of the connection between Kyle and Drake. \n\nI try to stay out of stuff like this, but I just need to know if I broke some kind social code?? Am I the asshole for bringing that up?

      "description": "A couple of weekends ago, I went to go visit some friends from a college club. Ever since I graduated and started working last summer, I haven't been able to spend time with this group (most are still in school), so I was really happy to get invited to hang out. Now, I live about an hour and a half away from the university and unfortunately, there was a huge accident on the freeway, so it took over two hours to get there. I was pretty tired and hungry when I go to the house where the get-together/party was being held at, so I asked the hostess (let's call her Kim) about food. She tells me that another guy, Alex (not his real name), is picking up food for everyone at a local restaurant so I should tell him what I want. I tell Alex my order and I continue on with the gathering.\n\nSo a while later, Alex comes back to the house with everyone's food and he calls all the guests' names out one-by-one to give them their dinner. I wait patiently...and he never calls my name out. I keep waiting and noticed that every single guest got their food, while I still stood there empty-handed. Maybe I'm being a little over-dramatic, but I felt a little embarrassed and humiliated when nobody else noticed that I had nothing. I ended up going into the house's kitchen to get some water and I see Kim and Alex huddled together and talking. I got up to them say something like \"hey, I didn't get my meal. What happened?\" Alex looked a little horrified/embarrassed, while Kim apologized and offered to cook me something instead. Now, I guess due to a combination of being really hungry, tired, and frustrated about having a long commute and getting stuck in traffic, I got really upset. To me, it felt that Kim's make-up offer was half-assed and was more or less trying to cover up for Alex's mistake so that way he didn’t have to go back to the restaurant. It didn't feel fair that everyone else got nicer meals (including Kim and Alex), while I was going to end up with something like a cup of noodles or scrambled eggs. Luckily I kept my composure and told them it was fine (even though it really wasn't) and that I didn’t need anything. I was still upset afterwards, so I ended up leaving the house and drove back home without telling anyone. When I got home, I didn't get any messages from them asking where I was, other than a \"I hope everyone had a fun time!\" message from Kim in our Facebook group chat. It's been nearly two weeks, and nobody in the group has reached out to me, and I'm too upset/embarrassed to reach out to them on my own.\n\nNow, are my feelings valid, or am I in the wrong here? ",

      "description": "Earlier this week my brother asked me to cook him and his girlfriend lunch. In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).",

      "title": "AITA for not paying my plumber?",
      "description": " This happened a few years ago but I still worry about if I was an asshole here or not.  There had been an influx of new subcontractors in my area due to a booming construction industry in our somewhat small town. One plumber in particular I had become acquainted with was one of these guys. He had come from across the country looking for work 3-4 years earlier and had done a good job from what I could tell. When he found out I was building a house, he begged me to do the plumbing. He told me he would do it for $1,000 cheaper than my best bid. The best bid came back at 12k and true to his word, he agreed to 11k.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything seemed to be going fine although we had our typical minor disagreements about certain things. At the end of the job, I paid them and these two guys basically had decided they were moving back home as the economy was tanking nationwide. I go to pull my certificate of occupancy and find out that while the plumbing for the water had been approved, the gas had failed due to a minor issue with an extra emergency shutoff that was required. I called the plumbers and they basically never responded to me. So I called the building inspector and he informed me that another guy was actually the plumber of record for the gas portion of the project. It was a guy I'd never heard, never met, and had never been to my house. I found out that my plumber had a plumbing license but didn't have a license for gas line installation in my state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I'm in a jam. I need to move in in a couple of days and to get them off as the plumber of record and get someone new on who may then have to take responsibility for the work already complete would be nearly impossible and certainly can't happen in time for me to move in. So I called the plumber of record and told him the situation and asked him to come fix the issue. He told me it would be $275 and he'd be there the next day. He asked me if I would pay him and I told him I had already paid the other guys who he pulled the permit for. He said that had nothing to do with him and I would have to pay him. I told him I would.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe fixed the plumbing and got it inspected and then sent me an invoice. At this point,I called him and told him I didn't appreciate him pulling a permit on my house for an unlicensed plumber and that we had two options. First, he could walk away from the $275 and chalk it up as a loss, or I would pay him but only after we had a conversation with the state licensing board about what he had done and why I felt it was inappropriate. He cursed me and hung up and that was the end of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that I feel bad about is lying to him. I knew I wouldn't pay him but I also was in a tight spot. I had to have him specifically out there to fix it and felt like I had no other options. Anyway, it's been weighing on me for ten years. Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I (19f) live in a tiny 3 bedroom apartment with 2 other girls (both 20). In October 2018 one of my room mates, we will call her Kayla, reported me to the manager of our apartment complex for having my boyfriend at the time sleep over almost every single night. This really infuriated me at the time because my ex and I never bothered her/were excessively loud and we mostly stayed in my room. In fact, she frequently came into my room and hung out with both of us. \n\nKayla and I were really good friends and personally I would never do something like that to one of my friends. Upon talking to management I learned that I was violating the lease by having a guest stay so many consecutive nights and the fine for that was $500 and Kayla knew about the fine when she reported me. I just felt like she could’ve talked to me before doing something so drastic. And I questioned for a long time whether I want to be friends with someone that would do something like this. I found it to be petty and highly dramatic considering we are all friends and my ex and I never bothered her. \n\nFast forward to now, my ex and I have been broken up since January so the tension surrounding him being at our place so much was gone. Kayla and I have both been putting in effort to be better friends to one another and we had been getting a long fairly (we’ve butted heads many times in the past). Also noteworthy, Kayla now works at the apartment complex office. \n\nAbout a month ago she got out of a long-distance relationship and began fucking our downstairs neighbor. He has stayed at our place quite literally every single night since they met except for the occasion where they sleep at his place. \n\nThis sort of fuels me with rage because 1) she reported me and could’ve gotten me a $ 500 fine 2) her jobs partially consists of enforcing rules such as the guest limit 3) after she reported me we were on the outs for months 4) she barely knows this guy, my guy and I had been dating for a year. He stays all day and all night. Not just sleeping up with her. Also want to note that she has started treating me like chopped liver since he came around. \n\nIm really really tempted to report her to the office the same way she reported me with no warning. I would kind of feel guilty if it affected her job but at the same she sort of deserves a taste of her own medicine in my eyes. \n\nAITA if I report her? \n\n",

On top of that, he literally rubs the bag all over his chest in what seems an attempt to mop up the sweat.  \n\nNow I understand I’m somewhat of a germaphobe, but I feel like this is rather sickening and that my food should be replaced.  AITA? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I became roommates 7 months ago back when we were still just friends. We have been dating for the last 3 months. Over the months, he has continuously finished my food without asking. I have brought it up multiple times because it bothered me and I asked him to stop. We grocery shop together and split the bill based on who buys what and we split the cost of the food we'll share in half. It's not exact, but it mostly evens out and this problem really is not about money.  I don't mind sharing food nor do I mind giving him the last bite. I just hate to come home excited to eat my snack, and unable to find it in the cabinet, I as my boyfriend if he's seen it to which he replies, \"oh yeah, i ate that.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day we were high and I was looking for the perfect high snack in the kitchen when my boyfriend laughed and said, \"you are going to be really mad at me right now.\" I'm confused. I look around for a bit and then I see the now empty box of my Snickers Ice Cream Bars peeking out of the trash. My heart sinks. I bought this box of ice cream. He can have some. He did have a bar a few days ago, but he asked me before because we both know it's considered mine. I went on for five minutes in the grocery store before buying this ice cream that it is AMAZING and I haven't bought myself a box in years. My boyfriend claims I should not be upset that he finished it because he really needed that ice cream and it brought him joy to eat it and I should be happy for him. It's selfish of me not to let him have it. He would let me eat his last ice cream. He also says he will buy me the next box. He thinks I'm over reacting with how mad I am, all he did was finish some ice cream. To me, it isn't about the money or having a box in the future, it was the fact that I could have had the perfect snack at that moment, but that opportunity was ripped away from me. I'm not mad he had some ice cream, I'm mad he finished it, and I'm even more upset that I did not even know it was finished. I still had the hope of eating an ice cream bar in my mind. I thought it was in the freezer, waiting for me. Instead, all there was was an empty box in the trash and an intense feeling of disappointment. ",

      "description": "My dad has, on occasion, expressed excitement about me getting married in the distant future. He wants to “give his little girl away” and it’s a big deal for him, as I’m the only daughter he has. However, I am sure that I do not want him to walk me down the aisle for a number of reasons, and I’ve felt this way for about a decade now. \n\n1. I find the whole process of “giving away the bride” old fashioned and sexist. I’m a grown woman making decisions for myself, financially independent and my dad (or anyone else in my life) has no say in whether or not I get married.\n\n2. My dad is an okay father, but a shit husband. \n\nHe’s not winning any awards for father of the year, but not abusive or an alcoholic or particularly negligent. However, he’s a terrible husband who spent most of his marriage to my mother being a cheating, narcissist piece of shit and only in the past 5-6 years has turned it around. For 13 years, he had no respect for his wedding vows and has cheated on every woman he’s ever been with. When I found out about his cheating in high school and told him to fess up to my mother, he chickened out and I had to do it myself. It was devastating for me to be dragged into his bullshit like that, and fundamentally changed the way that I see him. I was really close to my dad growing up, so realizing that he was capable of being so awful cut me pretty deep. \n\nPart of this is about punishing him for what he did to my mother, and to me. Who forces a 16 year old to tell her mother that her father is having an affair? But a bigger, more important part is that I don’t want a guy who is incapable of staying faithful having any part of me committing to being faithful for the rest of my life. He obviously doesn’t respect marriage, so who do I have to act like he did? \n\nAnyway, am I the asshole? ",

Her parents are pretty strict and don't like me so they gave her a curfew to be home, roughly around 9. Of course I know this because I have strict parents myself but they seem to trust me with her. We went on a date last night because I wanted to try and move forward in our relationship so this was my only plan to. I didn't expect us to spend so much time at the beach until her parents started calling her, we both didn't know we had lost track of time and it was almost 9 already. I felt terrible because I felt like I forced her to go on this date with me and stay longer because of it. And to make matters worse when she got home, her parents told her to stay away from me because they say I'm trouble and that she can't go out anymore and she was just crying. She feels like this is her fault because of her curfew and that she can't go out all the time and she's scared that I'll leave her because of it. I'm in a hole now because I feel like I not only ruined her social life but the entire relationship now.",

With my hire date, it'd be 9 months before I got FTC. If I'd been told that in the interview I wouldn't have cared, but my boss is claiming ignorance (which I don't believe because they've worked here for years).\n\nCouple more months, corporate does more things to make me hate the company. Then, I decide I want to go to grad school. My intended field is very competitive and I would need to do extra things this summer in order to get my application up to par. I ask my boss if I can drop down to 4 days a week. They get very evasive. Multiple conversations and I have no hope they'll give me the flexibility I'll need.\n\nMeanwhile, at Job 1, we've all gotten pay raises and a new program that allows us to earn commission for the first time ever. I've also been told there's a promotion if I want it. I know they'll be flexible with me so I decide to quit Job 2.\n\nBoth jobs do schedules 3 weeks out. With how the weeks lined up and because I'm nice, I ended up giving about 3 1/2 weeks notice. Told Job 2 it's because I hate the job (I'm bored to tears every day) and the company, saying nothing about my boss to avoid drama. Boss freaks anyway, calls me selfish because \"I know I'm the best and the only other person with my availability shouldn't even have this job\". Am I the asshole for wanting to work a job I like?",

      "description": "Recently I have agreed to take care of a dog that was abandoned by her previous owners for unknown reasons. She's still pretty young, barely above a year old, displaying puppy-like behaviours.\n\nShe's very cute looking, she has those eyes like that cat from Shrek - you just can't refuse her anything when she looks at you with them. She makes a fantastic impression on anyone who meets her and usual reaction is \"oh, she's so sweet, what a lovely dog\".\n\nThe only thing is, she's not.\n\nShe's a huge attention seeker - whenever you're in the house, she'll keep following you like a lost puppy (maybe cuz she is one) and she constantly wants to be peted. But when you leave the house, she becomes an unstoppable destructive force with one objective - to ruin your entire apartment. \n\nOkay - when I agreed to take her, no one warned she's like that. But I took into consideration that foster dogs are not a fairy tale and that she might be problematic. I took her 1,5 month ago and since then, she already costed me over 2,5k euro (she destroyed the tv, my clothes, some of the furniture, headphones and some other less valuable of my stuff). I was furious when I found out that she destroyed the TV, but I never vented out on her.\n\nI understand that she's not doing this on purpose and most likely it's separation anxiety, but all those events made simply not like her. When I look at her, I don't see an adorable dog, I see someone who ruined tons of my stuff. I really, really don't like her.\n\nNow don't get me wrong - I'm not abusing her or anything. I still take care of her and I'm giving her attention, although it's forced from my side - I don't want to give her back until she'll find a permanent home. Despite the fact that I'm caring for her as much as I can (I recently taught her how to give paw and how to sit), people still call me an asshole or an idiot when I'm telling them that I don't like her due to the fact that she's not my dog and never will be and that she destroyed lots of my stuff. I'm not forced to like a dog - I still take care of her and make sure that she has everything she needs and I'm doing my best to correct her behaviour, but that doesn't mean I have any positive feelings about her.\n\nYet people still call me an asshole for that - am I really one for not liking someone who devastated my place?

When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.   \n\nMy friend and I have talked, gamed, gotten drinks throughout the year.

      "description": "I live with two roommates. Because of my schedule and training, I often eat at unusual times and thus cook for myself (I would ask them if they want some as well, but I know the answer from experience). Recently they and another common friend got mad about it saying I was being wasteful and egoistic. The thing is, I pay for 90% of the food because I don't want to eat the crap they would buy (canned vegetables/packaged meat) and I want to eat in a way that doesn't affect my training and schedule negatively (no food 2h before training and eating within 1 hour after training). I know one of them is quite the environmentalist, but I really don't care about his politics when it comes to my personal life. Besides, we'd just cook more together, essentially using the same amount of resources except for the electricity for the stove. AITA for living my own life?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn case anyone comes here from my last post and wonders, I thought it would be interesting to make this a separate topic and see how the environmental argument would affect the result.",

It just keeps the peace. \n\nThis year my birthday comes up on one of her weeks.  I really can’t imagine not spending it without him, he’s the most important person in the world to me. \n\nI literally decided to throw a birthday party for the sole purpose of being able to invite them and get to spend some time with him on my birthday without it being awkward .   That was the reason for it.  \n\nI went ahead with some of the plans for it and really didn’t think it would be a big deal, but my gf is furious. I didn’t tell her that this whole party was just an excuse to spend time with my son on a day that’s not mine.  \n\nShe’s acting so aggressive about the whole thing.  She wants me to disinvite the ex even though it means that Ely won’t be able to come.   She accused me of wanting to get back together with the ex.   She also said that I was just using her to make ex jealous which is ridiculous.  Her whole attitude could maybe be understandable if we were newly dating, but we’ve been together for over a year.   She doesn’t like ex at all.   But to say “aw well” when I said that Ely won’t be able to come is really bugging me about her. ",

      "description": "Sorry about bad formatting I’m on mobile. This is an alt account as they know about my main.\n\nThis just happened a week ago and I’m still mad about it.\n\nSo I am an 18 year old(in grade 12)  and have an older brother use and a younger sister. My dad is lazy. He’s been unemployed for five years and doesn’t both to find work or clean up his mess, saying I should do it. He also shows heavy favouritism towards my sister, to the point that me and my brother were feeling neglected ( my mom lived with me but was at work 7 days a week from 5am-midnight). My dad would constantly insult us.He’s the type of guy to drive my sister to the US (we live in Canada) to go to the mall but could take me to homecoming, that is 15mins away because he was “busy” (sleeping on the couch). He would also complain about tiny things, such as how my room was dirty because there was a tuft of red hair in a corner I was already trying to clean up. When I tried to explain that I was going to clean it and that it was be sisters (it was long and red and I have short black hair) he yelled at me for suggesting it could be hers (she is the only one in the family with red hair). \n\nBefore I start, I have to say that I failed chemistry and had to retake it at night school (important later)\n\n\nOne day my mom came home early. I don’t really know what happened as i was at night school,but she got mad at him about leaving his plate in the sink. When I came back from night school.He tried blaming me for leaving his dish in the sink and I tried to explain to him that I couldn’t have washed his plate as I was at night school. He yelled at me calling me an idiot and a cunt who couldn’t do the simplest thing. It was then I lost it. I yelled back calling him a fat lazy fuck that does nothing at all and told him if it wasn’t for my mom he would be homeless. I also told him he’s the reason why my brother left the house at the first chance he got(which was true). My day threw his sandal at me and wanted to hit me, but my mom intervened. I left after that, didn’t go to my room but left the house. I went to my brother’s house(about a 40 min walk away) and decided that I will stay there for the meanwhile.\n\nIt has been about a week since then and I’m still at my brother’s house. My dad called me once demanding me to apologize. I refused. My mom also called telling me that she understood where I came from, but that it was uncalled for. My brother had to go back to the house to get my backpack for school and he told me  that my dad exclaimed as he was leaving “Thank god that there are no more dumb fucks in my home”\n\nI talked to my friends about the situation. They said that they would have reacted the same way I did. So I’m wondering Am I really the Asshole here.\n\nTL;DR : Dad get mad at me not washing his plate even though it was impossible and get mad. I called him a fat fuck and leave the house\n",

This review I left summarizes my experience perfectly (I didn’t pay beforehand). This is exactly what happened below and the review I left\n\nWorst experience ever. Never order here, you won’t get your food. It started with me putting in an order for carry-out and having my coupon not work, saying I needed to order a large pizza even though the paper coupon I was sent stated I could order a medium or large. I called to place my order, where they tried to overcharge me $3 on the pizza, and I had to point out their bullsh#t. After, as I was told that my coupon went through and my order was placed (Thank god I didn’t give them my card there) and went to the store. I was then told to show them my coupon, when I was told it went through. I gave them the coupon number and home address, but the guy at the counter was like a broken record and wouldn’t stop saying the same thing over and over, “you have to have your coupon” He sounded like he was drunk, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he was. I continued to state the address and he wouldn’t listen or give my food, I refused to pay until I got all my food, my order sitting right there and card in hand. Idiot on counter still repeating the same thing over and over. I then stormed off and left without giving these idiots a dime. I will never ever order here again, and will be telling everyone I know this shi#ty experience. And I know quite a few people. I left still hungry, and my sister was crying when I got home.

But I guess I didn't realize it signed me up for not having my family around me. Mind you my family is three hours away, and my sister is wanting to come stay with me for a few days. Well I told her sure I guess and now the sisters are frantically trying to hide. Freaking out because my sister is coming in the middle of the day and not at the end of the day so they dont have time to plan.\n\n Here is my thoughts. I have no one other than the 2 sisters as friends. I work and then try to help with the one sister with her job. But ever since the sister came back from overseas, I am not an option anymore. She and the oversea sister obviously go together with life things and here I am still feeling like an outcast. Am I jealous? Probably.  But now I am super sad and angry because I miss my sister pretty bad and I feel like I need to tell her to stay home. So...am I the asshole who doesn't want to call her sister?",

At the next stop a woman gets on and sits next to me. It seemed to me like she was struggling to sit in a comfortable way and she her stomach was very round and protruding out of her dress. (It was some kind of form-hugging sweater dress so it was fairly noticeable). \n\nI also should point out that I am 7 months pregnant myself! I thought we had something in common so I smiled at her and said “when are you due?” She then furrows her eyebrows at me and goes “Pardon me?” \n\nThat’s when I thought maybe she took offense because she doesn’t know me so I was like “oh sorry it’s none of my business.” \n\nThat’s when she narrowed her eyes and said in a snappy way “I’m not pregnant.” Obviously I’m mortified but I kind of froze up and didn’t know what to say so I think I just said “oh”. \n\nShe then gets up and walks to the whole other side of the train even though that meant she had to stand until we got to her stop. So clearly my comment really bothered her :/\n\nI am obviously embarrassed now by the whole thing. But I truly didn’t have any ill intent. \n\n(I actually texted my husband about this whole situation when I got to work.

      "title": "AITA For Getting Annoyed My Neighbour For Multiple Problems Such As Being Forced To Take His Delivery and Deal With Bad AirBnB Guests",
      "description": "I have been living in a small apartment for quite some time now close to 17 years with my parents. The apartment is made up of only two flats. One of which I live in. The second flat was empty for the first 10 years, however, someone moved in. He was quite nice for the first few years, very supportive but after a while he changed.\n\nHe moved out of the house and moved somewhere else nearby but as he still owned the flat he started renting it out on AirBnB and this is where all the problems began. People that we didnt know started entering the building and as we lived in a very poor community where theft rates are high this makes us very uncomfortable in our own homes. To make matters even worse, sometimes he would forget to specify which flat is his and we would have Airbnb guests poking our keyhole with their key at times like 3 in the morning. The guests can also be very inconsiderate as they slam doors shut, walk up the stairs loudly at midnight, they sometimes come home drunk stumbling in the apartment. I just think that as the host that he should make it  clear to people that they shouldnt be coming to the apartment so late in the night and even if they are they should at least be considerate and make as little noise as possible. Not to mention they also turn on the apartment lights when its still bright outside and their is sunshine coming into the apartment. You may think this isnt a problem, however, my family is the one who pays for all of the electricity bills in the apartment except for the flat. When I asked him to split the electricity of the apartment complex (again not including the flats just the hall and the stairways) he refuses to do so and as a working class family this a massive burden. I have the urge to just take out the light bulbs but obviously he wouldnt be happy about that as it would \"drop his airbnb rating.\" When I put up a sign next to the door way  saying please close the door slowly, he takes it off, types it out in a tiny size and puts it back as if anybody will notice it\n\nAnother problem I have is that he sends his Amazon orders to my apartment despite himself not living their and thhs this means thag I constantly have to sign his packages for him. And its not something that happens once every blue moon. No, this guy has stuff coming in almost every single day. I dont get why he cant just send it to the apartment he currently lives instead of sending it to the one he rents out. \n\nSo I had a talk with him this morning and he quickly became very hostile, immediatley replying with shut up. When I asked him to not send the packages here or atleast be here when they arrive, he responded saying that we were not being good neighbours for not taking his package and that he is getting annoyed by the fact that I tell the delivery man to just leave it at the post office. I also requested if he could let the guests know to be quiet and considerate he said that we were the loud ones and that he was disturbed by our arguments. We do have arguments at our home but its as with any other family, where its small and not frequent. He then proceded to say that he would write a letter to the council complaining about us. When I broight up the fact that yesterday, a minicab caming ringing the bell at two in the morning to pick up AirBnB guests he simply said \"What can I do\" So what do you think?\n\nTLDR: I have a neighbour who rents out his apartment to AirBnB guests. The guests are very inconsiderate and loud. He also sends his packages to our apartment although he lives somewhere else and we have to pick up the packages for him. When I confront him he becomes hostile and threatened to write a letter to council complaining about our family ",

      "description": "2 years ago, I was in high school and dated a guy we’ll call F. It happened as a result of us being in the same friend group and was never very serious. I broke up with him after a month because he was manipulative and tried to get me to choose him over my friends. Towards the end of our relationship, F wanted me to wear one of his sweatshirts to support him since he had a soccer game that day. No problem. He told me I could give it back whenever. We ended up breaking up shortly after, and the sweatshirt was the last thing on either of our minds. For 3 months after the breakup, he stalked me. He would show up to restaurants I was at and outside of my house at night and he would look through my windows and text me about it. So I figured the safest thing to do was no contact and blocked him on every platform. He would keep finding new ones to contact me on, and I would keep blocking him. He even had his little sister try to add me on SnapChat and would keep changing his profile pictures to old pictures of us to try to get me to talk to him. I kept with no contact, and things died down. 2 years later, F has made a new Instagram and messaged me to ask for his sweatshirt back. I don’t want to give it to him. I don’t want it. I don’t wear it. It’s not about the sweatshirt. It’s about the idea of having to see him again. We don’t have any mutual friends who could bring it to him. I feel stuck. I don’t want to be the bad guy and keep something that he cares about and is rightfully his, but I really don’t want to get involved with him again in any way. AITA?",

      "description": "I order from a nearby chain pizzeria pretty often. A bit about where I live:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy apartment is a \"standalone\" apartment on a street corner i.e. not part of an apartment complex, on the second floor above a store. There's a small outside staircase on the side street, about 10-12 steps. This staircase leads you up to a porch where my apartment is. The street I live on is busy for sure but the side street, where the stairs are located, is not particularly busy and theres usually parking. Even if there's no parking there isn't a lot of traffic so it's never a big deal to double park with the flashers on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery time I order pizza from this place the driver always calls to say they're here, and I tell them great, look out for the wooden stairs and come on up. Every time, without fail, even if it's a driver who has delivered to me countless times, they ask if I can come down instead. I always tell them I'm not really dressed for outside or something similar and they'll have to come up. To which they begrudgingly hang up and come up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I tip reasonably well (usually $3-5 or so on a \\~$15 check) so it's not like I'm asking them to do this and then leaving them pocket change for a tip. But I don't even think the tip is relevant, I kind of assumed their job is to bring my order to my door. But they definitely do a good job of making me feel like a huge asshole every time they come. Like, I'm not asking anyone to come up a 5th floor walkup, it takes the better part of 15 seconds to come up the stairs to my door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This happened last Wednesday, we are 6 best friends (me and 5 others), one of them, let's call him (Z), didn't even wave when he saw us sitting together, and continued talking to a group of girls he was already sitting with, so we thought as a comeback, we'll just do a harmless joke(my idea), so we named our WhatsApp group \"lonely bitch\" then left, he tried calling later that day but we ignored him.\n\nNext day, prank's over, we tried calling him to let him know that we are going Sushi later that week, but he didn't answer any of our calls or texts, eventually he did answer my texts and I told him it's a joke.\n\nHe started saying he kept crying that day, and that his old friends abandoned him and that we will never become the same again. He then asked me some really odd questions, such as if i regret introducing him to the others (as they liked him more) and if i was jealous and wanted to ruin it. Of course i denied that because that's simply not true, he himself is one of my closest friends. \n\nNow he's just being a dick and not answering any of our calls and messages, last message he sent was \"I understand it's a joke, but I'll never be the same again with any of you\" and \"give me time\". We made a new group and added him but he left..\n\nI think he's overreacting to a harmless joke, i mean he also did mean jokes before and I never took them this seriously, but at the same time he appears to be very insecure towards this scenario.. \n\nI don't want to lose this dude, he's a good friend, but i was thinking of confronting him on Sunday and telling him how he's overreacting..\n\nAm i the asshole? What should I do to reclaim this friendship? \n\nTL;DR: \nNamed our WhatsApp group \"lonely bitch\" and then made all members leave except one as a joke, the guy took it seriously because of his insecurities and is really mad about it even after telling him that it's a joke.

Here's what I've done that would make me the asshole:\n-Forgotten to replace the toilet paper maybe once or twice last semester. \n-Left a few dishes on the counter of the kitchen. \n-Forgotten a slight mess I'd made in the kitchen once last semester.\n-Accidentally broke a bottle of sparkling white grape juice, took care of the biggest piece, and ran out to catch the bus because I had to present a project that day that was worth 100% of my final grade and the bus was leaving in 3 minutes. (I did apologize to the group chat as soon as I got on the bus and I told them I promise I would take care of it as soon as I got back from rehearsal that night.\n-Hadn't cleaned the bathroom I share with someone (yeah, that one DOES definitely make me the asshole, but we got a schedule set up for cleaning; I've been pretty much following it since.)\n\nPart of that could probably be I have ADD, so tasks tend to slip my mind. It's not excusable, but likely understandable. I'm improving this semester. I haven't lived in an apartment or had roommates before. \n\nHere's what some of my roommates have done:\n-Taken down the shower curtain and taken away the batmat in the bathroom because of the bathroom thing (And like I said, I don't deny that I was the asshole in that, but removing the batmat and shower curtain is dangerous) until we got a schedule set up.\n-Another only texts/talks to me to tell me to do a chore, never really bothers to get to know me. \n-Blew up at me about the grape juice thing, even after I mentioned that I didn't have time to clean it up right there and then and I even told them the soonest time that I'd be able to clean it.\n-Demanded I put away my dish RIGHT AT THAT SECOND, even though I'd just come back from a dress rehearsal of a show, which for the record is exhausting. I even asked her to let me recharge first and then I would gladly put it away.\n-Pretty much blamed me for have a cold shower in a condescending way.\n-Hidden all of the plates, cups, dishes, silverware after that single mess I had made in the kitchen (yes I get I should've cleaned it up and I wish I had remembered).\n\nI've posted the story to other threads and they all think I'm the entitled one and that I'm the asshole.

      "description": "I met a girl on Tinder. We talked a lot and it turned out we had lectures in the same building, so one day we decided I'd wait for her and we'd met in person.\n\nThe meeting was meh. Turned out she could meet me only because she was supposed to get some documents from doctor and right after that she needed to go home. It was raining and neither of us had an umbrella. Sometimes I didn't know what to say as she was way more intense in person. It wasn't my best day overall, so I didn't think much of it. And she struck me as a person who could use a friend.\n\nAround week later we decided to meet again. We had classes until late, so we settled for a short walk and maybe some food. The break before the last lecture I got a text to meet her so I did. She was upset about some stall selling nerdy posters in the main hallway. Soon it became clear she was more mad than sad that she didn't have money to buy some poster. She started ranting about not having iPhone. She threw her smartphone on the ground several times. She cried. People were staring. I tried to comfort her, although I'm terrible at such situations. I managed to calm her down a little and convinced her to go to the last lecture to take her thoughts off it and after that we'll spend time together.\n\nI felt mentally tired, but I focused on my own lecture, during which my laptop's charger broke. For most of my assignments I need access to a computer, so it was important to get a new one asap. Lecture ended and I'm heading towards exit talking with a friend. Friend went to the restroom and I hung nearby as we have this silly habit of leaving the building together (this explains why she doesn't leave on her own and stands close by). I spotted the girl and went her way. She was in better mood simply complaining about boring lecture and broken nail.\n\nFriend left restroom, it's time to go. I mentioned broken charger and said we need to make a small detour to the store. Girl went nuts and yelled she won't go to the store to watch people buy things she cannot afford. I standed there dumbfounded and I could sense my friend was even more uncomfortable than me. When she finished I simply asked if she still wanted to go out with me and the answer was no. The only response my brain could think of at the moment was ok, bye.\n\nFriend and I left. And friend was literally scared of the girl and she didn't change her mind after I tried to justify girl's behaviour. And nearly begged me to never meet the girl again. The thing is, I really trust my friends when it comes to the people I date/possibly would date.\n\nThe next few days I was busy. Girl was the one to text, but she asked about the medicine I didn't longer take and if I could give it to her. When I recived the message, my mind was set in stone to never contact her again. But right now I feel like an asshole, because it's clear she needed help and I just ghosted her.",

      "description": "I know that sounds bad and that's why I'm here. For the last few months, my fiancé and I have lived in a small apartment complex. To begin with, the place isn't built great so the walls are thin, but we only have this issue with one neighbor. \n\nUsually it's music or tv and it is loud. I mean like we can hear every word loud. She's told us it's so loud because she's hearing impaired. We have no reason to doubt her. We understand and are tolerant of it during the day, but usually the noise starts at 9pm and doesn't stop until sometime after 6am, it's a lot harder to do so. Ultamately it's making it hard to sleep. We've tried white noise, brown noise, we've tried headphones ( even ones meant for sleep). It's either uncomfortable or doesn't work. \n\nBack in the summer months we were able to talk to them about it and that seemed to resolve things. Unfortunately, now that it's colder and we don't sleep with a fan on we are realizing maybe it wasn't so fixed after all. It's been loud again since maybe early November. My fiancé has gone down 4 different times after 11pm to knock and ask them to turn it down but no one ever answers. We feel bad since it's loud because they're hearing impaired but at the same time we need our sleep and I feel like there are other ways to go about late-night listening. \n\nSo, would I be the asshole for reporting a noise complaint to the leasing office? I feel so guilty because there is a real reason for it, but I'm sleep deprived, have finals due, and at my wits end. ",

They will be there to answer any questions you may have. In anticipation of faculty coming to speak with you, I would like to request that you submit your questions to me no later than Friday, November 2 by 5pm. There will be an opportunity to ask questions from the floor, but I would like to have the faculty as prepared as possible.\n\nAs extra credit, if you submit a question(s) and it is acceptable, I will give you 1 point on your final grade for the class.\n\nMy submitted question was\n\nIs it best to transfer at the end of the year or in between the fall and spring semesters?\n\nThe teacher responded with \n(Insert Name Here)\n     You do not have to be present for class on Monday (November 5). Thanks.\n\nBeing concerned I followed up with\n\nWait why?

My requirement for extra credit was that it be appropriate. Your desire to transfer is a personal desire and the answer to your question is not best suited to all students in the class.

      "description": "Yeah I know this is a mess. Basically my long distance gf (I'm 20 now she's 19) accused me of rape on some advice forum on Reddit. I know ghosting isn't generally okay but I got seriously pissed off at what she wrote about me. She made it seem like I was the bad guy, telling everyone how I was being too rough with her and how she didn't like how we just went our separate ways after the sex was over. We were both virgins and she said before that she liked BDSM, and she said yes. I don't think it's okay that she go out accusing me online when I literally asked her if she wanted to have sex, and she literally said yes so I thought it was fine. \n\nThe reason I'm asking if I'm an asshole is because she seems to think I am and I do admit I thought about messaging her, but decided it's way too risky. I don't want to let her jeapordize my future. She was crying before the sex and telling me she wasn't sure she wanted to stay together and when I hugged her it turned into sex. I probably would've handled it better but yeah. Also she didn't outright accuse me, she asked if it was rape but in her text she heavily made it seem like it was and twisted the story. It really scared me because my future could get ruined. So I ghosted her even though she said she still really loves me. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My  sister and I have a very combative relationship. She's in her 40s and  has never had success in her career. It's not entirely her fault, but  she takes it out on other people. I'm younger and things have gone  better for me, but she thinks that I can help her in ways that I can't.  Years ago my intern (a woman) was hired into a full-time job. My sister  was furious over this and said I should have given her the job. My  sister wasn't qualified for it, my intern had a relevant Masters degree,  and my sister lived 3000 miles away. Years later, I left that job and began dating my former co-worker. We're still dating.\n\n(My sis and I have talked about that job. 1 time she seemed to acknowledge that it was the right decision.)\n\nLast  July my sis &amp; nephew came to visit. My nephew is among my favorite  people in the world and we play all kinds of games every time we're  together. The first few days went OK.\n\nOne  afternoon we were on a pier dancing to a jazz band and having a good  time. My GF joined us, and as soon as she showed up my sister shut down.  She didn't say hi to her, didn't acknowledge her presence, just looked  straight through her. We walked 10 minutes to a restaurant and she  wouldn't say a thing to her the whole time. In the restaurant my GF was  seated immediately across from her. My sister still wouldn't acknowledge  her. My GF felt so awkward and insulted that she made up an excuse and  left. (My GF &amp; my sis have met a few times before w/o incident.)\n\nI  was livid. After my nephew went to bed I told my sister how angry I  was. She said I that I had no empathy for her and said that my GF would  never get an apology. She left town a couple days later (earlier than  planned) and we haven't spoken since. That was 9 months ago.\n\nThis  past week included the bdays of my sis and nephew. I sent him a note  and a gift and I included a short letter to my sister saying that I  wanted her to be a part of my life, and that I hoped we could treat the  people in both of our lives with respect. I didn't call my nephew  though, bc I didn't want to go through my sister. This is the first time  I haven't spoken to him on his bday. My sister never responded to the  letter, and that was 2 weeks ago. (I sent the gift early.)\n\nThe  day after my nephew's bday I learned (from my dad) that my sister  needed $150 to take her dog to the vet. I sent my dad $300 and told him  to give it to my sis. He suggested I include a card, but I've already  written her a letter to which she hadn't responded, so I'm not sending a  card.\n\nNow  it's been 5 days. I haven't heard from my sister. I'd like to speak to  her and to my nephew. And I'd like her to apologize to my GF. I know  that if I call her she's gonna give me a hard time about not calling my  nephew.\n\nShould I call her? AITA for not calling her?",

      "description": "Hello Reddit,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my wife is pregnant and is in her third trimester. She has recently been complaining about how stressed she is and how she needs a break. She says she needs a night away in a hotel by herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI find the night away in a hotel by herself to be strange, especially seeing that I was talking about taking her away for a \"babymoon\" next weekend where we would both getaway and leave our 2 year old with grandma and grampa. Further, I tell her that I would rather use our vacation fund for joint holidays and not seperate trips and that I don´t want to set a precendent of taking seperate trips like this - I am uncomfortable with the idea. She is furious and says this is not a seperate trip and she needs this, but I tell her that is how I view it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all this I inform her that I would be happy to give her a break this weekend - for both Saturday and Sunday I promise to take care of all responsibility and she is free to do anything but I ask her to come home and at least spend the night with me as there´s no need to get a hotel - especially with our upcoming babymoon. She gets incredibly upset at this and says that nothing will satisfy her except for the hotel and night away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today (Saturday) and I thought this had blown over. I stick to my offer that I made her previously and start the day off by taking all responsibility around the house and caring for our child while she sleeps, I also make her breakfast. She however blows up at me after all this and says \"No this is not a break. I need a night away in a hotel.\" An argument ensues and I end up feeling hurt that she doesn´t appreciate my gesture of giving her the weekend off all responsibility. In the end she storms out and books a hotel for herself anyways and stops talking to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hi guys, I’m 22F. I’ve been fighting depression and after being gone for 2 months (as in no social media, no gaming, etc) because of the death of my mom, I came back to find some shitty things.\n\nI realized that a friend, we will call her B, blocked me on every social media platform. I talked to others and from what I’ve gathered, she was upset because I came out as lesbian a bit before my mom passed away. B is lgbt herself, but doesn’t like lesbians and are ‘wary’ of us, as our mutual friend describe it. Mutual friend told me that B was over it and that we could still talk and hang out but I denied that. I told her that if B was really my friend, she wouldn’t have blocked me on everything just because I came out. I don’t give a shit about B really and we weren’t ever that close. \n\nThe main issue here is B is dating my best friend, F. I’ve known F for 12 years and introduced him to B. They live together now and have been dating for 2 years or so. The thing is, if I don’t forgive B, then F and I will not be able to hang out. I talked to F and he told me he isn’t mad at me and pretty much separates himself from the situation and says that her decision are hers to make. I don’t want to be around B though, and B and F are glued together. She’s like a puppy and can never leave his side. It sucks, but I feel like I have no way to be friends with F. I’m sure she’s reading ever message I send him as well, because a message I sent will be marked as read occasionally and when I ask why he didn’t reply, he’ll say that he didn’t even have any messages on his phone (making me think maybe she deleted my texts). \n\nWIBTA if I told F that I can no longer be friends with him/talk to him if B is around (pretty much meaning our friendship is over)? I don’t want to start even more drama and ruin their relationship. I don’t know if I should just ghost him or be upfront about it. I still think he would take her side though because they live together and if he cared about the way she treated me, he would have said something sooner..",

      "description": "So before I start this was a very minor event that happened and I will admit that the entire thing sounds EXTREMELY childish. \n\nSo I am very ticklish (this is important to the story) like insanely ticklish. Anyways, I was playing video games on the couch  with 2 of my best friends. One of those two friends and his fiancé had just bought a new apartment together and were having a “housewarming party” Other people were at the house but not in the room. \n\nMy two friends were purposefully trying to make me lose at the game we were playing, so they kept poking me in the stomach or sides while playing. The one who was doing it the most was the host of the event. At one point, I said to the host, “if you poke me in the stomach one more time I’m smacking the controller out of your hand.” Looking back on it now it was dumb because they were laughing and having a good time but I was genuinely getting really pissed at them because I hate being poked and shit.\n\nSo my friend pokes me one more time, and so leaned in for a wild swing and knocked the controller straight out of my friends hand. Issue was, I was not thinking about where the controller would land and it went directly into the TV and shattered the screen. The controller was fine, but the tv was destroyed. My friends fiancé then ran into the room and started yelling asking what happened. I got immediately ratted out. \n\nNow if nothing else so far has made me look like an asshole, this next part definitely will. So my friends fiancé began to demand that I buy them a new tv. At first I flat out refused because I was still pissed about them poking me, but eventually after reflecting I felt that it was my fault for breaking the TV and thus offered to pay for Half price of a tv, provided it was the same kind that they already had (about 300-400). His fiancé is still demanding I pay full price for the tv. The other people in our group of friends are staying out of it, but I honestly wish I just knew if I was justified in only wanting to pay half the price for the TV or if I should be obligated to pay full price.

      "description": "At work, I'm in a department with eight people. I am the only person on the team without children and I'm the youngest by about five years (I'm a woman and almost 30). They all are very family-oriented and I like to stay at home with my fiance and play video games. We don't want children at all, and I have an IUD that my coworkers don't know about (I keep medical things private). This does not cause any rifts between my team and I. At most, I can't contribute much to conversations about children. Some of them game or watch the same shows as me, so we still have a lot in common and get along great. We have meetings regularly and, as far as the workplace goes, this is the best team I have ever worked with. \n\nAt our meetings, we usually spend some time catching up on non-work related things if time permits. Today we had a meeting, and one co-worker asked how my wedding planning was going. Of course, this conversation jokingly flows into the \"next step\", which is children. I'm a very chill person and my go-to answer is \"That's not in the cards for us right now. Maybe in a few years\". They aren't judgmental about it, but I don't like answering the same question because nothing has changed. It's been asked about five times by different co-workers since I started there a year ago.\n\nI'll admit I wasn't feeling the best and overwhelmed with my current project. I never try to show that on my team and remain positive, but the timing was terrible. I sat there quietly for a second and said, \"Listen, it's just not going to happen for us.\" Everyone's face fell, and I was confused until my co-worker said, \"I'm sorry to hear that, OP\" and changed the subject. I realized with how I delivered the message, they think I can't have children and I feel that I've put some people in an awkward spot.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I will now supply some context. I’m a 21M, who is in college and paying for my own college. I had been with my now ex for 3 years. So day before her birthday she suggests we go to an expensive restaurant. So I suggest we go somewhere cheaper because we can use that money for when we go on our vacation the next week.(which was also for her birthday, where I was going to be paying for meals/tickets etc) She gets mad because I complained about how the restaurant was expensive. Says I get lunch with my coworkers all the time I should be able to take her out. (I had actually not eaten out with him for 2-3 weeks because I was saving money for our trip....yes I tried to explain that to her) So she tells me not to come up for her birthday because she’s going to eat with her friends instead of me. I try talking to her but she just yells at me so I give up. I text her the day after again she didn’t want me to come. So I tell all the people(some of her friends) I invited to her place to bar hop as a surprise party for her, not to come.(Had bought drinks and balloons) We met up the following day and she’s still mad and says things to me like “I’m her boyfriend I’m supposed to do things for her” “she’s not gonna applaud me for the bare minimum” “All my friends told me to break up with you” so after that we broke up. I still gave her the birthday presents she wanted but I miss her a lot and sometimes I wish I had just bitten the bullet and not complained because it was her birthday... I was just trying to budget for trips and everything else. But, I need to know, was I wrong? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend (22M) and I (22F) recently moved into an apartment together. In doing so, I moved out of my parents’ house.\n\nI have anxiety and regularly (especially in the evening) experience rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, feeling of a “pit” in my stomach, fatigue, etc. This happens more frequently when I am alone. The symptoms became much worse when I left home and went off to college, decreased significantly when I moved home, and have now started up again. I’ve had what I would consider a panic attack/episode at least 3 times in the past week. I believe this has to do with me moving out, my parents separating (very recent) after my dad having an affair, and my boyfriend starting a job that he works in the evenings, which leaves me alone for long stretches of time.\n\nI would like to get an emotional support animal to help alleviate some of these symptoms. My (technically my family’s) puppy at my parents’ house was always able to distract and comfort me when I was particularly anxious. I believe that I would legitimately qualify for an emotional support animal.\n\nHowever, my issue is that doctors (any health professionals really) are major triggers for my anxiety. Because of this, I would like to obtain a letter via an online service or some sort of teletherapy (the most legit I can find). Note that this would NOT be a registration/certification. I know these are scams. There seem to be services out there that can legally do this, but I know that online services like this are often scams that make life more difficult for people with service animals and even “real” ESAs, which I don’t want to support.\n\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA for using a legal but ethically questionable online service for obtaining an ESA letter? Should I just suck it up and see a therapist?",

Here's a little back story of my marriage: we have been together almost 3 years, got engaged after 7 months, married after about a year and a half. For our entire relationship, he's had crappy jobs and I've talked to him multiple times about trying to find something better. My mom is about to die from cancer and we recently had a major blowout. I told him I want him to stay in a hotel because I need to process my mom's death alone. He ended up punching our old TV screen until it was shattered and he caused a contusion in his hand.\n\nSide note: A few months ago I started asking him about his resume and he would immediately change the subject. I made him sit down with me to edit his resume so I could apply to jobs for him because he wouldn't (even though I made it clear for months that I want him to find something better so we can save for our future). I kept applying for him and he wouldn't respond to the emails. \n\nAfter our blowout, him punching the TV and each of us yelling at each other, the next day he acted like NOTHING HAPPENED. I walked in and he runs up to me to give me a hug. He keeps talking about his feelings but he hasn't been there at all for me during this time with my mom. His mom had cancer when he was 6 and he was told she would pass (she didn't), but he's the least understanding person. \n\nI have a crush on my coworker because he's there for me more than my husband is.

      "description": "I've had this friend since first grade and since being out of high school, she has decided to become an EMT. She been only been in the program for a few months (since August 2018) but since even before the program started has being posting these boastful (i.e. prideful and almost arrogant) snap stories anywhere between every day to a few times a week.\n\nThey all go something along the lines of \"I'm so proud of my fellow EMTs/firefighters!! No one understands the shit we go through!\" etc. In the past she has posted the blue line flag claiming it was for firefighters and EMTs as well, despite the evidence I tried to show her. She just denied it and said I didn't understand. Regularly she posts selfies of just her or with her friends exclaiming how proud she is and how much good they're doing. I'd like to note that she is not an EMT yet nor are her friends firefighters yet.\n\nGranted she is doing well in the program is likely to become an EMT eventually, but watching these stories constantly where she congratulates herself and demands respect for \"what she does\" gets annoying eventually, so today I decided to talk to her. Am I the asshole in this situation? \n\nHere's the convo, sorry she's hard to understand sometimes: [https://imgur.com/gallery/37tFN6n](https://imgur.com/gallery/37tFN6n)",

      "description": "My girlfriend is German so last year we took a trip to visit her family there.  Last year, it seemed like my dad really wanted to go too.  So, this year I invited him and my mom to come with.  Both my parents are in their 50s and this is the first vacation in years that my dad has taken where it's not about taking kids to an amusement park or something.  He works away from home a lot and doesn't get to do enough for himself.  That's why I thought it would be cool for him do something like this.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, we've been talking more about the trip (it's in May) and my brother told me he was interested in coming too.  I think it'd be weird if he came, but he just broke up with his girlfriend so I feel bad saying no.  It's going to be expensive and really difficult for me to come up with the money so I don't really want to compromise.  I'm just not sure where my brother would fit in.  AITA?",

      "description": "(Mobile formatting sorry) My girlfriend and I are both seniors in high school. Today she got a letter from a small, state university. The letter said she received a substantial scholarship that would cover all expenses, as well as allow her to study abroad for free. I was so excited for her, but she didn’t really care. She said the small, state school is not her first choice. I tried to convince her that it might be worth going to her backup university with this scholarship on the table now, but she said that she is set on going to the larger, better-known state school. This is where the problem arises, the larger university offered her no scholarships and didn’t admit her to the honors program, so going to the university will set her back $25k a year. I asked her how she could just pass up a free ride, and she told me that her family already offered to pay for college, so the price wouldn’t matter to her. I asked her how she could just think this way. I explained that I have to pay for my university, and furthermore, some people can’t even afford to go to university in the first place. She immediately got defensive, and said “well my parents were smart with their money.” I cut her off and asked “are you implying that my parents weren’t smart with their money?” She said, “ I never said that. You’re treating me like a spoiled brat, and that not what I am.” I told her, “yes. You are spoiled.” She said she didn’t want to talk anymore tonight. Am I The Asshole for calling her spoiled???\n\nTL;DR - girlfriend passed up on substantial scholarship, claiming parents would pay for college. I called her a spoiled brat. ",

Another girl tags along, and they stop to talk, as do I. More and more people were tagging on and I was being more and more ignored, since I knew like 4 people there.

      "description": "This happened about 5 years ago when I was 16 but has always bothered me. I was at an amusement park with my cousin who is a few years younger than me. She had had a problem with her ticket so we went to go stand in line to see guest services outside the entrace to the park. We're in a line with about 15 people in total in it and are about half way through. There are two guest services windows but only one line (this is somewhat important). There is about a 3 foot gap between me and my cousin and the next person in line.\n\nAs we're standing there a woman with a small child, maybe 4 or 5, walks into the gap in front of us. She doesn't say anything or look at us. Thinking that she may have thought the line began there I say: \"Maam we're in line too.\" She turns to me and says: \"Well my son is handicapped and this is the handicapped line so I get to go to the front.\" She then gestures towards a handicapped symbol sticker thats on the window to the left. Personally I have no idea if her son was or wasn't handicapped. He had no obvious physical disability but of course that doesnt mean he wasn't, however, I had no way of telling. It's also worth noting that this is the only guest service area outside the park. Additionally, there is no idication that it is for the handicapped besides the sticker on one of the windows. Before I can respond my cousin says that it's fine and I drop it. I would have continued to argue if it weren't for her. I turn to her and say in a lower voice: \"I don't get it, she gets to go in front of us because her son is handicapped?\" The woman immediately turns back around looking angry and asks me: \"What did you juat say about me?\" I say \"Nothing.\" and she turns back around.\n\nAt this point we still have to wait a few minutes as there were still people in front of us both in line and at the windows. Eventually only the woman who cut is in front of us in the line and the right window, the one without the wheelchair symbol, is open. She turns to us again and scowls saying: \"See now it's open. That wasn't too hard was it?\" We say nothing and go to the window, get the problem fixed and go into the park. We don't encounter the lady again for the rest of the day.\n\nI don't feel like I did anything wrong but based on the way she reacted I'm not sure. So Reddit, am I the asshole?",

Now I don’t hate any of my co workers but it feels like I am sometimes put with the worse ones because I do my job. So today I decided to take a mental health day to deal with some stress and anger I have been dealing with the weeks prior. Now my job does not believe in mental health days so they usually don’t accept if you give that as your reason. My friend (also co worker but we are first and foremost friends) tells my co worker (the one) that I am actually not sick but taking a mental health day? So I get a text saying she knows I am not really sick. I am not blaming my friend but I am thinking that my co worker is a hypocrite because she takes entire weeks off to manage stress at times. I believe that my situation (even tho it is a little last minute) is no different from taking time off in advance. \n\nNow a little extra info\n\n1) I am a low worker \n2) she is higher up but in no way can fire me\n3) I know we have enough people to work because they would have sent people home (not me) early because we usually over staff on weekends for cases like this. \n\nSo be honest because I will apologize if I am wrong WIBTA?",

My mom, specifically, got along well with her and they frequently texted and chatted on facebook.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward toward the end of our relationship. We weren't too attracted to each other anymore and the nail in the coffin was when I found out she had been seeing someone for a few weeks. She lied multiple times over the whole thing. First that it was just casual flirting, then kissing, and I finally found out they had sex. Whatever, we broke up, I blocked her, and moved on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where I start getting frustrated. My mom and F remained good friends in the past year we haven't dated. I know, my mom's an adult and she can make her own decisions but it really bothered me. I've never been terribly close with my family since I moved away but I found out F and my mom had been talking about me (my mom overshares everything) as well over this past year and it feels like a huge breach of trust since she's told her what I've been up to, who I'm dating, etc. Worst of all she told me how F's current BF looks just like me and sent me a fucking picture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike, really? I asked my mom multiple times over this past year to not talk to F out of respect but this crossed a line for me and I refused to come out for xmas holidays. She's been really upset since holidays mean a lot to her and I feel awful cause my sister mentioned how hurt my mom was but I feel like my feelings have been disregarded too. These wounds are constantly being re-opened despite my feelings on the matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess it's just a touchy subject and it feels like my pleas are on deaf ears as she just shrugs it off when I bring up how that bothers me.",

      "description": "My daughter is 16 years old dating a 17 year old boy, they attend the same high school and have been dating for over 3 years. I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.",

      "description": "I went to go eat some all you can eat Korean BBQ with my friends after we finished a tedious group project to celebrate (highschool). After waiting for some time, the waiter finally takes our order for our first round. We noticed that he hadn't brought us any water. We don't mind because you have to ask for water in California to be served water. But even after asking, we were waterless for a good 15 minutes. We've tried to grab their attention but it seemed as if they were intentionally ignoring us and just scurried away to other tables or the kitchen. When we finally got a hold of one of the waiters, he grabs us some water but refuses to take our next order because he was not our assigned waiter. At this point we really start to get frustrated. Our waiter takes our order (after another 10 minutes of waiting), giving us a ton of attitude. This time, we ordered more just so we wouldn't pester him again but no, he tells us it is a max 2 plates per order. We never see this guy again after that (during our stay in the restaurant) so we just ask for our check (which they were very fast in bringing) and leave. Given the poor service, we don't leave any tip. \n\nAs we leave the restaurant, our waiter chases us out with a butter knife in hand. Visibly frustrated, he berates me and my friends for not leaving any tip. He tells us we are naive kids who have never worked a job in our entire lives, emphasizing that it is very hard to earn a living in California off of minimum wage. I was honestly shocked. I have never thought of viewing this type of situation from that perspective. Embarrassed, my friends and I just walk away (there were a lot of people outside). Now, one half of me genuinely feels remorse for not tipping. He might've been having a shitty day at work or at home. I don't know what goes on in his personal life, so I can never say. Even some of the people that I shared this story with tells me that we should've just tipped him. But the other half of me feels as if our decision to not tip him was justified. We were barely tended to, and received blatantly terrible service. I've not tipped in restaurants before where I received little to no service. AITA for not tipping then, and in this particular situation?\n\nTLDR: My friends and I didn't tip a waiter who gave us terrible service. He proceeds to chase us out of the restaurant and makes us feel terrible about not tipping him. ",

      "description": "  A bit of context before I dive in, my roommate and I share a two-bedroom apartment with a small common space with a kitchen and living room. The apartment is pre-furnished with everything anyone could need. My roommate was leasing their room a year before I started leasing mine. According to our neighbors the person who was originally in my room was never around, so my roommate was able to do whatever she wanted in the common area with no one was around to complain or ask for space.\n  My roommate and I have had issues with her stuff being left out before. Not like \"oh, you left out a book or a plate is in the sink\" but more like \"wow, where's the floor?\" I was tolerant for the first month, assuming she just wasn't used to me or sharing space, and I asked a couple times if she could clean stuff up because I couldnt do anything in the common area including cooking. At this time she also had a new boyfriend and would spend most of her time at his apartment, maybe coming back to our place once a day. Whenever she came in she would put her trash on the counter and the pile would build up. I hit the point where I had had enough and I moved everything off of the kitchen counter that didnt belong in the kitchen and I threw away all trash that I could find. She got mad when she came in the next day, threw a couple personal insults, said I had no friends. It was okay though because I got to cook dinner and she moved all personal items into her room and our common space got clean. Please note that at this time all of my cook ware was kept in my room and all of my food was kept in my room as well. I had asked for her to make space in the cabinets and the fridge for me but that had not happened yet.\n  Three months of living like that she announces that shes going to be subletting the room to someone and that she wouldnt be in our apartment from January to May. I asked at this time again if she could move some of her stuff out of the kitchen cabinets so I could put my cookware out there instead of keeping it under my bed and she agreed at the time. She found a subletter who is male and I wasnt okay with that and was blocking it with out landlord as much as I could because I didn't want to live with a boy. The landlord agreed with me. Her parents showed up to help her move out of her bedroom when I was at work and I recieved a call from our landlord saying that I had documents to sign to allow a male roommate into our space. I then recieve a call from her and her parents saying that I had agreed to have a male roommate and I needed to sign it because I was causing \"unnecessary drama\". I proceeded to call my mother crying because my parents didn't want me living with a boy and that's how it was shaping up to go down.  My mother convinced me to just sign it and I got a written agreement from the landlord that if the boy was crazy I could change units at no fee. She leaves the apartment and the new boy moves in. \n  When she had left, she left a pile of laundry, a pile of her boyfriends stuff, a full fridge of moldy/rotting food, and cabinets full of her stuff. I cleaned out the fridge and left for my parents house for the holidays.\n  When I came back the boy moved in (we're actually pretty good friends now, but if my dad or grandma asks the new roommate is a girl). He asked where he could put his cookware and if I could make space for him in the kitchen. I had boxes under my bed that I was keeping my cookware in and he had boxes that he moved his in so we cleared out half of the cabinets and split that half of the space between us. We put her stuff in the boxes and put those boxes in our laundry closet where we had a bit of storage space that we could use. We did not touch the piles in the common area. \n  Two weeks later we're having our seasonal room inspections and those piles that she had left were a fire hazard and the landlord called my roommate and said her stuff would be picked up by maintenance and once it was picked up it would be impounded for 30 days and if it wasn't claimed it would be disposed of.  One week after the inspection maintenance showed up and the new boy asked if they had talked to the boyfriend of the girl subleasing as the majority of the stuff being taken was his. He called the boyfriend and asked if he could collect the stuff as soon as possible. He ends the call and reports to the room (including maintenance) that the boyfriend was on his way. He recieved a call about two minutes later from the roommate who was out, apparently screaming about what a horrible individual I was, and he told me to turn off my phone to prevent her from calling me, so I did. Maintenance at this point leaves and says they'll come back later to move out anything left behind. Boyfriend shows up and moves out all of the piles and stuff left out visible and goes to look for her ceramic plates because aparently she told him that he could use them and he was going to pick them up in May but because he was there he was going to grab them at the time. We, new boy and I, go into our laundry closet and give him the box with her silver ware and her ceramic plates, bowls and mugs.\n  The day after one of our neighbors comes over and is like \"Old roommate is really mad and she wants to talk and said that you're not responding to any of her calls or texts\". I pick up my phone because I had thought I just had the one call last night and hadn't recieved any texts from her in over a month. Just the one call the day before when my phone was off and no voice message and no texts. \n  An hour after, the old roommate texted me and basically called me an inconsiderate ass for boxing her stuff in the cabinets without telling her. Am I The Asshole for moving her stuff?",

(And the night before at the club we were at and had cuddled with her the whole night also while I was in the same room but I digress.) Cut to about 2-6 months later, I actually don't remember, we were still together but I was still working on my feelings about it and still experiencing a lot of jealousy. \n\nI get home one night, and he is super excited to show me some art he had done! I look, and it's a bunch of figure drawings of a naked woman. His office was having a week where they were providing a variety of useful art etc. classes to employees, and this was one of them. I tried to be \"chill\" about it, but it just sparked up a lot more jealousy again. \n\nWe got into a fight about it that I don't think we ever really resolved. He said he had showed me because he was hoping to get some support from me re: his art which is also his career (he works in film). I expressed that it really shocked me to suddenly see all of these drawings of a naked woman he had done. He was firm that it was a professional setting and there wasn't anything to be jealous about - it was a professional model and he was surrounded by coworkers, it's not like it was a sexual experience. I said that I wished he had warned me about it, even before he had opted in to take the class; that I would have been fine with it under other circumstances because I understand the artistic value, but because of our recent history I was particularly sensitive and really really needed the warning. \n\nI am willing to admit I am a prude and therefore the asshole but let me know!

      "description": "First I'm gonna provide some context. About two years ago I met this guy named Sean, and after about 6 months of knowing each other we became very good friends. So much so that when homecoming rolled around during our sophomore year we decided to go together (I was still identifying as female) as friends. We went in a group with my sister and her date, my friend Robby. Everything was pretty fun as we took some bomb pictures.\n\nAfter this, my sister broke up with Robby and started dating Sean. He started to hang out with me less, which I understand because he was dating someone and stuff, but still I feel like he just pushed me to the side. He didn't say anything about the homecoming pictures and I liked them, so I left them up.\n\nFast forward and they've been dating for a year. I come out as transgender (ftm) and I get a text from Sean a week later with no hello, no how have you been, just one text asking me to delete the homecoming pictures a year and a half after I posted them and a year after Sean started dating my sister. I asked him why and he got really mad and told me to just forget it, but I told him I'd delete it when he told me why I'd delete it so I could avoid it in the future. \n\nHe told me that it's not because I'm trans, which wasn't even a thought in my mind. Then he told me it was because Robby was in the picture with my sister and he didn't like seeing that, even though it was like the third thing I posted on Instagram so he'd have to go to my page and scroll all the way down. \n\nHe then called me some names, called me my deadname, and told me I was just a girl confused about my gender. I told him that if he didn't want to see them, then don't look at them. Then he called me more names, so I blocked him. My sister and my mom were mad at me for not just deleting the pictures.\n\nJust a little bit of petty high school drama. Am I the asshole for not just deleting the pictures?",

      "description": "A while ago I agreed to move in with a friend who worked out of town, and unbeknownst to me at the time, this friend's girlfriend decided to let her lease run out and move in too. Since the very start she has been disgusting. All of the stuff she moved in with was caked and covered in dirt, hair and grease and she dumped her mountains of stuff in every shared room in the house. I didn't see the red flags as verbally she kept saying she'd sort it out and I believed her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe spoke about her moving some stuff into storage/the basement and cleaning her part but she always had an excuse. She couldn't because she was being bullied at work, then her father was going through legal trouble, then her job was too stressful. I ended up spending most weekends deep cleaning. Once it was habitable again I asked her to share a cleaning rota with me, she would clean one room every two weeks or we would get a cleaner. She agreed to clean herself. She cleaned once. And then a relative of hers died in a car accident and it hit her hard, obviously. So I laid off, and continued to do all of the cleaning and she continued to be a disgusting mess. I'm talking having to scrub her shit off the toilet and her pubes out of the bath, re-wash her dishes, throw her trash out. So on and so forth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince the accident, I've managed to get her to clean 3 more times. But every time is a battle, because I'm not taking into account her mental illnesses. The last time we spoke about this, over three months ago, she told me she was 'too depressed to clean' and that I needed to lay off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, I work 70 hour weeks, I clean one day a weekend and work the other weekend day, I work well into the evening, sometimes I have to clean up in the evening too. She is still in bed by the time I get into work, she finishes an hour before me in the evening and spends all night doing whatever she wants, going out to dinner with friends or watching TV. She spends her weekends doing whatever she wants, going out with her boyfriend, staying in bed all day. I know that depression manifests itself in different ways, I myself have a long history of PTSD, but I strongly believe she is just using her 'depression' and 'anxiety' to live like a pig and exploit me. So, am I the asshole? Or should I accept that she's too depressed to clean and stop hating her for this?",

      "description": "On mobile so apologies ahead of time for any formatting issues.\nSort of a long story.\n\nAlright, to preface, I’m a 20 year old female, and I haven’t had a lot of relationship experience. I dated a girl for around 2-3 years in highschool-freshman year of college and that’s it. I didn’t and for the most part still don’t find males that physically attractive, so I always sort of assumed I was a lesbian.\n\nI ended up meeting a guy online while playing video games and we became fast friends. I really enjoyed his company. Eventually it got to the point where he asked me out and I accepted on the grounds I thought he was a good guy, and liked him thus far so I’d give it a shot. He had a good personality from what I had seen of him, and I feel like personality is what truly matters regardless of gender (I later learn the term for this would be demisexual).\n\nFast forward a few months to when I realize I’m pretty unhappy in this relationship. We don’t see eye to eye on pretty much anything, we’re basically polar opposites. He keeps making sexual jokes or innuendos directed at me despite me being vocal about not liking it. He’s pretty old fashioned in his views and a lot of it downright rubs me the wrong way. We have very little in common outside of us both liking the same video game. \nAnd to top it all off he kept telling me he loved me and would talk about things in the future like we’d be together forever. I just felt like it was way too soon to be saying things like that and it made me very uncomfortable. At that point I loved him as a friend, not as a significant other.\nTo be fair to him though, he always treated me respectfully and with kindness. It’s not like I couldn’t stand him because he was being an asshole, our personalities just didn’t click AT ALL.\n\nIt got to the point where every thing he did would set me off. I knew I didn’t like him in a romantic way but he was so into me that I knew it would hurt him really badly to break up with him— and it did. He was absolutely crushed.\nI finally got the courage to say something because I was downright miserable, and I told him I couldn’t be with him because he was a guy, and I liked girls. That I tried to see him that way but I just couldn’t.\nI thought I was telling the truth at the time. In retrospect, I think I was using it as a way out, because I believed it (or at least convinced myself I did) and didn’t want to tell him it was also because I could no longer stand his personality in a relationship setting.\n\nI am now happily in a relationship with another guy I met through a gaming club at college— and he makes me happier than anything in the world. It feels completely different from my previous relationship in a very good way.\nBut this also leaves me firmly demisexual and indeed not a lesbian.\n\nEven if sort of unintentional I want to know if it was an asshole move to tell him I couldn’t be with him because of his gender. \nI absolutely do not regret my decision to get out of that relationship but I do feel a bit bad about how I did it.\n\n//And I think I dodged a bullet, because he ended up saying some really shitty and insulting things to me afterwards out of spite.\n\n\nTL;DR: met a guy online, started dating, realized we didn’t really click at all and that he was making me miserable, broke up with him by telling him I was a lesbian, turns out I’m demisexual and just didn’t like who he was as a person.",

      "title": "AITA for being annoyed with my family for constantly talking about my younger brothers engagement and not about mine while I am also engaged?",
      "description": "TL:DR My brother is essentially marrying someone that my family has never met and has not set a wedding date, and yet my family constantly talks about it and almost never brings up my engagement/wedding that ii only 4 months away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey all, I'll try to give some context to better understand the situation. Sorry in advance if I seem to ramble, this might get long but I want to give the details that I think matter and play into all this. I am 26 and my younger brother is 22.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am the oldest boy in my family and have 6 siblings (one older sister, one younger sister, one younger brother, two step-brothers, and a younger half-sister). So it's a mixed family but we are all close in age with exception of my half-sister, and we all get along pretty well. My full siblings and I were born a raised Mormon, and now that I have grown to adulthood I no longer practice within the church but still consider myself Mormon. Same thing for my younger sister. but my older sister and younger brother are still very active in the church and my younger brother served his mission, however I did not. \n\nFor those not familiar with the ins and outs of the Mormon religion, typically young men and women at the age of 18 can choose to serve a mission for the church which means they can be called (sent) to almost anywhere in the world where they will learn the language and preach the Mormon gospel to the people of that area. It is a choice (although there is a high amount of pressure for you to do it, especially for young men) and I made the choice not to go on mine.  My younger brother chose to go on his and ended up going to Argentina to serve where he met his now fiance. But for more context understand that on a Mormon mission as a young man or a young woman you don't really spend much time with the opposite sex. You have a same sex companion (partner) that you live and work with to preach the gospel i.e. knocking on doors and such, and you may at times work with sister missionaries who also have a same sex companion to do group lessons and whatnot. But it is not like they are hanging out 2 on 2 in like a double date situation or anything. I might be wrong but I would guess that over the course of ones mission, you might get to spend in total maybe a couple of days worth of time with the same sister missionary but it would not be in like a hangout or date type setting. I say all of this because this is how my younger brother met his fiance and how he fell in love with her.\n\nHe served his 2 year mission and returned last year in February. We all met him at the airport to greet him as he walked out of the gate where within the first 5 minutes of reuniting with us he stated \" I have a girlfriend and she lives in Mexico\" (which is where his fiance was from, she was just also serving her mission in Argentina). We kind of chuckled and said sure (not knowing how serious he was) and continued to ask him about his mission and experiences. He then says later that day that he his planning on flying down to Mexico to see her in the next couple of weeks. He does this a few times actually and in about a month or two after returning home he flies to her again and proposes to her. I had my personal doubts about this because it seemed pretty sudden but over the last year I have since come to believe that my brother and his fiance are in fact in love with each other, although with them having a long distance relationship I think they are in for some challenges once they are married and living together. On top of that they have been going through the process of getting her a visa/citizenship so they she can come to the states and they can get married here. Over the last year this has been the biggest topic of discussion with my family and we are a little divided on it. Some are in full support of the whole situation (saying they are so excited to meet her and can't wait for the wedding), others think he's being a bit crazy in committing to this without having taken time to actually date this woman. I fall in between these two, I fully support him in wanting to get married, I believe him when he says he is in love (if he wasn't I wouldn't see why he would go through this whole citizenship process) but I have my worries about his security and quality of life post marriage. He is a student, just recently got a job as a busser and currently lives with my mom and two sisters. I'm just worried about his situation once everything is cleared and him and his fiance are able to get married here.\n\nOn the other hand, I met my fiance almost three years ago and we have been together ever since. My family immediately fell in love with her and with good reason because she truly is the sweetest woman I have ever been with. I have been bringing her around my family a lot throughout our relationship and she has even spent time with them without me being there, so they have really had a chance to get to know her. We moved in together 6 months ago and withing a month of the move I proposed to her. Prior to me proposing though I was constantly getting asked, borderline harassed about if or when I would be proposing to her, constantly telling me how much they loved her and how amazing she was or that I'd \"never find a girl like her again\" etc. So I propose, she says yes, and we start the process of planning our wedding.\n\nHere is where I start to wonder AITA; I am not having a traditional Mormon wedding, I am having just your standard wedding i.e. ceremony, reception (with dj, dancing, bar, cake etc.). Basically the whole nine yards. My brother is having a traditional Mormon wedding i.e. getting married in the temple (which only a handful of people can actually attend, myself not included), followed by a reception at the church which is most commonly just a stop by, say congrats, maybe eat some food, and then leave. so there is much more involved in my wedding than his, but that's not to say that his is any less exciting. My biggest issue is that because if the immigration process my brother and his fiance do not have a wedding day set since they have no real idea of when she will be able to move here and get married. I on the other hand will be getting married in 4 months, but yet every time my fiance drive to spend time with my family the conversation at some point in the night turns to my brother and his engagement and the immigration battle he is fighting and all of that, and nothing is ever said about my engagement or PLANNED AND UPCOMING wedding. I honestly had really realized this until about 2 months ago when my fiance said something about along the lines of \"why doesn't your family say anything about our engagement? And why do they bring up your brother so much?\"\n\nI realize his struggles outweigh mine in a sense, but since then I can't stop thinking about it and notice it more and more. I literally had my fiance right next to me at Christmas as we said goodbye to my grandfather and he said \"bye it was good seeing you two! Have you heard anything from your brother yet about his wedding?\" (he was in Mexico at the time visiting her). I responded '\"No I haven't heard from him, but you got my wedding invitation in the mail right?!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Sorry for spelling and grammar errors",

      "description": "So I have a Chemistry test on Monday and I need to study for it. I go into my room and my brother is blasting music at full volume and I tell him to please use headphones so I can concentrate. We share a room unfortunatetly. Can't study in the kitchen because my sister is doing her stuff and it's usually very cold there. So I have nowhere to concentrate. I spend 40min begging my brother to keep it down and I was being as nice as possible but he doesn't and said he didn't care if I had to study or not so I went to my mother. I asked her 3-5 times if she can please tell my brother to use headphones and she ignores me and starts singing some song on purpose to get me away. I call my dad on my phone (he works later than my mom) if he can please tell my brother to stop and I get no answer (which makes sense since he is busy at work). \n\nMy parents go insane if I get a grade below an A because I must go to the best college and all that crap so I put in a significant amount of effort into my school work and exams at all time and make sure I'm top of the class in all my subjects and I spend hours upon hours studying everyday to the point where I barely hang out with friends so it's a little frustrating. \n\nSince my mother didn't care and my dad won't pick up and I can't chase my sister out of the kitchen I go back to my room and beg again and he wouldn't stop. So I tell my brother to fuck off and he goes and reports me to my mother and she starts screaming and shouting at me and says that I shouldn't corrupt her kids and I should corrupt myself and if she takes my Nintendo switch from me. I'm beyond pissed at this point because they want me to get good grades yet when I need the quietness to study to achieve these graded they wouldn't help me tell my brother to be quiet. \n\n I get into an argument with my mother and asked her why she didn't do anything when I complained and I slammed the door and then the plant vase fell from the windowsill and broke...and I feel pretty awful since it was a nice one",

      "description": "I’ll try my best to keep this nice &amp; short- but I need honestly here it has been absolutely deceiving me nuts the past two weeks\n\nThere’s 4 of us, we live in an off campus apartment complex. It’s not the nicest place ever but it’s a step up from the dorms so that’s nice- plus it’s all students. We all “rent by the room” and share the common areas, meaning we have individual leases. (Which is important later)\n\nI originally rented as a student going to university- but right before the semester started I had a family financial crisis where I was then put in a situation where I was now financially responsible for my own expenses (car loan, student loan payments, rent, utilities, gas, groceries) so I did what I had to do and dropped out of college to support all this in the meantime. Took on two jobs initially for about 3-4 months of living there. \n\nWhen this was all going down I had let them know about it all- “this is why I am no longer a student. This is why I have 2 jobs, the rent here is a bit expensive and since I’m no longer a student I’ll be looking to move out” they knew all of this months before I moved out. \n\nAbout a month ago I moved out officially, payed a hefty fee with the apartment complex to vacate the place (it was in between semesters, and it’s not really a desirable place to live in so needless to say I couldn’t find anyone to sublet my lease, which is ok. Not upset about that)\nLuckily I was able to find a better job with better pay- I can afford the rent of both places comfortably but it’s not like I’m swimming in money or anything. I’m still a 20 year old  here. \nBut I no longer have the keys to the place, the complex knows I’ve vacated (since I had to pay nearly $500 to do so) and I haven’t stepped a foot in since. But since I still have my lease I still pay for the room- which is OK. that’s my consequence to this situation. I understand that\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I started getting bombarded with texts from the 2 roommates there who handle the utilities. They sent me Venmo requests for the utilities. I initially thought this was a mistake so in our group chat I simply said “hi I no longer live here and no longer use utilities” and man did I get a shit storm response coming my way. Something about how “I agreed verbally to pay, and that they still need to heat the vacant room” ??? I don’t think I need to pay the gas AND electricity bill to heat my room- that’s $20+ of THEIR living expenses- not mine! I understand the heat the room situation though- the apartment complex advised me to close the vent in the room so I did. No heat goes into it, it’s not even close to the thermostat.\n\nI texted the one roommate who handles the electric bill that I’m not paying $20 for the logic that is to “heat my room”. Since the gas &amp; electric bill covers more than that. (Lights, electronics, computers, hot showers, washer and dryer, cooking on the stove) that’s just not the correct math. But I’ll pay the $4 to “heat my room” she never responded. \n\nYesterday the gas bill came and same thing, I denied the Venmo and a shit storm of texts came through...about how they “have to pay for the heat in MY room” and how I’m being “childish for not texting them” even though I did. They never responded to me. \n\nI’m at my wits end here. I’m starting to feel like the crazy one here but everyone I’ve spoken to on this just can’t believe  that they’re trying to make someone who doesn’t live there still pay utilities. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nMy thought process here:\n1) payed a fee to vacate the apartment \n2) I still pay the $600 rent there\n3) I have my OWN living expenses! Why should I pay theirs now?\n4) I don’t even have a key to the place anymore \n5) the one heat vent is closed in the room\n6) their parents pay for their rent/utilities..this comes out of my pocket. Me not paying the 1/4 of the utilities means $3-$4 gets added to their bill- that’s not a whole lot\n\nTL;DR: am I an asshole for no longer paying utilities in an apartment I no longer live in?\n\n",

      "description": "Recently I've been struggling with my mental health. I've taken time out of University to try to deal with it so I'm staying at home with my parents right now. I only have one friend here and we've been friends for over ten years and because I'm home we've been hanging out a bit. Never loads because I can't cope with that. I don't particularly enjoy going out and it's tiring to be with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, last week my mood crashed and I felt that it was impossible to keep our plans. Instead of saying anything, I just didn't go on Facebook. We'd arranged to meet up twice over the weekend and one of them was a food event we had to get tickets for. These were free, you just had to have one so they knew how many people were going. I didn't go online for five days and didn't talk to anyone but my parents and my therapist. I knew the entire weekend that she would be super pissed at me but I couldn't face speaking to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to today. I was reading some blog posts online and came across one about fighting social anxiety. It gave me the push I needed to get onto Facebook and send a long message explaning that I'd been really down and that I knew I shouldn't have vanished but I didn't have the courage to go online and message her. She replied 'ok'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReading the messages she'd sent over the past five days showed that she hadn't gotten worried about me, just angry. That upset me because it seems that no matter how much I share about my mental health her replies are, almost word for word: 'that's not good' and 'do this thing and you might feel better'. I know that doesn't sound bad but it's literally all she says and then we'll talk about other stuff. It upsets me because I try to take into account her feelings all the time. I felt awful all weekend because I knew I was hurting her and she doesn't even seem to care that I feel like shit. And she complains to me all the time about everything wrong in her life and I listen and listen and try as hard as I can to be supportive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I do tend to avoid messaging her and I've done stuff like this in the past (although not to this extent). I don't try to arrange to meet up because she does it first and I never know what to do or if she'll be interested in what I suggest. Maybe I'm just the shitty friend? I don't know. Please help me out here - am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have known a good friend for more than 15 years. We are both in our thirties and have professional and high-stress jobs. When we meet every 6 months (he lives in Australia), we talk about our jobs. We talk about the details to the long term issues of where to work. We also act like fools at times - mocking each other etc..\n\nHe just started his first long term relationship with a woman. He brings her everywhere including casual gatherings. I don't mind her as a person. She is friendly and not confrontational. During one encounter (just us three), we were talking in our job-related jargon and she seemed insanely bored. I realize she was excluded and apologized. She got up and wanted to leave -- my friend naturally left with her. For a few times after that, she still attended and came with him.  I tried to steer the conversation to neutral topics such as movies, politics, romantic lives etc... However, it wasn't as good as letting \"loose\" and being unfiltered. I spoke to my friend and asked if I was a third wheel. He denied this assertion. He even admitted that it is better to let loose and talk about our jobs. I asked him to not to invite his gf and let her do things on her own. However, he feels that not inviting her is a betrayal.  He said he did talk about it and will address it. To date, I am not sure the depth or extent of their conversation.\n\nWhen we still hang out every six months, she still comes all the time. She still acts uninterested in our conversations and our jocular approach to teasing each other.  She often will go on her phone, and force digressions.  At this point, I told him I think it's better that I don't attend some of our hang-outs.  He wasn't upset but kept insisting I am over-reacting.   I do feel lousy for giving a bizarre ultimatum, but things aren't the same with a gf around. I also feel conflicted about being too irrational.  \n\n\nEdit: Sorry for the grammar mistake in my post title.",

But part of me says I’m being an asshole because it’s just social media and to stop taking it so seriously. But at the same time it’s how people keep in touch and she followed our other friends back, so what is her deal against me? AITA?",

      "description": "Recent events have made me question my choice to give my girlfriend's mother an ultimatum regarding her future rights to see her as-of-yet unborn grandchildren. My girlfriend is currently saddled with over $15,000 in *her mother's debt* that was put in credit cards/student loans under my girlfriend's name, and she is intent to get a second job just to help pay off debt that isn't hers.\n\nApparently, my girlfriend started borrowing her mother money at 16 as things at the household were tight, but under the table payments in cash, which certainly isn't counted in that first total, eventually turned into credit cards after her mom maxed out her own and tanked her credit score.\n\nMy future MIL has consistently said that she would pay these back, and took out loans that she promised would be applied to the debt. However, she instead used these loans to pay for vehicles, a tummy-tuck, and trips. For one of these loans, my girlfriend took a lean out on *her own vehicle* as collateral for the loan.\n\nI recently broke when two separate events compounded to give me the impression that this woman will never pay my girlfriend back. The first of these events took place back in December when, as legal guardian of my girlfriend's twin half-siblings, took money from their savings accounts to pay down debt. This money had been given to them by their father to set up college funds and they had no knowledge of the withdrawal. They are 13 years old and certainly do not track those accounts.\n\nThe second incident, and the tipping point, occurred last week. My girlfriend pays her family's general expenses for the month and is then repaid when her mom gets her paycheck. She lives at home (for the moment) and thinks this is fine as she has never had much of an issue in being repaid. Her mother has now missed 2 payments and this week came to her asking for an extra $600 to pay the water bill which is apparently overdue by multiple months.\n\nShe called asking me what to do and I said to refuse to pay it. She has her own expenses and it is too large of a financial strain to deal with. Her mother and her got in a shouting match that had a lot of, \"You live under my roof!\" from my understanding. The two are now at odds, and I am in the middle of it.\n\nWhen I came over to go on a weekend getaway, I told her mother that if my girlfriend paid off a single one of her credit cards, she would never see her grandchildren. She then went on a tirade about how horrible that was, and that I was brainwashing her daughter into hating her family. She has since spread rumors to all of her children and other family members about how terrible and manipulative I have been. My girlfriend is entirely behind me and wants to GTFO of her house to avoid feeling obligated to assist her mother.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here?\n\nTLDR; Girlfriend saddled with $15,000 in her mom's debt. I told her mom she would never see her grandchildren if GF pays it herself.",

      "description": "I am going to a conference related to what I am studying in graduate school. I am lucky enough that I could get a hotel room on site at the conference. The hotel allows me to have up to 6 people in the room so I offered space to other students in my cohort for free as I know that there are a lot of financial limitations to going to conferences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first person to reach out to me was Abby who is part of my cohort. She asked me if she and her husband Brent could stay with me. I told her that she was welcome to, but that I did not really want to have Brent staying with us as I would rather save the space for other students in our cohort. Abby said she was unsure if she would come but asked me to hold space for her for the time being. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, Claire and Debby, both members of my cohort reached out to me about staying with me. I told them that was fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that Eric (a cohort member) reached out saying that him and Frank planned to stay in a hostel but if I still had room they would be interested in staying with me. I told both of them it was fine as well. Frank is in the same year as me and my cohort but in a slightly different field and a separate cohort from mine. He attends school in the same place and I have had multiple classes with him, the conference is relevant to both of the fields. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen the issues started. Abby is angry at me because Frank is technically not part of our cohort and I said that I was only allowing cohort members and that is why her husband Brent could not stay with us (who is not in graduate school and works full time in an unrelated field). I tried to explain my reasoning to Abby and she said she understood but is still upset. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen Debby reached out to me. She texted me that Claire and she are not comfortable staying with men and that I shouldn’t have allow them to stay with us. She is telling me I am being unfair and that Claire and her already bought tickets to the conference that they can’t get refunded but that they don’t feel comfortable staying with men. They also said because they knew I said Brent couldn’t stay with me they assumed that no men would be staying in the room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey feel that since Eric and Frank had already planned to stay at a hostel I should just tell them to go back to their original plan, and only let women stay with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the originally message I sent to the group I didn’t specify anything about gender, as I am comfortable staying with anyone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kind of feel like a dick that people are out money and now have no where to stay for the conference. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I have a hotel room for a conference and decided to let both men and women stay with me and now some of the women are upset. ",

Everyone else hates talking in front of the class, but we all know that public speaking is an important skill to practice.

I said no, because I don't like showing weakness and ect. due to past bullying. As I got home it was bruised.\n\nHe will also make sexual remarks with me.

      "description": "Just throwing it out there, he's 17 and I just turned 18, we're both seniors in highschool and I'm stressing out big time about college applications. I have a 2.3 GPA (not good I know), but I still have a decent amount of colleges that are reasonable for me to apply to. However, my boyfriend is in the same boat as me, except his GPA is higher and we both got the same test score. He plans on applying to the same schools as me, and some of his own as well. I helped him get started by helping him with the common app questions and his college essays, no biggie. But after a while, I got burnt out. He constantly brings up college applications, asking for my help because he feels he can't do them on his own, while im still worrying about my deadlines, and the schools that require auditions (sound recording technology major). Am I the asshole for going silent for a couple days after I've asked him multiple times to slow down on mentioning college, and not wanting to help him any more than I already have?",

      "description": "Towards the end of last fall my 16 year old son started bringing a friend over to our house.  He’s  a nice enough kid, but over the course of this winter he’s basically inserted himself into our family.  \n\nNow he comes over every day after school and spends the night frequently on weekends.  He only has his mother in his life and she’s not home a lot.  She’s a whole other story of entitlement.  The second time we met her she asked us for money.  \n\nBack to my son’s friend though, he’s always bringing his issues and dramas with him to our house.  Often I feel like his therapist.  It would be different if I didn’t also have two young children in addition to my son, but I do and adding an troubled teen to the mix has just been frustrating and mentally tiring.  \n\nIt’s all come to a head though.  He smokes although he denies it.  There have been multiple times I’ve smelled cigarette smoke on him.  Earlier in the week one of their teachers caught them both smoking in the dugout at their school.  \n\nMy punishment for my son was no going out and no friends over for a week.  I’m going to also ban this particular friend from coming over.  At least on week days.  I don’t know yet.  I’d like to ban him completely, but I do feel bad.  I haven’t fully made my mind up yet. \n\nMy husband doesn’t usually come home until later on so he’s not as bothered by his presence as I am, but since I’m the one to deal with and feed the boy my husband is deferring to me on this.  I just have enough on my plate, I really don’t need all the problems he brings with him and now he’s becoming a bad influence on my son.  ",

My ex has contacted me about their posts and it seems clear to me that the posts is feeding an unhealthy habit: checking up on me. While I’ve moved on, it’s clear to me my ex has fallen into a deep depression and isn’t doing well. \n\nThe people I’d want to ask to unfriend the ex are my parents and my very best friends. \n\nI don’t want my ex knowing anything about my personal life.

      "description": "My buddy got engaged three weeks ago and they already booked a wedding at an all exclusive resort in Jamaica for the end of June 2019.  He's now texting everyone the travel agent's information and telling us to book our room ASAP since they could only reserve a few rooms for the wedding party.  For the minimum stay of 3 nights + flights, my GF and I are looking at $2,600 for a room that's a basic hotel room with a view of the \"tropical gardens\".  My GF is in grad school and already dealing with a lot of student loan debt (&gt;$100k) and most likely won't be able to make the wedding due to her school schedule.  I'm not going to push for her to go since her student loans are very stressful for her.  If she doesn't go, I'm looking at a $2,000 3 day vacation for this wedding.  I'm seriously considering not going and I feel like a jerk and cheapskate.  Also, I've know this guy since high school and I'm assuming he's planning to ask me to be in the wedding party. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  I'm considering skipping my friend's wedding in Jamaica due to cost and relatively short notice.  I feel like an asshole, but I also feel justified if I don't go.",

Has purposely fed our oldest kid items that we asked her not to due to a possible allergy or threw away food that I made for my daughters breakfast bc she said I was forcing my daughter to eat and going to make her fat.

If we don't like to get out, so we left the house. When FIL asked us to come back we agreed and I was given the silent treatment  for our remaining time there and the night before we left to come overseas MIL hugged and said be safe to everyone. I got a pat on the head like dog.\n\nNow we're going back stateside and will be 3 hrs from the in laws and am dreading it all. She seems to think nothing is wrong, grandkids will be spending nights with them and they will have free access to our life and kids.

I’m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he’s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon’t get me wrong Justin’s nice, he’s attractive, and he’s good in bed, but I just don’t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I’ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn’t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he’s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he’d find another girl, but he wouldn’t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? ",

Mostly due to just being very different types of people. There were some issues of their kids bullying my kids. And the wife got pissy with me one day because I told her to keep her dog on a leash and out of my yard after he jumped on my autistic son and scared him.  \n\nAnyway, we don't speak to them or hang out with them. We happily ignore each other. However- I have made it clear to the neighbors that since we are not buddies, I don't want their kids hanging out in my yard or leaving things in my yard. \n\nMy kids never go into their yards or leave things in their yards. I make sure of this. \n\nHowever, their kids are always walking through our yard back and forth to each other's houses. Meandering their football games or kickball games into our yard. And then consequently leaving items in my yard. \n\nTo this date I have found: A baseball glove, 10+ baseballs, 2 footballs, a frisbee.  \n\nI used to leave them there and they stayed out there for infinity without them claiming them. So I started throwing them back into their yard. But now, I just immediately throw them away. \n\nOne day me and the neighbor Dad almost came to blows because his kid left the baseball glove in my yard and I threw it away. When they came back to ask me about it I told him straight up I threw it away. \n\nAITA for taking things  left on my property and throwing them away especially after I asked them multiple times to stay out of my yard and not to leave things in my yard?\n\n",

      "description": "Ok so let me get the story straight, so this girl the wife of my dads best friend cheated on my mother with my dad (I didn't find out about this until a year ago) due to mental problems and a 3 years later they had a boy and then a couple years after that a second one. The only reason I was with them was because of my dad, I used to stay with them every Thursday and every second weekend with my dad.\n\n But my dad became very ill of pancreatic cancer and visits became fewer and fewer and he was becoming weaker and weaker (due to failing organs and chemotherapy) and he told me the story about this ring he had and how it was my great grandfathers ring in which he got it from Vietnam when fighting there. He told me that when he passed that I could have it and I should give it to my eldest son as it had been passed on from his dad. This was very important to him and to me.\n\n Fast forward few months and he had done his time and had passed away. I was very sad and then it turned to anger when i asked for the ring back and my stepmom said no he gave it to me as a wedding ring. So I tried for a little bit but ended up giving up. So I said since I know you don't fish I was wondering if I could have my dad old fishing gear ( me and my dad fished a lot) she said that she fished all the time and she was going to use it, this made me suspicious because me and my dad have always invited her to fishing but she always said no. She also kept all my dads guns and she doesn't even shoot. She won't give a single thing of my dads to me even though she knows we loved to fish and shoot on the range.\n\nOk so this was all 2 years ago and I haven't tried to get it back since. Am I the asshole. Are we all the assholes. Please be the judge.",

      "description": "Let me explain: For Thanksgiving (2018) my calculus teacher assigned us to make a thank you letter to our parents that would be mailed to them on exactly Thanksgiving. My parents just got divorced, and are currently living at separate addresses. I wrote two pages to my dad about how much he’s taught me, how I’m who I am to him, everything you would expect. I had some friends and even my favorite teachers to read over it to make sure it was perfect, and I ended up making My english and anatomy teacher well up, along with a few classmates cry. I poured my absolute heart into this letter. I turned it in with confidence that I said what I wanted my dad to know. After all, I love him to death.\n\nHere’s the problem: I didn’t write anything for my mom. I didn’t want to. I couldn’t stretch to write a paragraph, much less a page. I wouldn’t budge to fake it, or write some generic garbage as a nice gesture. I don’t know if it was bitterness, spite, or just negative parts of our relationship taking focus of anything I was thankful for.\n\n My dad received his letter Thanksgiving day, and he loved it. He asked if he could show his friends how great his son was and whatnot. My mom didn’t get anything that day. To be fair, she doesn’t even know about the letter and she doesn’t know that I couldn’t write half a page of nice things about her. However, she loves me and I don’t think It’s fair that I silently resent her. I feel like I’m the only one in the family that she really has right now, and she probably needs someone to love her right now.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

Like why can't he just make friends IRL or in his own state? It was just so weird to me and basically, I told L to cancel the flight and not come because I didn't think he would actually come. I got into an argument and my friend R and A who agreed with me kicked him from the discord. I removed L from all my social media and cut off contact with him. I told C that if he hangs out with L over winter break than I'm not friends with him. C is saying that I'm just being a dick so I would like to know if I am actually being an asshole. ",

      "description": "I posted on this sub a few weeks ago about my work. I have a lot of downtime, and that coupled with the fact that I don't get paid very much, has made me want to pursue other options after only 1 month.\n\nI've now been here for a little over 2 months. I'm still just as bored, slowly updating my resume and occasionally checking LinkedIn and Indeed for jobs I think I might like. But mostly on Reddit and Pinterest all day. \n\nToday, Monday morning, I get to work and open an email saying me and my coworker's pay is going to be cut by up to 15%. \n\nIt's a giant company based on sales of several different types of products. From my understanding, the product that my branch is selling is the only product making any money. All the other branches are hemorrhaging money. They had a massive layoff last month and let go of about a third of total employees.\n\nI feel like I landed on a sinking ship that I didn't know was going down.\n\nI took this job as a small stepping stone to get to the next higher-up job title, but with a different company. I planned on staying here for only 6-8 months initially. I'm not learning any skills, no new software, nothing.\n\nMy question is, our busy season is coming up. If I left, that would leave my 2 coworkers with the same job as me to pick up my work. Although I don't have nearly as much work as they do, they're already swamped, and this'll just add more to their plate. They have been nothing but nice to me, and I don't want to do that to them. I want to leave on as good of terms as I can, in case I need a reference in the future. WIBTA if I did that to them?\n\nSorry for the long post. I'm sitting at my desk, having written this right after our meeting where my boss explained the email. I just got my email from him about my new rate. It doesn't seem like that much when it's put into hourly terms, but those hours and dollars add up, and it's definitely at least $1,000 less per year, if not more.",

It’s not the fact that she would sandbag games for her husband or just outright complain throughout the game. But her demeanor and just bad energy. She would often yell at and/or berate my friend in front of all of us or quickly get drunk and then handsy to my friend to and extent that it would make everyone uncomfortable. There are a number of other details about her that are less than kind and don’t want to get into right now. \n\nThey are back in town for the holidays. We also both have a very good mutual friend whom I heard from that my buddy just planned on showing up with his wife to game day.

      "description": "Hi, so another school post. INFO: 15, F. In a releationship with a guy. \nGirl: 14, single. Grade below\n\nEvery year, we have 3 dances; homecoming, snow fest, and prom. Only two are available for 7th-12th, prom is 11th-12th and 10th if invited. Homecoming passed, now its snow fest's turn. She asked me to snow fest and I said, \"Just as friends.\" She frowned and I said it again \"Just. As. Friends.\" And she grinned as her brother quotes \"A creep smirk\"\n\nI didn't mind, but she bought me a Valentine's day card the school gives out each year. It was \"I love you everything you DEW\" with a Mountain Dew and a cherry sucker. She drew me on the back, but my head was gone and had a creepy shadow behind me. So, would I be the asshole for changing my mind because im uncomfortable and dont have any romantic interest in her.\n\nWIBTA If I change my mind because I am uncomfortable and feel like she doesnt understand that I dont like her romantically?",

      "description": "Last night I was coming home from work on the bus. I was exhausted but there was no place to sit so I had to stand for maybe 10 minutes. When a seat opened up I took it. I am very, very overweight so I usually try to sit away from people so I don't crowd thier space but last night the bus was unusually crowded. I was so tired I just sat down. I guess my hip touched the guy next to me and he said that he didn't like to be touched. I told him I was very sorry but I only had a few more blocks to go. He told me that wasn't good enough and I shouldn't be so selfish. I again told him I was sorry. He then started getting really vile with me and I was so scared I just sat there saying nithing. He was so mad I could feel his spit on my face and he was just calling me the worst of worst names. I decided I'd just get off and walk home but then got stuck against the pole as I tried to stand up which just gave him more ammunition to berate me. Finally I wiggles loose and got off the bus at the next stop. I was just happy to be away from that guy.\n\nAnother lady got off with me and first asked if I was ok. I said I was used to it at this point. But then she started getting mad at me for not sticking up for myself. I told her I was sorry and then she said I was always going to be everyone's asshole if I keep acting so pathetic and walked away in the opposite direction.\n\nI hate confrontation so much but I've been playing both altercations over and over in my head and feel like such an asshole and loser. Am I an asshole? ",

      "description": "I had an aquaintince, no we weren't friends but we were friendly, sociable and occasionally drank together as we had mutual relatives.  His wife and he had 3 children together and he basically was a lazy sludge. His wife was always borrowing money off my sister (her landlord) to pay rent but he and his children always had new Nikes on. She basically took care of him and he volunteered but didn't have a paying job. \n\nI didn't approve of this but at the same time it didn't exactly affect me so I stayed in my lane, live and let live and what have you. He was a nice enough guy, arrogant , but decent personality wise. Anyway, a couple years ago his wife went to the doctors and they found out that she had cancer . It was already in the late stages and she died relatively quickly. We all felt horrible and one of the local clubs we were mutual members of got together and pulled money together so that he would have to worry about bills etc with the grief of losing your wife and the mother of your children, we even donated so that there would be money for the kids for Christmas. My brother even gave him a vehicle for free. All he had to do way pay to transfer the title . \n\nWell, the first thing that pissed me off is he was drinking. Big deal right? No he was drinking the money we gave him for his bills. The vehicle my brother gave him? He sold that as well. It got to the point where they gave his mother the check for the children's Christmas gifts so he didn't blow that as well.\nTo top it all off we had a service for his wife. A get together of friends and family at the local bar. He got loaded and was shoving his tongue down another woman's throat. AT.HIS.DEAD.WIFES.SERVICE I watched him and her shamelessly make out in front of his and my horrified and disgusted family members.\n\nNow I'm no Prince, I do not preach holiness from the comfort of my ivory toeer, but I just couldn't help thinking \"is she even cold yet? \" \n\nI stopped talking to him that day, even when he says hello to me I ignore him. I don't need that type of person in my life , that to me is the fakest shit ever .\n\n\nOh and he married another woman like 3 months later. She has money which I assume is her most appealing feature. Of course she seems lovely, but I'm almost positive that his toxicity will ruin her as well.",

      "description": "My wife and I have been married for 20 some odd years. We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother’s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while… I just couldn’t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (… *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.",

      "description": "I am a (22 M) living with my (21 F) in an apartment. I am a registered nurse that works full time and my gf is a nursing student who works part-time on the weekends. When we moved into the apartment the deal was she would maintain the apartment and I would pay for everything (rent, groceries, utilities, ect.). It's been a few months and things have been alright for the most part. I work 4 days a week with 2 shifts from 3PM - 3 AM and 2 shifts from 3PM - 11PM. Today, I was on my third work day of the week which meant I just worked back to back 12's. I woke up 2 hours before work and needed time to decompress, which meant I did not touch the pile of dishes that were in the sink. My gf got home from class as I was heading to work and she didn't say anything to me at the time. Tonight, I got home around midnight and I saw that the kitchen was still a mess and my gf had left some cheese on the counter. So, I popped into our bedroom and said \"hey please don't leave food out\" to which she replied \"well how about you do the fucking dishes\" and then went back to sleep. Now, I do help out around the apartment and clean the entire place on my weekends off while she goes to work, but I am in the middle of my work week right now and kinda expect her to keep the place clean while i'm not home.  I understand that she is really stressed because nursing school is awful (been there done that), but I am letting her live with me 100% free so that she did not have to commute to school. I just want to know AITA for not doing the dishes before going into work today?",

      "description": "So I recently studied abroad in Europe, and even though I learned a lot of good things, one not so good thing I picked up is smoking the occasional cigarette. And by occasional, I mean no more than once a month, usually only when I’ve been drinking and that doesn’t happen often. \n\nMy girlfriend, for obvious reasons, is not a fan of this habit. She’s worried about the health implications, which I understand, and she also doesn’t like the smell it leaves behind. I always explain to her that one reason I like them is because I’m pretty introverted so when we’re at bars or parties, it gives me a nice excuse to step outside and have a moment by getting away from music and people. As for the health stuff, I don’t really feel like it’s making a big impact as little as I smoke them, and I point out to her that if I got drunk every weekend that would probably kill me faster but she wouldn’t have a problem with it. \n\nShe’s still not okay with it and has caused a couple disagreements. I’ve already promised her that if it got to the point I was craving one when I wasn’t drinking or started smoking more often than I am now, I would give them up but until then I don’t see the problem. Am I the asshole for not listening to her and quitting?",

      "description": "So for context my mom is a yoga teacher and my dad is a photographer. \nThey left today to work with a campaign of ONU that involves both victims and former members of the guerillas, in an area that is still dangerous and that has issues with armed groups. \n\nBefore leaving and as I was saying good bye to her, my mom even reminded me that anything could happen and gave me the name of the funeral service they have and some directions regarding a project she has next week, just in case. \n\nSo a little time after they left my grandma and I are having lunch and she keeps talking about people that have been kidnapped, about some journalists that were killed in the frontier, about how the “clan of x” was fighting with the “clan of y” , etc etc. \n\nAfter a while I couldn’t take it anymore and asked her to please change the subject to something lighter because I was feeling uncomfortable and more anxious.   I already have an overly active imagination and I didn’t need the extra ‘worry material’ \n\nMy comment didn’t sit well with her and she proceeded to tell me that she never knew how to speak to me because I would always scold her.  \n\nThen she then brought up other situations, some from  2 years ago, that pretty much boiled down to the fact that she asked me to do a favor (a time consuming favor) and I, in her words, “just ignored her”. \nMost of the times I didn’t get to do those things because I was busy with Uni or because I genuinely forgot. \n\nShe then said that I always made her feel worthless and because of that she didn’t know how to speak to me and she even told me that I should consider going to a therapist because she didn’t think it was ok for me to always speak up my mind when something was bothering me.  \n\nI understand that she might be feeling bad because sometimes we don’t have a lot of things in common. \n\nWhen I try to talk with her about things that I do she doesn’t pay attention or makes an off handed remark and when she talks about the things that she likes I am interested in some of them, but others I just don’t care about but try listen to her and then excuse myself to do something else. \n\nAll in all I feel that she ended up painting me like some sort of bully and I would really like to have a second opinion. AITA? \n",

      "description": "Long wall of text; TL;DR at the bottom\n\nSo I (19 F) met my ex in high school, first grade, we didn't talk that much, we were more like classmates till the 4th grade (last year in high school), when he started to like me once we took same class together. I used to meet him once a week maybe twice, and we talk a lot on the internet, mostly about studies, exchanging memes and used to tell me some cool bedtime stories. I liked him, and he also did, and after exams, he told me that he thinks he likes me and I said that I do too, he asked me out. He was too shy to do it, so his ex bestfriend was the one who asked me if I want his bff or not and I said yes so he told him to go for it. \n\nMy mom, very strict, doesn't want me to date anyone, because dating for her means sexual relationship. So during summer holidays I used to ask my uncle to take me to my best friend's house where I act like I'm getting in then I go out and meet my ex. I've kept doing that for an entire month once to twice a week. And we haven't kissed or touched inappropriately. Meanwhile, I've been talking to his bestfriend, everyday for hours, and I told both of them about my family problems and they showed me empathy and care. Especially his bestfriend because we used to talk more and we are both introverts so we don't go out much. I liked his bestfriend a lot till he became my bestfriend too. And one day just two weeks after we started dating me and my ex, I spent more than 24 hours talking to his bestfriend and I found him so interesting and I never got annoyed of talking to him, his advice, his helpful plans, his movies and music suggestions,and then the way he treated me and what he did to talk to me once my mom found out that I've been seeing my ex and lying to her. (She got onto my Facebook because she has my password and looked through my messages), and I fell in love, I denied that because I was in a relationship,besides that's normal for friends to treat you that way.\n\nSo, my mom used to come and sit next to me everytime I use my phone to make sure I'm not talking to my ex, nor to my female bestfriend. And once she sleeps (around 3am) , I find my male bestfriend online and we talk for 30 minutes, or less, gives me virtual hugs, and I talk to my ex during the morning once she leaves my side. Days later, she started to give me back some freedom, and I restarted to talk to my ex using a pillow to hide the screen, and of course to my male bestfriend. We got even closer, and I started to love him even more, he kept giving me advice on how to manage the family problems. My male bestfriend unlike my ex who is a bit childish and with non-existent intellectual talk, is a good listener, so I used to \"ignore\" my ex and talk to him about everything even politics lol. So my ex felt a bit leftout, and in groupchats like he is a thirdwheel, and we argued a lot about that... and he hated it when I say that his bestfriend is so cute and so sweet...\n\nSummer holidays came to an end, and I entered my architecture university. For art class, the very first week, we went to a part of the city where my male bestfriend's university is. And knowing that, I've never seen him before, except three time in high school where we had a 5 second conversation, I wanted to see him after class, because at this point we talked online a thousands time more than we did IRL. But he couldn't come. I was hurt. But I said maybe he just doesn't want to see me because he is just antisocial. (I've tried to meet him two times before but he couldn't manage to showed up). And my ex knows about everything. Few days before breaking up with my ex,I sent him more than 10 wholesome memes of couples, and he answered me saying oh it is an overwhelming love. And one week before breaking up, i came to where he lives, asked him to meet me, he didn't answer and didn't come to see me. You can tell from the way he talks to me that he doesn't want to be with me anymore.So we broke up. Now leading up to this part you already think that I'm an asshole, now comes this part.for weeks before our breakup, My male bff stopped talking to my ex for seemingly unknown reasons, until one day after we were together, he told me that my ex was insulting him with his other friends, was insulting me with him, and was always an unpleasant friend overall because he was an avid drinker and a failure at life and my male bff just didn't have the courage to cut him off. Among other horrible stuff like talking bad about people, then acting like they're his friends. And one week before his birthday since i have his password, I checked his facebook messages to find out that he wants me back but just so i don't get in a relationship with his ex bestfriend and that he used to talk bad about me and told everyone about my family, joked about my problems and made fun of my insecurities, to top this off, I found out that he was going to breakup with me if he found another girl, aswell as him hitting on a classmate.\n\nI forgot to mention that we kept being in touch. And his birthday came, and I was the first one to wish him happy birthday and instead of thanking me he said that I'm cheap, I got angry, he didn't notice, kept talking about his life, and about the girl he found attractive and ignored him, so I made fun of him, hurt, he told my female best friend about that. 13 days after, I told him that I'm asking his ex-bestfriend out, so he said that I'm an asshole, and called me a bitch. I apologized, he called me a dead thing, I kept apologizing, and ever since he has never talked to me again.He keeps telling people that he loved me(even though there's actual proof that he didn't, but it involves me sneaking into his messages) and that I broke his heart, aswell as his ex-best friend being a traitor, and outed us as the assholes with his friends.\n \nTL;DR: I have been emotionally cheating on my ex, which was uninterested in our relationship anyway, but keeps on telling people I'm an asshole.",

      "description": "Ok before I get cancelled, let me give some background. I (19 F) have been dating my boyfriend (19M) for about a year now. He is black and I’m white and we have never had any problems being a “mixed race” couple (aside from a few mean comments from others, but we just ignore them), and we don’t really give much thought to it honestly. We typically have similar political beliefs and outlook on life.\n\nLast night we were talking about Michael Jackson and R Kelly and it turned into a discussion about “cancel culture”. We both agreed it was good that some people are finally being held accountable but then I mentioned that it is getting out of hand and some things are just completely taken out of context. Yes, something someone said on twitter might be completely stupid and shouldn’t have been said, but it doesn’t mean we should instantly jump on the bandwagon and start calling this person a sexist or racist or whatever. We’ve all said stupid shit, but it doesn’t necessarily mean we’re this evil person (take the pew die pie situation for example). \n\nBoyfriend then says that he doesn’t give a shit about context and says “well, if a white person said nigger with a hard r, he should be cancelled no matter what”. I said “well yea, you shouldn’t use the word, but context is still really important. If I said “You shouldn’t use the word nigger” I’m not actually using it in a harmful way, I’m speaking about the word.”\n\nBf then gets mad and still says anyone who says it should be cancelled, doesn’t matter the context. I ask him about the white actors in movies like Django Unchained and 12 Years a Slave- yep, he thinks they should be cancelled for acting. He brings up the point that you wouldn’t say a cuss word around children, but I said that’s part of my point, we are grown adults and people should be able to discuss things in a mature way. I feel like being so afraid to say a word even in the right context just gives more power to the word. I mean that’s why the word nigga is a term of endearment for black people now- they took back the word, and took back its power. He just keeps saying “you’re white so you don’t get it” back to me.\n\nAt this point the argument is getting ridiculous and I start yelling at him about how much of a hypocrite he is for his liberal use of the word faggot, to which he yelled back “that’s completely different” and got mad and walked out. Yea, ok.\n\nI know the whole argument was dumb and I handled the argument in a shitty way and so did he, and we both apologized. However, the whole n word thing made me feel crazy especially since usually he is a little more conservative than me. AIT racist asshole for thinking there is a right context for the word, and for thinking people shouldn’t get cancelled over a stupid mistake?\n\n",

      "description": "Hi everyone! My husband and I bought a house in August and when we did the final walkthrough minutes before the closing, we found that the ceiling above the one window in our living room was wet and there was some mold present. My realtor drew up an amendment to our contract, which is signed by all parties, saying that we were going to continue with the closing but the sellers agreed to fix the damage and mold *as well as* the underlying problem.\n\nAfter a week or two of phone tag, a contractor hired by the seller finally showed up. He gave me the creeps, but whatever. He looked outside, gave me some BS about the gutters, replaced the piece of drywall and then disappeared without even painting it, and I couldn't get a hold of him.\n\nFast forward a month or so later, the leak is back, and it is even worse....actually dripping instead of just wet spots. I couldn't get a hold of him of course, so I called the realtor, and she gave me the seller's number. I contacted the seller and, of course, the contractor called me right away and told me he would be there the next day. He ASKED if we were going to be home, which was weird, and I said no because we both work but my dad would be there because he was off. The guy never showed up. He texted me saying \"something came up\" and that he was going to come over the next day (yesterday, now) in the morning, again asking if we would be home. My husband took yesterday off for a different reason, but he was at the house all day. He again never showed up. Since the guy was weird about asking us if we would be home etc., I texted him and asked him \"hey, did you get to the house today?\" Knowing full well that he wasn't there. He responded with \"yeah, I was there! I found some bent flashing above the one window and I replaced it!\" He sent the seller a bill for work that was never done. Needless to say I contacted the seller and he fired the contractor and someone else is coming to do the work. The contractor left me a few voicemails calling me an asshole, even though I caught him in a lie. So Reddit, AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: asked a question I knew the answer to to catch a shady contractor in a lie, caught him, he got fired. ",

      "description": "So me (20f) and one of my friends from school (21f) went out to a club like a week ago. I hadn't spoken to her in a while, both of us had just gotten busy, and last time we spoke she was having some major relationship drama. \n\nSo when we met up again she filled me in on everything. Her boyfriend (of five years) had hit her once, which I knew about, but she confessed to me that he had done it more than once. They'd also broken up for a period, in which she had slept with someone else. When they got back together and she told him about this he flipped out about it, and started calling her a whore and stuff like that. She'd also cheated on him once before that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were drinking this whole time, and a lot of what seemed like her \"true\" feelings came out. She confessed to me that she didn't love her boyfriend anymore, wasn't attracted to him, but felt guilty about what had happened and felt like she owed it to him to \"try\" again. I told her that was insane, and that even though she was wrong for what she did she shouldn't be in a relationship that she didn't want to be in. That isn't fair to her or him. Because of all the things that happened in the past, her boyfriend had become very controlling and untrusting of her. We had planned a night out, and he told her she needed to meet up with him to go home at around 10:30, which is very early considering it was a Saturday night and we'd planned to go out drinking. Well as we got drunker and drunker and how she truly felt about her boyfriend came out, I told her she should just turn off her phone and be done with him. She was very clear about not loving him or wanting to be with him, so I told her to just end it and have fun. She did, and ended up making out with another guy at the club. At the end of the night, around 2am, she called her (ex?) boyfriend and he called her an uber home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't reply to my texts consistently for about 2 days, and then when she did told me how guilty she felt about what happened. She said she did love her boyfriend and want to be with him, and that she shouldn't have done what she did. She also said she \"has a hard time saying no to me\", which to me sounded like she was sort of blaming me for what happened. We haven't really talked since, and she doesn't want to hang out or go out anymore. Honestly I feel like I've lost a good friend, but I don't feel as though I've done anything wrong. She didn't have to do what I said she should do, and she definitely didn't have to make out with someone. I have a boyfriend as well, and also got super drunk, but didn't cheat. I just feel like she won't get out of this awful relationship because it's been so long, and it clearly isn't good for her but she doesn't see that, and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore because she knows that I feel that way, or because she blames me for what happened.",

      "description": "So I just turned 18 in November, and want to go on a trip to visit some old friends. My parents are onboard, but just today they said they want to have some tracker app on my phone in order to make sure I’m safe. They then changed it to me just giving them my iTunes password, and they could look at the find my iPhone. I am a very private person, and feel weirded out by giving out my password. I countered with letting them make a snapchat, as I have snapmaps on and they could just look at that, without me giving out my private stuff. My parents got very upset though about how I don’t trust them, and how I know their ATM pin and all these other passwords. I’ve always been a private person, and don’t share stuff with hardly anyone. My parents say they are upset I’d lump them in “with everyone else”. I’ve since said I’ll give them  the password but they are still upset for what I initially said. AITA?",

      "description": "So sorry for the long post; I tried to cut down as much as I can!\n\nAfter graduating from college, I took a break before applying to law school. For the past few months, I worked as a teacher in rural China (this becomes relevant later), and put my home address as that of my parents. \n\nMy application cycle has been successful, and I am extremely grateful to be in my current situation. However, my parents have this irritating habit of announcing my law school acceptances before I have the opportunity to do so, and it has gotten to the point where family friends will sometimes find out that I've been accepted to a law school before I do. Law schools typically send out an acceptance email to applicants first, followed by a formal hard copy of the acceptance letter. Because I worked in an area without internet on top of the infamous Chinese firewall, I didn't receive the emails. However, my parents happily rip open any law school mail they receive, even if it is clearly addressed to me. They then proceed to call and brag to their friends that I got into X Law School.\n\nIt probably seems petty, but I have worked my entire life to get to this point, and I really looked forward to finding out for myself if I got into X Law School, and opening that envelope to see the hard copy of my acceptance letter. I worked and paid my own way through college, and also paid for all my law school applications. The fact that I have to find out about my own acceptances from congratulatory texts from family friends or posts by my parents on social media is infuriating. \n\nI have asked my parents in the past to not open my mail, and to allow me to decide what news to share with family and friends. They have pulled this kind of stunt in the past, especially with my college acceptances and scholarship award letters a few years back, but whenever I ask them not to, they act hurt and tell me that they only \"want to share good news with everyone\" and how it doesn't matter if whether they find out first or I find out first. When I told them that I thought it was inconsiderate that they would deliberately ignore my requests, they were extremely offended. My dad even sarcastically offered to send photos of any future acceptance letters if, as he put it, \"reading those letters is SO important to you.\" \n\nAITA for telling off my parents for more or less stealing my thunder over my acceptances? I know that they're just excited, but it feels like they prioritize being able to brag to their friends over my personal preferences.",

      "description": "Hi everyone,  I have (I feel) a rather unique situation. \n\nFor starters: me [26F], Socially excluded girl (SE) [early 20s], EG friends [20-24 all F] and Excluder girl (EG) [early 20s]\n\nSo I've been in this group of all female friends for 2 years. SE came into the picture a year ago and she seemed to fit in fine, or so I thought. Recently, EG stopped talking to SE for an unknown reason and SE has been asking EG for months about why she's being ignored. \n\nBecause SE wasn't getting any answers from EG, SE started talking to mutual friends and requesting them to ask EG why she was ignoring SE. From SE's perspective it appears she feels like she's being cast aside since all mutual friends have told her to leave EG alone. SE says she just wants to apologize for whatever she's done and move on.\n\nNow, from the screenshots of the conversations I was sent from SE:\n-SE had been trying to talk to EG for months but got no reply.\n-SE used mutual friends to get an answer from EG about why she was being ignored. \n-Friends of EG tell SE to leave EG alone and SE said EG was being a bitch for not telling SE what her problem with SE was.\n-EG sends a long message that essentially calls SE out for being a bad friend for talking shit behind her back. Also said she can choose who to be friends with and doesn't want to be friends with SE due to a personality clash.\n\nI'm torn in this situation because although I don't condone how EG and friends have basically excluded SE, part of me feels like SE made a mountain out of a mole hill. SE is very upset and feels hurt because several of her friends chose EG over SE. I would normally be empathetic with someone who is being bullied, but part of me also feels like SE brought this on herself by dragging mutual friends into the drama and making them choose sides.\n\nSE doesn't want me to ask EG or mutual friends for their side because she feels like EG would hate her more for it.\n\nReddit, I know how terrible SE must be feeling as we're the only friend group she really hangs out with. I don't want to choose a side though because I feel both parties contributed to the drama.\n\nI would like to know what reddit's opinion is.",

      "description": "This just happened today and I'm distressed. My cat died and I need honest opinions on whether I was an asshole that contributed to this or whether I'm being irrational in grief.\n\nSo my cat is about 7 years old. He lived with me at my dads place and when I moved out a few years ago, I ended up having him stay there. I cant stay at my dads, because the house triggers my asthma/allergies, but that's because I'm particularly  sensitive. \n\nThis has been a sore spot for me, because my dad and family aren't the most responsible. They will feed/clean litter/pet him/give him treats but they're not on top of his health. However, I live in a studio (basically a room) and every time I bring my cat over, he pretty much just sits on a bed and is by himself most of the day. So I've felt that having a whole house to roam and constant attention is a better living situation for him, with me taking him to vet visits and so on.\n\nA few months ago, I realized it had been a couple years since his last checkup and brought him to the vet. He was overweight but otherwise in perfect health. However, he had a dental condition that the vet said could be causing pain while eating, and they recommended dental cleaning under anesthesia and tooth extraction,  possibly up to his full mouth. \n\nThis seemed extreme and the anesthesia seemed risky to me, and since the vet was small, I decided I would delay the decision for a few months and go for a second opinion with a more advanced vet when my parents were both on vacation and I'd have him at my place anyway. This way, I'd have time to think things over and if he needed the tooth extraction, I could handle the post-op care and make sure it was handled properly.\n\nFast forward to this Monday, my dad has left and I'm going to pick my cat up on Tuesday and bring him to the vet on Wednesday. \n\nMonday night, my girlfriend ended up improperly using Drano and bursting a pipe, flooding my kitchen with Drano water. This was then tracked through the apartment. I was extremely concerned, because Drano is severely caustic/toxic, and I do not want my cat getting any residue on his paws and becoming sick. My apartment is one room, so there's no way to block off areas either.\n\nSo I decided I would go by my dads to feed him until I could have my apartment cleaned properly. Tuesday, I went by and fed him. \n\nWednesday, when it seemed like the cleaning would take longer than expected, I messaged my mom and arranged to take him to her place, where I'd stay with him. \n\nThat night, I took him to the vet. It was -5 Celcius out - I drove the 10 minute drive there, but theres 5 minutes in the car where it's cold (need to wait to turn on heating) and 3 minutes walk from the parking spot. \n\nAt the vets, hes fine. Still in great health. I ask a bunch of questions about the dental treatment and am confident in the vet's answers, so we tentatively plan for a cleaning in two weeks. \n\nWe leave the vet- again, maybe 8 - 10 minutes combined low temperature between the walk and the car heating up. \n\nWhen we get to my dads, he's peed in the carrier, so I take him to the washroom, run a bath and then bathe him in lukewarm water. I use tearless baby shampoo from a new bottle, which is safe for use on cats. \n\nAfter, I used a small towel to wipe some of the water off him but he was still pretty wet. He was frazzled and wanted to run from the bathroom, so I let him go. Then, I took another small towel, found him and wiped him down again. He was still a bit damp but I figured he'd air dry. The house is warm too. I left some treats for him and left. \n\nToday, I went to go pick him up to take to my moms. I pack his things and then when I go look for him, hes dead and stiff as a board. \n\nHe was in perfect health. All I can think is...I killed him. He must gave got hypothermia. I would never imagine that some brief outside temperature and a bath would kill a large cat, but it's the only option I see besides a heart attack. He used to be a stray and lived outdoors during rain storms - I cant believe he'd die from this.\n\nI don't know if I'm being too hard on myself or if I murdered him. I'm devastated - I'm taking him for a necropsy tomorrow. \n\nIf he had a heart attack from the stress, I'll feel a little less guilty, because I can't not take him to the vet, but there were no indications of heart disease.",

      "description": "I'm on mobile, and this story is kinda long. Sorry if formatting is funky.\n\nI'm a senior in high school, and I will be graduating in May. At the beginning of my senior year, my mom had started talking to a lot of friends and family about coming out to watch me graduate from high school. \n\nAll of the schools in my district have their ceremonies at the same venue. I have been to graduation ceremonies for my school and others in the same district before, and they have been very, very crowded. It usually works out in the end, and all of the attendees are seated before the ceremony begins. Due to those seating complications, my school district has now put a new rule in place for graduations.\n\nAbout 4 or 3 months before the date of my class of 2019's graduation, the school district announces that each student/graduate will be issued 6 tickets for the ceremony. Each ticket counts as one seat. This means that I can only invite 6 people.\n\nThey sent out forms for people to request up to 3 extra tickets, which I did. We have 9 seats now for my graduation.\n\nNow that that information is out there, I'll tell you about my relationship with my extended family.\n\nI have little to no contact with all of them. My parents moved us when I was 2 years old from the original state I was born in, where all of our extended family lives. I'm not upset by this at all, and when we visit them every few years it isn't weird or anything. I just don't know them well, and they haven't really been a consistent part of my childhood and life up to this point.\n\nMy mom has 3 friends that have been around me for my entire life. They have been there for my triumphs and my downfalls, have had their part in raising me, and I consider them family. I always refer to them as my aunt's, and they basically have been an extra set of moms.\nI also have an older half-sister who I've looked up to my entire life as well. \n\nThese 4 women are monumentally important to me, and I really want them to attend the graduation ceremony.\n\nMy mom told me that the first 6 tickets are going towards her, dad and my grandparents. The other three she is saying should be prioritized for extended family that may or may not be driving or flying out here.\n\nI know that she doesn't want to disappoint her side of the family, but I'm sad thinking that when I look out into the crowd, I won't be seeing who I wish was actually there.\n\nWIBTA if I asked her to prioritize seats for the 4 women over my extended family?",

      "description": "Sometimes he doesn’t wash himself enough to the point where I notice. I can smell his BO. I cringe when he sits on my cushions in the tv room because they smell after. He once planned a date with a girl and the day of the date, stank - at least four days of not washing. I told him to shower at his work place (5 mins away. Our bathroom was being redone at the time). He replied “I’ll just try and wash out of the sink.” I yelled something about putting some effort in on dates. What’s she going to think and he replied “She won’t notice the difference.” I yelled some more until he went and showered but I’m not doing that again. \n\n\nThis guy is a fully functioning man who has a good job, in his 30s. He’s a good person over all but it’s just soooo bad and annoying when he doesn’t wash. It really pisses me off living with him sometimes so I vent my frustrations to my friends who also knows this guy. I feel bad talking behind his back but also I’m not his mom. It’s not my job to tell a grown man to wash himself. ",

      "description": "I (F24) have worked in a school office for 5 years, my partner (M29) has been working there for the past few months. We work really well together, have a wonderful life together and we have 2 beautiful children aged 4 and 1. \n\nThere's a young girl (18) who has worked there for 2 years, me and said girl have a lovely relationship, always get along at work and have been on a few nights out together. We have had many talks about my relationship and her relationships over the two years together and she has a good relationship with my children, they love her! \n\nShe is known to be quite a flirt, so before my partner started I jokingly said don't you dare flirt with him, we laughed about it, she said never in a million years and at first there was no flirting, but over the last few days I have noticed some - very much one sided but my fiance isn't really doing much to stop it. I spoke to him about it and he said she speaks to everyone that way and don't let it bother me.\n\nI'd noticed little things, she will always ask him to do things for her, always fake laughing and flipping her hair back, typical flirting, but then there was other things I'd noticed like if I appeared she'd stop talking to him or if she thought I couldn't see, she'd be getting up close to him.\n\nSo, I mentioned it to another friend who works there and she said she wasn't going to tell me but she had pulled up the girl and said, look you really need to stop flirting before his fiancee notices and that a few other work colleagues had noticed. The girls reply was 'I am trying my best to stop because me and her are good friends, but I can't help myself and I don't want to break up a family.'\n\nI was livid, 1) because she had admitted it and 2) because she actually thought she had the chance. I told my fiance as soon as we got home from work, and he just laughed about it and said its laughable that she thinks that and I need to stop worrying about it before I get too paranoid (I used to be really bad at the start of the relationship)\n\nBut the thing that is bothering me is that I only work part time and if she's like this in front of me, what is she like when I'm not there. \n\nThen yesterday, in work, she pulled me to one side and said 'your (fiances name) is soooo funny, I wouldn't have anyone else here for me if he wasn't here, he's always listening to me and giving me hugs when I'm down and hes taken me under his wing.' So I got mad, I told my fiance and he said he has never hugged her, never done anything to make her think anything and he said he just wants to be able to come to work without any hassle, but I was too mad and ended up giving my fiance and the girl the cold shoulder all day.\n\nAITA for being pissed off?\n\n(Sorry for it being so long!!)\n",

      "description": "Some context: wife and I have been trying for a kid for years. It turns out she has a form of PCOS and endometriosis and we were told that she'd have difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term. After many, many, many appointments, we were referred to a surrogacy agency. Here, surrogacy for profit is illegal, so it's purely altruistic. We ended up finding a surrogate through this agency and a couple of years later, she's 5 months pregnant now. The baby is biologically my wife and I's.\n\nWe had a scheduled amniocentesis (where they collect a sample of fetal DNA to screen for certain conditions) and the results are not good. Call us selfish or insensitive if you'd like, but we weren't thrilled the baby has a high chance for down syndrome and spina bifida. The OB/GYN said it's very likely and we should prepare for it early. \n\nWe (the wife, myself, and the surrogate) met to talk a bit, at which point the surrogate revealed she has been smoking and drinking while pregnant. She broke down crying saying she was under a lot of stress and it was her coping mechanisms.\n\nAre we the assholes for not wanting this baby anymore? I don't know if we can even refuse the baby at this point. What happens to the surrogate? What happens to the child? We haven't reported anything to the surrogacy agency because it's still fresh and we're not sure what our options are. We fear of coming across as insensitive but truth be told, we didn't anticipate this nor did we really want it.\n\nWe know pregnancies don't always end up perfect, and we're fine with less than perfect. But things like DS or SB mean our lives fundamentally change to that of caregivers, potentially our whole lives. We're not ready for that nor do we think we'd ever be ready for it. We're mostly upset the surrogate has toyed with a life that doesn't belong to them.\n",

      "description": "Obligatory this is my first post and I'm on mobile so pardon my mistakes.\n\nI live 1.5 hours from the closest town so usually if I have doctor's appointments or other business I plan it for two consecutive days and spend the night at my MIL's house because she tells us how lonely she is and that we never come see her. She always tells me how happy she is too see me and my small well behaved dogs and acts happy to have me there.\n\nShe's the kind of person who is chronically depressed but refuses to seek treatment. She refuses to take responsibility for the things she says or does either. She's a lso a chronic liar who makes things up to get sympathy. She complains about everything you do but also complains if you don't do them. I've gotten to where I can pretty much tune her negativity out but visits are always really exhausting for me. If I was the only one who felt that way I'd figure it was just me being bitchy but it's all 6 of her kids who feel that way.\n\nThe problem developed after I got home from a recent overnight visit to her house and my SIL told me that MIL had reported to her that she can never sleep while I'm there because my dogs run through the house and terrorize her dog. I sleep in the recliner in the front room, her and her dog sleep in the bedroom with the door closed. My dogs sleep in the chair with me so I know they aren't running around because they're busy cramping my back trying to sleep around them. She complained that I keep her up all night although I'm asleep by 9:30 every night.\n\nSo my dilemma is AITA if I refuse to sleep at her house and instead spend the night in my car when I have to go to town? I just have a real hard time knowing that I already go out of my way to please her by visiting when no one else will and she lies about my visits to get attention. Do I tell her why I won't stay at her house?",

      "description": "In the last few years I've gotten really tired of shaving my legs and since leaving high school with catty girls and realising that the rest of the world doesn't really care so much, I've just done it less and less. I'll do it for photographed occasions now and that's pretty much it. I'm occasionally mildly self-conscious about it and then I remember that body hair isn't a crime and life goes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA year or so ago, I asked my boyfriend how he felt about me \"pulling the chute\" as I'm told it's called and was surprised (and a little sad) that he told me he finds it less attractive. We've been together for 8 years and I had been letting it grow longer and longer before bothering to shave for the last few years really, and he never said anything about it (maybe wisely since I'm all about that \"you don't get to tell me what to do with my body\" stuff). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThing is, he never says anything the other way either. He doesn't ooh and ahh or give me more calf rubs when I do shave my legs, I wouldn't even guess that he noticed. But he says he does notice, and finds it more attractive when I shave them. I guess since to me it feels like a stupid, pointless, socially imposed job that only women have to do, and doesn't actually benefit anyone practically, I don't want to spend time on it. And so my proposal was, if you want me to do it, you gotta show some appreciation when I do!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that never happened, so a few months later, I offered up a second alternative: my legs can be silky smooth as often as he's willing to put the effort into shaving them! I thought it was kind of a sweet plan. He gets what he wants but also has to do the labour to get it, so he can understand there's a time cost for what he enjoys, if minor. So we did that for a while but it petered out and I've had furry legs for two months or so now. It isn't like it's an issue on a regular basis but I guess I wonder if this is one of those things where I'm being a jerk for not spending a little extra time to do something nice for this dude, or if he's in the wrong for wanting shaved legs but not appreciating them (now that sounded childish on my part. I'm leaving it in. It's a childish question anyways). This is very much a molehill, and not a mountain. I guess I'm looking for, am I a little bit of an asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the breakdown (tl;dr for the acronym-lovers out there): I don't like shaving my legs, and don't feel I should have to. Not hugely resentful of it, just lazy and annoyed that society puts a lot of pressure on women to waste their time on their appearance when there's better stuff to do. Boyfriend likes shaved legs. It's isn't like it costs me much, am I being a jerk to deny him something he likes for a little effort from me? ",

The thing is she would really like a wedding. I would love to have a wedding as well but I cant get over how much of a waste of money it is... it's one day of our lives and yes it's a special one but the money we blow on the wedding could be used in soooo many better ways like getting our own place. \n\nThe other issue is that everything we do from now till the supposed date has left us feeling guilty that were spending money and activities that should be fun are always tainted by \"you should have saved this money for the wedding\" and I see it in her eyes too that she knows this. \n\nAfter she found me visibly upset and asked me about it I told her and she seemed a little upset but understood. I told her that it doesnt mean we cant have a wedding at some point later in life theres nothing stopping us. \n\nAll I can say is first and foremost: I care about our future over anything else. I'm not going to let one arbitrary day financially ruin us. \n\nI wish we could afford it as it would be an amazing gathering of family but where do I draw the line?",

      "description": "To preface this I want to say that this happened just now and I'm still kinda pissed about it and I want to see if I'm the asshole for the way I went about standing up for myself and also I'm a senior in high school.\n\nToday in the morning during school, class was pretty dead since pretty much half of my class was off on a field trip so our teacher just gave us a study hall to do as we pleased. I was working on some hw so I wouldn't have any later when the guy in my class started grinding two quarters together something I hate since I literally cannot stand the sound of metal screeching/grinding together and idk but it seriously bothers me and I can't focus with it going on. He knows I hate this sound since many times in the past I've told him to not do that since it kills me to hear. I figured to give him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he forgot so I text him to please stop. He leaves my message on read and proceeds to do it anyway but more and louder intentionally looking at me and laughing when he see's it's bothering the hell out of me. So I decide I had enough and very loudly without getting up from my seat tell him in front of all the kids in class and the teacher (there were only 6 of us since most of the class was on a field trip for Spanish) to please stop grinding the quarters together because it's seriously bothering me and if you don't stop I'll ask the teacher to take the quarters because I can't concentrate. This sets him off and he gets incredibly embarrassed and pissed that I called him out. But he doesn't stop there because he stopped for a solid 5 minutes before he tries to do it discreetly by walking to the trash can and then doing it straight it in my ear to get a reaction out of me but he didn't know that the teacher was watching him and she asked him what he had in his hands that he put up to my ear. He says \"I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING\" and I tell the teacher that he was grinding the quarters and he gets super pissed and says \"YEAH I WAS DOING IT BUT IT\"S NOT A BIG FUCKING DEAL\".  She told him to stop or she was going to kick him out of class and he's just sitting there fuming for the rest of class. \n\nWhile I wish it would of ended there it didn't since I have last hour with him too and he sits in front of me. He decided to do the quarter grinding thing again except this time he has a pissed look on his face so this time I tell him it was funny how butthurt he got that when he got caught and that you seem still pretty butthurt about. This sets him off and he instantly explodes and calls me a bitch and he ends up dropping the quarters in the process and when I go to reach for them so he doesn't grind them again he grabs me by the collar trying to scare me into thinking he's going to hit me and I get in his face and I tell him \"I dare you to hit me because with your track record you're going to get expelled\" the teacher then tells him to move to a different seat and he lets go of me and leaves class. \n\nAITA?",

I texted him to reiterate that we should just use this as closure but am I an asshole for thinking it’s more than that that he wants. \n\nMe: Okay. Just making sure it wasn’t for anything more than just saying cool to see ya and then parting ways\n\nHim: Well I would be willing to talk about that stuff but not over text because things can easily be confused etc.\n\nMe: No. I’m just clarifying that it was a convo to kind of close a chapter on our lives of us being together and to see how we have grown and to let go of like resentment and guilt by discussing things calmly. At least it did that for me. I feel closure and at peace now.\n\nHim: Well I do feel more at peace now and it was clear that resentment and ill will had decreased but we didn’t necessarily talk about that stuff directly is what Im saying.\n\nMe: Oh well now we kind of have talked about where we stand. Just kind of thought about it recently and was like wow that felt good to be nice to you and understanding for a change. I wish you the best in the future and thanks for agreeing to chat, I appreciate it!\n\nHim: I agree, I have been thinking about how nice of a conversation it was and that it was healthy for both of us. I would be willing and wanting to talk in the future. I appreciate you very much and only hope the best for you too of course.\n\nMe: Yes. It was good to have. I feel a weight has been lifted. It has taken away some guilt and anger.✌🏻\n\nHim: I feel the same way too. I genuinely hope we get to talk again soon. ✌️\n\n\nWhat do I think? Why is he doing this while having a gf? ",

      "description": "Let me start with I love my wife. We have been together for about 9 years now. Married for 5. Anyways, my wife deals with some anxiety and OCD which she is medicated for. I usually only eat once a day and it is in the evening after work, gym and after our boys are in bed so around 8-9ish. She usually smokes marijuana to unwind and we watch a show or movie together. \n\nI only eat once a day and so this is the time I usually enjoy to eat. This has been a usual thing for about a year now. For whatever reason, not sure if it has been her anxiety lately or the marijuana but she tells me I can't sit with her and she gets pissy with me if I eat something loud and crunchy next to her. Saying \"you chew so loud\". She has said this for most of our relationship but not with irritation like lately. I don't feel that I'm eating or chewing any differently than I have my whole life but I guess I am a loud chewer?\n\nLast week she through a fit about me chewing next to her while we were watching a movie and I got upset and just put my food away and decided I just wouldn't eat anymore so we could at least spend time together. Sometime I even change what I plan to eat to something softer and less crunchy so my chewing doesn't set her off. It isn't all the time either, there are times when I eat in my game room while playing video games. She has said sorry and admitted to me it is a little crazy. She diagnosed herself with misophonia (condition in which a person is overly sensitive to sounds. Usually the trigger sounds are noises made by other people, such as chewing or tapping a pen). \n\nI love my wife and I love food. We love to watch movies and spend time together. She loves food too, I just want to be able to enjoy all the things together. \n\nTL;DR: I eat in the evening while spending time watching shows with my wife, she tells me I can't eat crunchy foods while watching with her.

      "description": "So small background story before I explain, I currently work at a sushi restaurant and I've been working there for over a year so I pretty much know the restaurant and how it functions like the back of my hand. It's to the point where the owner of the sushi restaurant trusts me with account for DoorDash, Grubhub, UberEats, etc. (Mainly because she's not tech savvy, so she pays me extra to make any adjustments with the menu.)   \n\n\nAnyways, our last call is 10:30 PM and we officially close the restaurant and kick customers out by 11:00 PM. Roughly around 10:40, we still had 5-7 customers finishing up their meals and a customer walks in with her husband and says, \"For two,\" holding up two fingers. I simply told her, \"I'm sorry, our last call was 10 minutes ago.\" At this point, our sushi chefs and kitchen staff were already cleaning and getting ready to leave while us servers have to wait until the customers pay and leave. She starts begging to me and explaining that it's not fair for us to serve other customers and not serve them. We still have to refill the customer's, who are still eating, their drinks, but we don't accept any more orders from them; hence LAST CALL. We inform our customers 5 minutes before last call if they need or want anything else to be fair. At this rate, explaining to the customer was like talking to a brick wall. I was slowly getting frustrated because she started to yell at me and start attracting the other customers who are currently dining. I didn't want to make a scene so I simply said, \"Stop embarrassing yourself and your husband. Please leave.\" The husband's face started getting red and the wife was even more pissed. She started screaming how she's a regular and that she demands to be served. They ended up leaving and she flipped me off. My manager was currently in the bathroom and she asked me what was all that noise about. So I explained her the whole situation and she was mad at me because the husband and wife come 3 times a week and how my actions or how I dealt with the issue may have lead to losing a regular.   \n\n\nI feel bad now because my manager is telling me how I did something that was wrong/bad and now I feel like an asshole.

      "description": "To keep it anonymous, I’ll call my friend “Dan” for this story.  This is long, but important to me. \n\nI’m currently 30, I’ve known Dan since I was 9 years old from a youth hockey team we played on for a couple of years. When I was 14 I moved to his side of town and we became best friends. Always hanging out in and out of school, hockey team in high school as well, blah blah blah. My family progressed to upper middle class over my childhood while his was poor. Dad left, mom not working and using child support and disability to pay for things, they weren’t struggling per se, just not a lot of money coming in. This was never an issue between us, as it shouldn’t be, just giving background. \n\nMy family was always very nice and accommodating, we’d get tickets to sports events and bring him  along, dinners, and other things. I was never given any allowance, so when we both started working, we’d spot each other for things and always pay it back or keep it even. \n\nHigh school finishes, I go to college for a year and then join the Marines, do one enlistment (5 year contract for me) and come back home. He stayed at home, didn’t pursue college or a trade, and  worked at various grocery stores in the meat departments. During my time in the Marines, whenever I’d come home, I’d always want to catch a game or go out and would happily pay  for all of it because I just wanted to enjoy the experience and knew he didn’t have much. \n\nAfter my enlistment and moving back home, we pick up where we left off, hanging out a lot and generally carry on as we always did. I decided I didn’t enjoy the pace of being back home so I decided to move to NYC to use my education benefits, which is about 4 hours from where we grew up. He visits a couple of times when he could, we texted, normal long distance friendship. \n\nA couple of years later his girlfriend got a job in NYC and they moved to my neighborhood. He never really got established, delivering pizza and working at another store. He couldn’t really afford to do anything besides just sit there, at this point we’re in our late 20’s, so I’m not just going to go over and play video games with him, but he could never afford to do anything. If I wanted to even meet him for lunch I knew I’d have to offer to pay to even get him out. So we gradually saw each other less and less.\n\nOver this time he was occasionally asking me for money, like 40-100 bucks a couple times. He’d pay it back but only if I put him on the spot, so I’d just remind him on the days he originally said he’d do it and no problem. \n\nI feel like we were kind of growing apart anyway, but this hastened it. He asks me for money one day when I ordered a pizza and he delivered it, I told myself I’d see what happens if I don’t ask for it and also not initiate any conversation. We didn’t talk for months, until the same scenario happens again, I feel bad and give him 80 bucks. \nI remind him on the day he said he’d give me it back and he can only give me 40.  Then he delays it again. \n\nI went off on him, I told him that the reason we didn’t talk was because I was being silent until he made an effort, which he never did. It was like 4 months, he could have given me a dollar a day or ANYTHING. But he showed zero effort, and never tried to pay me back, even after he got a large loan for school (that he gave up on). \n\nAt this point he offered to give me 13 dollars, I told him to save up the money and give it to me at once or to fuck off. And that’s what he did. \n\nI understand financial hardship, but he hasn’t really ever tried to improve his position or followed through with anything in life. Recently I heard his girlfriend left him and he moved back home. But still comes to New York to, I guess be near her in hopes of getting her back. I don’t know, and I realized I don’t really care. But I’m not sure if that’s because I’m a little desensitized and cold from my time in combat. \n\nShould I feel bad, AITA?",

      "description": "I’m a female, mid 20’s, above average height (5’9). I’ll start talking with my matches and we’ll have a decent conversation and they’ll start talking about meeting up right off the bat.

I’ll  say we should get to know each other better and then ask more questions (height, interest, personality, what they’re looking for)\nMy thing is that once a guy says he’s shorter than me I say it won’t work... but I’ll never say it’s because of their height that it won’t work. I don’t want to make them feel bad. I’ll usually say it’s because we are not compatible and then eventually I’ll unmatch. I won’t budge on the height thing as superficial as it is but I also don’t want to make anyone feel bad just because that’s my preference. \nMy question is, AITA if I’m not truthful about a guys height being the reason I won’t date him?

      "description": "So I can’t fucking stand my little sister, L. We’ve never gotten along and our personalities just do not click. We have a seven year age difference (she just turned 16) so we never really got to like “grow-up” with each other. My mother would ask me to baby sit her all the time and I was told I was in charge, which meant that I was also responsible for making sure L did any chores our mom expected her to do while she was out. The problem was that I would tell her to do them, then she’d act out and either throw a tantrum or physically attack me (she was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder/and schizophrenia at 12) and I would do my best to handle the behavior. Most of the time I’d be able to get her to do her chores, but then as soon as my mom would come home L would immediately go to her and complain that I was mean and bossy and hit her. My mom would yell at me for bullying her despite me telling her EVERY time that L would flip her shit when I asked her to do what she told her to. At one point I gave up and would let L do what she wanted but would remind her of the chores and that mom would be home soon. She wouldn’t do them, mom would come home, see that L’s chores weren’t done, and the proceed to yell at me for not “being responsible” and making sure that L did her chores. This caused a lot of resentment between me and L that has only gotten worse. She’s attacked me physically a few times when she’s had manic episodes (this is when I was in my late teens) and while she was younger and shorter than me she could do serious damage and so I would fight back to defend myself only for my mom to scream that I’m the adult and I can’t touch her. Recently she’s done multiple stints in juvenile detention centers and has been sent to mental rehabilitation facilities (and been kicked out) for her behavior. My mom can’t understand why we hate each other so much and blames me for not trying to mend the relationship and “act like siblings are supposed to.” So I have to ask am I the asshole for hating L and not wanting any sort of relationship with her.",

Knowing that money was tight and that living in Chicago was expensive, I offered up the login and passwords for the streaming services I subscribed to (Netflix, Hulu, Prime). Everything was good for a while and then random movies , shows, and new profiles started popping up. When questioned my sister admitted that she \"may\" have given the login info to a couple of friends. At this point I said that she or her friends needed to start paying each month if they were going to use it. Things got heated and the conversation ended with my sister saying she was getting her own accounts. Not being a trusting person, I changed all the login information. \n\nFlash forward to a few weeks ago and I get an angry text asking when and why all the login information had been changed. I explained again that I wasn't going to pay for things and let her friends use it for free. Let me add that at this point she had moved back in with our parents and was living free of charge.

      "title": "AITA for pressuring my wife to get a job?",
      "description": "I need some help, Reddit. I’ll try to be as unbiased as possible and present both sides as fairly as I can.\n\nPresently, I [M27] am the sole provider for my family’s finances. I work tech support from 7am-4pm on weekdays, and I’m on call with a second job every weekend (Sat 9am-4pm and Sun 9am-9pm). My wife [F28] is a stay-at-home mom for our daughter [7], and she regularly keeps the house tidy, does laundry, often makes dinner, etc. She also hasn’t needed a job since we got married, as my salary has always covered us well enough. We have a modest house, a single used-car payment, and have decent finances compared to other low/middle class families.\n\nBut lately, our finances have been getting worse than we’d prefer. We have several thousands of dollars in credit card debt (all from necessities, gas, groceries, etc), and only enough savings to last us a month (with roughly the same amount in our checking account). Long story short, we’re spending slightly more than I’m making, and it’s causing some strain.\n\nWe’ve already made some of the simpler lifestyle adjustments (no unnecessary spending, less fast food, etc), but we’re still hurting financially. My proposed solution to this problem is for my wife to find a part-time job in town to work while our daughter is at school. As an act of fairness, I’d step up and help with housework appropriately. It’s not a perfect situation, and we’d definitely need some adjustment, but adding a part-time salary would relieve our entire financial situation in a few short months, and we’d build savings after that with her added income.\n\nThe problem with my proposal is that my wife doesn’t want a job.\n\nHer proposal instead is for me to find a better/higher paying job. That way, things can stay as they are, but I’d be making more money. Right now, I’ve had the same position at my company for three and a half years, and it’s a great company, but I’ve tried to “climb the ladder” many times over the years with no success. As a response to this, our financial situation, and my wife’s desire, I’ve been considering switching jobs lately. My wife is hoping for me to get a position in management to increase my salary (though I don’t have the skills for management just yet, so that’s not really an option).\n\nThe issue with her proposal is that I’m already near the salary ceiling for my position/skills. We crunched the numbers, and if I switch companies/jobs, I won’t be making any more money (or much more) at all.  Another consideration is that I’m pretty established in my current company (I was employee 14 in what’s now a growing 75 person startup), and if I move to another company, I’d be starting from square one in terms of tenure/reputation/impact. My wife and I have been having discussions about this on and off for a few months now, and she’s applied for three positions in that time, but because she doesn’t actually want a job, our conversations about it have become unfortunately intense.\n\nI want her to get a part-time job to help with the finances, she wants me to get a different/better job to help the finances, and our conversations often devolve into fights where one of us eventually leaves the room. Her resistance to help with the finances is weighing down on me, my pressure for her to work is weighing down on her, and our fights are weighing down on us both. We’re exhausted talking about it, but she’s called me an asshole once or twice in fights about this, so I need to know, AITA for pressuring her to get a part-time job?",

      "description": "Tonight my mom and some of her friends were over and she brought up how a guy she asked out cancelled and she said she wouldn't reschedule unless he asked her out the next time. This led to me bringing up how men can not want to ask a woman out because they're afraid of rejection, although that wouldn't necessarily make this case one where he would fear that. That led into discussing things like paying for dates and the conception of \"Men taking care of women,\" on dates and all, such as paying no matter what, regardless of what the woman says she wants. I argued that it shouldn't matter what gender you are, as long as both parties are communicating honestly and openly and both \"scratch each others backs,\" so to speak, which led to my mother insulting me and calling me a few racial slurs relating to my father's former jewish faith. While I believe my mother is acting like an asshole in this situation, I'm wondering if I also am because I called her view \"idiotic\" for presuming certain roles in a relationship because of gender alone and saying that it can be totally fine for a woman to provide for a man in a relationship, assuming both sides communicated that they wanted that. For reference, I am 20 and my mother is 50 and divorced.",

      "description": "So, to start off, we are not a rich family.\n\nWhile we are okay-ish financially (considering that my family makes ends meet, by providing for me while I study far from home, providing for my g-ma and all), my dad is not good with money.\n\nI've been keeping some savings lately-- I want to get a CELTA certificate in the immediate future, so as soon as I finish my degree in CS, I can start working immediately as an English teacher, so I can gather money to pursue a master's degree in Ireland. \n\nI really love English, and I'm told I have a way of forwarding knowledge to people, and I want to put that in use. It's one of the first times in my life where I feel certain with some things.\n\nAnyway. Back to my dad.\n\nMy dad is great, he is a great dad, a fantastic husband to my mom, but just never was good with his money. He never kept savings, and whatever money he makes, he puts it towards the house and to his dad, or his car that is in constant need of repairs.\n\nSo, sometimes, when he doesn't have enough money to get by, he asks me for some, the maximum he has ever asked for is €300. Which is perfectly fine with me, as he always asks and never takes without my permission, as he knows it's my money.\n\nAnyway, because I'm away and all, and my parents want me to fully focus on school, and not pursue a job in the first/second semester of university, if I need something (clothing, shoes, etc) I have to use my savings, which has been greatly difficult, ESPECIALLY now that I need to save up to €1500.\n\nSo I asked my dad for a money bank, so I can put the 1/3 of my savings in it, and just put penny by penny until I get a job, so I can have my certificate by the age of 23 (I'm 19). \n\nWhile he didn't say anything, I saw his face darken, and he made an indirect comment about what he is going to do when he needs money, to which I said I'm going to keep some away so he can help himself when he needs to.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Yesterday me and my friend decided to try out Little Caesar's Pretzel Crust Pizza. I bought the pizza, we went to my apartment, and we tried it out. Me personally, I didn't like it. It just had a average pizza taste and the pretzel crust didn't really add anything other than a slightly saltier flavor. I didn't care for it and I made my thoughts known to my friend. Believe it or not, he was actually mad at me. \n\nHe starts saying stuff like \"You always act like you're so smart.\" and he told me off for using \"big words\" and \"trying to sound like a food critic\". I was confused by where he was coming from. He then starts telling me that it's the best pizza he's ever had. I said to him \"You must not have had many pizzas if you think that THIS is the best pizza.\" That was enough for him to just snatch the whole pizza box from me and say that he's having it to himself since I don't like it. And guess what? He eats the entire box and not only that, but he was also using a piece of crust to wipe up an any excess grease from the inside of the box and he was eating that as well. \n\nIt was disgusting what he was doing and I had to step in and call him out when he just lazily tosses the empty box on my floor. I told him to pick it up and toss it, but he says \"Not until you get better taste in food.\" Was he seriously this upset about me not liking this pizza? I then snapped at him and said \"I'm not gonna get lectured about good taste from someone who comes from a white trash family who eats nothing but fast food every day.\" He just left my place and that was that.\n\nAm I at fault over this? I admit that I may have crossed a line with my white trash comment, but he started it with overreacting to my reaction to the pizza. What do you think?",

She was extremely cold and just went to her room which isn’t typical. \n\nI tried to ask my other roommate if I did anything wrong but she’s friends with both of us so I think she’s trying to stay out of it. \n\nSo Reddit, did I do anything wrong?

      "description": " This one's a long-ish one.\n\nIn high school, like most of the people on the non-social media side of the internet, I was a shy, weird, awkward kid. I somehow managed to find my tribe and I ran with them throughout high school and after. These were my people. They accepted me, they were my first D&amp;D group, my first regular gaming group. They visited me in the hospital when I was almost dead from dengue fever (I got better). But even then, not all was right in that house. I was disrespected a lot. I got left out of things. They were snippy and dismissive and always held it against me whenever I had to bow out of activities for things that would improve my life.\n\nEnter the second year at the university I would eventually graduate from. In my second year, I'd decided to reverse what I'd done at the previous universities because I figured doing what I'd done then got me expelled twice, so maybe it would be best to take another tack. And it worked like gangbusters: I got my GPA up to about 1.5/1.75 (A/A-), joined school activities, got into student government, and even made friends. I could feel myself starting to drift away from my original friend group. I stopped responding to messages. I stopped going to D&amp;D and game nights. Once, one of them violated bro code (\"A bro should not be friends with a bro's ex\") and I didn't speak to them for a month and it seemed like none of them noticed or cared. I started to realize how embarrassing a lot of their behavior could be.\n\nIt came to a head later that year. We'd just finished our midterm exams, and it was my birthday, so my other friends and I decided to get together for a day trip to an amusement park out of town. I mentioned later on social media that I'd gotten sunburned and one of my old friends said \"This is what you get for not taking us.\" I'd consciously made the decision to not take them along. First, logistics would be a nightmare (me, my friends from university and my driver filled my van to capacity). Second, it is really hard being the one common person between two groups of people who are total strangers to each other. Three, I had by that point long gotten tired of my old friends's antics.\n\nApril of the same year. I went to a birthday party with my old friends and decided to try making time for them . I asked if they were free the next week and they all said they were busy. I think nothing of it until a few months later in July. In July, I stumbled upon a Facebook post. A friend from that group had posted a photo album of pictures they'd taken at an amusement park. The same amusement park I went to with my other friends. From the weekend I asked if they were free. What upset me was the fact that they felt like they had to keep a secret. To deceive me. That was it. All I remember is cutting all ties and blocking them.\n\nNow, 7 years later, they want to extend an olive branch. I shut them down.\n\nSo Reddit: am I the asshole?",

They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fiancée, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.",

      "description": "So me and this girl have known each other for more than 15 years and we are now in our 20s. I will try to be as objective as I possibly can. \n\nShe has always had psychological problems (recently diagnosed as social anxiety and depression), but some months ago she started dealing with suicidal thoughts and gave therapy a try.\n\nShe doesn't have a lot of friends. In fact, she considers me her best friend and the only person she doesn't feel judged with. We have a group of friends from high school in common, but she feels our friendship is based in our lack of capacity to get real friends (we are all kind of introverted people). When she started college she tried to be open to meeting new people, but ended up with a group of girls she can't feel included with. So she has, or she had, only me.\n\nI am not the most psychological healthy person either. I lack self-esteem and have undiagnosed social anxiety, which makes it difficult for me to live life as I want to.\n\nThe thing is, until now, and eventhough I wasn't mentally healthy, I tried to be the best friend I could. I listened to her problems and rants for literally hours, trying to be there for her, listen, understand and cheer her up. When I wanted to talk about my own problems, we always ended up talking about hers. But she had it worst, so I let her rant. We created some sort of comfort in knowing that we weren't alone: while our friends were learning to be adults and choosing what life they wanted to have, we weren't trying to get better. We unconsciouslly validated each other's negative self-talk and low self-esteem because we both dealt with that. When I tried to be positive, she would come with her negativity and make me go down to the depression hole again, unconsciously. This went on for 3 YEARS and we were totally distancing ourselves from the real world. \n\nThings changed when I, thank god, attended a clinical psychology subject in college (1 year ago). I learned how to deal with my problems, how to improve my self-esteem and social anxiety. I became more positive and tried to explain everything I learned to her and help her, but she wasn't having it. She was seeing my progress and felt left behind and that's when she started therapy, but sadly it didn't work for her. She is trying it again now. \n\nAfter that, she has become VERY spiteful towards me. And the thing is that I've tried to still be there for her and listen to her, but I've noticed that it's not good for my mental well being (and she doesn't find my validation of her negativity anymore, she doesn't like that). Listening to her talk about her negative habits, that are very similar to those I had, makes my progress crumble and I fall again into the depression trap; I'm still not in a good position to lift her up when she needs someone. I tried to talk this with her, after distancing myself for a while, in a way that I don't hurt her feelings but, as I will explain, she disorts reality so she didn't understand it. \n\nThis is how she distorts reality: she takes everything personal and thinks everyone hates her. That makes being her friend extremely difficult, as I can barely say anything without her taking it as a personal attack, and probably that's why she couldn't make friends in college. But she thinks she has the best personality ever and the problem is her physical appearance (in reality she is very pretty). Another things is that right now I'm trying to be more social and have an active life, so when I explain to our group of friends how I'm doing, and she is there, her depression and self-hate gets worst. She thinks everyone is bragging about their life, she hates everyone. And now, included me. She can't be happy about other people's happiness (and I get why because I've been there). \n\nConclusion: If I distance (distance as to stop talking for hours with her about her problems) myself from her to prioritize my own mental health, she will be completely lonely and with anyone to talk to. I already put some distance and she got much worst. Should I make and effort and still be there for her? I'm scared of her suicidal thoughts. \n\n\n",

The relationship in the end didn't work out and to cut a long story short, I got cheated on several times and found out that she had been doing party drugs, (MDMA &amp; Weed) behind my back. Now I don't mind natural drugs but I do have a pretty strong objection to MD. I'd told her previously in the relationship that if she was to start taking them, then I wouldn't be a part of her future and this may have labelled me a dick in her friends eyes, however I wasn't going to budge on a belief.  \n\n\nContinuing on, the day we broke up, I'd found out she'd cheated, but also that she was doing MDMA every weekend when she went clubbing, whilst I worked a 10pm till 6am job which is where I am writing this now. I then proceeded to take her mum &amp; housemate out for coffee where I told her mum that she had been taking MDMA every weekend. I purely did this to protect her as I still to this day don't wanna see her get hurt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole though?",

      "description": "My boyfriend of two years clogged his work bathroom (in the process of using it) and unclogged it with his bare hands. Obviously, I (female) find this appalling.  \nIt would be funny if this was a one-time, emergency scenario, and it once was, because **this has actually happened before**. He’s told me about doing the exact same thing in college. There was a line of people at a public stall, and he clogged the toilet while he was in there. So while the water’s flowing over and onto the floor, he decides the best course of action…is to stick his arm down the hole and…start digging. I always found this story kind of funny in an over-the-top, shock-humor gross way. But, at the time, it felt like a one-off emergency situation. The fact that the exact same thing just  \nhappened again blows my mind. It’s not funny now. This directly interfered in our relationship when he told me. I became physically repulsed, and the sex we were planning on having obviously didn’t happen. I was so stunned, I couldn’t even  \nexpress myself properly. I incredulously told him this wasn’t okay and then shut down a bit. He became extremely upset, telling me my reaction was disproportionate and unfair, that I was being cold and shaming him, but I can’t help what disgusts me. At present, the idea of him manually unclogging toilets with his bare hands absolutely fucking disgusts me. The fact that it will likely happen a third time, as I’ve since realized he is a consistent toilet-clogger, disgusts me. I don’t want his hands on me. He tries to spin it like he’s (literally) taking care of shit himself, but it’s clear to me that he just doesn’t want to face the embarrassment of anyone knowing he blew up the bathroom. I think his chosen solution is gross and inappropriate. He agrees, but maintains that my reaction was extreme. Am I the asshole for reacting the way I did?  \nSidenote: this is all because he uses way too much toilet paper. He’s stopped the toilet at my place on more than one occasion. I’ve told him to use less, my mother has told him to use less. Clearly it’s not sinking in. Thank god we keep a plunger handy, otherwise I guess he’d take it upon himself to fingerboard the toilet bowl.  \nTL;DR: Boyfriend is a serial porcelain gynecologist, AITA for being revolted?  \n",

      "description": "First time posting on reddit and on mobile, so sorry in advance for any issues. Long post\n\nBasicly the situation goes like this : I am staying over with my brother and his family, our mother is also living with them. Today I was asked to give my nephew some medicine because he is sick. I went to their medicine cabinet and find what looks like a bottle of medicine. \nBeing a responsible adult, and wanting to find the correct dosage, I looked at the label and saw that the medicine was homeopathic. Being that im really against sudoscience because its so dangerouse and predatory, I get upset and start to look for another medicine thinking they might have bought it by miatake. Nope, all their children's medicine is homeopathic, but ironicly not their adult medicine.\nBecause they had so much non homeopathic meds for themselves I decided to be more casual about my aproach when confronting them. I immediately went out to the living room where they were at and asked them if they knew what homeopathy was.\nMy brother and his gf (mostly his gf) essentialy told me that they wanted to raise their child on alternative medicine and that in addition they didnt vaccinate my nephew either...\nAll of the sudden a few things clicked in my head that made me enraged\n1. They dont use homeopathy exclusively for themselves\n2. My nephew nearly died from the flu last year, he had to go in an ambulance one night after a severe seizure due to the severity of the flu, I now believe this was because he wasn not vaccinated\n\nI imediatly raised my voice and told them that stuff was not backed by science and that it was completely dangerouse to not have him vaccinated, after arguing I called them hypocrites for not using that type of medicine for themselves and having had vaccines as children. We got into a shouting match, I was visibly upset and raised my voice, and started using profanity.\nThey got upset and called me closed minded, said they weren't hypocrates because it is already to late for them to start to be clean or some bullshit. \nThis is when our mother got in and called me a jerk, told me college had radicalized me and closed my eyes and how dare I come into my brothers home and critisize him. At this point I relised somehow my mother had also been turned to this shit, she told me she also stopped using her medications for her illnesses and moved to natural medicine, and told me how great it has been for her. \nI was so shocked and angry, and my entire family there told me I was a jerk, not open minded and that I didnt have my nephews best intrest just a need to feel superior because I go to college. They basicly all turned on me. I left by just saying they were all insane and that it would be their fault if anything ever happened to my nephew, god forbid, and finished by saying that they were the ones responsible for his condition last year( I may have said this with a few more curse words) and then stormed out.\nIm now gone from there and feeling terrible about this, especially since I did this so close to the holidays and maybe blew this out of proportion, so AITA ?",

It’s important to note that we’re in a LDR, so we barely get to see each other.\n\nI stay for about a week and a half, just leaving today. After a couple days into my stay, my girlfriend and I noticed the roomies acting a bit annoyed and caught the general vibe that something was up, so she asked to call a roommate meeting. I leave that day and she calls me later to tell me what they said. \n\nThe jist is that I stayed way too long, I made messes and never cleaned them up, and locked myself in the bedroom when my girlfriend was away at class. I want to make it abundantly clear that I cleaned everyone’s dishes and put them in the dishwasher multiple times and would sweep their floor whenever a mess was made. I even helped my SO clean out their fridge. We picked up our dishes whenever we were done. I probably left crumbs in places, but I doubt it would be that much of a big deal. Other than that, all utilities are paid for in the lease, so it’s not an issue of me using their utilities and being angry, I’ve just overstayed my welcome. I also kept to myself in the bedroom because I have anxiety and I could feel that something was up with them. \n\nAfter my girlfriend told me this, I was quite upset and my girlfriend agreed that I had done a lot, but didn’t defend me to them, so they still think these things, so I said I didn’t feel welcome there anymore and I wouldn’t be returning to her place. That made her very upset and now I don’t know if I’m just being an asshole or not, so Reddit AITA for not wanting to return to her apartment because of them?",

I do use the interest that is generated for an occasional treat, but nothing too fancy as I feel like it isn't necessary to spend a lot of money to enjoy a vacation or get a good meal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe painted me a rather bleak picture of her financial future where she told me she wouldn't have enough money left to retire and didn't want to chip away at her funds too much and that's why she needed 5000€ from me or my sister. I told her I would give her the money since I didn't want my sister to already lose money before she had control over it.\n\nThen today, she told me she wanted to go to Machu Picchu (from Germany) to see some Guy give an Ufology Seminar at the ruins. This was the following Interaction:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom: (excitedly) I'm thinking of going to Machu Picchu in May! Wouldn't that be great? There is this brasilian (My Mom is brasilian and came to Germany almost 30 Years ago) Youtuber that is going to explain stuff about the ruins from a historic and ufologic standpoint\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe (carefully) : Didn't you ask me for Money just last week? I feel weird giving you Money if you have enough to pay flights to Peru and back... (let alone for some bullshit seminar, I thought)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom: Always with the Money! Forget about it! I'm just going to take the Money for the move out of my own funds!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: I'm just a little confused why you asked me in the first place...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom: (sighs sadly) some day I will find people that are excited for me...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then I left, feeling bad for questioning my Moms financial choices and wondering if I was the Asshole in this Situation. I mean I got enough Money, but at the same time, she seems to have enough too. What do you guys think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My Mom wanted Money from me after painting me a bleak picture of her financial future and I questioned her financial choices after she brought up that she was planning an expensive trip resulting in me not giving her Money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nexcuse the capitalization errors, I get confused between german and english sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It got to the point where she went from posting one a day to 10+ and he'd comment on all of them. This escallated to her deleting all his comments and unfriending him.\n\nThing is, she doesnt have children (Ofcourse shes still a walking threat to immune compromised/too young to be vaccinated people) She is European and English is not her first language. She is very mistrustful of modern medicine and quite frankly scared of doctors.

      "description": "Context - my computer sits on one side of a paper thin wall. His bed is on that direct other side. He's has talked to me previously about the sound on my computer being too Loud. He works night shift so he has to sleep during the day sometimes as I also work the night shift. \n\n  This week mid day (11am-4pm) I'm watching a YouTube video and hear a loud pounding noise coming from the other side of the wall, my roommates room. I immediately lower the volume because I never had the intention of waking him up. He then send me a message that he's not mad just being assertive since I seem to forget that he needs to sleep. This I understand for the most part. To me banging on someone wall is extremely rude and uncalled for. I respond saying that it is unacceptable to bang on my wall and that I would like to speak with him to find a solution to this issue we keep having. I didn't not state a specific solution as I said I didn't care what the solution was. \nHe states that since words seem to do nothing he'll continue to bang on my wall until my behavior changes. I feel now as if I'm being treated like a kid \"I will continue to bang on your wall until your behavior changes\". After a few messages back I state that I would be willing to move my computer as I think the issue is how close it is to his wall. My volume was not loud on my computer to begin with. But due to the walls being so thin it probably comes off loud. He says the only issue is volume and that he's said ask he has to say and that's it. He has also said he doesn't want any beef or animosity. For me banging on the wall does not. Am I supposed to hang on his wall if wakes me up? Do I turn my volume up to piss him off more? I don't like either of those. He doesn't see why I'm upset. I'm willing to move my stuff to the other side of the room. I'm not sure if he understands why I'm upset. Am I the a**hole?",

      "description": "I recently began planning my wedding for this September. A major background point is my fiancé and I live in a different state than both of our extended families – mine is 10 hours away, his is about 4 hours away. We’re about ready to send out save-the-dates, particularly for the out-of-towners to begin making arrangements if they decide to come.\n \nHowever, we are planning on doing an elopement-style “wedding”, with just a party on the same day to get everyone together. If we end up doing a ceremony, it will be a tiny one with just our parents and our (currently honorary) wedding party. Frankly, it’s the type of wedding I would want to go to – no fuss driving between different locations, and ideally the guests will get to spend more time with us, the newlyweds, instead of being tied into traditional dances, speeches, and other nonsense. My great aunt is apparently very displeased with this and thinks we need to do more for the guests (to the point that she and my grandfather will not be coming). I wouldn’t be surprised if most of my extended family plays this same card.\n \nTL;DR: AITA (or, maybe WIBTA) for just throwing a laidback party instead of a formal wedding?\n \nAdditional information for those who may need it:\nMy fiancé and I are not particularly close with either of our extended families. We have a couple of people we like, but a lot of the invites are just to play nice.\nWe are going to do the party/reception at a VFW, so we’re not doing some huge blow out. It’s lowkey, but what we lose in “luxury” I feel we gain in actually seeing our family and friends.\nBeyond being able to see people, we’re also doing this to cut back on some of the stress of planning a formal wedding. I looked at a lot of places, but we live in a wedding-centric location and it would run us far more than I am willing to spend to have a traditional wedding.",

      "description": "**Warning, this is really long winded**\n\nI’ve known this guy for around 13 years, since we were in high school as he’s a year younger than I am (I’m 28). He’s never had a semi normal home life as his mom stole his identity at a young age and his dad is a royal asshole who used to beat him. Since knowing him we’ve always been close, just clicked and had similar interests and we even roomed together in college and got along just fine. We fell out of touch for a couple years as he stayed in the college town with his then gf and I moved back home but when they broke up, he moved back home too and in with his dad. Things were ok on that front for the first couple weeks and then shit hit the fan and they got into a fist fight so he got kicked out. My wife and I had just gotten married that year and after asking her, he moved in with us and lived with us for around 2 years. He started seeing a girl we went to high school with, knocked her up, married her, and they moved into an apartment together. *Disclaimer, I never really cared for the wife but never voiced that to him because he seemed genuinely happy with her*\n\nWe stayed super close, golfed more than any two non pros should, I was at the hospital when his wife gave birth, and even after his son was born we maintained the golf habit. During all this, he snagged a pretty damn good supervisor job at a local company working midnights and he seemed to like his job and I know he made good money doing it. \n\nWith me being his best friend, I’ve never felt like I had to hide anything and I’ve been honest with him about my marriage, jobs, aspirations, and I felt like he did the same but something seemed off for a little while. Well one morning when he got off, he was greeted by his now ex wife’s dad and brother with 2 local officers. Ex wife claimed he beat her (I to this day don’t believe he ever touched her, he’s 6’5 and if he ever hit her she’d be in the hospital) and threatened her and was a drug addict (smoked weed and nothing more) so filed a protective order against him and moved out. He goes through a rough patch as you could imagine and I offer advice and guidance as best I could throughout this whole ordeal. He then ended up getting fired from that job and said “they were out to get him” and didn’t really know why he was fired (we live in a right to work state, no reason needed to fire an employee). I of course try to offer advice where I can again and he ends up getting another job, making less money but still a job none the less.\n\nBetween lawyer fees, being left all the rent and utilities, and making less money, he left the apartment and moved in with his cousin. During this time, my wife and I bought a different house and were expecting our first child so we moved out of our old house which was left to me and my sister when our father passed away and it was sitting empty as we fixed a few things up and attempted to sell it. After deliberation with my sister and our mother, we decided to let him rent it for a decent price so he could have his own place for him and his son and so we could make a little money per month since we still paying insurance, utilities, and property taxes. \n\nFast forward about 3 months and he lands a great job making more than he’s ever made and I was legit happy and even a little envious of because he was making more than I do. It was at a steel mill and was union and as almost all manufacturing companies do, had a probationary period of 120 working days. He’s constantly telling me how much he loves the new job, he’s paying his bills off and wants to buy a new car, even talked about wanting to buy our house he was renting! \n\nFast forward another 3 months, he’s made new work friends and is hanging out with them after his shifts and I got a vibe that something was off again, like he was getting into things he shouldn’t be. Starts going to bars and having sex with a bunch of tinder girls, whatever, he needs to do what he thinks he needs to and I never voiced any concerns because he was still being a great dad and just having fun like a normal kid twenty year old man would. Then I got a call from him about 5:30 in the morning before he needed to go to work, said his car got repossessed and doesn’t know why, they were supposed to take the payment out of his bank account and he wasn’t sure what happened but none the less, needed a ride to work. I oblige because I know that if you’re late or call off during the probationary period, they’ll more than likely fire you and I don’t want him to lose this job. On the ride up he’s calling his dad begging for money and saying he can’t lose his car because he’ll lose his job. I drop him off, told him I’d be back to pick him up after his shift ends. During his shift he gets his car thing figured out, once I picked him up I dropped him off at the bank and he got his car and we both went our own ways. \n\nObviously he was blowing money and not paying his bills, although he was still paying us rent so all we knew was what he told us and I took his word for it. Then comes day 118 out of his 120 probationary period, he shows up to work and works a couple hours and then gets escorted off company ground and is terminated. He calls me distraught, once again doesn’t know why and everything was going so good, I try consoling him and he actually ends up getting another job the very next day making less money doing harder work. He then missed his rent payment and paid us 2 weeks late, no big deal really and did that for the next couple months until we finally sold the house and the buyer was keeping him as a renter. He only paid half of the rent because he jumped from that job to another and to another so he still owed us the other half and then when we closed, they took out half of rent for that month and he hadn’t paid that either so essentially owes us a whole months rent. \n\nHe said the new landlord forgave the rest of that month because there were a few issues with the gas that was their fault and it happened to be Christmas so that worked out in his favor and being able to buy gifts. During all this he went to a payday loan place to try to make ends meet and put me down as a “reference” evidently without asking me first. He met this new girl in the midst of all this and knocked her up and was just so excited! It just happen to be right after I told him that my wife and I are going to have another child and his kinda felt forced, but whatever, still wasn’t proud of him and then he started talking about marrying her and having a family together and how happy he was. She ends up getting cold feet and leaving with her 8 month old baby from a one night stand to live with her grandparents and gets an abortion. He’s devastated, doesn’t know what happened, they were so happy together and they were going to have a big nice family and he loved that 8 month old like his own 3 year old son. *Insert eye roll that you can see repressed memories with here*\n\nI voice my opinion, my very very honest opinion, tell him exactly how I felt about the whole situation and about him losing 2 jobs that were lifetime jobs within a year of one another. Told him I didn’t care for the 20 year old gf, that she seemed super immature and doesn’t have a good track record of decision making and he needed to focus on himself and his son and not worry about her. Then I get a call from the new landlord asking when he paid us rent, whether it was on the 1st or 15th, and I told her the 1st since that’s when it was. Turns out he lied to her and said it was the 15th and hadn’t paid her yet. He doesn’t mention any of this to me and I don’t to him either and everything seemed ok. He was working, seemed to be getting over this girl and I hadn’t heard anything more from the new landlord. \n\nNow we’re to last week and he calls me, says he’s being evicted and doesn’t know why. Turns out new landlord didn’t tell him not to pay the rest of December’s rent and he still hadn’t paid it or January’s rent, but he insisted it was just January he was behind on. Then on Facebook, he puts he’s in a relationship with 20 year old girl again and then he texts me saying new landlord is “fucking with him on purpose” and he’s tried to pay her what he can afford and she won’t accept it, mind you she kept the rent at what we charged him which was VERY reasonable. \n\nFinally, the AITA moment has arrived! Lol\n\nI call him out on all his bullshit. Told him I’ve talked to new landlord and know he’s behind more than he lets me believe and that he needs to get his shit together or else he’s going to get his sons visitation taken away. Told him exactly how I felt about the gf and how in my opinion she wasn’t good for him, that he needed to get far away from her and focus on himself and his son. I said he needs to get his finances in order because not only did he go through the car repo thing but now he’s being evicted and in the mean time I’ve been getting calls from the payday loan place asking if I can have him call them, plus he still owes us money for rent! I was far from big brother as you could be, I came down on him hard and told him how it is and that he needs to grow up. \n\nI’ve since been deleted off all social media accounts by him and the gf and he never responded to any of my texts, am I the asshole for this?\n\nI love the kid like he’s my brother, I have ALWAYS been there for him and have tried to give him the best advice I could. How he’s reacting really makes me upset on one hand because of how close we are and what we’ve been through, but on the other hand I almost feel relieved because I truly believe people that are always down and negative drag all those around them down and I don’t want to be caught in that trap. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "description": "Been debating whether to post this considering it isn't recent, but this has been a constant at the back of my mind now for well over a year and its been happening for some time. Be warned this is long as I need to give some background..\n\nMy sister and I never got along when we were kids, it look her moving out and going to Uni on the other side of the country for us to even begin to get along. Our parents divorced, she came home for a little bit and things were okay. \n\nThen she met her future husband and I noticed she was starting to change, and not for the better so we stopped talking. About 2 years after they were married he was in an accident and he was medically discharged from the Army. At the end of the day he is alright, and I noticed my sister started to act herself again and we started to talk once more. \n\nFast forward a few years and once more I notice she changing again. This comes after she and I put some money together to fly mum over to visit her grandkids. Mum then starts to call me several times in the day, in tears because of the way my sister is treating her and how she and her husband are treating the kids. Mum explained at the time as, the husband was acting the drill sergeant and the kids were the soldiers, and my sister agreed with everything he did (another version of her husband).  The more she told me the more I realised my sister is becoming a stranger. \n\nNext time I see her, its at our cousins wedding. First day she is at the house and she threatens to hit my dog for \"being undisciplined\", now I had just come home from work; I was tired, I didn't want to see her and mum had been texting me asking me to come home early. To say the least I replied \"you touch a hair on my dog and you know where the front door is\", bare in mind I never talk back, I hate confrontation. But threaten my dog and that filter is gone. To say the least she didn't appreciate it.\n\nNow comes the wedding day. We are getting along, drinking together, sharing jokes, talking, taking selfies. Then my mum, aunt and I say we are ready to go, and she goes off and starts talk to another cousin (she isn't our cousin, she's mentally disabled but it makes it easier for her to think of us that way) who she has made very clear she doesn't like. Then things go downhill; mum realises the keys are missing. Now I didn't bring my keys like I normally do so we didn't have a spare. So here we are scouring the car park looking for said keys and my sister is stomping around , pissed and acting the victim. Its not her keys that are missing, she was the one that avoided leaving in the first place. She isn't the one who had to break a window and crawl inside in a $80 dress, calm the dog down, find the spare keys then go back to the reception.\n\nI asked my uncle and aunt that night \"Do you believe me now how much she has changed?\" No one believe me in til that night.\n\nFast forward several years to the \"incident\" of December 2017. My phone is flashing at me while I'm at work, I have a Facebook alert \"\\*\\*\\* has accepted your friend request\"... huh? I didn't send a friend request. Mum has access to my Facebook  account as she sends herself lives for a game she plays that I don't, the only thing I can think of is that she thought she was on her profile and sent it thinking she unfriended her (oh and during this time mum has also had a minor stroke so memory issues). Mum says she didn't. Okay whatever, I'll think on it. I unfriended my sister that night. Why? Because we hadn't spoken in years, I always text her on birthdays, Christmas and New Years with nothing in return and I also didn't like the person she had become.\n\nIt was for my own piece of mind. It is now the next day and mum sends me a screenshot of a message my sister sent; \"\\*\\*\\* is a little manipulative bitch. She friends me on Facebook to see what I've been up to and then unfriends me after she's satisfied. If she fucken wanted to know she should of asked\" something to that effect, I don't really want to go and find the message. If she just sent that to mum, yeah fine whatever. Mum chose not to respond as she didn't want to take sides, which is understandable. Only my sister decides to post it on her Facebook page, and its just a rockslide from there.\n\nShe accuses mum for taking sides, continues to call me a bitch and manipulative, no matter what mum says she twists and turns it to her own agenda. I knew what she was like and I didn't want that toxicity in my life. I refuse to text her to set things right, I feel like she over reacted over a Facebook invite. Last year at Christmas, mum notices her house is up for sale and approaches her about it. Shit hits the fan once again, she's bringing up that incident once again, continues to accuse us both, in til mum has had enough and has now cut her out of her life. She will not see her grandkids again, my sister will make sure of that.\n\nAITA for not responding to set things right back in 2017? If I had done maybe last year would've not happened and my mum would still be able to speak to her grandkids. I feel like I mishandled the situation and I feel like I'm to blame, that I'm the asshole.\n\nIts ironic, its the worst memories you remember and the ones you want to forget the most.",

      "description": "My son has had behavioral problems since he started school and had a really bad kindergarten experience.\n\nFor 1st grade we decided to put him in a Lutheran private school. My husband, kids, and MIL and FIL are all members of the church that runs it. We were told, before enrolling him, that the school \"specialized\" in kids with special needs of all kinds and each student had curriculum based on the needs, strengths, and weakness of the student.\n\nThe classes are 1-4 all with the same teacher and 5-8 with a different one. Class size averaged about 6 students in his. From the start it seemed to go badly. The teacher called AT LEAST once a week asking if I can pick him up, most often because he would sit at his desk and refuse to do work. I often had do have him do all his work at home. \n\nIn his 2nd year there things got worse, and after A LOT of pressure we agreed to put him on ADD medication. This led to him not eating and being angry a lot, often crying at school until I had to pick him up anyway.\n\nWe thought about taking him out but when we brought it up they convinced us that would be the worst thing we could do and they have several methods to work with him and tons of experience.\n\nIn 3rd grade we decided the meds made him miserable and we took him off. The relationship with him and his teacher became even worse and SHE would call me crying asking for help. We moved him to the older kids classroom when she refused to teach him but then he had zero instruction and his grades started falling.\n\nI could take it anymore. He was so sad all the time and felt rejected. I felt like the school was bullying him. I pulled him and put him in public school and amazingly he is flourishing and the teacher says he DOESN'T have behavioral problems, he's just a boy. \n\nThat made me feel awful because now I feel that the teachers needs were put in front of my son's.\n\nAfter he left, my family was so distraught they stopped attending services and the church or pastor made no attempt to reach out to them.\n\nUntil recently. Apparently my son's teacher had a mental break down after he left at some point and quit. They apparently can't replace her. One day out of the blue the pastor goes to my MILs and offered her the job and she accepted (she's a retired teacher).\n\nI feel the school put my son through hell and  didn't care. AITA for feeling like my MIL betrayed the family?",

      "description": "So, some background information, me and my girlfriend both currently attend the same highschool but because I have strictish parents we normally don't get a lot of time together. So normally we spend about 5-10ish minutes after school hugging and kissing and sometimes just talking a bit. My girlfriend has been going through a bit of a rough patch and is pretty upset in general (I won't go into any more detail because it doesn't really pertain to the events other than the fact that she needs more emotional support).\n\nNow, there was an informational meeting after school for track (which I have done for multiple yearsand planned on continuing) and I wanted to go despite the fact that I could have picked up all the papers from the head coach thenext day. This was partially because Ihad practice immeadiatly afterwardsand would have felt akward skipping the meeting and partially just in case there was any information in addition to the papers (though in hindsight it was mainly the akwardness. After school when I asked my girlfriend where the meeting was (because I can be fairly forgetful) and she pointedto the Head Coach's room. She then asked if I was going. I replied yes and she told me that I could justget the papers tommorow and I told her that I should still go anyways because their might be other stuff that they talk about.

      "description": " I'm currently a grad student working on my PhD. During my time, I started to develop a really bad drinking problem due to burnout and stress. I got help through intervention and I am working on maintaining.\n\nA girl I had been talking to from high school had just finished her education and was moving to town. I was very excited to see her, and we had hit it off really well again while talking before she got here (this was before my drinking problem and during). She got here and we went out a couple of times... she said that from what she saw in our dating that she wasn't pursuing anything romantic with me (I asked her), and I accepted that but also followed up with the fact that I was interested in her that way if that came up in the future.\n\nWe started to hang out a bit more and developed a FWB relationship. It was actually very romantic to be honest, but I knew she was actively dating other guys for a real relationship.\n\nWhen we met up first I had achieved 5 months of sobriety and was just finishing an OP rehab. I told her that I had a problem with alcohol from school stress and had to stop, which weirded her out a lot so I let it go. We continued our FWB relationship until last weekend when I had a relapse (not in her presence). This relapse knocked me out of commission pretty bad (I'm a big drinker when I do) and I couldn't answer my phone. When I came back, I lied and told her that I had gotten sick. I'm many days sober now and my sponsor and I are working on getting me into sober living this Monday (which I was going to tell her because I'd be gone for at least 3 months).\n\nIt came up during our last meeting (Friday) during a semi-related subject (why I'm behind in my degree -- I took a quarter off to recover) how serious my alcohol problem really was. She had believed that I just was getting hungover too many times or something to that nature. She got VERY, VERY upset at me for not telling her that I had such a serious problem in the past that I was recovering from. According to her, I was lying by not telling her (someone that doesn't have any deep impact on my personal life nor do I hers because we weren't actually really dating). I was putting her in danger by not waiting until I had more time, or for not telling her so that she could make a decision not to see me. Mind you, I would never drink around people nor want to have anyone over when I was.\n\nI accept that I'm an asshole for lying about my relapse to her by \"being sick\" while I was recovering... also I should have stopped everything other than getting back into serious group-based sobriety, including seeing her a couple more times. However, am I the asshole for only leaving it at \"I had a problem with alcohol\" while we were just hooking up and not telling her the horrible alcoholic spree I had the past year? I honestly feel like this is something that is way too personal and embarrassing to have to tell someone before you are actually dating them seriously? I did say a couple more times during our FWB relationship that it would be cool to date, but we never actually had a real conversation where we committed to one another and just kept it casual. This is the same person that would say \"I expect a romantic night\" while also maintaining her single status, and got upset at me for not telling her that I was Bi-Polar because she (innocuously) asked me what medication I was taking.\n\nI would obviously tell someone that I was starting a serious relationship with... but we had never committed. I'm really sensitive about my alcoholism so I didn't want to press the matter if it didn't need to be.  I don't like to go around saying that I'm an alcoholic to everyone (unless it's AA).  I just need a sanity check.",

      "description": "I was at home on Saturday making music, which I’d set the day aside to do, and I was really in the zone when my girlfriend texted me. She was supposed to buy a car that day with her folks but they bailed, and she asked if I’d come keep her company. \n\nIf I hadn’t been doing anything I’d be down, but I was really making some good progress creatively and, honestly, the idea of schlepping around a used car lot instead just sounded awful to me. But she also said she was feeling lonely. I was starving and particularly broke at the moment, so I thought about it a bit and said, I’ll come with you to get the car if you buy me dinner tonight. She happily agreed.\n\nBackground: She recently left her job but has a lot of money saved up, and when she is working she makes a good amount more than me. I live paycheck to paycheck basically but I’m not in financial trouble or anything. When we eat out normally, we alternate paying for meals.\n\nEverything went fine - she wasn’t upset or anything, and we went to a great burger joint after she got quoted for the car (she didn’t buy it yet because they wouldn’t negotiate, but we later learned that this is standard for used cars). But I got started thinking afterwards, was it a dick move to ask her my girlfriend to buy me dinner?? \n\n",

      "description": "My ex and I had a amicable but long drawn breakup. The context of that is not that important obviously but I knew he didn't love me anymore and things were going to change. We shared two cats we essentially rescued from his friend as kittens. They has severe eye infections and a terrible case of fleas . We both nursed them back to health together. We we're very attached to these cats and treated them as our children (crazy cat people lol) I was the one that moved out and he kept the cats (something that at the time of our breakup he demanded) I was always the one to give in and honestly I didn't want to make the situation harder than it already was.  I didn't want to rip my cats out of the home they've   become so adjusted to. Anyway to the point of where the assholerie might have happened..after the breakup I was still allowed visits and was responsible for food and litter, a situation happened and I had to jump ship to protect myself at the time knowing I would probably never see those cats again. It's been difficult to even think about them without tears forming in my eyes and this wave of guilt flooding over me. So I don't. I don't think of them. I don't look at pictures I don't try to remember no, nada, nothing. Complete detachment. Recently we got into an argument and he brought up the fact that I don't \"give a fuck about the cats\". All of our interactions have been though text or calls and we only do speak because I still have some items left in his home and again we're for the most part pretty amicable. I don't hate the guy but I do resent him for keeping them. He knows and has heard me completely break down over the phone if he even just brings them up. I try not to talk about them and give him vague answers when he does bring them up through text for his credit. Reddit I need to know am I the asshole for not caring about these cats ? ",

      "description": "BG: I've known these people for around 6 years or so and I'm 18. We're v close and I tell them everything ( or at least used to)\n\n\nOkay so this starts last year when I had a really bad breakup. Both of my friends were busy so I went through it alone pretty much, it was a really bad few months mental health wise. One if my friends was genuinely busy, but my other friend just wanted to talk to her BF instead and we didn't talk for a few months. Obviously that's her choice, but I can't help how I feel. There's more to it but that's the jist. I learned how to heal on my own though and I'm doing better.\n\nFast forward a few months later I made a Reddit  account that I used to vent and for advice and all that. I mentioned it to me friend (don't remember the context), they asked if they could see it but I said no because it's like a diary. She said she was hurt by that but didn't mention it again. And then today she asked me why I've been so distant and not telling them things. I didn't know what they meant tbh but she mentioned the account again and that it's weird that I'd rather vent to strangers than my friends. I told her it's just how I feel. Then eventually I told them if they felt so bad about it they didn't have to talk to me because I'm not going to open up to them more. I just don't feel like it's fair to ditch more for months when I'm in a bad place and get upset when I look for other places to vent to\n\n\n\nAnother thing is that I met some guy online and we've been talking for a while. They don't like him because they feel like he's using me or whatever. Im only mentioning this because it's put a dent in our friendship too for not listening to them and to stop talking to him.",

      "description": "TL;DR My abusive mother who I am low contact with offered to buy me a car to help me while I save for my wedding. I accept after talking over with my SO. It's been 9 months with the car and now she wants me to take over payments on the car (not the original agreement). I cannot afford this and tell her if I would have know I would have declined the offer. She tells me my SO doesn't take care of me and at the end of the day I'm still white trash like her. I kick her out of my wedding and am giving back the car. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me start by saying that my mom and I have always had a strained relationship. She was physically and mentally abusive to me and my siblings. My dad got full custody of us after she cheated on him while he was deployed. Totally different story, on to the meat and potatoes of this post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter being no contact with my mom for years and many years of therapy I decided to let her back into my life, low contact. I have been in a relationship with my SO for 4 1/2 years and we got engaged in February. I wanted to include my mom in my wedding because it is such a huge milestone. My SO and I live in NY and share a car (this is important for the next part of the story I promise). We have been deciding on where to get married that is what we both want, but is financially smart for us. This is where my mom comes in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom is all for being a part of the wedding. She seems genuinely invested in the planning and apologetic about our rocky past. Cool, this is going well. She suggests that we come back down South (where I am from) to get married, it's cheaper, has ties to my roots, and is where my SO and I first met. I agree and we start the planning. She insists on paying for the ceremony and reception portion of the wedding. A total of $6k which is a huge help. I accept the offer and thank her. We move forward in planning and she offers me a car to help me get around. There are no stipulations when she offers the car. She says she wants to help me out and she will pay the car payment and insurance. I talk this over with my Fiance and we both think it would be a huge help to not have to share a car, at least until after the wedding and we can afford a second car for me. We accept the car and I go down to pick it up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward it's been about 9 months since I got the car from my mom. Everything has been fine. We talk on the phone about once a week and text every couple days. Seems like things are really looking up and I am getting my relationship with her back on track after so many years of being heartbroken. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I get a text from her saying that at the end of the year my SO and I will need to take over the car payment. I ask if something went wrong and if her finances are ok. She said yes, but she feels like I am old enough to make a car payment on my own. Again, this was never brought up in the process of us taking the car, and I even asked multiple times if we would need to take over at any point because I don't think we could budget for that. I told her that if I would have know this before I would not have accepted because I can't afford another car payment on top of the other expenses we have. We get in a huge fight. She tells me that I am ungrateful and I have forgotten where I come from (White Trash) and basically that my SO does not take care of me. I immediately shut down. I told her that I will be giving the car back to her and that she is no longer welcome at the wedding. She says I am over reacting and to just pay for the car because she doesn't want to take it from me. I insisted that she take the car back and now she's coming up here to pick it up in the next few weeks. Am I the Asshole ? ",

I didnt reply as i was driving and focused on the road and the music on in the car. \n\nHe then, without warning or asking, proceeds to tell me in extreme detail what the woman did to the toddler while our own 3 year old sat in the backseat, so I screamed at him. I screamed “why the fuck would you read that to me, why would you think thats okay, that’s disgusting and disturbing, i feel sick now”\n\nHis defense was that I read him “sick, disturbing shit” all the time. He would be right as i often read stories to him about deaths in the news in detail HOWEVER I personally dont find graphic death nearly as disturbing or upsetting as the graphic details of the rape of a baby. I never have and never will subject myself to reading things like that. \n\nHe yelled back at me, we got into a fight when we got home, away from earshot of our toddler, and havent spoken since.\n\nMy sister told me i made it a bigger deal than it was, so i really want to know, am i the asshole here?",

      "description": "I am a long time lurker, and I have a scenario that happened about 2 years ago, and till this day I sometimes think about it, and despite everyone in my life telling me I am not the asshole, I figured I wouldn't mind having Reddit a go at it. This is going to be quite long, I'll try to be as concise and short as possible.\n\n I lived with 2 other female housemates. The one I shared a room with (call her L), and the other, C. Now L had her golden retriever (call her doggo) at the apartment with us, and this is in all of our 3rd year in University. A little background about my relationship with these two ladies to set some context. \n\nWith C, we didn't get along very well (because I was the asshole to her previously, about not communicating well about my GF's dog being homed temporarily in our appartment, and so I had promised her after a certain date C would never have to see the dog again). And I did keep this promise. \nWith L, we had bonded well during orientation, but after the first year of living with her, I ended up getting a GF and I don't know if that sat well with her (maybe out of jealousy,I really don't know). \n\nAnyway, the whole start of the problem was when I one day had to throw away some bloody underwear and I had tied the garbage bag and had accidently left it in the bathroom, I was rushing to make it to the bus for my class. I came home later and found that doggo had gotten into the bag, and I could not find the bloody underwear, so I had told L what had happened, and she started panicking (rightfully so) because she said that dogs sometimes eat socks/underwear and if they don't poop it out you need to get it surgically removed so it doesn't cause further damage to the doggo. \n\nNow, this happened on a Thursday, and I also had gotten really ill with a stomach flu, I literally have never thrown up so much in my life(and the only way I could stop the throwing up was using suppositories (fun)). The weekend both L and I had a club tournament to go to, and I had told the team I wasn't able to go, but L as a somewhat co-captain still needed to go, and had asked me to make sure doggo poops normally. \n\nBeing so drastically sick I told L that no, I am not well enough to even take care of myself, my GF will take me to her place in another city to make sure I have care. L was furious because she said that since it was my underwear the doggo ate it is my responsibility to take care of it. Don't get me wrong, if I wasn't sick I definitely would have made sure doggo was alright, I'm not a monster. But, again I was pretty much bound to my bed, so I held my foot down and told L that no, I cannot take care of doggo, I can't even take care of myself. \n\nWhen L insisted that my GF just come to my apartment to take care of me, I said no because then my GF's dog would have to come with her too, and L KNEW about C not being happy with GF's dog, she just said \"what is one more day going to hurt? She was here for so long anyway\", I told L no again, and that I would not go back on a promise I made C just to watch your dog. \n\nPlus, if my GF had to come to my apartment, she would have to take care of not just me but 2 dogs, AND WORK. (It worked well that I come to my GF's apartment because she literally worked down the street to her apartment so it was feasible.)\n\nWhat ended up happening? I went to my GF's , I was severely sick for a week, and had residual symptoms for another week afterward. L got another friend to look after doggo.\n\nIn the end, doggo was fine, she didn't actually eat the underwear, and I'm left with this bad taste in my mouth whenever I even think about this experience. Still to this day L blames me for not taking responsibility, and yeah, I understand some of her points, but when I am too sick to even take care of a dog, then how could you expect me to do that? \n\nAlso, people constantly tell me I am not the ass hole because say for instance you aren't talking about a dog but a baby, if your baby swallows another kid's toy, it is NOT the responsibility of the other kid, or the other kid's parents to care for your child, it's your child, it's your responsibility. This I completely completely agree with this, doggo was not mine, L had chosen to take watch of doggo while at college, doggo is NOT my responsibility.\n\n I am no longer friends with L, because I don't need that shit in my life. There are way way more examples of L trying to use me as a doormat (partically because I kinda let her do that in the beginning), but when my GF started pointing out abusive behavior from L to me, it made me realize that I didn't want to be a doormat anymore. \n\nSo yeah, AITA for not looking after my roommate's doggo? \n",

Our advisor entrusts me and the other officers of our class (I am the class secretary) to manage the class, and rarely ever helps us, which is understandable considering that my school's staff is limited and she has to teach five other classes. \n\nShe has been our advisor for three years, and has dealt with a lot of our shit, so sometimes she gets mad at us for the smallest reasons because she's really tired of us as she has voiced out countless times. This week, my class has been preparing for an outing for our assigned clubs. Combined with our other projects that we had to submit within the week, we were all really tired. Usually, in the mornings when we wait for our first subject teacher, we like to mess around and talk before lectures start. This morning we were particularly noisy, our advisor comes up, yelling \"WHO'S SCREAMING?\" then accuses a girl who's known for being loud. She goes apeshit, kicks over our trashcan, pushes stuff off the teachers' table, and breaks her own glasses. She rants to us how tired she is because the coordinator of events of my school is absent and that she has to take care of the outing, then starts calling us inconsiderate for not helping, despite the fact that it was us who planned it in the first place. She starts crying, makes someone call in the Gr 7, the only other highschool class. After humiliating us in front of the Gr 7 and FINALLY giving the announcement she was supposed to give, she lets them go back and starts saying we're so irresponsible, that we're the worst batch she's ever handled, then says \"I hate to compare, but it's true.\" She says how we were abusing her because, and that we should be good to her because she's our \"second parent\". She opens an open forum and tells us to say what we have against her and she say what she doesn't like about us. We didn't say anything. She starts pointing at my classmates one by one, calling them immature, lacking in common sense, and even called someone stupid. She tells our class president, who literally busts his ass everyday, that choosing him as president was a mistake. Then she asks us what we want and suggests that we cut ties so she'll be nothing but a subject teacher. I say it's a good idea. It's for the best anyway, because obviously she can't handle us, and we're just as tired of her as she is of us. She just walks out.\n\nLater, another teacher comes up and informs us that her BP was high because of us, and if something happens to her, it was our fault and that we would pay for her if she goes to the hospital.",

      "description": "warning: long read \n\nThis was a couple of years ago but I still often think about this. My ex-best friend of a couple years and I were in a pretty large friend group at the time for context. \n\nAnyway, my friend, lets just call her ‘A’ told me she was talking to this guy in our college, she showed me the messages and he seemed pretty cool. They would meet up often and I tagged along once or twice, so the guy, A and I started a group chat to talk about life. We talked a lot for a few months and grew closer but I felt A was drifting from me after years of being close best friends. I obviously knew something was up as the guy and A started to talk to me less and less. \n\nFast forward to my birthday party where I invited the large friend group, including A. I asked her if she had been talking the guy lately and she said more than before. I asked to play a game on her phone and she reluctantly gave me her phone, instead I went on to their messages to see what they had been talking about and discovered paragraphs and paragraphs of them just taking shit about me. I really wanted to just  burst with anger but I kept reading and found her saying how much she just wanted me to die and the guy saying “ I should just kill myself.” I was disgusted, raging but I asked her to leave outside without causing a scene. \n\nLater on I messaged both of them saying that they should no longer speak to me or look at me,  saying I was finished with them and that I was going to block them on all social media. I then told my friend group what she had done and they all immediately stopped talking to her. I feel guilty as she lost all of her closest friends because of me, I’m not sure if should’ve told them but it was such a big thing that they had done that I had to have someone to vent and cry to. AITA for this?\n\nsummed up: found out friend wished for me to kill myself, told all our friends what she had done, she lost her closest friends.",

      "description": "Sorry for the long post and skewed format, im on mobile. \n\nA bit of background: My best friend was in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship for a while, and she’s now carrying this mans kid. While I don’t have an issue with helping her, I have an issue with helping him, considering what he’s done to her physically and mentally. (Death threats even.)  A bit ago, I was talking to her and she said I was never there for her at the time she needed me the most, her pregnancy. I politely let her know that her boyfriend is not someone I would like to associate myself with considering the past, to which she very harshly came back at me with a string of “I was there for you when you needed it” \n\nMore background: She had an abusive household, I would pick her up multiple times just because she didn’t trust herself alone, sometimes at 3am, sometimes at 3pm. Any time she needed me. I talked to her for hours at my boyfriends birthday party because she was upset and didn’t trust herself. I’ve sat with her for hours talking because she didn’t trust herself, I’ve fed her when she refused to eat, I even gave her a room in my house because she needed out of her own. Any time we have an argument, which isn’t often, she throws everything she can back in my face, telling me I’m childish and she’s even threatened our friendship a few times, this time included. Once I tried to ask her to talk to me because I wasn’t feeling well and she told me she was talking to her sister and she couldn’t talk. I’m not trying to put myself on a pedestal, but I think I’m a decent friend to her. My mother told me that I should give him a chance and that maybe things did change.\n\nAnyway,  she told me “I guess you’re never gonna see me again because I’m having his kid. He’s gonna be in my life FOREVER” quote. As far as I know, or as far as she told me, he “changed”. Though her grandmother (whom she lived with) told me otherwise. I already have trust issues with new people, as everyone does but especially abusive people.  She’s told me I should give him a chance. I’m willing to, just need advice. \n\nSo, reddit.. AITA?",

      "description": "I had thought I recently met two lovely people who happen to be homosexual. However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?",

      "description": "This story is actually extremely long on it's own, and full of twists and turns. Because of this, I'm going to start in the middle, so feel free to ask about anything that might not make sense.\n\nThere's this guy that I liked for over a year, who we'll call Austin for the sake of this story, but I always knew the crush was unhealthy. I couldn't stop thinking about Austin and would even stop paying attention in class to daydream about him. I only had one of my class periods with him, and it happened to be seventh, so I had to wait all day to see him. Because of this I would force myself to stay at school while sick just to talk with him. So yeah, pretty unhealthy.\n\nHowever, when Summer came around I lost some feelings for him because I never saw him, and when school rolled around we had no classes together, so my attraction just kept growing weaker. I assumed that Austin never even had a crush on me to begin with, so I felt it impossible that he liked me now. But one day while I was walking out of school, one of his friends came up to me and told me that Austin did, in fact, like me! This made my heart ache because he had been such a big part of my life that I didn't want to hurt him. At my school, we have a dance every month, and that happened to be the Friday before one. I go to all of the dances and Austin had only ever been to one, but of course he had to show up that night. Of course I played petty and avoided him, and I thought I was safe from any confrontation. Because of this I let my guard down, and when I was sitting alone on the bleachers he cane up to me and asked how I felt about him. I told the truth; that I liked him a lot but not in that way. He walked off solemnly, but I thought I'd gone about it correctly. That is, until one of my friends who had been sitting in front of me turned around and said, \"That was harsh.\"\n\nBecause of that I felt the need to make it up to Austin and asked him to the next dance. I tried to make it clear I wanted to go as friends, but apparently he needed me to blatantly state this, because two days later he asked me out. I knew at this point I had been unintentionally leading him on, so I felt obligated to say yes. However, I ended up breaking it off less than a month later, and I feel like such an awful person. I want to make it up to him but don't want to make things worse. \n\nI'm already pretty convinced I'm the asshole here, but I want some more opinions.",

When I got their and started talking the one girl made me pinky promise with her we would dance together at prom. Considering I can't dance I was a little concerned on how that would play out. \n\nAnyways, prom rolls around (No, I didn't have a date) and I saw the girl at prom before the food was served, talked a bit then went over to my table. Sometime during the night on the dance floor I randomly made eye contact with her and her friend then quickly looked away and started talking to someone. The reason I never asked her to dance was a mix of awkward/shyness and not knowing/being able to dance. \n\nProm ends and I didn't see her again till a week later a party when I randomly run into them and her friend goes \"hey girlsname look who it is.\" and pretty much had a short conversation with her on why we didn't dance at prom,(she brought it up) where I said something along the lines of cause I didn't really see her once the dancing started. Ended the convo with her saying she'd talk to me later and that was the last time I talked to her. Well more because summer was right around the corner than University but yeah.\n\nWas I an asshole here?",

      "description": "Background: I am a manager at a restaurant that I have worked in for nearly 6 years. I’ve been managing for ~8 months, so some situations are still new to me. We do not have extremely clear-cut policies, and my management team is quite lenient ( read: /too lenient/ )   \n\nStory: Today a newer waitress came in too high to function. She had two tables within an hour due to bad weather, and still couldn’t take care of them. She was cut from the floor by another manager and she was still obviously stoned when I arrived. Other servers filled me in and the manager (who is very close with her) had no intention of talking about it until I asked him to come into the office. I asked if she had been cut for that reason, he confirmed, so I decided to write her up. Additionally on the write up, I acknowledged another time she had come into work after day drinking (she could still function, but was tipsy). I also wrote that she has been out of uniform regulations for the past two days. \n\nNow here is where I start to feel guilty: MANY of my coworkers smoke marijuana. A staggering amount. If we cracked down on drug use, we would have no staff left. I’ve sat with people as they take a hit on their smoke break, I know multiple people are dealers, and some cant function WITHOUT weed. The difference is, to me, they can perform their job while under the influence. \n\nCLARIFICATION: I hold no grudges against marijuana. I used to smoke all the time, but gave it up due to anxiety and wanting to keep a clear head. I DO have issues with people presenting horrible customer service in our establishment and thinking they can walk all over their place of employment. I also hold no grudges against this waitress. I actually really enjoy working with her (most of the time). \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nTL;DR: AITA for writing someone up for being too high to work, while knowing full well that others smoke at work too (but can still maintain their work)? \n",

      "description": "I (M) am the 7th of 7, 5F 2M Sister I'm refering to is 2 years older and #6.\n\n3 years ago my sister got married and chose her wedding date for a time when my parents were going on a cruise with my Grandfather and aunt etc. She wanted them to cancel to go and they straight up said no if you want us to be there then change the date (they had already paid and planned for about a year.) so she changed it to my birthday, whatever no big deal.\n\nI suffer from clinical depression and at that time was going through the task of getting on a medication that worked for me and I was very unstable. (been depressed since 4th or 5th grade maybe earlier) I was 21 at this time living with my parents and working a part time job (~30hrs a week) and I did a lot on my parents farm. She was also living with my parents and would constantly harass me at least 3 times a week telling me I was a PoS and would never be better than her soon to be husband and I should just KMS.\n\nOver the next few months I was constantly verbally assaulted with that fact I was a PoS and should KMS at least 2-3 times a week. I was also informed by my favorite sister #5 that she said no one could mention it was my birthday after 11 am that day. I had already made plans to go visit a friend for that weekend for my birthday (about 2 hours away) which I was told to cancel because it was her wedding (I had planned it before she got engaged.) I really didn't want to go (I hate large social gatherings) and she was being her narcissistic self.\n\nI ending up going only because I wanted to hang out with my grandfather (then 89), who lives 1/2 way across the country and I don't get to see very often. I basically just kept him company the entire time and enjoyed listening to his WW2 stories. The wedding was okay (honestly pretty shitty now that I attended one of my friend's wedding) and I left as soon as I had eaten with my grandfather. I said goodbye to my eldest sister and her family (they live near my grandfather and were leaving for home right after) and went home.\n\nOnce she moved I avoided her as much as possible and refused to go to family reunions etc if she was there. I told my parent's that I wanted nothing to do with her and I wouldn't be in any family photos with her there. If I attended any family gathering with her there (without my knowledge) I avoided her and left as early as I could.\n\nMy parent's think I'm an ass for not being around her and \"forgiving her\" for the way she treated me.\n\nIt's been 3.5 years and I'm finishing up my schooling and planning to move (my sister moved back in the same small town where my family lives) and I would have no plans to visit afterwards.\n\nParents think ITA for avoiding her and not forgiving her for being abusive for years and that I won't visit them when I finish my schooling if she's there or be in any family photos including her.\n\nMy family knows she told me to KMS often and honestly only #1 and #5 defend me.",

Two sizes bigger than his old ones. \n\nHe is about a size four.\n\nWhen tied properly they fit well and he has tried them playing football and tucking with me. No problems. \n\nI asked the “ex” by email three times if he could use his new boots as they are too small. \n\nHe still turned up to rugby in them. \n\nSo I took matters in my own hands and took the black ones off him. I told his mum by email before he left that I had done it and why, she then had a go at me in email for doing this.\n\nNot only this, in front of my boy, her boyfriend had a go at me threatening to call the police and that it was theft holding them back. \n\nHe then (again with my son in my car) told me he was going to sell (my sons boots, not mine) - which is actually theft (the black boots they were told would be returned once he was wearing the new ones. \n\nAdmittedly I told her boyfriend he was an idiot for threatening me over such a small thing and that as his parent I had a responsibility for my children’s safety and that I will be contacting social services and the police (the latter as I have severe mental health issues caused partly by my ex’s and my “mothers” abuse and that this is intimidation) and that I will also tell them that he was drink driving in the car (took an open can in the car whilst driving my son home) one Sunday and speeds excessively with them in he car also (something else I’ve witnessed). \n\nI admit I failed to protect my daughter from her so I am an asshole for that a big one.\n\nBut I told the court in a family hearing that I would not fail my kids again and that I would contact social services should abuse to the boys happen.\n\n\nSo, AM I THE ASSHOLE?\n",

We have another (password-guarded) wifi network that is our employee wifi, used only by employees. In this instance where the public wifi is down, I would have been perfectly fine giving customers the password to this employee wifi, but my manager has made very clear on multiple occasions that this is a private network, and never to give other people the password. I personally don’t see the harm, but I do as my manager says.\n\nThat same day, a professional-looking man in a suit and tie came into our shop with a computer, a briefcase and a bunch of papers, bought a drink and sat down. He came up to me a few minutes later, telling me that the guest wifi wasn’t showing up, and I told him very apologetically it’s down today. He told me, “Well, I’m going to need the password to the employee network, then. I have a lot of work to get done.” I told him, even more apologetically, that we can’t give that password out, as established by the manager. I emphasized how I’d have no problem doing it but it’s her rule. “Well, I need the password though. Like I said, I have a lot of work I need to get done. What’s the password?” \n\nHe kept pushing and pushing, until he finally went back to his table and sat back down. He scowled and sulked like a petulant child as he finished his drink, then thrust all of his papers and things back into his briefcase furiously, and dramatically stormed out of the building, huffing angrily as he left and eliciting a huge number of stares from our other customers.

In the last 18 months, he managed to rid himself of debt, but we had numerous problems relating to his MH and anger management issues, and me being out a lot - during this time my step-mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and I spent a lot of time with her and caring for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToward the end of last year, B finally got out of debt, and in October we moved out of our single room in a shared house into a 1 bed apartment together. Unfortunately, in November, I took on a huge new project (a book deal for my first novel), my grandmother and step-mom died, plus my family dog which I'd owned for 18 years. I tried to put this aside, as I had tight deadlines on the book. A couple of weeks ago, I handed in the first draft, promptly get very ill, and felt suddenly overwhelmed with grief. My MH has been so poor - crying all the time, feeling physically ill, retreating from any and all social situations and just staying indoors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nB was away for a week with work and after a few days of being alone, I started to feel much better and to remember what life was like prior to all the intensity of the last few months/year and a half. I felt a sense of peace and safety by myself. When it got near to the date of him coming home I became an emotional wreck at the idea of him returning.  I told him I thought I needed time apart, just to hibernate and process alone, and that maybe in the future we could be together but that right now, I wasn't coping trying to be in a relationship whilst also grieving and working on my book.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis response was about how upset he is about trying to find a new place, how he's just rid himself of debt and will need to find enough money for a deposit. I earn more so we figured I would stay here in the 1 bed apartment alone and take on the full rent and he will move out and go elsewhere. He's really upset about this new and unexpected financial situation and I feel so guilty for requesting that we live apart especially when I know how long it took him to rid himself of debt but before. He's done nothing wrong - it's all stuff going with me, so I feel so sad at asking him to go. But I just desperately feel like I need time and space and solitude. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Imma try and summarize this the best i can. If you want/need more details ill edit the post.\n\nSo i (F17) met this guy (M17) in middle school. I found out from a friend that he liked me, which i found odd since i just joined the school and talked to (we'll call him) Leo once or twice. Despite that, i began talking to him and liking him, so we dated.\n\nA few people would say things to me about him, like his anger issues and how he was mean to a lot of people, and as soon as i saw those traits i broke it off, in fear of judgment. I told him i wasn't ready for a relationship at that time, and maybe we could get back together later down the line. \n\nFew months later, i ask him if he wants to try it again, and he says yes. We date, ans the backlash is 2x worse. People wouls constantly say i was out of Leo's leauge, point out how he'll yell the hard r out on the top of his lungs, etc, so i left once again, but very reluctantly becausr i still loved him.\n\nFlashfoward to Junoir year. I still love him. I told him i still liked him, as to not appear creepy, and he seems okay with it? Like something might end up happening if i play my cards right. Am i the asshole for trying to get back with him though? I explained why i broke up with him, and we talked about it a bit. I admitted to my mistakes, and told him I'd respect whatever descion he makes. I love him so much. He was my first boyfriend, and i never felt the same with anybody else, male or female. Sure, he's done some pretty bad things, but haven't we all..? I just hope I'm bot manipulating him in any way. I truly love him, and will stick through it with him if he does even take me back.",

      "description": "My friend and I have been friends for a several years. She adopted an ex fighter pitt type dog. It’s huge and has many battle scars and she admitted that this dog killed a few dogs and cats before she adopted it. She has a huge heart and I get that these breeds get a lot of hate but that doesn’t make me less fearful of them and I don’t want him around me or my cats. I don’t want to be a person who let a dog with a fighting past around me thinking I’m helping prove that “it’s the owner not the dog” and he ends up hurting me or my cats anyway (you can say media blows it out or proportion and they might but don’t pretend it doesn’t happen.)\n\nMy friend wanted to come visit me and my fiancé and I told her sure. So when she’s practically down the street she texts me that she’s bringing her new dog to meet us because “he needs to be socialized.”\n\nNot wanting to be rude, I told her I guess it was ok but to please ask first next time. I wanted to be nice and try to get over my fear but nope. So when she gets here, I see she’s BARELY able to hold onto this dogs leash. I should have said no.\n\nWhen they come in the dog is barking and growling at me and my cats. 2 of my cats ran but 1 of my cats is a 21 year old deaf girl. She tried to run but the dog kept lunging for her so I scooped her up and put her in the room with the others and closed the door. Her heart was pounding, I didn’t want to leave her in there but I didn’t want to come off as mean. After a lot of convincing from my friend the dog finally calmed down a little but it was on edge. All my friend said was “sorry bout that lol he’s still learning.”\n\nWe all sit down to chat and she just let him off his leash to roam around the house! I asked her nicely if she could keep him close but she glared and said that “he’s fine he just needs to learn.”\n\nWe keep talking but I can’t focus because I can’t not watch this dogs every move. He ate all the cat food and kept going back to the door my cats were in and growling. So I asked her again if she could keep the dog next to her. She rolled her eyes and got the dog to sit next to her. For a bit everything seemed to be ok and I started to relax, we turned on the TV and we were focused on the show. I then felt something grab onto my leg and making weird movements. I looked down and this dogs was humping my legs!\n\nI freaked out and pushed the dog off of me and yelled “NO! ABSOLUTELY NO! GET OFF OF ME!” The dog got off but he started growling and barking again. My friend got up and started yelling AT ME! “Don’t push my dog! He’s not hurting you!” I told her to get out don’t ever bring him back. She left right then.\n\nI know I could have probably handled it better but in the moment I wanted the dog gone. She didn’t even ask if she could bring it over in the first place! And it was scaring my cats! Our friendship is pretty much moot at this point, but was ITA?",

When we were walking around we walked by a crazy guy and he grabbed her ass and she was so pissed and started yelling at him and trying to fight him. I stopped her from hitting him because the guy was like egging her on and def would have kicked her ass. She then told me to do something about this and I was like ah no, the guy is huge and crazy. I'm not a big guy so would have got my ass beat too and I'm not her boyfriend so I don't have to like defend her honor or anything like that. I suggested we walk away and go to security and or a cop. We walked away and the whole time she was berating me and calling me a pussy, asshole, not a man. And when we got to the security guy she said she didn't want to hang out anymore after she gave her statement to him and a cop so I left and went home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA For chickening out? I'm a lover not a fighter and she's just a friend so I didn't feel the need to like beat up a guy for disrespecting her.

We go to the same uni and we love making fun of these over dramatic couples we see or hear about from our friends, by pretending to have a fit over a really small issue (\"OMG HOW COULD YOU NOT HOLD THE DOOR FOR ME? WE ARE SO DONE!\") just as a joke between us.\n\nNow for the fuck up.\n\nMy gf usually has rreaaally bad period cramps, to a point where she can't walk back to class if we're at the canteen. She just clutches her tummy and lays her head on the table and prays for the pain to go away. For the 8 months we've been dating I've bought her chocolates every time it was her time of the month to sort of distract her from the pain cuz I heard chocolate works wonders (and fellas, it really does).\nBut this time I didn't cuz I'm literally broke to the bone cuz of buying materials for class. And she got really mad at me.\nAt first I thought she was doing the overacting drama thing as a joke, so I played along.\n\nHer: WTF, the one time you needed to pull through and you let me down?! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻) \n\nMe: Oh I'm sorrryyyy, but does it say \"room service\" tattooed on my forehead?\n\nAnd this is when she shoots me this look of absolute disgust, and gets up and storms out. Me being the dumb bitch that I am thought she was still pretending, so I was sitting there waiting for her to come back so we could laugh it off. Except she didn't. Turns out she walked back home (she lives pretty close to uni) alone.\nWhen I texted her and asked her what happened. She said that my reaction was totally uncalled for and all she asked for was a chocolate. (gf is from a well off family) and said its impossible to not be able to afford even a chocolate. And now she's being lowkey salty towards me.\n\nWomen of reddit, help a brother out. Pls. I really like her and I don't want things to spiral out of control.",

I am in university housing, eat on a meal plan, and my parents have said that they will pay for my dining hall food, but will not give me money to spend in restaurants or for takeout (which is more than fair and I’m thankful for what I have).\n\nMy boyfriend of almost 2 years lives in an apartment his parents pay for, and they pay for all of his groceries and whenever he wants to eat out, so he eats out for every meal.\n\nWhen we go out, we switch off who pays the bill. I’ve tried to explain how annoying that is for me, because I eat half as much and would pick cheaper items, but he refused to do it my way. At the time, early in our dating, I was working full time and could usually get him to eat something I cooked or I could afford a little splurge after an overtime shift. \n\nNow I’m stuck. I have no income now that I’m a full time student, and it’s not easy for me to do this any longer. He never wants to eat with me at the dining hall where I can swipe him in, or cook food from ingredients I can buy with my swipes, or cook his own anything, so from Friday night until Sunday when we hang out it’s constantly ordering in. I tried to explain that it’s different for him to buy my tiny portion on his parents card than for me to buy his meal and a half with money I’ve saved myself but he doesn’t get it. He begs me to come over before dinner and then gets mad when I don’t want to order in, so I end up pretending I’m not hungry while he orders something. He doesn’t like when I bring my own food over, even when I bring a bunch to share, and he especially doesn’t like going separate places for dinner.\n\nI am saving to go on a long spiritual trip to Asia that I’ve been dreaming of for years, and have been living very frugally since I first had the idea in early high school to afford the experience. I didn’t want to do this anymore, so I told him that I will never order in anymore, and we are going to eat and pay separately, and I refuse to go out unless it’s a special occasion. He got mad and said I’m being cheap and I focus too much on money and it ruins the fun of the weekend and our dates, and if we do that it’ll feel like a transaction.\n\nSo Reddit, am I actually the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "(On mobile, sorry for formatting!)\nMy ex-bf of a year cheated on me a few months ago. I was devastated. I had a general idea a few weeks ahead of him admitting to it cause he pulled back emotionally from me. No texts, never called, wouldn't come home that kind of thing. So anyway, during those weeks..I cried...ALOT! I was heartbroken  that here i was going thru this again..I mean I saw the signs from dealing with past relationships that happened the same way. In a way, those weeks helped me overcome and start to accept my reality, so when he did come clean about the cheating I was pretty calm and level headed.\n\nI told him we was over, that he needed to leave and that I'm sorry this ended this way but I am not putting up with cheating as it has happened to me in the past and well, once a cheater always a cheater! He kept asking me if we could still be friends and I agreed just to get him to shut up about it. Once he was gone, I blocked him on social media and changed my number. Mainly due to how I felt about him. I still felt strongly about him even though I was calm and I knew if I had a way to communicate with him i was going to crack. \n\nFast forward to now. I am mentally stronger. I am finally over him completely and the thought of him does not make my chest hurt. I went to the grocery store and saw him and it was almost a relief not to feel panicky! I been avoiding him for so long I was worried that I wouldnt know how to act normally but none of that fear happened. I walked up to him and said hey and asked how he was. He GLARED daggers at him and basically said how I lied to him and lead him to believe that we could be friends after the break up. And since it's been months of no contact why come up to him now. \n\nI dont feel like I was an ass cause i dont owe him anything but then again this voice inside me says maybe I was.\n\nWas I an ass?",

      "description": "so...my (now ex-) boyfriend and I have been together for 3 1/2 years and I have been doubting our relationship for some months every now and then. Normally, I wouldn't be the person to change anything as he still is a very good friend to me and I knew it would break his heart if I ended things. However, I recently talked a lot with a guy from Uni about a lot of personal things and we got a long very well and might have kissed once or twice (to clarify: he isn't the reason I decided to end things). With his help I realized that I wasn't the happiest I could be and decided to break up with my boyfriend. Of course, my boyfriend is absolutely heartbroken and I feel really bad about leaving him since he already has a lot of personal problems going on. Despite that, I've felt really relieved for the past week and have also run across the thought, that staying longer and breaking up a few months later wouldn't have made anything better, although maybe we could have saved our relationship? I have no idea anymore. Am I the asshole in this situation or is it okay what I did?",

      "description": "My sister got me a nice contour make up palette for my birthday. The next day she asked if she could use it and I said yes since I didn’t mind. She dropped it after using it, making the make up inside crack. She didn’t even tell me she broke it, she left it until I opened it later and then asked her about it. \n\n I’ve been using it since bc I don’t have the money to buy it myself and it’s a really nice one, but it’s really hard to use and I usually end up making a mess. \n\nWould getting angry about it make me ungrateful since she bought it for me in the first place? \n\n",
