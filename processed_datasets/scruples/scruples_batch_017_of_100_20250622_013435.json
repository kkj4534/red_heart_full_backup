      "description": "Me and this girl were talking online (She was out of state) and things started to get a little dirty. I told her that I was not into online relationships and that I am into having fun, but i dont want to like save my self for her.  She got confused, but I explained it to her to which she then agreed with me. \n\nWe kept talking and having fun. We would talk about spending time together and calling each other cute. We would call a-lot and I was starting to get a little annoyed a-little, but it was still pretty good. \n\nFast forward a couple of days and we were done having “fun” and I told her that I was going to go to bed early. She then got mad and implied that I was just using her and playing with her feelings. I then told her again about what I said when  we first started talking and she told me to loose her number.\n\nAm I the Asshole cause I feel like I clearly stated how I felt in the beginning of the relationship, but idk if talking about how we would spend time together and what we could do was too much.

      "description": "Yesterday, I got into a fight with my stepdad (who has a history of \"because I said so\"-ing and needing to be right about everything) over me commenting on things I have no experience in. To counter, I stated an instance from a couple months ago in which I signed up for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and he said to get in shape for it, I need to do things lke running 2-3 miles daily and 100 push-ups and sit-ups every day. I relayed this information to my instructor, who has 25+ years of grappling experience and asked if it was overkill for my current skill and athletic level. He said that excessive running could have a negative impact on grappling, and I relayed this info back to him in the argument yesterday. He then immediately said he was going to go to my next session with me (I pay for it and it's under my name) and call out me and my instructor in front of the whole class, even though there's no way to do this without a major disruption. The next session is tomorrow, and I don't know if I should issue this ultimatum when I stop by to pick up my uniform on the way to class or not.\n\nTL;DR: 50 lbs overweight stepdad thinks he knows more about fitness than a Jiu-Jitsu black belt, says he will disrupt a class and embarass me just to prove he's right, I don't know whether I should issue an ultimatum or not",

      "description": "I'm gonna start of by acknowledging that this is super cringe, niche, personal shit but I'm anonymous so who cares. Also this is both a general question and a specific case that went wrong. \n\nI write smut semi professionally. I also do lewd roleplays sometimes to get the creative juices flowing. it's hard to come up with novelty for women by myself. \n\nI rarely go here, but if someone is very enthusiastic about my writing but brings nothing to the table for me, I'll offer to write in exchange for nudes or money. Basically I'll offer to whore myself out if they're not my type. The 'am I the asshole' conflict for me here comes from the fact that: \n\n1. it could be seen as inherently disrespectful to ask for nudes, regardless of services rendered or the context\n\n2. the assumption that a roleplay is worth sexual favors in the first place\n\n3. the fact that it seems like a bait and switch from the persective of the person I don't find interesting. \n\n4. I'm basically saying 'I'm not interested, but...'\n\non the 'I'm not an asshole' side, though: \n\n1. Don't come in here wanting to write about taking a horse cock and then act dignified/self righteous of your own purity when the topic of nudes is broached\n\n2. if you're not interested you're not interested. just say no or ingore me and move on. It's not like my asking cost you anything. \n\n3. some people have gone along with it and it was a lot of fun\n\n4. I woulda ghosted/said no anyway if this wasn't an option\n\nOne person in particular insisted on writing in broken English and cut out as many letters as they could. There was nothing appealing about it at all and I felt as if they were very dumb. I explained the situation and gave them the offer, and they bitched and moaned and argued with me for hours. I engaged out of a pure, frustrated disbelief that someone could be this dumb. \n\nEventually they sent me three (3) broken imgur links that they claimed to be nudes, played dumb as to why they weren't working, tried to nag at me more, and insisted they were too incompetent to use other image hosting sites. I lashed out, told them that they were either genuinely retarded or a really bad lair, and told them to fuck off until i finally blocked them. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Just changed to a new account to maintain anonymity, but over the last week I've considered cutting a close friendship entirely. I (27M) have been close friends with a 23F who has ancestry going back to Greece and has strong left lean in politics, whereas I lean to the right on more subjects than not. For context we're both Australian with my ancestry going back to Ireland.\n\nI have been close friends with this lady for roughly two years and we've grown close, we've even made a pact to get married if neither of us find another partner in the next few years. That being said, we keep growing close and then splitting far apart. To keep it short, we went on a date over a year ago and I took her out to lunch at a Greek food festival. She arrived \\~40mins late and had eaten a heap of pizza at home prior to coming and made herself sick, so she didn't eat anything and spent the date complaining how sick she was.\n\nAnyway, the big event came last week when we went out after work for a drink together and she was showing me her 'Bumble' (online dating) account and saying she could never \"swipe right\" on anyone with conservative views, or anyone who looked \"too Anglo\". Ideally she wants a Greek boy in order to be culturally relatable, but then said \"white people have no culture\" which I personally think is quite harsh to say that neither the Australians or Irish have no culture.\n\nContinuing with that night, she insisted to see my tinder profile and was swiping through on my behalf and came across a German girl and she said \"look, she's one of yours\". I was lost for a second, but then she whispered \"cause she's a nazi\".\n\nPreviously we'd opted to ban talking about politics as she often gets mad when I justify my beliefs, but now and then it's almost like she can't help herself and brings it up anyway.\n\nIn fairness, outside of politics we get along really well, but I feel like in this latest case it appears as though she has no respect for me given I am everything she seemingly dislikes - a white anglo and can't respect that I have different opinions in politics than her. We haven't spoken for a week, but I keep thinking, am I an asshole for considering cutting the friendship for this?",

      "description": "Background: I'm a girl and my friend, who we can call Joe, is a guy. We were best friends in our freshman year of college but drifted apart due to him transferring schools. Since then we hadn't talked in about a year but in November 2018 we got back in touch with each other. \n\nMain story: \nWhen we first started talking again Joe would quadruple+ text when I was busy and sometimes even call me if I did not answer him. I told him this was way too much and it was making me uncomfortable. I enjoyed his friendship enough to be patient for weeks for this habit to die down. Joe told me his OCD, depression, and anxiety cause him to latch onto people and compulsively text/overthink when he doesn't get a text back. Okay, no biggie, it was improving so I didn't think too much of it.\n\nFast forward to mid-January and Joe begins talking to a girl he met on some dating site. He lets it slip that he's been texting her a bunch like he had been doing to me when we first started talking again and even saying things like \"I'm feeling pretty down tonight :( \" when she wouldn't answer him (something that is somewhat manipulative, imo). I tell him he's going to make her uneasy and not want to talk to him anymore. A week later he sends me a screenshot of her basically saying all the things I warned him she would (she's uncomfortable, he's being too intense, advising him to 'chill out' with other women, etc.). He then goes on to blame his mental health issues again and then say things like her saying that makes him feel self-conscious and he feels like hurting himself now. In the moment I was supportive of him...then he told me it had happened before we started talking again with two other girls...then last week it happened again with yet another girl. \n\nTonight I called him out on it and told him that him making girls feel scared and nervous makes me uncomfortable and isn't okay at all. But per usual, it turned into him saying how \"broken\" he is, that the only real way for me to \"get it\" is to have OCD, that his intentions have never been to make them nervous, etc.\n\nI just wasn't having it anymore. I told him his mental health wasn't an excuse to make anyone feel uncomfortable and this behavior needed to change like he had told me before that it would. I said that after one girl told him getting 20 messages in a row and overly pushing to hang out made her uncomfortable it turned from a \"mistake\" to something bigger than that with each girl he did/does it to afterward. He seems to think that I'm overreacting and that him \"really trying\" should be enough for me to not be upset by it. Honestly, I'm at the point where I feel like he's using his mental health as an excuse and I'm not really understanding why it's so hard to not quadruple text a girl when he knows they are busy. \n\nAlthough I'm standing by my stance, I'm starting to wonder if I am the asshole and I should be a bit more sympathetic to his mental health issues.

He then states that he's \"not fucking around\" and \"I'm not your fucking buddy\"\n\nAt this point, I've rang out his transaction without saying anything further besides \"Yes sir.\" As he's leaving, he yells back \"Fucking prick!\"\n\nAm I the asshole for calling someone buddy?

      "description": "I’m in grad school and my husband and I have a 2 y/o baby girl. I was looking for a daytime nanny and figured I would start on my school’s listserv to see if any of the undergrad students would be interested. A 19 y/o student emailed me back and expressed interest. We talked via email over the next few days and decided to set up an informal interview at my apartment. \n\nIt wasn’t until he arrived that I realized it was a boy. I now realize his name is gender neutral but I had only ever heard of girls with the name, and so I just assumed. (I had tried to do some Facebook searches before that but nothing came up). I’ll call this guy Taylor (not his real name). \n\nSo, anyway, I decide that since Taylor came all the way over so I might as well talk to him (I’m still trying to be open minded). He’s very nice and has decent babysitting experience based on the resume he brought. I took his contact information and told him I would call back in a few days after I speak with my husband. \n\nI realized after the interview though that I just don’t think I’m comfortable leaving my baby with a teenage boy. I talked to my husband about the whole thing and he agrees with me. But I still feel bad about it. I understand the sexism at play here and I like to think of myself as a fairly liberal/progressive person. I guess it’s been engrained in me that boys mature more slowly than girls. Maybe there’s some stereotypical thinking about women as caretakers in there too, I don’t know. \n\nI guess part of it might also stem from my childhood. I have two siblings that are several years older than I am. I just remember growing up my mom would let my sister watch me but not my brother. Even though my brother was the older one, I never questioned this. No one did. \n\nAnyway, I usually call my mom with stuff like this, but we’re so much alike that we just end up agreeing with what the other says. So outside opinions would be nice. ",

      "description": "This happened to me a couple months ago but it's been stuck in my head ever since and I need to get some outside opinions. I was at a bar for happy hour and I was playing pool with my gf and a couple friends. We were down to the 8-ball and as I went to go take the last shot I noticed a group of people sitting/standing in the way so I couldn't really hit the cue ball. I politely asked them to move and they all did... except for one. He just flat out said no. Now I've only been playing pool in bars for 3-4 years but I've still never had someone just flat out refuse to move for a shot like that so I was a little shocked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe argued for a couple minutes before I finally decided to just take the shot. I had to basically stick my ass in his lap to make the shot, I'm not sure why he was cool with that but whatever. I made the shot, gave him a dirty look and then returned to my friends. A little while later we decided to get to my friends house party. We get there, go down to the basement to get some beer out of the keg and then see a couple people playing Beer Die. For those of you who don't know what Beer Die is, it is a drinking game that involved a coffee table, two teams of 2 players and a single dice or \"die\" that is thrown back and forth. I'm not gonna describe the whole game but the important part is there are 4 chairs placed at the corners of the table and it is required to sit in them to throw the die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGF and I decide to get next game so after a couple minutes or so we sit down and start playing. About half way through the game she runs out of beer so she gets up to get some more from the keg. I'm talking to the guys across the table from me and someone sits down in her seat without me noticing. I turn around and to my surprise its the SAME fucking dude from the bar! I was beyond shocked at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him to move because he took my GF's seat and we are playing a game that requires sitting down. He refuses, doesn't really give a reason but just keeps saying no and generally being an annoying prick about it. Now I'm not a very confrontational person. I know that's pretty cliche to say about these situations but I'd never been in a fight before this and I'd only ever lost my cool twice in my life. Both of which just led to verbal arguments. GF comes back and says its okay and just asks him to scoot back a bit so she can sit on the ground. For some reason this made me even more livid. He was just going to let her sit on the ground! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not a very big guy but this kid wasn't either. If anything he was a fair bit smaller than I was so idk why he seemed to pushing me like this. I told him to move one last time and after he refused, I grabbed the arm of the chair and lifted it straight up so the two legs on the right side of the chair were off the ground which caused the chair to tip over and him to fall out of it. Immediately my GF exclaimed \"OMG he didn't mean to do that, that was an accident\" and in my anger fueled state I yelled \"Yes I did!\" He gets up and pushes me hard and I just blacked out. Next thing I know one of his friends has me around the shoulder's and is pull me off of him. Apparently I grabbed him by the throat and pinned him up against the wall. He was lucky his friend pulled me off of him before I could do any real damage. I was lucky his friend was fine with just pulling me off of him and didn't decide to beat me to a pulp because that dude was a big motherfucker. Also I don't know many people at this party as it is my GF's friends house so I'm also lucky I didn't get jumped by a bunch of people this guy was friends with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGF and her friend escort me outside all the while I'm yelling at this kid \"That was twice tn! You fucked with me twice!\" everyone probably thought I was nuts and I can't really blame them. My shirt favorite shirt had been ripped right down the middle, I was breathing heavily and probably had a crazy look in my eye. I go outside to calm down and then we go up to the owner of the house's room to cool off. He hears about it and sends some guys downstairs to kick them out. I let it ruin my whole night because I just couldn't comprehend what would make someone be that much of a dick and it almost seemed like he was targeting me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat pretty much sums it up. I could probably expand on it a little more if anyone has questions. Before anyone asks I had gotten to happy hour pretty late so I only had 2 drinks there and I had about half a cup of beer at the house party so I don't think alcohol had much of an effect. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; Random guy refuses to move at bar while I try to take pool shot, then follows me to a house party and steals my gf's seat while playing Beer Die causing me to lose my cool and get into a fight with him.",

We started dating around summer break, then he figured out on his own we wouldn’t work together because “he was too independent”, that he wasn’t as free essentially and the last time we spoke he went on about how happy he was without me. I don’t regret the time we spent together but he told me i’m his biggest regret, and he told me i could call him anytime. But i was a little upset over hearing that i was a weight during the last month we were together, so i told him to never contact me again and that it would be good if he just went away.\n\nI regret it so bad, it has been four months since the breakup and it’s been one months since we last spoke, i feel so pathetic for still wanting him back. He rejected me because he thought i was needy, i was just compensating for the distance. I feel like i’ll never get over this, i want someone that will never leave even if it’s difficult but i still want that someone to be him.\n\nI don’t want to loose my pride again, i’ve begged for him back once and he laughed because i didn’t understand him. Why did i have to fall so hard in the first place? He was the one that wanted me so bad anyways, i was planning to keep dating if he didn’t ask. I know he uses reddit as well and i just hope he sees this and speaks with me, i feel the lowest i’ve ever felt and i don’t know what to do anymore. It’s not fair, i gave my everything into making it work, i know that people come back around if they really want to be in your life but i’ve closed all of those doors out of anger now and i know we don’t have a chance back.\n\nIt was only a two month relationship and i don’t feel i ever did something wrong, hell i even wanted for my space getting back to school. I only wanted one relationship in my life and be done, get married and travel the world. That’s all i’ve ever wanted and i fucked everything up.",

      "description": "TL;DR: My friend is in an MLM (multi-level marketing) and she feels I belittled her job. She’s called me crazy and I called her out for gaslighting me. Now we’re not talking to each other. Am I the only asshole here for belittling her job and then ghosting her?\n\nSome background (sorry if this post is overly long): I’ve already clearly told her I didn’t want any part of her MLM. I finally gave in and told her I would just do the bare minimum and send strangers her way, but not anyone I know. I told her I wouldn’t tell them anything about the MLM either, because it makes me uncomfortable. She’s well aware (or at least I thought) that her job makes me uncomfortable in terms of what she asks me to do/buy/sell and that I already feel like an asshole just for sending unsuspecting strangers her way. This argument would’ve been avoided if I had just stuck with a hard “no” and never sent her anyone, but here we are.\n\nThis friend was talking to me about going to public events to sell her MLM and brainstorming ways for me to help her get customers. She told me that as part of her pitch to random people at auctions, markets, etc. that she wanted me to say she had a business just like the shop-owners/auctioneers had, and if they could check it out. I refused saying that’s not true as the businesses she mentioned are not pyramid schemes. \n\nCue the long arguments about “why would I say that” and “it’s not really a pyramid scheme and no one knows what a pyramid scheme really is” and “if it is, what I do isn’t illegal” and why I can’t just “not mention that” and “it’s not for you why do you care” and blah blah blah. If the details of the argument are relevant I’ll include it, but it lasted a long time. Finally she says she wants to end the argument, and we agree to just not talk about it from now on. \n\nJust after agreeing to that, she adds that I’m being crazy and irrational anyways and that she’ll know in the future I just can’t deal with her job. I basically tell her she’s gaslighting me and she says I make her feel dumb because she doesn’t know what “gaslighting” means. She keeps calling me crazy and asking how she she can “win against gaslighting.” And I just tell her for starters, to not call me crazy. She calls me crazy and to just drop it; and sends me a cute kitten video to show she’s moved on. I ghost her after this video (which I already know also makes me an asshole since I didn’t  call or tell her to her face I was done with her as a friend).\n\nThe reason I decided to post this is I showed this argument to my other friends and they called me the only asshole here for attacking someone’s job and then ghosting them, because they say a person’s job should be respected no matter what. They asked me how I would feel as a teacher if someone told me I didn’t know something about social justice (even though I teach Math); it’s the same thing I did to her. They say I should apologize to her for being crazy, and make up with her. \n\nAre they right? Am I the only asshole here?",

Since I am not afraid to say what pisses me off in someones face instead of behind their back, like many people in school seem to do, I don't have many friends but the ones I do have are very good friends. Except that one guy, who is coincidentally also my longest friend. \n\nHe and I went through some shit, and he is probably the only guy that ever saw me cry, so he has been pretty close to me. And even if people that had a problem with me tried to talk him out of his friendship with me, we always ended up doing shit together again in the end, which I appreciate. However, in the last one and a half years, he started being the most unreliable person I know. If we have something planned he is often just cancelling in the last minute, or he doesn't remember agreeing to drive somebody, or he suddenly doesn't want to go somewhere because he'd rather play videogames. We still did stuff together, but half the time it was a huge effort to get to do stuff with him because of that. Since he is avoiding stress and anything that pressures him at all cost (a quality that I do not have) I thought it was just something I had to live with, and it was never so bad that I had a serious problem with it. \n\nUntil last summer. We go to Gamescom (A huge gaming convention) every year, and since he has a car and I don't I already asked him last winter if we could drive together. He agreed, we both had tickets, and things were good. Until Gamescom actually came, that is. He got a girlfriend about 3 weeks prior, and I even encouraged him to talk about his feelings with her since he is kind of a shy dude and didn't have a relationship with someone who actually treated him decent before, and I knew the girl was going to be good to him because she was very friendly and nice. So they got together, and two weeks before gamescom I overhear that he is at her place (which is quite far away from where we live) over the gamescom days. So I asked him about us driving there together since I kinda relied on him due to the trains having fucked up schedules because of some building sites. I was very mad, and I told him I was mad and cursed and insulted him a bit and whatnot, but I came to forgive him after a few days. I had to leave the convention about 2 hours earlier than I usually would so my train connections work out for me, but that was it. We met up there every day and had fun together as usual. Then he just went back to being the usual kind of unreliable and didn't fuck me over in a bigger way, until this winter.\n\nMy grandmother got sent to a hospital because her bowels had an inflammation that was spreading through her intestines, and since my grandmother and my grandfather are like parents to me (had an abusive mother, live with my grandparents yadda yadda) I visited her there at least once a week. I would have gone every day, but this is my last school year and I had 2-3 exams per week while she was in hospital so I had to learn a lot for that and couldn't spend too much time away. My friend knew this. When my grandmother got out of the hospital my grandfather and me still had to take care of her a lot since she now has an artifical outlet for her bowel and her body had to adapt to it. She could barely move, and she got sick in the hospital and had a very bad cough and a lot of headaches. My grandmother is trying to downplay things like that though, so we had to make sure she actually takes care of herself and drinks enough and so on. That also caused me to actually miss a few lessons in school, so my friend had to know about that too. \n\nFinally to the point: Our class needs to raise money for our graduation (since we need a place to get our certificates and celebrate with the teachers and so on), and one of the ways they allowed us to raise money was by baking cookies and selling them. I asked said friend if he wanted to bake cookies with me, since his family has all kinds of fancy equipment and due to my relationship with my mother I actually never baked cookies in any time of my life I could remember. He said yes, and we both thought it would be a lot of fun since I basically make cookies for the first time with a very good friend. The person organising the selling of the cookies told me that shortbread is selling extremely well, so I said we could make that since it would be simple enough. My friend has a grinder you can use for shortbread. So he sent me a recipe to use, I said I'd make some dough. Since there was so much going on between me, my grandmother, school and now this I told my friend that I would have time either on saturday or on monday the week we were going to bake, and if he is okay with me not being sure when I can bake yet. He didn't say that he'd mind, and someone from my class asked me if I could help them with maths on saturday, so I told my friend (on the friday) that I am baking with him on monday. \n\nMonday, after school, I ask him if he takes the grinder to my place with his car and we bake at my place, or if he comes to get me and the dough and we bake at his place. I'd be good to get home with the bus if I can leave the bowl I had it in at his. He tells me THEN that he is sick. I promised that we were going to sell them on the tuesday though, so we had to bake that day, and I didn't have the stuff to make the cookies. I was upset and asked why he couldn't tell me earlier, quickly calmed down and apologised (albeit still being grumpy) because if he is laying with a fever in bed, it's not his fault. Right? So he reads my apology and doesn't respond. A few minutes later I remember he said he'd bake a few cookies with his mom on saturday. So I ask if I should go to his place and collect his cookies before school, so I can sell them for him. He then responds very confused and asks if he isn't welcome to selling them anymore. I tell him that I thought he was sick, and that we have to sell them tomorrow, to which he says that he will be in school tomorrow and that he will sell them himself, he isn't feeling that bad and will be there, he is \"just still sick from the weekend\". So not only did he have time to tell me THE ENTIRE WEEKEND, he also just kinda said he was sick because he didn't wanna do shit. He was also playing videogames until late at night, I checked his discord where he was chatting with people in voicechat. \n\nI then asked basically everyone else I know if they had stuff to make shortbread, two guys helped me out but we didn't have a grinder, only a bag for softer dough, so stuff got complicated and I wasn't home before 2 am, couldn't be there for my grandma and couldn't learn for any exams that day. I told my \"friend\", yelled at him a bit since I was super mad, but he didn't even talk about that anymore or say he was sorry at all. He didn't say anything to me since, and we haven't spoken in a month now, but I don't want to forgive him again because he just keeps wasting my time even when I really need time. Am I the asshole for being angry and not doing anything now?\n\nTL;DR:\n5-year-Friend of mine makes promises, then finds excuses to not keep them, essentially fucking me over, it's especially bad in the past one and a half years and he fucked up extra hard one month ago, essentially robbing me of one entire days time and more than 3 hours of sleep that night because he was lazy, during a time in which I needed to be there for my bedridden grandmother and learn for crucial exams. I got really mad and unfriendly as a response to that, none of us have apologised for anything, we haven't spoken for a month. Am I the asshole for not doing anything now?",

      "description": "DH knows I love Valentine's Day. But I don't have super high expectations. I just want a little love and acknowledgement. However, he has been exceptionally stressed and busy with work related things lately. I was worried he didn't even know VDay was coming up so I reminded him a few days ago. I told him we didn't have to go out to dinner or do anything extravagant but maybe we could just spend some time together. I even offered to run errands with him that day just so we could do *something* together. He said sure, but then this morning he left to go to work. (He told me the other day that he had today off, which is why we were gonna run errands together.)\n\nI texted him Happy Valentine's Day and asked if there was anything I could do around the house today for him. He said, \"No, why?\" (Didn't wish me a happy V-Day back) I responded by reminding him that it was Valentine's Day, and that I thought we were going to spend time together. I thought that if I could take some things off of his plate, he wouldn't be so stressed when we did something together. He told me he didn't want to do anything, that he had too much work to do and he was way too stressed to give me his undivided attention. I told him I understood, but that if he wanted to buy me some chocolates or a card, that would make me very happy. He replied with \"Haha maybe.\"\n\nHe should be home in about an hour or so. And to be honest, I'll be really hurt if he doesn't make any sort of effort. He knows how much I love Valentine's Day. But I also know how stressed he is and I want to be accommodating. The thing is, he's been so stressed out due to work for months now. It's been hard on both of us. \n\nAITA for being disappointed?",

      "description": "I have a platonic friend at work, lets call her Pam, we are both married and don't have any romantic feelings for each other. I say that upfront, because I know how it may look like.\n\nWe don't work in the same department, but still had to work together for quite a while. Think of it like a big project for multiple years. I am very introverted and don't easily connect with a lot of people, but we became kinda close and spent a lot of breaks together, like eating breakfast daily, lunch most of the time and just the usual coffee breaks. We never met or meet outside of work.\n\nAfter the project ended we moved to different positions and different locations inside the company. It's a 10 minute walk if we want to meet now, combined with new responsibilities it was of course impossible to meet as regularly as we were used to. But we found a weekly slot where we could meet and have lunch together, take a walk together or just sit somewhere to talk, we even had a recurring meeting in Outlook to block that slot for us (that part is important I think). I was happy that we at least found that small little slot, because how I said: I don't easily connect with people at work and was happy to found a good work friend who I can openly talk to.\n\nThis worked for a few weeks, then another co-worker (Bob), who also worked for for that project but left the company after it was done, announced (via a telegram group chat that a few people including me and her were part of) that he will be in the area and asked if someone wants to have lunch. Of course it was exactly the day and time where we had our recurring meeting. Pam immediately said yes, as did another co-worker of the group. She then even asked me privately if I would join, too, but already said that I probably won't. Which is correct, I never was the biggest fan of Bob and not a fan of group activities in general. I knew that we couldn't talk, because main topic obviously would be the new job of Bob and the new position of Pam or the other co-worker. Things I either already knew or that I don't care about.\n\nI was very pissed. She didn't ask if we could move or cancle our meeting, she just agreed to have lunch with Bob. She couldn't really understand why I was so angry, for her it was just normal to skip it for someone who isn't at the location that often anymore. For me it was just very disrespectful and also hurt my feelings. After that I just canceled the recurring meeting, which she didn't even comment on and we wouldn't meet for a few weeks after that.",

      "description": "I was in my local shop and as I was walking out, an older lady (with a walking stick) was walking in. Now general courtesy in the UK is to give way to the person exiting a building however in this instance I broke convention and made some room for the older lady to get past. As I stopped and allowed her to pass, a middle-aged woman started walking in the gap I created (with in my opinion, full visibility of the older lady) and I said \"Just wait there, let this lady come through\". In my opinion her body language suggested she was going to try and squeeze through but I wanted to make sure the older lady got in the shop safely\n\nThe old lady went past, I then motioned for the middle aged woman to pass and I thought okay get on with my day. \n\nShe then turned around a bit annoyed and said \"I was going to let her pass\". So I was then flustered and apologized and it was intensely awkward and I feel like I may have made her day bad when I was trying to do good thing \n\nAm I the arsehole here?

      "description": "I live with my boyfriend and our pets, sometimes I get home and I really dont want to cook and sometimes I'm not even that hungry. Ive been cooking predominantly for about a year and although he does help and cooks every so often, the problem is if I decide not to cook one day he wont make himself food and just become upset and fall asleep upset and hungry. I feel guilty about this and sometimes just give in and make food. \n\n It's just that sometimes I just really really dont want to cook or eat and if he's in the house all day when I get from work he will often tell me he hasnt eaten anything all day so now I either cook or feel like an absolute asshole. Its not like theres no food, theres just no quick snacks most of the time. \n\n\nAny more info needed just ask but i wont give any personal info obviously just topic related.

      "description": "I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost seven years now, and we’re getting to the point of marriage.\n\nLast week, my boyfriend and I had dinner over at my mom’s and stepdad’s house. We always have a bit of wine during dinner, so it’s not unusual for our conversations to get... unusual.\n\nThat night, my mom said something to the effect of “well it’s been 7 years, at this point it’s kinda a given that marriage will happen” and I agreed with her. I’ve talked with my boyfriend about marriage before and we see it in the future, but haven’t acted yet since we’re young and broke (I’m 26, he’s 29)\n\nMy mom and I got carried away with talking about what kind of wedding that I wanted, and I just wanted to establish with her that it would be small. I mentioned that I had thought of doing a destination wedding.\n\nAt this point, my boyfriend’s tone changed. He went cold and snapped “we didn’t discuss this. We didn’t discuss a destination wedding. I don’t want to be having this conversation”. Mood changed. We stopped talking about marriage.\n\nOn the way home, I asked him why he changed so sudden. He said that my mom had made snarky remarks that annoyed him, and that he didn’t want to “plan our wedding” at the dinner table. I didn’t catch any of the remarks he was referring to, and I just thought it was light conversation- we weren’t making any plans.\n\nFast forward to today. My stepdad pulls me aside and says that he was “stunned” at the way my boyfriend reacted in that conversation. I told him that my boyfriend expresses that he was uncomfortable “planning” the wedding at dinner. My stepdad also agrees that it was light conversation and wasn’t anything serious. He then says that when he first (and second) got married, that he was over the moon with joy and that he would expect a positive response from my boyfriend. He thought the cold change in tone was a red flag.\n\nNow, I believe that we are going to get married one day and that my boyfriend truly wants that- but I can see why my parents would find his reaction as a concern.\n\nI come home from work and decide to talk to my boyfriend. I told him that my parents are concerned about his reaction, and that I believe their concern is reasonable. I just think they’re being parents.\n\nHe is angry. He starts raising his voice and I told him not to channel his frustration towards me, and he agrees but then says part of the frustration is because I understand my parents point. He says I don’t “have his back” and that they’re making judgements of him. I empathize with him and tell him I get where he’s coming from, but that from my parents perspective- I can see why they’d raise a concern. He says he feels backed into a corner and that I’m not trusting in him that he wants to marry me.\n\nNow he’s locked in the bedroom, refusing to talk to me. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "(Wasn't sure if this was meant to go in r/relationship_advice. I don't think so but if So, sorry, it's my first time lmao.)\n\nOkay. So, compared to most of you here. I'm younger. To the point where I'm not even in college etcetera. So I'm still at the point where adults look down on me/tease me and whatnot.\n\nNow I know for a fact that I don't know everything and whatever. And I do respect adults, I promise.\n\nHowever, I'm just going to get into the story. My Mother has a friend who enjoys making comments about my love life. Asking if I have boyfriend yet and commenting about how, seeing as I've never had a boyfriend, I'm sure to get one soon or I'm seeing someone behind my parents backs. Now, I get this is all harmless joking, but it really makes me uncomfortable. See, I'm gay. My Mother and a few of my close friends know this. I don't enjoy this teasing because a lot of the time I just want to tell my mother's friend, no. I won't and don't have a boyfriend because I'm not into guys. It just really gets under my skin and I can't help thinking I'm being dramatic.\n\nNow, the other day, I came downstairs on my phone, my mother's friend spoke up and said \"See, ____ is always texting her boyfriend.\" With a short laugh. Normally I'd just ignore this, but I couldn't, I paused and moved to speak to the woman. I told her simply that it would be nice if she stopped mentioning my love life all the time because it made me uncomfortable for reasons I don't want to discuss.\n\nShe didn't take it all too well and seemed to nod understandingly, but then continued to side eye me and shit that honestly I thought was a little immature.\n\nMy mother pulled me to the side and told me that I was being an asshole. That her friend was only having some fun with teasing me and that id dampened the mood for everyone. At the time I thought I was totally not in the wrong. This woman was making an uncomfortable and my mother knew why. It would've made more sense for her to politely tell her friend to be quiet. Especially as I had expressed my discomfort to my mother on one occasion.\n\nBut I've been thinking and I can't help feeling bad. It's not like the woman knew and she is all round a very jolly person, I'd describe her as having a 'heart of a child'\nAnd thinking back I can't help but worry that I snapped and spoke a little harshly. Idk. My mum isn't impressed with me and I'm not impressed with myself either. Like I said, she didn't know of my discomfort and it's not like the trading was doing any harm.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hi everyone! Long time lurker, first time posting. \n\nMy husband and I (38M, 31F) have a seemingly perfect relationship outside of typical work/children stressors. We've been together and married for approximately 4.5 years after waiting only a few months to get married. We communicate often, and well.  We trust each other, completely. Any time an ex might slide into DM's for any reason, it's brought forward. \n\nI admittedly read A LOT of r/relationship_advice. Idk why, really. Call it a guilty pleasure. I get tired of the typical mundane droll that is FB, IG, etc, so I often turn to Reddit for something more stimulating.\n\nTo get to the point, I started to see a pattern in the last several days on RA where the OP's cite that their significant other was cheating after several years (lets say 6+) of supposed monogamy, and they claimed to have not known their were any issues in their relationship that would have caused the SO to act out in that way. \n\nThis, in turn, prompted me to shoot my hubs a text to \"check the oil\" on our marriage, as it were. We had a baby a few months ago, (my first, his third- we have custody of his other two) and we've been adjusting to the changes, of course. I asked him if there was anything he needed, or was lacking from me, whether it be doing more around the house, doing more things with him, or yes, even physical aspects of our relationship. This lead to him saying no, he's good (to paraphrase) and then make jokes about more sexual acts, of which I will spare you.\n\nOkay, cool. \n\nI pick up the baby from my mom's, and am on the way home when I realize that, heyyyy, he never asked me if I was good. He answered my question with \"nope, we're good, more sex.\" And went about his way. So I point this out, and he replies with \"oh, so we're fighting today. LoL jk jk.\" \n\nWe talked it out once I got home, and he claims to have been planning to have a sincere conversation about it once all of the kids were in bed for the night. Maybe true, maybe just something an inconsiderate husband might say to cover his ass. \n\nAITA for being miffed about the fact that he was seemingly unconcerned about my feelings until I pointed it out?

I let him and he sees a picture of me in my bra (not a huge deal to me) but since then he obviously had  a huge crush on me and I was not interested. So since I'm too awkward to confront him I just kinda made myself a brick wall to talk to whenever he tried to talk to me. He doesnt pick up on the clues.\n\nSo flash forward to yesterday night. He text me via snapchat and tries to make conversation then he post on his story \"pick a number and I'll send you a question  that you have to answer honestly warning not for kids\" kinda posts and he tells me to do what was on his story I tell him \"I dont want to I like to keep things G rated\". So he replies \"oh your so boring\". I tell him \"sorry but I don't want to\"   he then repeatedly sends \"boring\" and I figured he was gonna continue spamming me till I agree. So I tell him to \"leave me alone\" and he replied \"wow really okay I was just joking around\"  that's when I lost and told him how I really felt about him and the real reason his girlfriend dumped him then I blocked him before he could respond.

      "description": "AITA? So during Autumn 2018, my best friend (let’s call her S) of about 3 years started being distant, very distant. I chalked that up to her working hard due to upcoming exams and while I didn’t like it, I sucked up my pride and let it be.\n\nA few months later, after a couple of instances of my complaining by beating around the bush and trying to be nice, I was really struggling with her distantness, so at the start of this month I sent her a VERY long message laying out exactly how I felt (short version is, she wasn’t talking to me and when she did she didn’t have her heart in it, and was just generally very distant to an, imo, unnecessary level) and she instantly agreed she was being distant and promised to try harder.\n\nThat would be the end of it? Nope. Fast forward a week, I was still coming to terms with the fact she was improving and learning to trust she will talk to me eventually and one evening she was active on Facebook but not responding to my messages so I panicked and sent a desperate message for her attention. She naturally got annoyed and the next day she told me I needed to trust her more.\n\nSo a few weeks go on up to tonight where things are going fine, she’s still being a little bit distant but she has exams coming up so fair enough, nothing to worry about. But then we have a short conversation over Facebook two days ago about Easter holidays, then nothing. I sent her a message asking about an event over the summer then a meme. A few hours later I could see she had been active and I started to go into panic mode but I didn’t say anything. Then she was active again in the evening and that’s when I truly panicked. I sent her a message generally saying “I know you have exams coming up but I think it’s reasonable that you reply when you have the chance” (implying, like now).\n\nWriting all this out I feel like this might be more clear cut than I realise but I’d like to hear it from another person.

      "description": "Look, before you click the title and type YTA, let me state my case.\n\nI'm an Northern Irish guy living and working with my girlfriend in England and while we have a nice house and a dog, the neighbours kids are terrorising us and getting their parents to threaten us when we don't bow to their every whim.\n\nOver the past year, the kids in the estate kick a ball against our high wooden fence nearly everyday, the noise it makes is annoying but we can live with it. However, sometimes the children kick the ball over the fence and come knock on our door to get the ball back, again it doesn't bother us too much.\n\nRecently however, the kids have been kicking the ball over numerous times in the day and I work hard 9-5 so surely it's understandable that sometimes I couldn't care less about the ball, especially when the kids are rude to me and swearing at me when I give it back to them. So one day after retrieving the ball 5 seperate times and witnessing one kid attempt to climb my fence and get into my garden, I issue an ultimatum, if the ball lands in my garden again then I'm keeping it til the following day and then they can get it back.\n\nThe kids went and told their parents that we took their ball and won't give it back so here comes two parents knocking on our door yelling at us to give their ball back. Me and my gf protest saying they are damaging our fence, being rude to us and we insist that we are being reasonable qbut the parents keep saying the same thing \"give them their ball back now\", except more and more forcefully each time.\n\nSo what am I meant to do? Live my life as the defacto ball boy of the estate, eternally returning the balls back to their selfish, demanding owners under coercion by their parents?\n\nNow I should preface this next bit by saying that I'm aware that my next actions could make me an asshole and I would normally agree, however, I would argue that I'm not THE asshole in this situation.\n\nAfter having some kids dad come to my door and square up to me, I had enough, clearly noone bar us are interested in having a reasonable conversation about playing with a ball in the middle of a busy road (when there are 2 perfectly good parks 1 min down the street) or respecting other people's space so when the ball came over the fence last, I grabbed my sharpest kitchen knife and sank it into the football so to emulate a nail puncture. I step on the ball and squeeze a load of air out with my foot and then throw it back over the fence, making a much harder thud when it hits the ground \n\nNow I know this is petty and immature but I've had enough of acting as a surrogate parent to these whinging little shits and I feel someone should at least teach them that actions have consequences, especially if their own parents couldn't GAF.",

      "description": "Me and my friends went out drinking and were having a great time. We are all great friends and have no drama between us and they know, that I tend to get a bit emotional, especially when I'm drunk. \n\nWe went to a pub before going to a club, that has a cheaper entrance fee when we get there early, so we wanted to get out of the pub quickly. I checked my phone and my mood took a nosedive, when I found out that I hadn't been nominated into a contest, that I had put months and months of work into. I showed the results to my friends and they didn't really get it and didn't really react as well. Drunk and emotional as I was, I grabbed a bottle of liquor and headed to the bathroom where I broke down and started crying over every shitty thing that has happened recently. One friend came to knock on the door to ask what I was up to and I said I was just taking a dump and they left me alone for some time. \n\nI started to simmer down and slowly pull myself together, when suddenly all my friends started to flicker the lights on and off behind the door and started furiously knocking the door, which made me get pissed off again and without me noticing, one of my friends had pried the lock open using their keys and there I was -  red eyes, exposed - \"yeah, sure you are taking a shit, we can see\" (sarcastically one of them said). They all laughed and I just ran away out the door to a remote place, where they couldn't catch or talk to me. They tried calling me, but I didn't answer. I even turned the phone off and took a taxi home and that was that.\n\nMorning after, they asked where I went and so I told them everything to which they responded that \"I was just stupid and drunk and decided it would be good that I shouldn't be depressed and alone in that stall and that we all could have a fun time.\"\n\nSo, AITA?",

So I’m not alone in doing the things I like to do, such as try new restaurants, bar hopping, or going to places like a movie or putt-putt. I’m not ready for dating with strings attached. And I’m not looking into one-night stands or booty calls. \n\nBasically I just want platonic dates who will be my company at restaurants, parks, and activities. \n\nI brought the idea up to a friend (he’s my only friend, he’s in a wheelchair, and a picky eater, so he isn’t exactly up for the task) and I was told not only is it a bad idea, but it would make me an asshole who uses people for my own greed. Honestly, much different is that from casual sex? I just want someone to share the experience with. Someone to talk to. Someone to relate with. Since I don’t have a girlfriend, nor do I want one at the moment, I just want a platonic individual who will go out to eat with me, maybe do shit together in places where a single adult male would come off as creepy, and end it there. Who knows. If we hit it off, they could be my designated “FWB”. ",

After sharing my encounters with S (S has called other users Trash, has said we have down syndrome, and even pulled the Suicide card). Their fans just started calling me a hater of S, they have called me *Hated user in the community*'s alt, and the thread was locked due to harassment and Witch hunting (Where 90% of their comments were removed)\n\nSo fast forward 2 weeks and basically most of them have just been commenting on all of my posts calling me trash. But when they comment something (That counters something they said like 10 hours ago). I call them out on it, and they just go into harass\nmode.\n\nNow I will admit I am poking them with a stick at times. But thats only because of constant harassment (well... what looks like harassment to me). And Bullshit they have posted. Im also not the only person to get this treatment\n\nAlso, what I said at the start kinda contractions itself because of my own perspective, but its really getting me.\n\nSo what im asking is.

I was opening the mail and got this letter today\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/yOlHLXo\n\nI was kind of outraged that they sent a letter out almost shaming those that didn't contribute to the church. To me the letter read that he was disappointed in those that gave nothing financially to the church. That just doesn't sit well in my book and the more I stewed on it the more frustrated I got. I ended up calling and essentially saying that those that contributed nothing or little should not be shamed with a number game sent in the mail. If anything you should be sending a letter to those that contributed nothing letting them know that the church has resources available and that they will always be welcomed to contribute spiritually. He sounded shocked and said finances are a huge part of the church. I kind of went off at that point and said I would be switching memberships. Anyhow I feel like an asshole for taking this to the extreme with them.\n",

Its a 5 minute walk to the shop and I left 12 minutes before the shop closed.\n\nBefore I continue; I work for a startup and required hours can vary, if things need to be done then they've gotta be done, especially if it's some sort of emergency, so tonight I worked almost 5 hours (unpaid) overtime and when I finished fancied a drink, only the pubs were closing soon so I might only get one in before I have to o to home, so went to the shop. \n\nI get to the shop, and as I'm about to open the door the owner (at least I think he's the owner, he's there the majority of the time) opens the door, about to walk out. I smile, say hi and walk in just after he comes out. I believe he also smiles to seemingly acknowledge me (with me being a regular to the shop, we always say hi, how are you, the usual formalities etc.). Now just as I'm walking in he says (in a very annoyed tone - he's usually super friendly) \"cmon man, I'm shutting it down now, be quick\". I look at the clock on the shop, thinking I must've made a mistake, I am going to (and always do) spend a couple of minutes here, if that because I know where everything is in that shop like the back of my hand and he also must know that - however the clock on the wall says 10:35, 5 minutes past closing... I apologise, take a few beers to the till and pay, he doesn't seem happy at all, the most annoyed I've seen him in 3 years of going to the shop and I now feel bad.\n\nWhen I get home however I check the clock on my phone (which I know is accurate) says it's 10:32. Meaning I must've left at 10:27, latest (I had a cigarette on the way home so walked slower than I normally would and took a minute or so to finish it before I opened the front door and came in).\n\nI don't really like any confrontation, am always as polite as I can be and hate to annoy/be a pain in the ass for anyone else. So, AITA here? Should I have not turned up at the shop 5-8 minutes before the shop closed and just gone without tonight, knowing I would only take a minute or two at most? Or do you think he was maybe just having a shitty day? ",

My brother was a huge asshole to me because when i eas born (im the younger sibling) my mom started absuing my brother and gave me all her love. This didnt last however.\n\n Fastforward a bit and my uncle mailed my mom and ccd me and my brither in the email requesting a neet up so he can help. I was the only one who replied. I was going to meet him and my mother said she would call the police on my uncle for kidnapping me and trying to rape me. I ignored her and met with my uncle for the first time in 5 years. I was shaking, skinny, pale and frail we talked about my life and how he was going to help etc. Once i returned home i begged him to take me in so i can escape my mother. He ultimately agreed and this was the best year of my life! \n\nMy mother has messaged me for one and half years now and i ignored her and never replied. She always sends me texts saying how sorry she is and how much she loves me etc but i dont care... \n\nMy brother is being ignored because he wouldnt give his condolences to my dad (i live with him now) after his child died with his new with and told me he would never speak with him again (he believes hes the devil bc my mom made him out to be fabricating lies and such) after he told me to leave him alone for my \"piece of mind\" i was shaking and felt i had to puke and never thought of msging him again. \n\nMy family wants me to reply because they are family. But they are human trash in my eyes and never want to speak with them again. \n\nAm i the asshole?",

      "description": "Hi guys,\n\nBefore I start telling you my situation I want to tell you my relationship with my parents:\n\nMy parents are beautiful people and they really love me. I think that's why I worry so much and why they behave like they do. They were really strict in most of educational things (likes not allowing me to go out as i want until i was around 19) This has changed recently but i think it is correlated to me wanting to move out.\n\nThe situation: \n\nI recently got my Bachelors and want to further study for my Master. My house is about 35 miles from where i live. So the idea was to move out. That's what i did. I live in my universities city now. The problem: When i moved in, my parents told me that they wanted the key to the appartment. (FYI I am financing everything by myself by working beside my studies) My father jokingly said he might be there at any moment without me expecting it. When he said that i said no, you need to tell me before you come to my house each time. His reaction was like \"we'll see\". \n\nPart of why I wanted to move out was also to not have to handle all the family stress and living freely as I want. If they have a key and come to my house as they please I will never feel comfortable. Imagine me going at it with my girlfriend and they come for a random visit. \n\nSo the thing I worked out was to give them a fake key, and give the real second key to a friend. When they come to me without telling me I will yell at them why they would do such a thing, so they will never do it again. Also I will tell them that I lost the original key and got a new keyhole. \n\nI could also tell you the truth, but that would only lead to arguments and questions of confidence, which I do not necessarily want to answer. I want to do all this without disappointing them, because they have always been good parents to me. I love them, but they don't understand that I am slowly growing up. \n\n\nAITA for lying to them?\n\n",

      "description": "I moved in with my bf in January.  Before then I honestly didn't notice his strange habit of constantly being in just his underwear at his place.  Since moving in though, it's become an issue for me.  \n\nAs soon as he gets home from work he will take a shower, put on some briefs and stay in them until it's time for him to get ready for work the next day.  On weekends he will also stay next to naked unless we have company or are going out.  It just makes me uncomfortable being dressed with him constantly wearing next to nothing.\n\nI've made some jokey comments before last night and he never picked up on the hint.  So last night I discussed it in earnest with him.  I told him that I know he likes to be extra comfy after work, but it makes me feel uncomfortable and suggested he start wearing sweat pants and a t-shirt.  He said it's not as comfortable and also made a backhanded comment about how warm I keep the house (which is a whole other issue we've been having since moving in).\n\nWe kept talking about it and he basically just laughed at me and told me I was being ridiculous.  No likes getting laughed at so I got a little heated and then he did as well.  He told me that if he wanted to walk around in his underwear in \"HIS\" house then that's what he's going to do.  Ever since moving in it's felt like our house and him saying that has totally ruined that feeling for me.\n\nI get that he wants to be comfortable, but is it really too much to ask for him to switch to sweats and a t so that I feel comfortable as well?",

      "description": "So my group of friends (6 guys ~22-23y/o) has this 2 y/o tradition where we go to Boston for St. Patrick’s day and stay for the weekend, this year being the third time. We always go with the 6 of us and anyone’s gf. My best friend has been dating this one girl for about 8 months now and of course wanted to bring her along. Myself and one other in the group planned to bring their gf as well. So four weeks prior to st.Patrick’s day we’ve finalized the guest list (9 people) and reserved everything (bar crawl tickets, restaurant reservations, hotel rooms, etc. Now, for my best friends gf of 8 months this would be her first time there and, might I add, she was not very accepting of what we had planned - suggested different things/said she didn’t want to do the things our friend group typically does. \n\nNow a few days ago less than one week before we take the trip I get a text from my friend saying the gf has invited one of her friends to come along and the friend accepted and is planning around coming. She also expects that we accommodate her friend and adjust accordingly. Now I know the friend and she’s very nice and I have nothing against her - matter of fact we’ve gotten along pretty well the times we have interacted - but it’s much too late to change plans. Long story short, for her to be able to come we’d have to get another hotel room (we are all splitting the rooms equally so this would make the cost for everyone higher by about 100$ since all the rooms left at this point are very very expensive), get tickets for a different bar crawl than the one we already had cause they were all sold out by now, change the dinner reservations (not a big deal) and drive another car there (4 hour drive there and back). \n\nOf course I wasn’t gonna stand for that and flat out said she can’t come and to tell her she isn’t going and that his gf doesn’t get to invite people to go on our trip cause it’s our trip and she’s a guest on it. I also said she can’t make this trip HER trip instead of our friend groups trip as much as she’d like to. I’ll admit I came off a bit rude when I said this but AITA for saying her friend can’t come?

      "description": "So my birthday was on the 15th and about 2 weeks before that, Maya calls me with Nancy in her car wanting to talk to me and tell me a few things. We were all college friends but I graduated a semester ahead of them and due to my circumstances, I can't go up to meet them regularly. So back to the call, it was a fun talk same as usual. Now, I don't usually make plans to hang out. But I figured I need to be more proactive now that I'm not in college so I brought up the idea of hanging out on my birthday. The plan was to take my dad's car to Maya's house and then carpool with her to the college campus where Nancy lives so we could hopefully hang out at a spot that's similar to Dave &amp; Buster's. I told them that it's ok if that doesn't happen. I just want to hang out with yall and do whatever.\n\nAnyway, Maya said she will remember to take the day off on my birthday. So up to the day before my birthday, I hear nothing from her about our plans. So I text her wondering if we're still on for tomorrow. She gives me two different, ridiculous excuses.\n\n1. She has a therapy session on that day and she doesn't think she can cancel.\n\n2. She has the flu.\n\nNow idk about yall, but my bullshit meter went off when I read this. Firstly, she had two weeks in advance to schedule the appointment for a different day. Lastly, she just so happens to magically have the flu, but on Valentine's Day, she was out with friends at some event. I know this because she posted all of that on FB. I had the flu before and I was bedridden for a week and a half. And she has a class on Friday and went to office hours on that day and then went to class on Monday. Trust me. She didn't have no damn flu. \n\nSo I called her out on those excuses on my birthday because I was upset. Usually, I'm never upset when around those two but I felt entitled to be upset in this situation and I had to say something because I don't like letting bs slide. She has done this in the past too. She's one of those people who loves to make plans with you and get you hyped up but then never follow through with them. But then you see her on FB posting pics of all the events she's went to and with other people. She did this once before to me which led me to confront her now that it's happening again.\n\nAt first, she started arguing with me when I did so, using the fact that I barely text back in the group text as a talking point and then tried to defend her excuses. I told Maya how irrelevant that was and continued to stay grounded in my point. Then she starts apologizing over and over and then saying things like, \"Nancy why won't you help me out here lol\". It felt very disingenuous to me and I stopped responding and just focused on me the rest of the day. \n\nA few days later she texts me asking if I'm still mad at her. I told her that I was a little bit but that I'm good now for the most part. No reply.\n\nSo AITA? ",

Sure enough, it gets to the point that I hear loud noises downstairs (a water bottle hitting the floor and breaking), footsteps, and as I come down I see my mom chasing my dad with a mop handle, and strike him.\n\nI fear this will escalate EVEN FURTHER, since we have a history (dad was arrested, never convicted, once of domestic violence). I call the cops, I say that my mom was holding a weapon but specify that it's a plastic mop.\n\nUpon this, they stop fighting and go into separate rooms, preparing for the police.\n\nPolice do their investigation, take pictures, take statements, and officer says \"kid, your mom is being arrested for domestic violence\"\n\nat that time, mom was the major breadwinner, and my dad, sister and I all agree that we don't want to press charges/get my mom convicted. \n\nWe try desperately to say we don't want to press charges, but this becomes a criminal trial, so we have to convince DA to drop charges. We do so by lying to them, saying how my dad's visible wounds were from our dog, not our mom. \n\nMom's record is clean (not convicted) and she still worked at that place making $$$ for a bit. \n\nHowever, everybody in the family feels distant from me. Mom acts differently around me than before, talking less, and dad (who now is the breadwinner) blames me, saying that I nearly ended my mom's life. \n\nwhenever my dad gets angry at me, or at my mom, he'll say \"do u want *THE EVENT* to happen again?\" and to me he'll say \"you're tearing this family apart, you nearly broke this family apart\"\n\nthis happened around a year ago, but dad, who flew back home, got angry recently and brought up some sour spots by berating me again bringing up mom's arrest.\n\nI've been haunted by this, since I feel like I did the right thing, but that I was responsible for the repercussions, and the decline in my relationship with my family.  I feel bad that my parents have to endure this shitty marriage because of me, and that I'm the one that's almost breaking everything up.\n\nAITA Reddit?",

      "description": "My sister in law did not want to have kids, at least not until she at a good point in her career, but my brother did not want to wait.  So one time when we all went camping together I overheard her tell him they couldn’t do anything because she was in her dangerous time and couldn’t find her todays sponge and using only condoms would be too risky.  That night he got her really drunk and had unprotected sex with her. The next morning when she realized what had happened they had a big fight and we heard the whole thing. He claimed he was really drunk too — he wasn’t — and couldn’t find the condoms — he had given them to my husband with a big smile and wink — and had tried to pull out — yeah right — and that she was actually awake and really excited  and said okay to pulling out but she just didn’t remember — not true either. He said he’d make it up to her by ending our camping trip immediately and taking a shortcut to get us back in time for plan b. He then insisted on unprotected make up sex “since she was getting plan b anyway.”   The “shortcut” ended up taking four days, which was how long we had planned to be out anyway, and they had unprotected sex the entire time. Once my husband told me how my brother had given him the condoms, it was obvious to me what he was doing, and I wanted to say something, but my husband insisted that I should mind my own business and just enjoy the camping. That was really hard when she asked me if I had any protection she could borrow, and I had to say no.  I felt like I needed to cover for my brother, so I teased her about how loud she had been while they were having sex that night and had begged him not to pull out.  I think she actually believed me — she had been really drunk. Of course she got pregnant. They are on prenancy 3 now, and their oldest is only four.  I’ve never wanted to talk to her about it for obvious reasons, but I am feeling guilty now because she told me last night that all of her pregnancies have been accidents and she really wants to go back to work but can’t because she is never able to get a break.  I just gave her a pat on the head and said that each of her babies were just meant to be.  I just don’t want to rat out my brother. ",

      "description": "Am I the asshole for not letting a Mum buy a loaf of bread after closing? This happened a few weeks ago but I was ruminating on it afterwards wondering if I did something shitty. \n\nI work in a major retail grocery store which on Sundays is open only from 11-5 (I say only because people regularly wait outside before 11 and it’s usually busy from opening to closing) \n\nI supervise the front  end and at 5pm we do an announcement that the store is closed and the customers need to finalise their shopping. It’s common that people will try and fit in last minute purchases and not line up at the check outs straight away so in reality sometimes the last customer may not leave til 5.15. All of us only are rostered til 5.30 and we need to clean and count the money etc. \n\nSo this particular day we do the call and put the entrance roller doors down (leaving the other side open we’re people are checking out). 2 guys came in a few mins after 5 and I said “sorry guys we are closed” and they said “oh we only need to get a drink” and I said “oh ok go on then”. Evidently those guys didn’t want just a drink and began walking around doing other shopping. A few mins later 2 other men tried to walk in and I said we are closed and refused them. This happened 2 more times with two different men. Turns out the security guard who’s meant to stand at the entrance of this shopping centre isn’t here and people are just walking in. These 4 men didn’t seem to leave either, just kind of loitering out the front. \n\nSo around 5.10 this Mum and her kid come running in and I call out “sorry you can’t come in we are closed” and she says “I just need a loaf of bread” and I just say no and apologise again. Theoretically this woman could have come in and bought the bread and it wouldn’t have held us up because a few other customers were still there with large shops but I had already said no to several people before her and they were still hanging around and they would have complained to me or taken forever to get “one thing”. The woman looks disappointed and leaves. Another customer watching starts having a go at me, saying I should have let her in and she only wanted a loaf of bread etc. But the way she said it was if I’d been a real bitch and I felt quite guilty afterwards. The nearest store open 24hrs were she could get bread was probably 10mins drive away. So not super convenient. I’m assuming she needed it for the kids school lunches. \n\nAm I an asshole? I just don’t want to make exceptions for people and then everyone starts thinking it’s ok to come in after closing.  ",

      "description": "Me: 37/yo guy; had more than my fair share of monogamous relationships. \n\nAbout four calendar years ago, my relationship with the only woman I’ve ever wanted to marry ended. By marry I mean, I (still at some level) love her in the truest sense of the word; exactly the sort of connection you’d hope for in a life partner. I saw our future in her eyes. Unfortunately for me, she didn’t reciprocate and after two years of her allowing me to live in a fantasy I couldn’t do it anymore.\n\nAt the end, I met a monster named Depression for the first time. I felt like a widower; like I was missing an integral part of my life. I was having real withdrawals missing her and even though I eventually shook it, I feel today like I am a different person.\n\nAlso during this time, another woman entered my life. She is a mutual friend, and she is amazing in every way. Smart, talented, attractive, badass, financially secure, and completely into me. We’re great friends. \n\nFriends. \n\nI can’t make myself give her more than that. I “like” her very, very much. We’ve been getting along great for [time since depression] years now. She’s a great companion. She knows what happened. That said, we’re both in our upper 30s, and she wants to be married and to be having kids. I’ve *only* ever wanted kids with Ms. Big Deal from paragraph two. I’m pretty sure I don’t want to be monogamous anymore, even though I’m not even interested in meeting new people. I’m mostly content to work and entertain my many hobbies and business ideas.\n\nMeanwhile, she has been trying to talk herself out of wanting a family, but I know she very much does. She deserves all of that. However, she knew I was very broken when she got onboard, and she knows that I’m not in love with her like that. I would miss her dearly, though. Ironically, I now know exactly how my ex from paragraph two felt.\n\nAITA for not faking my own death or something to make her find someone who can give these things to her?",

I wasn’t able to do anything myself and it didn’t even feel like a gift.\n\nNot to mention now I have one more thing to take care of/maintain on top of our house, other pets, kids, etc etc.\n\nI truthfully would have just appreciated some quality time and maybe a card.

However, in the \"assigned tasks list\" file that was sent by her, I didn't get assigned for it and she expected me to \"should have automatically get on with it\". Mind you, I DID NOT GET UPSET for 3 reasons: (1) I hate sales and customer service so I would catch any chance to avoid doing those tasks (2) I'm going to quit this job (3) I know this kind of management would just hurt her more in the end, especially when this center already in a deep shit. So all in all, this is just like one of those stories you can make a tweet out of it and think nothing more of it (at least to me).\n\nSo during our walking routine today, I told my dad about what happen and ask him (words by words): \"What do you think about all this?\" Then he got MAD at me and said:\n\n\"HOW THE HELL CAN I KNOW? I WASN'T THERE TO KNOW THE WHOLE STORY, YET YOU ASK ME WHAT I THINK?\"\n\nI snapped back immediately that I didn't ask him for A SOLUTION, I simply shared with him what happened at work today and ask how he FELT about all that. He kept saying:\n\n\"I WASN'T THERE SO I DON'T KNOW!! AND IF I WAS, I'D TELL HER THAT I WASN'T ASSIGNED THE TASK AND DONE!! DON'T ASK ME WHAT I FEEL ABOUT A SITUATION UNLESS I'M AN INSIDER\"\n\nBasically, he's angry because I'm asking his opinion about a situation that he's not the insider even though I told him EVERYTHING happened and including the context. It's like when you submit a post on this sub, instead of others writing INFO and demanding for more context, they would yell at you and get angry for \"daring to ask opinion\" when they lack information and not an insider.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I just got home from work, while getting ready for my shower I saw a guy with a ladder and his little daughter trying to get on the roof of my Garage. Naturally I ran outside and asked him what he thinks he’s doing. He then tells me that he’s looking for Hail damage (we didn’t have any hail for months around this time). I told him that I don’t believe and told him to better fuck off and that I’m gonna call my landlord.\nSo the first thing I did was call my wife of course and asked if my landlord let her know that someone is coming over to check our roof for hail damage. She says no. Then I call my landlord right away asking if he sent someone over. At first he said no, so I told him what happened and then suddenly he remembered that he sent someone over to check the roof.\nSo I tell my landlord that I told his worker to fuck off and I said I’m going to apologize. Guy never came back so I was never able to apologize.\nThe thing is, where I am from in Germany it it’s pretty much known that people sometimes use their kids to distract you so someone else can pickpocket you or go into your house behind your back.\nSo my landlord neither told me or my wife that someone is going to check on the roofs, and also bring a child as well.\nI just acted out of instinct from what i am used to.\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I’m not currently in a relationship but I have been and I’ve been wondering for a while if this is something I shouldn’t do. I’m quite the fangirl and have an obsession with a male actor for like 3 months or so and then move on to a new one. My latest obsession is Tom Cruise for instant, I love his movies and I have a picture of him from 1990 saved as my lock screen cuz he looks adorable. I did this when I was with my ex too but with like young Johnny Depp or Ian Somerhalder or whatever. It really nagged him. I wouldn’t literally say “he’s so fucking hot I want him.” But I would talk a lot about his movies or so... like I’m talking about Tom’s movies and that weird scientology shit. I tend to use gifs of them as well as oppose to random ones.\n\nIs that a weird thing to do with your significant other? Sometimes I would even compare him to certain roles they played (cuz I really felt like they were similar).\n\nOne time we were watching a movie and he said “WOW she’s HOT.” And his mom freaked , cuz I was right there and I had to say “it’s okay I do it all the time too.”\n\nSo am I the asshole for openly drooling over hot actors who I know I will never meet or do anything intimate with? Or was he being sensitive?\n\nNote: He was the jealous type \nNote 2: he had male shirtless anime characters on his lock screen which I thought was hella weird but never asked him to change it ",

I say no, a little shocked that someone would ask a stranger to give up their seat. The couple is young and looks to have no medical issues, and I’ve been here longer so why should I give up my seat?

      "description": "Throwaway. \n\nBackground: My (now ex) girlfriend and I are both studying to be clinical psychologists. The final year of our program requires us to do a year-long internship. Most people apply to sites around the country. This is an extremely stressful time, as you’re essentially competing with other doctoral candidates across the US for a handful of positions. \n\nMore Background: Prior to the breakup, my ex and I had been dating for about 9 months. She was very up front at the beginning of our relationship, telling me she has trust issues due to being cheated on in the past. I was willing to work through these insecurities with her. Throughout our relationship, she accused me of cheating with my coworkers, members of my cohort, friends etc. I want to be explicitly clear that I never cheated on her while we were together. At the beginning of the relationship, I was willing to deal with the accusations and assured her that I wasn’t being unfaithful. My thought process was she’d see that I was trustworthy and realize I wasn’t the type to cheat. But as time went on, the accusations didn’t stop or even lessen, and I began to become increasingly resentful which leads to the current situation...\n\nDuring one of my internship interviews, I was chatting with another interviewee. She told me that she has an upcoming interview where I live. I offered to meet up for lunch when she came to my city and talk more about the site she’s applying to (I had previously worked there). I told my gf and she was furious. She called me a piece of shit and said she knew I would eventually “act like all the rest”. I broke up with her and told her not to contact me anymore. This was a few days ago.  I’ve been getting messages from her friends essentially telling me what a terrible person I am for “cheating”, breaking up with her right before her series of internship interviews, and that I was intentionally trying to throw her off her game. My own friend group is split on the issue. None think I’m the asshole for breaking up with her, but the majority think it was a dick move to do it before interviews and think I should’ve waited until after (mid to late January) to leave the relationship. \n\nSo now I want Reddit’s unbiased opinion. AITA? And if so, how should I go about apologizing? \n",

      "description": "So my friend and I made plans for me to come to her house this weekend, she lives about 2 hours away from me. For context she is married with a baby, and I, being single, have come to her house to spend the weekend many times before. \n\nI have always knows that she is not the cleanest person out there, and her house is just kind of... grimey honestly. I don’t judge, and I would never say anything to her about it, but I am used to a cleaner, more hygienic lifestyle. She lives out in the country and doesn’t seem to mind there being bugs, even mice in her house. I usually question whether the sheets on the guest bed I sleep in are clean and fresh when I come here. But this time it’s really bad. \n\nI arrived at her house earlier today, with the plan being that I would stay here until Sunday. Right now I am laying in bed unable to fall asleep. The sheets on the bed are very obviously dirty. There were crumbs which I brushed off, but they smell like her dog which always smells like he hasn’t had a bath in ages. There is dog hair all over the sheets and blanket, which is causing me to wheeze pretty badly from allergies/asthma. \n\nThe worst thing is that I keep hearing noises in the ceiling that sounds like some kind of animal is in the attic foraging around up there and it’s terrifying. I am scared of falling asleep in case the animal gets into the bedroom somehow. I’m not trying to sound snobby, some people are okay living like this, but I am definitely not. \n\nSo I was texting my sister kind of freaking out and she said I should fake an emergency and use it as an excuse to leave. My friend is already sleeping so I have accepted the fact that I have to sleep here tonight, but I am considering taking my sisters advice and faking something to get out of here in the morning. \n\nI would really feel bad leaving since she really wanted to go out drinking tomorrow night but I honestly don’t think I can handle tonight here, let alone a second night. \n\nSoooo WIBTA if I fake some kind of family emergency in order to leave in the morning??",

My mom gets lonely easily so she dates lots of guys, but it doesn't really bother me. What bothers me is that she takes advantage of the fact that I'm dependent on her. \n\nThe first one was a POS. The man was a crackhead, would yell at her and call her names in front of me and my little siblings, and he was physically abusive to her. I convinced her to leave him after he tried to get with my 16 year old sister. \n\nThe second one was a drug dealer who was actually pretty cool. He was nice, funny, and took care of us. Unfortunately, this illusion disappeared not long after he paid the rent for the first time. He would make my mom deliver drugs, smoke in the house knowing my brother has asthma, and he would mentally abuse my mom. She left him after she almost got caught by the cops. \n\nGuy number three is the current guy. When my mother told us she had a new boyfriend, I asked her not to bring him around until she was serious about him because I'm worried about the effect it'll have on my siblings to have so many guys coming into and out of our lives. Not to mention my mother's impeccable skill to find the worst POS possible.  She yelled at me and said I have no choice in the matter and brought him around anyway. My asshole-meter is going off the charts and I avoid him when I can. She's mad at me and I can tell she wishes I had gone to live with my dad and now I'm starting to wish I had. \n\nAm I the ass for not wanting her to bring her new boyfriend around? ",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to buy back my friend's share in our business?",
      "description": "They say the fastest way to lose a good friend is to start a business together, and I now know it's true.\n\nSo I have a (former) close friend, let's call her K. We, from what I gathered talking to her, have a pretty close understanding of how to work a business. So we, together with 2 more good friends of mine, started a small side gig last year. The starting capital is quite small actually, only $50k, in which I hold 40%, and each of the others 20%. We all have a role in the company, with me being the overall manager who's responsible for the ultimate success or failure of the business.\n\nThe business started off great. Thanks to our good starting location, we have customers right away, some loyal even. Within 6 months, the business made enough to sustain itself, and to even pay the founders a small, symbolic \"salary\" every month. We were happy, and whatever differences got swept under the table.\n\nBut alas, good things don't usually last! The last 3 months had been brutal. Revenue down 70%, some loyal customers left, we had difficulties finding new customers. I had to pump in a few grands to keep it afloat. Then the difference in personality became more pronounced. She was (and please note that you are following the story under my perspective) bossy and wanted things to be HER way. What's more, I perceived her to be... ineffectual at whatever job she did (managing the sales &amp; marketing team), so, as the person ultimately responsible, I felt the need to tell her that she has not done a great job and needed to change. You know, good friends giving each other advice and all that. I tried to be as tactful and non-confrontational as possible.\n\nBoy oh boy, what a bad decision. She went full nuclear. Arguments became a mainstay on the menu at all meetings. Tension was high. She thought the remaining 2 had not done as much as she did, and refused to set a stellar example and be more punctual and responsive. Instead, she started putting off tasks I gave her, and missed deadline after deadline. Even after all that, I tried to compose myself and encourage her instead of beleaguering her. I wanted to keep the team spirit high.\n\nWell, things went south quick two months ago. During one of our regular meetings, I said a few things that shouldn't have been said, to the effect of \"This company cannot have more than 1 boss - We already had someone to call the shots around here (me), now we need others to make the shots\". OK my bad for losing my cool, but it's the truth. K broke into a fit, then fell silence. The meeting concluded shortly after and nothing was solved.\n\nA week later she submitted a resignation, claiming health issues. She said that she'll try her best to pass on her duties to one of her salespeople, and that she won't withdraw her share in the company in the near future. She wished us good luck.\n\nGuess what? Both of those are lies. Her sales quit one after another (I should say that she had a habit of hiring people close to her - friends, cousins, old colleagues etc.), and she demanded that we (the company) buy back her shares so she can have a surgery for her illness. Well, not K per se -- she didn't even deign to talk to us, but instead sent her HUSBAND to talk on her behalf, at our BOD meeting. Now, her husband was friends with all of us, sure, but his name is not on the list of shareholders. K's name is, and she didn't even produce at least a piece of paper to let him represent her in the meeting. Damn. Her husband then implied that the stress WE put on her caused her illness. I'm sorry, what? You signed up for this in the first place. Starting up was never easy, of course there'll be stresses!\n\nAnyway, I am more than capable to purchase back all of her shares. But seeing as our business was bleeding money, and that she left the company during its hardest time AND her actions exacerbated the problems... I don't want to. No way. Nuh-uh. Not right now. I will, eventually, when the company has steadied its course and ready to pay dividend. That's when I'll buy her shares back and earn the dividend for myself. Luckily the other 2 supported me (they didn't know each other before starting the company, I introduced them all together), so her 20% vote means nothing.\n\nAm I bitter? Petty? Yes, I admit as much. But am I the asshole, in this case? Would you have done the same?\n\nYour call.",

      "description": "This story goes back far so I’m going to do my best to summarize it.\n\nOne of my best friends has been my roommate for years. I do love the guy, he’s clean, organized, and honestly a great guy to hang out with. However, recently he’s become more of a burden because he doesn’t understand how to budget his finances. He is the type of person to start and stop projects without actually finishing, for example college. The concept of money doesn’t really exist, and hasn’t up until now. \n\nHe had a car payment on a luxury vehicle he cannot afford, he has student loans from one semester of college (the money he spent on paying off other debts), money owed to creditors like those “get 1,000” schemes you hear on the radio. Basically, the guy is in over his head in debt. Recently, he was diagnosed with some sort of depression disorder and sever anxiety, which I would be in too if I put myself in a situation like he has. \n\nFor the most part, he has been barely scraping by on rent. The overwhelming amount of debt he has accumulating is stacking like crazy and he can barely afford to put gas into his car. I’ve told him to stop smoking weed and drinking to cut down on expenses. It seemed to work at first, until he started drinking all my beer in a single night and smoking most of my weed in a sitting. I also said he could eat some of my food too, but that turned into over half it. \n\nI confronted him about all of this, and he told me he has depression and can’t afford anything. I don’t doubt he’s depressed or whatever, but I don’t think he has any concept of what he’s doing to me financially. Sure, he’s paying rent but he’s eating for free, drinking for free, smoking for free, and using all the shit I buy for free. We’ve had multiple conversations about it, always ending with him complaining about depression and financial problems. \n\nEverything culminated in a massive argument, both of us saying shit we don’t mean about each other. I had the upper hand, my father owns the place and he hadn’t signed a lease for this year. I called my Dad and told him my friend needs to get out and explained the bare details of what was going on. He called told my friend it was time to move out. \n\nNow he’s couch surfing (he doesn’t own furniture just clothes, a laptop, and a guitar), and telling everyone what a shitty person I am. I have friends calling me saying I never should have done anything because of the tough time he’s having. People telling me a shitty friend. I haven’t spoken a word about what happened, all I’ve said is “this is on him, I don’t want to talk about it”. Now there’s elaborate stories going around sending me on a guilt trip, some of it true some fabricated. \n\nI tried to confront him, but he has me blocked on everything and is telling everyone we know I kicked him while he was down. \n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for asking my in-laws to pay me back?",
      "description": "      So 3 months ago I (20/F) went on a 3 week vacation trip to Mexico, with my boyfriend (21/m), my BIL (16), and my SIL (10). I paid my expenses, boyfriend paid for his, my parents in law (PIL) paid for BIL &amp; SIL. I left over some money so when I would come back to USA I would have money for my bills and I wouldn’t be struggling until my next paycheck. \n\n       Anyways, on the day that we leave back to USA, it turns out our tickets didn’t include our bags so we had to pay around 75$ each for our bags. I paid for mine, no problem. But then my bf realizes he doesn’t have enough to pay for them 3. I think it’s worth mentioning that my father in law had wanted my bf to throw a farewell party the day before we left, with their family members... which left them with no money.  My bf did not want to throw the party but his father insisted. Anyway, he asked me if I could let him borrow the 3500 pesos (around 188$) I had left to pay for his siblings bags. I was hesitant at first because it was all the money I had left, but my bf and my BIL promised me that their father would pay me back since it was for BIL &amp; SIL. \n\n         I paid for their luggage and came back to USA with 0$ to my name. I ended up having a negative balance on my card and I’ve been trying to recover from this trip for a while now. Now it’s been almost two months, and I ask my boyfriend when my PIL  are going to pay me back because I could really use my money, and he tells me he will ask his parents again. \n\n      Today he asked his mom when they will pay me back and she got angry. She said I am very “fijada” which roughly translates to I’m very ungrateful. She says because sometimes I eat at their house, why am I charging them for the luggage fees and that they will start charging me for things too. My bf defended me saying that I buy my siblings in law food at times too, when I owe them money I pay them on time, etc. Plus to her, damn near 200$ may not seem like a lot, but for a 20 year old who gets paid 400$ working a part-time, it’s almost half my paycheck! Does she think I shit money? I could of easily said no and let my BIL and SIL leave their luggages in Mexico but I didn’t and I came back with 0$ to my name and had to end up even borrowing money to pay my bills. \n\n     So Reddit, am I an asshole for wanting my PIL to pay me back? I admit I do eat at their house at times, and my MIL gifts me clothes from her store, but again I do not ask her to give me things, and if eating at their house is such a big deal I will stop. My boyfriend currently lost his job so I’ve been helping him financially too. I’ve been helping her son but she still thinks I’m ungrateful. Am I really an asshole? ",

      "description": "My home estate/neighbourhood is quite a nice place, and unfortunately that attracts burglars and vandals, loitering and antisocial behaviour.\n\nA friend of mine’s husband and 3 other residents proposed we as an estate come together to form a private security firm, run by residents, staffed by residents, and each household pays a pound a week towards operating costs. Staff were proposed to be trained, armed with non-lethal weapons, trained to restrain and detain where necessary etc....so I joined the residents forum as a potential funder of this. My partner is a police officer so I know how strained the police are.\n\nUnfortunately they have decided to mobilise before the project is a legit operation and they have civilians confronting criminals who could potentially be armed. This is the UK so it’s likely “just” knives and the like. But it’s still dangerous.\n\nA post went up yesterday by my friend along the lines of “well done to *husband* for attending an incident on *street* this evening” so I commented with “Oh my god! I have serious concerns about this, I’ll PM you”\n\nHer husband replied (can’t remember what) but I went to reply and I had been removed from the group.  I messaged my friend, expressing genuine concern. I unfortunately didn’t screenshot it, but I said something along the lines of “your kids need their dad, I’d hate your husband to get hurt doing what is borderline vigilante work when untrained and unarmed” and she gave me no end of crap about how she deserves to feel safe in her home, police would take too long to respond etc etc and she made out that I can’t be trusted (she thinks my partner will report this at work - which he probably would if I told him about their operation) and that I’m selfish and all kinds of really personal stuff I won’t get into.\n\nI suffer anxiety and I’m worried I’ve been an asshole by suggesting they shut down for the time being until they have the proper permits and passes. :( AITA?",

Despite the fact that she said she accepted my choice and supported me, I saw an undeniable sadness in her eyes when I did, and I feel terrible for being the reason we can never really be a family again. She would never say that to me and maybe I’m just over thinking things, but I feel like an asshole for not even wanting to consider reconciliation because of all that transpired over the years. So AITA for not wanting to see him again and just wanting to try to move on with my life without him being any part of it?\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to see my bipolar schizophrenic brother because of all the pain and struggle he has caused me over the years?",

      "description": "So, my friends were in a group chat and were talking about assaulting someone as “revenge”. Now the person they were talking about did some seriously messed up stuff and so they viewed it as a form of revenge. \n\nI became upset because my view is it would solve nothing. They said they wouldn’t actually do it. But when it came up that I would call the cops on them if they did, they said I was the bad guy. \n\nEssentially it boiled down to the person deserved it and who am I to judge them if the assaulted him. I said it was a moral argument and that it is not their place to make decisions like this as they aren’t police. They said if it’s not their place, why is it mine.\n\nI’m still worried about these people, and I do care about them. They are all perfectly capable of actually assaulting someone as well.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So, I made a throwaway for this, just in case. Sorry if it gets too long.\n\nI've been dating my BF for almost 3 years. He's in college and works part-time, I've been a teacher working full-time for 1 year now. While the salary is not great, I get by (I still live with my parents and so does he).\n\nWell, he is about to change jobs, and recently told me that I will have to (he said it like that) pay for his university course for some months until he gets paid in his new job, as his family is not in a position to do so, which is completely understandable.\n\nNow, for me it's not really a problem, I've been helping him pay for some things here and there because the money from his job goes ALL to pay for university (it has gotten really expensive, luckily this is his last year) and he has the intention to give me all back when he is in a position to do it.\n\nThe thing is, some colleagues have invited me to a holiday they're are planning and I want to go, because I haven't been on a holiday for really long and it would be a nice experience. When he told me about this issue, I told him about my possible plans, and he got kind of angry? defensive? because for starters, I didn't tell him right away. Honestly, it just slipped my mind, my friends and I had just talked about this idea some days before, we don't have anything definite, and also some days passed before I saw my BF again. I just forgot about it.\n\nI want to help him, but I still want to go on this holiday. It's not that I never do anything for him, I generally pay for our dates and all that (which again, I do it happily because we're a couple and sometimes things can get like this), but he didn't like the idea one bit, he considers it kind of selfish. \n\nI did the maths and I think that by living frugally for these months, I can afford both things, but AITA for considering doing something nice for me with my money?

That doesn’t bother me, but I do have a high sex drive. He told me before that he wants to wait until I meet his mum at the very least before we have sex.\n\nTonight I asked him how he feels about foreplay before I meet his mum or after, and he said he wants it to be natural and to do it whenever it ‘feels right.’ I responded that his stance on sex wasn’t when it feels right, but has an actual timing (me meeting his mum). Then he said I was killing the mood and I apologised and said I wouldn’t ask him anymore.\n\nIt’s my birthday today and I’m meant to be seeing him and staying over at his. That’s why I asked him how he felt about foreplay, because I’ll be quite sexually frustrated if I’m sleeping next to him.  I’m going to dinner with him, but considering not staying over now because I feel hurt from his comments. \n\nAITA for asking my boyfriend when he’s sexually ready, or was I pushing him too much?",

      "description": "Yesterday morning, my boyfriend and I were waking up when I saw a scary black spider scurrying across the floor. I'm pretty scared of spiders, and I think he's about the same level of terrified of them.\n\nAlso somewhat relevant, he is between housing situations and staying with me in my studio for a month until he moves into his new place. He is messier than me, and has probably created many homes for spiders with the piles of things he has left around. He has improved though and he's awesome and responsive to criticism. Just a lot of two steps forward one step back progress.\n\nI said something like, \"Holy shit, look at that spider!\" He leapt back in alarm and then looked at it carefully from a safe distance. He asked me to quickly grab a cup before it got away, so I ran to the kitchen.\n\nI use glass jam jars as cups, and that was the first thing I saw so I grabbed one and brought it to him. Once the spider was under the jar he asked for a lid. I had saved all the lids, so I tried a lid on another old jam jar before I brought it back. When I had the second jam jar in my hand is when I started plotting.\n\nHe captured and jarred the spider, sealing the lid tightly. He set the spider jar on the bookshelf and started to get his shoes on. While he was doing that I grabbed the other matching jar, lidded it, and while he was bent over putting his shoes on in front of the shelf I reached over him and swapped the two jars. I put a blanket over myself to go outside (it was cold too) so that he wouldn't see the spider jar in my pocket.\n\nI started inspecting the empty jar carefully. I told him to have a look, and that it looked like the spider was gone. We both carefully looked at the jar for a bit, trying to spot the spider. He became more and more freaked out, shaking the jar, looking around the bookshelf. I say something like \"we'll never find it with all these clothes and snacks around the apartment\". Finally he ran out of my apartment, saying he was going to open it outside to check that it was really gone. \n\nI went with him, spider jar in my pocket. He opened the empty jar carefully, then moved back from it to inspect from a distance. When it was clear there was no spider he started freaking out, saying there's no way it could have gotten out but it did so it must be in the apartment and it must be angry and out for spider revenge. He started crying, and saying he was going to go to his friends house for the night and maybe move his stuff there later, and that he can't go back in my apartment.\n\nI didn't expect things to go so far. I pull out the spider jar and show him that the spider is still in captivity, it was just a dumb prank, and apologize. He freezes, then quietly takes the jar from me and goes and lets the spider out in the grass.\n\nHe hasn't talked to me since. I really thought it was a harmless prank. I do feel bad and apologized to him.\n\nMy question is, AITA to the point where not talking to me for over a day is warranted?",

So far, so good, but I don't want it. I'm worried because, well.... M is a fucking train wreck. Let me explain: l already feel like a complete cunt to say this because things were never good into M's home (her family is a disaster) and seeing this l can just say that I can understand why she acts the way she act but..... Let me give some examples. She totally lack common sense. \nShe doesn't understand money. If she has some cash she will just waste it on useless stuff (she bought a dog without even having a house) and complain because she doesn't have it anymore and she is poor. \nShe has very bad higyen issues. Due to her family life she used to live in total squalor, and she is incapable of tell filthy from clean :in her old house she NEVER changed her sheets, picked up her dog's crap ,  washed anything and seldom changed her clothes ( her reasoning: they aren't stained, so they are clean); while I'm sorry for this, I'm concerned for my friend: her health is pretty frail, and she is often ill, plus she is a very tidy person. And these are the smallest things. \nIf  there is a poster girl of too dumb to live, that's M. She doesn't understand that crossing the road without watching is dangerous just like she doesn't understand that unprotected sex leads to pregnancies: she already has had two abortions (I'm not against it, just.... Why when you could use condoms and avoid stds?????) and still asks us if having sex while standing on top can lead to a pregnancy or if you can get pregnant giving a bj.  Until now,  you can think of her like a sad tragic Kevina, but the real issue are her acquaintances: she is a bad people magnet. Robbers, junkies, drug dealers are her friends, and she will bring them with her if you let her move into your house.  two of my friends have let her in: they houses have been robbed, damaged or used as a brothel  ( ah, M was being pimped by her boyfriend. She said that since she was his gf it wasn't pimping). They even found two  needles. She also gave to her friends the keys of the houses without consulting my friends first (both the times).  they were forced to change their locks, and received anonymous death threats for this, and one of them was also punched in the face by one of M's friends that did not want to leave. She still couldn't understand why they kicked her out, since she wasn't the one that did drugs or stole. The point is: I'm sure M will just die or be sold as a sex slave or something if someone doesn't help her, but I'm terrified that something could happen to F. She means the world to me. ",

Her email only said \"I'm so fed up of this shit. This is such bullshit. I wrote back to the professors giving them my support over this crap\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI replied with \"Why are you so upset? How does this affect you? Do you even know who the speaker is?

It sounds like you want to be upset by something\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe wrote back that I was being an asshole and that she didn't \"know anything about the guy, but my professor said he isn't sexist or homophobic\". I did some research on my own and found a recent interview he gave where he said that women are obviously ill-suited to leadership or science-heavy roles and that gay men/lesbians are \"shameful\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I replied, sent her the link to the interview and said \"this is why people are upset.

      "description": " I'll call him Richard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all began the summer before my junior year. My friends and I have been going into town after school on Friday since eighth grade, and over the summer we'd gang up if folks were in town. The summer before junior year, Richard, a mutual friend, was inducted into the group. He went to the other of two high schools in the district, but I didn't know him as well as others did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRichard was a fine addition at first. He was fun to be around the first couple of times. After a while, he started to annoy me. But other people were enjoying his presence so I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it. Richard quickly became \"one of the boys\" and I gradually became more and more annoyed by him. I found out towards the end of the summer that Richard was transferring to my high school. ~~Of course, I was thrilled.~~ I decided since my issues with Richard were mostly a personality clash, I would give him a shot, considering I'd see him on a near daily basis. That chance didn't last long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRichard has done the following:\n\n* He sent in a group chat a photo of a halved cat, guts spilling out. We told him that wasn't cool. He sent the photo three more times.\n* He screamed \"n\\*\\*\\*\\*\" out the window of his car while speeding down residential roads at \\~60mph. Richard is white.\n* He's been creepy-flirty with female friends, despite having a girlfriend.\n   * This relationship won't last much longer. He detailed how he's gonna break her heart pretty soon. She's nice doesn't deserve it.\n* He constantly talks about how privileged he is in the douchiest way possible, and regularly describes himself as an alpha male.\n* While ill on a school trip, he shit in a hotel bed, but hid his pants behind a dresser, and left the mess for housekeeping to deal with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost my last straw a few Fridays ago when five friends (Richard included) and I went to a burger joint to eat. Richard was high out of his mind when we sat down. This is not uncommon for him. He probably drove there high too. He regularly called over our server, often when they were already helping someone else, for the most insignificant reasons. He ordered his food before the rest of us were ready because he couldn't wait 5 minutes. When he got his food, he deemed his bun to be insufficient for his burger and demanded a larger bun, even after we insisted to him that those were the only buns available. He audibly made fun of other customers, and took a picture of a man he thought looked like Walter White with his shutter sound on. I asked for the check as soon as possible because I wanted out of that situation. I don't think Richard tipped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WIBTA for campaigning fiercely to outcast Richard from our social circle?** I'm not the only person who has issues with him, but everyone else is afraid of confrontation. I'm afraid this will cause weird tensions among mutual friends who have known him longer than I have.",

      "description": " I've been studying at my current school for 6 years now, and though I had a rocky relationship with everyone at first, I made friends with 4 other girls who I consider best friends: A, B, C and E. A and B are probably the most intelligent students in our class and the ones I'm closest to, and C and E are not exactly horrible students, they're just bad.  \n\n\nNow, I'm in no position to call them dumb, nor is it my wish to do so. I'm no genius either, but I'm an average student with mostly 8s and 9s grades (out of 10). They're my friends and I'd never consider them dumb, but there's one thing that pisses me off:  \n\n\nWhenever a year starts, C and E decide they'll study hard and try their best and not go to rec on any subject. First three months pass by, and they start not going to school, missing classes, not paying attention and speaking in class. I call them out for it, reminding them of last year, and they shut me off completely. A and B turn away and C and E group up on me saying that I'm rude and nosy and shouldn't be saying those things.  \n\n\nFirst week of exams comes by, and they get low grades. I see that they feel sad and encourage that they can do better next exams and try to support them. Then, next trimester comes and the exact same thing happens. Until we get to the end of the year, and they simply give up. \"Oh, I don't know this subject. I won't study it, since I know I won't be passing anyway\"  \n\n\nI call them out on it, say it's irresponsible and that they should try exactly because they don't understand it. I offer help and once again they say I'm a pain in the ass and that I'm wrong and that I should leave them alone. Again, it's me against the two of them and I just get so frustrated. End of year comes, and they are crying that they didn't pass in 5 subjects and how they'll try, and how they should've looked for help and I just can't help but cringe.  \n\n\nI know I probably should leave them alone, but knowing they'll end up sad and in a bad position at school I just can't bring myself to do it. I know they could do wonders if they stopped missing classes and started paying attention to them instead. I tell myself I insist because I want to see them happy, but they've told me so many times I'm wrong that I just feel like I'm the asshole in the story. Am I? ",

      "description": "Now I'm aware that sounds very assholeish but hear me out.  My friend (Jane) was in an abusive relationship.  Throughout the relationship myself and several other friends had continually supported her.  I don't believe it was Janes fault she got abused and I never pressured her to leave.  I know leaving an abuser is not as simple as that, and she would leave when she was ready.  It was a frustrating relationship to watch.  He'd cheat. She'd cheat.  He'd lie, she'd lie.  She had a temper and he had a worse temper.  Jane wasn't perfect but we had been friends for a very long time.  Now eventually her boyfriend went to jail for around 18 months.  She was sure to tell everyone the terrible things he did to her and how awful he was, and I completely agreed.  He was awful and with him gone she could finally get her life together for herself and her son.  Well 18 months pass and he gets out of jail.  My friend tells me she's been having sex with him and has some master revenge plan.  She's going to make him fall in love with her and then break his heart.  Ok whatever.  Time passes and he tells her that he slept with her friend (Carey).  Carey denies this, saying he's full of shit an he's just saying this to get back at Jayne.  Jayne will not drop this topic and at another friends wedding my boyfriend had heard about enough.  He basically told her to shut the f up.  She's gone around bad mouthing this guy for what he did to her.  He's a lying, cheating wife beater and you still believe him over your friend.  I agreed with him and we haven't spoken since. Now we are still in the same social circles and I'm wondering if I need to apologize for perhaps not understanding how hard it is to leave an abusive relationship.   AITA?",

      "description": "So, my brother (Sean) has a long-term partner (Melissa). I see them regularly as I still live at home for university.\n\n\\*\\*On 3 separate occasions, she stole from me.\\*\\* In my own home. She stole some makeup from me, then $30, then $40. This was about 1-2 years ago, and I know it was her; I'm not proud of it and am aware it was a terrible thing to do, but I looked through her makeup bag and found the concealer. As for the money, she was the only one home between the times of me seeing it in my wallet and seeing it gone.\n\nAt the $40 point, I was done. I texted Melissa something along the lines of, \"hey, a bunch of my money went missing. If you happen to know anything about this, please lemme know! If not, ignore this, sorry. Trying to figure this out.\"\n\nI never got a response, but what did happen is that Sean came flying over to my place. Rather than talking, he ended up physically assaulting me which landed me in the ER.\n\nAs we were waiting to talk to the doctor, my mom straight up asked me not to tell them what really happened, and when I did anyway, she interjected that it was “just a sibling spat.” She also asked me not to call the cops.\n\nI never got an apology from Sean or Melissa. My mom has apologized for not being on my side, but I think her prior actions clearly showed me where her loyalties lie (even if unconsciously).\n\nI put my anger aside for the civility of the family. I've made it seem like I'm not upset with them anymore and that it's all water under the bridge, but in reality, I'm still boiling. My mom knows, which hurts her a lot, but the two of us have actually formed a pretty good relationship since the incidents (she \\*apologized.\\* Nobody else has, and I can understand why she rode the line between us).\n\nAs I said, I'm still mad and, quite frankly, I don't care enough to work it out at this point. That may make me the A too, but I feel like if it wasn't spoken of or worked out at the time, there's no point in doing it now, years later. And I just don't care. \n\nHere I should specify: I would never cut my parents out. But, I'm afraid in that cutting out Sean and Melissa, mom'll willingly cut herself out of my life as well, seeing our relationship as ruined beyond repair even if she wants to keep it. She'll see me as immature again, and I don't know what that'll do to us, and whatever she chooses to do, my dad will follow and do too without question. But I literally don't give a single shit about Melissa, and it's bordering on being the same for Sean by extension and because of his actions, and I really just want them gone from my life.\n\nOnce I've moved out after school ends, I don't need to be around them. I don't need to be civil. I can forget they existed, and it would be easy (but it would really hurt and blindside my parents). If I did so, WIB (a petty) A?",

      "description": "My friend who was having the party doesn’t have a lot of friends so he invited 3 other people and me. I was the only one that came to the party, one of the people wasn’t allowed to go because of his parents(I heard his parents yelling at him over the phone saying he can’t go) the other person couldn’t come because he wasn’t in town(his parents made a last minute trip to shop), the last person, who is the person that owns the discord server, said he couldn’t come. He said that he couldn’t come after an hour of me texting and calling him to ask where he was and if he was calling. \n\n\nHe eventually replied that he was busy but never told me what he was doing. I got into a call with my friends later that night with the two other people that couldn’t come. We started to talk about some stuff and then we started thinking, why wasn’t the one friend at the party. We all knew why the two other friends couldn’t go but we didn’t know the last friend’s reason for not coming. \n\n\nWe started to think that he would put his discord server and his gaming servers over his friends. He has repeatedly said that he would play with us more often when we talked to him less during school. That was not the case, in fact he has only been working on his servers, he only talks about his servers, he never hangs out or plays with us anymore. We can’t a conversation without him bringing up his server. This led my friends and I to believe that he was working on his servers instead of coming to our friends party. \n\nI eventually asked him if he was putting his discord server before his friend’s party. He was mad, and we didn’t talk for at least a week, but he still wouldn’t tell us what he was doing at that time. So AITA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Alright, I know I already sound like a dick but this requires a full on explanation. \n\nSo for the longest time I was friends with this girl who we'll call Janice. Janice and I got along fairly well. After speaking with her for a while, we started to talk over text. These texts involved a lot of guilt tripping if I didn't respond with some amount of time. I'll keep this brief for her sake, but she had a traumatic childhood and I suppose is used to people abandoning her. I always ended up responding to this stuff.\n\nOne night, after hanging out somewhere, she invited me to stay the night at her house. I know I sound like a dick again, but the house was a disaster. It was a trailer home (which I really have no issue with on its own) but it was disgusting. Roaches and dead bugs everywhere. I'm sort of terrified of bugs so I was a bit grossed out but didn't comment on it. We hung out in her room for a while. I did something I know I shouldn't have, but that's my own fault. It ended with me being really sick around 1 or 2 AM. Janice tried her best to help me feel better. \n\nFollowing being picked up early in the morning, I never spoke to Janice again. I went out of my way to avoid her in class and online. She constantly would text me trying to guilt me into speaking with her again and I never responded.\n\nThen came the party. My birthday was coming up and therefore I invited a few of my friends to come over and hang out. I asked them to not tell Janice. One of them must've accidentally let it slip. Instead of speaking to me herself, Janice sent her friends to come ask me why I wasn't inviting her. When I just told them that I didn't want to, they called me an asshole. \n\nJanice and I don't speak anymore and I'm honestly afraid to apologize because I don't want this stupid guilt tripping and manipulating shit to start up again.",

      "description": "I feel super conflicted about this, I can't tell if I'm justified or being a hormonal brat. \n\n\nI'm a soon to be first time mom, over 8 months along and going through a rough pregnancy. We drove a very long way to get to the shower hosted by my in laws.(not an easy or fun drive, 8 months pregnant with GD,swollen running on no sleep) The shower was lovely, small and cute and fun and I got lots of great gifts. I am very greatful that anyone cares about me enough to put in the effort to throw a party for us or get us gifts. But lets get to the point. \n\n\nOne of the biggest gifts was a stroller carseat combo everyone pitched in to get for us. Before the shower my husband tried to make it a suprise but it eventualy slipped out that his mom (my MIL) got my stroller and carseat from my regestry. The problem I'm having is it's not the one I had on my regestry at all.  I spent weeks researching the right one for us, weeks looking at reviews and safety stuff and its ability to grow with my soon to be child for the long haul. At the party I hid my confusion and disappointment and thanked everyone profusely but the more I think about it the more it's bothering me.\n\n\n\nI know nothing about the one I was given, except the carseats attachment fits with the stroller my MIL already baught for herself and it's a color I hate and had mentioned I hated to her before.  The carseat is a totally different clashing color and I know nothing about it either. \n\n\n\nI feel like I should just be happy with what I was gifted but I also feel like 'what was the point of the regestry?'. Getting a stroller is a huge decision for a first time family and the choice was taken from me. I feel like I have so little control over any aspect of my life right now with this pregnancy being the way that it is and this stroller thing is really bugging me.My husband says I'm just being ungrateful but I spent so long on my regestry and labored over every big choice on it, I feel like my choices were disregarded. I also feel like I can't return them to get the one I wanted because my MIL will hate me. \n\n\n Am I being an ungrateful asshole? ",

She told me that there are so many dangerous things over there and portrais this beautiful land as it was some sort of jurassic world. My BF went to Vietnam 2 and a half years ago and he told her that it was the best trip of his life and that he would take care of me. \n\nBut still she tries to fear me as she always does when I do something she is not comfy with. She does not seem to understand that I want to see the world like she did when she was younger because she moved to cameroon for more than a year and visited many places around the world when she was my age. \n\nI know she is just trying to protect me because I am her child ut she is so manipulative. Every time I do something she does not like she does everything so that I have a remorse since I was a child. E.g. When I moved out she wouldnt come to visit me in my new apartment because she couldnt stand the feeling that I dont need her anymore and that she thinks I dont love her which is why I moved out.\n\nI see why she says such things everytime i do smth she does not totaly aprove, I m her child and she loves me and wants to protect me but she does not understand tht I suffer as much as she does. Even if I tell her. \n\nWhen she called me, I also started crying and asked if she wants me to cancel our trip and everything, it is really hard for me to look forward to our trip, knowing that she is trying to opress me not to go (the same when I moved out) \n\nI think I could not really make my point because english is not my mothertongue but I hope you can somehow understand what I mean and help me with my situation.

I just really don’t want her around my SD anymore even though it’s unavoidable for the time being. I feel like she’s making my dog have bad habits that are unacceptable for PA (public access) even though I’ve asked her so many times not to do things to make her misbehave because it’ll make me as a handler look bad. \nShe called me weird for telling her to stay away from the dog and was taunting me and calling me names. \n\nAITA for not wanting her around the dog ?

      "description": "I knew this person in college. At the time, this person appeared to be a woman. We've kept up over time on Facebook. Eventually, \"she\" became \"he\". He adopted a new male name, started taking hormone supplements, had surgery, and even grew a beard. For the most part, mutual friends seemed pretty supportive, as did his family.\n\n\nHowever, lately he has been developing a nasty misandrist streak, talking about how men are awful and should die. These weren't just a few sarcastic comments either. He has been harping on this for months and was directing his vitriol at male friends (who are probably all \"former\" friends by now). \n\nEventually I had enough so I replied with the following question:\n\n\n\"If you hate men so much, why are you trying so hard to transition into one?\"\n\n\nThe reaction I got from a lot of people was explosive. People acted like I was literally Hitler for asking something like that. To be clear, I don't have anything against trans people, and I was totally supportive of this person before. But I am just not OK with all the hatred he was spewing. AITA?",

      "description": "Let me make it clear that I am in high school.\n\n\nSo we have this program at my school where we get a free hour after fifth period to eat lunch or go tutorials, and I would typically sit with my friends in the debate room. While I was away at a  Speech and Debate tournament, some assholes got into a fight during the free hour at school, leading to staff ending that free hour indefinitely...Which means that we have to resort back to the three lunch bell schedule...\n\n Anyway, because of the new semester, I had to move lunches, and it now I have C lunch on the south campus. \nFine fine, the girl who is my duet partner is in that lunch, so I decide to sit with her and her other friends. I’ll call this girl DP. The first day that I sit with them (Tuesday) everything was fine. The second day, I noticed that some of the girl were talking bad about a mutual friend that DP and I have (I’ll him MF). DP and this girl (MG) were talking about how they hated the daily quizzes for world history and such. DP is like “You sit next to MF every day... why don’t you just copy off of him?” And MG goes “He gets really bad grades... he’s kind of stupid.” \nI’ve known MF for a long time, and I didn’t even know MG’s name, so I got defensive. I told her that maybe he’s smarter than she thinks and she shouldn’t judge him.\n\nMG then proceeds to talk about how her TEACHER told her outright that she got better grades than MF. I don’t say anything, but in my head, I know one of two truths; either that is the shittiest teacher ever for disclosing another Student’s grades... or MG is lying.\n\nLater, MF DMs me over Instagram asking how to debate someone.  Turns out he actually wants to confront this girl who he found out was talking shit about him. I told him to just ignore her, because we are in high school after all, and if he worries too much about it, his grades could suffer. He sends me a screenshot anyway of the list of things he wants to talk to this girl about, and the title is\n [MF’s Last name] Vs. [The Girl’s Last Name]\n\nThe next day at lunch (yesterday), MG is once again talking about MF, and I’m starting to wonder if the girl that was bothering MF was her...So I try to ask her what her name is, playing it off as “oh yeah, I’ve been sitting with you all week, conversing with you, i should probably know your name!”\nShe tells me her first name only. I check my phone to see if the name matches, only to realize that I need the last name.\nThe cafeteria is loud, so I ask DP what MG’s last name is “cause I’m curious”. Alexa tells me. Wasn’t a match.\nI message MF to be careful around MG, cause she’s been talking about him behind his back, saying that he’s an idiot.\n\nOn our way to 6th period, I talk to DP about how I think that her friends are a little rude and if MG is talking bad about MF, she’s probably talking shit about everyone. DP shrugs it off and says that they’ve known each other for years, and she doesn’t think that MG would do that to her. DP does ask that I not tell MF, because the group of girls are just a “certain kind of people” and she didn’t want MF to think that she was the one talking about him (she wasn’t, she said nothing.). To her request, I look on my DMs and see that MF hasn’t seen the messages yet, so I delete them all.\n\nToday, I go to lunch and MG confronts me about talking shit, because I was typing on my phone and asked for her name. I panic and tell her that I wanted to get to know her, seeing as we have been sitting with each other for a while. She asks why I was typing on my phone, I told her that’s just the kind of thing I do when I make small talk and am only half paying attention. She asks why I asked DP for her last name, and I tried to tell her that I thought I might have known her from when I went to private school when I was little (School closed down when I was six, half of us went to public school, the other half went to a different Christian school). She leaves.\n\nDP tells me that MG’s pretty pissed at me, and I make the case that technically, I didn’t tell MF anything and that she was the one talking shit about MF.\n\nAfter lunch, I go up to MG and apologize. I come clean, and tell her that I see MF as a brother, and he told me that he had a falling out with a close friend and I was trying to see if she was that friend. \n\nI was just alerted via Snapchat by DP that her friends no longer want me to sit with them, which I’ll admit, I should have seen coming, but it still kind of hurts (especially considering I don’t really have many friends in C lunch to sit with).\nWhat hurts worse is that DP isn’t really taking sides, not defending or standing up to anyone. \n\nAnyway, am I the Asshole for almost telling MF that MG was telling people that he’s stupid? \n\nTDLR: A girl I don’t know was talking bad about a friend of mine. I asked for her name, thinking about telling said friend, and today she accused me of talking shit about her.\n\nUPDATE 1/30/19: I’ve been spending C lunch in the library instead of eating, I still haven’t been able to discuss the matter with MF but on the bright side, my grades are a lot better due to the quiet and extra study time.  I’m not sure if I should tell MF about MG because if he confronts her, there is a chance that I’ll find myself going home with a black eye.",

      "description": "For context: I’m a dishwasher in a restaurant, and there are two main dishwashers: Myself, and a guy named Alex (not his real name)\n\nI just started recently, but since I’ve started working there, Alex has been shoving all of his closing shifts on to me and calling into work sick, among other things\n\nSo, it all started last Friday...last Friday, it was Alex’s day to close, as usual, he said “hey man, if you take this close tonight, I’ll take yours tomorrow”. Being the ~~gullible~~ nice guy I am, I agreed. \n\nThen comes Saturday....on that Saturday, everything starts off as normal, we’re just working away at the dishes then at 8:24pm he slips on the mat and “hurts” his back. Knowing this, I tell him to take a quick break. He does, and then when he comes back he seems completely fine...then at 8:44 (when the manager comes in to the kitchen), he starts making extremely evident gestures that his back hurts. The manager of course comes over and asks what’s wrong, and Alex explains that his back hurts. Knowing the inevitable, I decided to take my break. At this point, my manager comes up to me and basically tells me that he’s letting Alex go home early and that I’ll be taking the close. I just agreed and took it because it was clear that he was in pain.\n\nI would also like to point out that at the beginning of his shift, he was talking about how the Fallout 76 beta was only open until 12am that night (right when the restaurant closes)\n\nBUT THATS NOT ALL\n\nOn Tuesday Morning, I get a text from my manager asking me to come in that night (my day off) because Alex called in sick. I agreed because why not? Then, the following day (my other day off), Alex calls in sick again but my other manager texted my home phone so I didn’t go in because I didn’t get a message from in\n\nThen comes Friday. When we start our shift, Alex explains that he got food poisoning from the burgers that work gave him a few weeks back because they were ready to throw them out. So during our shift, he was telling me how much his tummy hurts..I will admit, he was looking really rough at the start of our shift. So, the night continues on and Alex is starting to look a lot better so I decided that he would be able to take the close because he clearly doesn’t look too sick...so as we get closer and closer to the time one of us has to leave, he keeps telling me that his stomach hurts more and more but at this point he was drinking pop (he said he couldn’t even keep water down before the beginning of our shift)....and admittedly, I did feel guilty until he said that - on the day he got “food poisoning” - his friend bought him red dead redemption 2. At this point, I basically didn’t even know if I could believe him anymore.\n\nAm I still the asshole for making him take my close even though it was pretty obvious that he was sick?\n\n",

I am capable of finding something sexual in nearly any sentence that can be said by a human being. Of course to not use such a gift would be irresponsible, so I do. Luckily, I found a girl that thought this was absolutely hilarious. We started dating, and I'd guess that atleast 20% of all things said were me making some kind of sexual joke based on what she had said.\n\nShe loved this, thought it was great. I loved making people laugh so I also thought this was great. We broke up yesterday, mutually and in good faith. We decided to remain friends, but to me, it feels extremely weird to make sexual jokes about my ex girlfriend. She thinks that I shouldn't treat her differently because we're no longer together. She claims that if I really want to be her friend than I should continue to treat her the same way as before. This is crazy to me, so I look to outside judgement.",

But I always thought she was somewhat interesting/ secretly a good person, because she had a rough childhood after all (no excuse though) and something told me she wasn‘t that bad after all. \n\nYears later I met her in adult life and we exchanged numbers. First I thought wow she really changed, and we met often and had much fun. In only few weeks we became very good friends.\n(My other friend mentioned she may have borderline because she has this two extremes with friendships.)\n\nSoon I would notice how she drinks every day, smokes a lot of pot and becomes angry to the point that she destroy things in the living room, broke her foot in a tantrum, and fights with strangers.\n\nBut when she sobers up again, she tell me this isn‘t her, that it‘s the alcohol.\n\nWhenever she is high on pot, she becomes a different person, more aggressive and possesive.\n\nOn top of all of this, she knows people that can seriously hurt your body (and mind). \n\nI realized too late that I was now way to deep in a ,,bond/friendship“ with this person, and apparently I‘m her only real friend now, which makes it even more difficult.\nShe often tells me how other persons ,,abadoned her“ for ,,no reason“ and how much she hates them. \n\nI tried to cut her off, by telling her I don‘t have time and so on. But as soon as I don‘t reply, she sends me so many messages, calls me often and so on, tells me she misses me, asks me what I‘m doing and so on.\n\n(I know it‘s not the sub for this but if anyone has any tips how to cut someone toxic off is welcome)\n\nShe is also distant friend with a mutual long term friend of mine.\n\nI don‘t want to get hurt emotionally or physically by her, but I‘m stuck now, I wish I never let her into my life. Now I‘m to scared to cut off the contact. \n\nAnd I don‘t have the physical or mentally strenght for any of her tantrums or abuse when I try to distance myself.\n\nAITA for letting a person with trauma, possible borderline and trust issues so fast so close to me only to trying to cut her off after realizing she is rather a toxic person?\n",

      "description": "Girlfriend, Jane, and I are very serious, we’re talking about getting married this summer. \n\nLong story short she had this male friend since before our relationship, john. John confessed his love for Jane through a social media dm to me. I was uncomfortable but brushed it off. John was fine until one day he walked in her house without permission while we were in bed. They got in an argument and she took his key. Fast forward two weeks and john is over while I’m there. He heads out and locks the door behind him... she calls him back in and takes his apparent second key. \n\nI asked at the beginning if john and her had a past, she told me she kissed him once while they were drunk. I know I’m an asshole for doing this, but I went thru her phone and found out they had been together before her and I were. I told her immediately what I had done, but that I didn’t appreciate her lying. \n\nThey still text and call daily, which makes me very uncomfortable. I’ve tried to express this to Jane but she doesn’t seem to get it. I am untrusting of john and it makes me occasionally untrusting of Jane. We’re planning on moving cross country in a few months, but I can’t handle him around now.. I just want him out. ",

      "description": "Throwaway because my s/o knows my account. \n\nMy bf and I both have started our freshman year at our local college, taking classes on campus, even though we are seniors in high school. This means we can still go to dances, do extracurriculars, whatever we want since we technically are still high school students. That includes going to senior prom. \n\nMy bf accidentally stirred up some drama earlier in the year and though he had good intentions basically my entire friend group hates him, except for maybe my closest friend. I really want to go to prom and have a good time, but I feel like he will just make things really awkward with his presence and it’s already awkward for me trying to feel part of my friend group when I am a little isolated. He is also just very socially awkward and any tension that he feels would make him anxious and sad and I don’t want him to be uncomfortable at prom. I am 99% sure he wouldn’t want to go if I weren’t going; it’s not his thing at all, though maybe I’m just making excuses. He has told me that he doesn’t really care, that if I go then he will go, but I could tell it might hurt him if I go without him. But we would have to try to find a table with people we don’t know and basically avoid my friends the entire night. I really would just prefer if he not go but I don’t want him to miss out or to hurt his feelings. \n\ntldr; friends hate bf, his presence at prom would create tension for everyone.

      "description": "So my neighbor and I originally had an agreement to rotate pick up duties. I’d pick up mine and her daughter for a week, and then she’d do the same the next week and so on. Well a few weeks ago she basically decided she doesn’t want to do any pick ups ever and started calling me during the days when she had to go to the school and telling me that she had migraines/stomach aches/menstrual pains/back pain/etc. \n\nBasically every ailment ever. She’d magically it during her weeks. Then, when I told her enough was enough, she started agreeing to the pickups but pulling out at the VERY last minute by saying she had “meetings” with the doctor. It was cryptic and BS but I picked them both up anyways since someone had to. \n\nLast week, I was dropping off her kid when I see her pull in the driveway with a shitton of shopping bags. She went shopping! When she told me she was “taking her younger son to the pediatrician.” Her son wasn’t even with her. Catching her in an obvious lie I told her this was the last pickup and don’t expect me to do any favors for her anymore. I told her daughter that I can’t take her anymore and to tell her mommy that too.\n\nThis past Monday I went to pick up my daughter when the neighbors kid started climbing into my backseat. I stopped her and told her that I can’t pick her up today and she’ll have to wait for her mom. I led her to a teacher and told the teacher to phone her mom because I can’t take her today. Then we left.\n\nWell ever since then this neighbor has basically declared war on me. She’s telling everyone that I left her daughter on the street just waiting to be kidnapped. She has some sob story about how she was getting blood taken because she fears she may have cancer (???) and even tho I offered to pick up her daughter I didn’t. \n\nMy husband is pissed at me too because he said I shouldn’t have put a child in danger. I told everyone that I honestly had no choice. I had texted the neighbor at least 10 times saying I wasn’t going to pick up her daughter anymore and no response. It turns out too that the teacher had thought I was the mom and it took them 1 hour to find my actual neighbor. I do feel bad that the girl was probably scared being left at school but I don’t know what else I should have done. AITA?",

      "description": "Ok so here is the background - \n\nMy girlfriend and I live in an apartment complex where there are assigned parking spots.  We have an upstairs neighbor who is claiming our spot for their own convenience but there is some back ground here.  I want to know if I am the asshole here.\n\nWe have a two car parking spot and about 4 years ago we let our upstairs neighbor use it at their leisure because at the time we didn't have a car.  Fast forward a year or two -  we get a car and tell the neighbors we need to now use our designated spot.  They got upset that we needed it back and through a minor fit - I thought we got past it because they have their own spot designated in back of the building.  The following year - they had a kid.  They've voiced their concerns before that because they have a kid that it is more convenient and safe for them to now use our parking spot.  I said no about a year back because our relationship with them has degraded over time and we live in a sort of mutual frustration and attempt to just ignore each other.\n\nFast forward to now - I woke up with an email from the upstairs neighbor to our land lord stating a myriad of reasons on why they are more entitled to having the two car spot; things like they have a kid, they want to get a second car and that we have no plans to buy a second car.  They finished off the email stating that we find their reasons agreeable as well as have agreed to them trading the spot for theirs behind the building.  I have never made any agreement to them and they have not come to me about this before hand.\n\nHere's where the aita part comes in - I am a relatively agreeable person and would have worked out a mutual arrangement to share the two spots with them - however - now that they in a sense lied to the landlord about my agreement without coming to me first - I am thinking of just telling them to go fuck off.  I find the whole situation manipulative and on principle do not want to be walked over because they feel they are more entitled.\n\nSo - Reddit - am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR - Parking spot could arguably more useful to them, neighbors handled the situation poorly and now I don't want to give it up over principle.",

He comes banging on my apartment door and my roommate lets him and Katie in and he comes charging at me ready to punch my face in. Katie and my roommate yell at him not to fight me so he restrains himself and yells at me for the next ten minutes telling me how I fucked up and that I had no excuse for what I did.

      "description": "So i need to keep this brief and on a throwaway account. People have been telling me that my gf flirts with other guys and my best friend told me she sees him eyeing his crotch and acts flirtatious around him. I decided to test this out for myself and I made a fake Facebook account, got a lot of friends and i told some people at my school to add him as a friend so it seems like somebody she would know, the mutual friends. He (brian) adds girlfriend as a contact and she accepts asking how she knows him. Brian explains he added the wrong person but should become friends because he's transferring to the university and lives in the area, share similar friends. They talk for a few weeks and my gf never told me about this. They talk about their interests and other stuff and to make sure that she's 100% the cheater i made sure that brian never started a sexual or romantic conversation or even about meeting up. That was all gf. Gf eventually asks him on a date and he asks if she has a bf and she says \"its complicated but not really\" and that was when i had it. I video called her and she was shocked to see who was on the other end of the line. She says i violated her trust and i was an asshole. She ranted about it on twitter and Facebook which clearly backfired. She claimed i led her on and that i am a scumbag. She pretty much proved she was a cheater yet all of the girls in our friend group and her mom harassed me online until i blocked them. I broke up with her, on Facebook via post when she ranted about it causing a massive flame war within our friend group. She went to the university counselor and now they want to speak to me about it and they're upset with me",

      "description": "Backstory:\n\nI go to a lot of concerts. Of course I don’t enjoy going alone, so over time, my cousin (23M) and I (20M) have become concert buddies. Anyways, he’s been a hassle to deal with lately. He’s always wanting me to drive to the shows, and often not paying me back for gas money just because he sometimes helps split parking costs. He’s also been very picky about what shows he’d go to, refusing some of my plans, even though I would always be down for a show of a band he enjoys.\n\nToday:\n\nThe concert was out of town, about an hour and a half away. I drove to his house to pick him up, and off we went to see the show. The drive seemed pretty uneventful until just about 5-10 minutes away from the venue, my car starts acting up. I knew something bad was happening immediately. My cousin, however, was pressuring me to try and make it to the show and worry about it later. I wasn’t having any of that, and pulled over. I called my dad and informed him of the situation, while my cousin called AAA to see what they could do. My cousin hangs up upon seeing the car is acting fine all of a sudden, and tells me to just drive to the show. I let the pressure get to me, and we somehow got there, and I end up paying the $10 for parking. My dad calls back and tells me I just need to get it towed, and I agreed. My cousin still stuck to his idea that we should just worry about it after. Calling for a tow after a late show when so far from home, was out of the question; I knew it would take ages to get a tow truck there, let alone all the way back home.\n\nI told my cousin that I was going to get towed, and since this towing agency requires you to be with the car, I had to go home. He claims he had it under control and I should’ve listened to him. He said he was staying for the show, and that he’d figure his own way home. I hand him his stuff and the $45 I owed him for my ticket. I did this because he made sure to ask for it before I left, stating that it wasn’t fair he had to pay for it and I was just gonna leave. I head out to park somewhere more tow-truck accessible. I wait while my cousin texts and calls me, thinking of ways to get me to stay. “Just wait for the tow guy to get there and Uber here or something,” he said at one point. I told him that wasn’t an option, and he was very annoyed. He kept saying how generous he was being by giving me so many opportunities to stay with him.\n\nDuring my tow ride, he sends an angry text saying that we needed to talk later on. I finally get home, paying a massive $300 since my AAA membership only covers 5 miles (it was about 80 in total), and I call to see what his issue seems to be. He tells me that if something like that happened again, not to tell anyone so it wouldn’t ruin the day, and I should have trusted him. I don’t even understand. I wanted to see the show as much as the next guy, but I fail to see how I’m in the wrong for putting my car above that. I didn’t want to risk it getting any worse.",

(I worry that she might want to start drinking at 13)\nso I spoke to my dad about it and I got laughter back in response because he thought it was funny. \n\nso I forgot about it until I came up again and she was worse. she texted mum she was heading to a mates place and left. mum had no clue where she was going or who she was seeing. (so she could be doing anything with anyone)\n so I told both of them that they should keep an eye on here and they got shitty at me, so I told them I worried for her, (quite angrily I might add) \nI went on about a mate of mine (that they knew) who started out just like this and ended up doing drugs by 15 and had a pregnancy scare at 16. they got more mad and accused me of thinking to far ahead and not to worry. we got in a slight argument again because I said she is my sister I'm aloud to worry, and i thought they where doing a shit job and they went on the your not the parent rant so I walked off. \n\nam I the asshole for telling my parents they are not being good parents?  \nor am I overthinking.\n\n",

      "description": "So I recently moved in with my friend, who I've known since the start of university, and his girlfriend. She's working, he's still at university and I graduated a month or two before we moved in. \n\nWe found a really nice two bedroom flat together that was relatively cheap for city prices. Splitting the rent so that I'm paying much more than them individually but not more than them as a whole. All of which I'm totally fine with. \n\nUnfortunately there were a LOT more costs moving in than I originally thought there would be. We also had to pay to repair two major appliances within the first month. As I'm currently an unemployed graduate looking for work this put quite a strain on my finances and I found myself with very little spare cash. I had enough to buy myself food but buying new bottles of oil, salt, butter and seasonings was a bit too much for me to afford through the whole month. So I asked my flatmate if I could use some of his until the end of the month. He said that was all good and that was that. So over the next 3 weeks or so I borrow, or just use I should say, very small amounts of such food. Nothing that you would actually eat on its own but stuff like salt, pepper, mayo, olive oil etc. and not in large amounts (I'd say I never used more than 5% of any item of his that I used). Suddenly I hear from him that his gf is pissed with me using their shit and he basically asks me to stop, which I do. Then I find out the next day that he bought and screwed on a latch to the cupboard door where they store their food and padlocked it shut...\n\nIt's been about a month or so since then. Now I have no problem with not using their food anymore, that would be wrong (plus I took a part-time job to ease the struggle while I'm looking for work and can pay for myself) but I feel like by physically locking it shut with a key while we're the only 3 ppl that would ever have access to it he's insinuating I'm a thief. I haven't said anything as I do feel somewhat guilty as I may have misinterpreted and overstepped my bounds but just seeing it really pisses me off. What do you guys think?",

So it passed a day or so, and I am on the new class and everyone is nice to me, I already met most of the people. When I get home from that day, I received a dm from a guy (let's call him Noah)in my class, that is best friend's with one of my friends. What can I say, things evolved fast and by the time I noticed he already had fallen for me. The thing is, I'm a flirtatious person and easy-going (normally), and sometime people misunderstand how I am and it happened! Noah thinks I like him, but I am not even attracted to him and I don't know what to do. And the worst is that I am crushing in a guy (Jacob) also from my class, he sends hints that is interested like saying that I could do better and other things. If I really start having something w/Jacob it will broke Noah heart, but I don't want this to evolve more and I don't know what to do..",

      "description": "My boyfriend of 2 years father was horrendously abusive. He still has mild post traumatic stress symptoms from this, and has only recently (as in the last year and a bit) began settling down and trying to become a better person (the abuse only ended a few years ago, when he was 12). He has no contact with him and has told me before he doubts that he ever will,  and that he has no desire to ever really talk to him again. To be fair, this was a while ago, so I'm not sure how he feels now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, today a letter addressed to my boyfriend came through our door. I opened it (NBD, we open &amp; read each other's mail). It was from his dad, obviously - I have no idea how he even got our address, because my bf never told him where he was going when he was moving out or anything. It was 2 pages of just...Nauseating shit. Manipulation, victim blaming, offers to pay for shit (jokes on him, we're financially stable) and unnecessary out-of-place details about the shit he'd done to my boyfriend? It basically ended with a request to come and join his dad at some family thing. It made me so mad. The fucking audacity of him. I really do want him to die brutally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to show my bf this. One part of me thinks that he has the right to see, and I know I'm not his caretaker, but I don't want him to go back to how he was before when he finally seems to be doing better and getting on with his life. I also (maybe selfishly) don't want that old fucks effort to even be seen. WIBTA?",

On the first night we all hung out as a group he tried to kiss a mutual friend after we had all gone to bed. After grafting on my friend the entire night. She’s chosen to ignore this and all power to her. \n\nI know she’s going to get hurt again and I don’t think I can honestly be there for her again. It’s exhausting and I don’t have the mental capacity right now personally to cope with this.

      "title": "AITA For not wanting my soon to be homeless cousin to live with us?",
      "description": "My cousin is a 28 (i believe) year old man. He has never held a real job for longer than a month, he dropped out of highschool, and he has spent time in rehab for addiction to cough drops. He also has a criminal record now because he doesnt know how to drive properly and apparently took a right turn into the wrong lane into oncoming traffic and hit another car.\n\n No injuries but he got charged for it. He lives with his (not mine) elderly disabled grandpa at the grandpas house.\n\nNone of these are reasons for me not wanting him to live with us. My cousin was severly abused growing up by my uncle and my aunt. His father was a drug addict thief who made him live in homeless shelters as a kid. His mom was abusive, though she is now dead from a heart attack. His father beat her in front of him, pushing her out of cars and putting trash bags over her head. Theres no denying that he had it rough. My uncle went to rehab and is now clean with a new wife and kids. He cut my cousin out of his life since my cousin still resents him.\n\nI dont blame him, but my cousin also tends to play the victim alot and hes now an adult.\n\nSo thats my cousins side of things. Abused kid grew up to be a dysfunctional adult.\n\nMy side of things is hes also creepy, weird, and unpleasant. As a child, he took one of our younger girl cousins (maybe 10? With him as 14) and placed her in his lap. I dont know exactly what happened but my little cousin was freaked out after she hopped away, and when asked she said he was touching her. My cousin admitted this and says he regrets it, but it gets much worse.\n\nAs an adult he messaged my other aunt ( i have 6 aunts and like 20 cousins in case youre confused) on facebook. He was normal at first but then started to tell her how hot she was. My aunt asked him why he was talking like that and he said he didnt mean anything and started crying. She blocked him.\n\nThen he messaged my older female cousin and did the EXACT same thing. My older cousin put him on blast and at this point we havent seen him in person for 6 years.\n\nNow last year, my OTHER aunt who he hasnt tried to have sex with is getting pestered by him for both me and my sisters numbers. I am a male and 22, sister is 26. He messages me and I refuse to respond.\n\n\"Hey OP this is Jim, been a long time how you been? Wanted to message you. How is your sister?\"\n\n20 minutes\n\n\"You live in X area?\n\nOne hour\n\n\"Yes i know im a fuck up but we're still family. Idk if you heard but my mom died. We are blood cousins.\"\n\nA day later\n\n\"Wow\" \n\nHe texts my sister as well who is always one for drama. She knows my cousin is creepy but still texted him i believe to get a reaction. Eventually my cousin tells her that he has secretly loved her for years and that he curses god that theyre blood related.\n\nMy sister shares all of the texts with everyone. We all know what he is now.\n\nNow its been another year and my cousin is almost 30 with no job, no education, no skills, no car, and facing crazy legal fines and fees. His life goal is to literally be a rapper like eminem.\n\nHe also has no support now either since his grandpa is going into assisted living and his other family is selling the house. I think hes also been creepy with them since they hate him too.\n\nOn facebook he constantly complains about the abuse he suffered, the fact that he has no friends and no girl, and that he has no family anymore. He posts that when his grandad leaves he will be homeless on the streets.\n\nMy sister, ever the drama queen, asks my parents if he can live with us. I dont think she really means it since he was a creep to her, but i said that he should rot in the street. She says that he is still family. \n\nI do feel bad for my cousin since he has had a hard life and tbh my greatest fear is being like him. Me and my sis still live with my parents but i am a skilled tradesman with 13k in the bank with my own new truck and am trying to start a business. Sister is in college. \n\nI think maybe if i had terrible parents id be like him, perhaps though id never hurt children or go after my blood like some freak. But i also think about him being homeless and realize what hell that would be. AITA for telling him to rot.",

Ever since my older brother left home for college, my mom would always like to come by our room to hang out as my older brother only visits once every few weeks.\n\nFrom that point on, a typical school day would consist of me and my siblings coming home from school by ~3pm, having time to ourselves until 8-10pm, and then my mom would come over to play games on her phone or sleep until 12-1am before she leaves.\n\nAt first, I was fine with having her around since she always talks about how much she misses my older brother, and I assumed that she'd eventually get over it in a few months. But as months passed I began dropping hints about how she should get back to her room, its getting late, and how I feel like I don't have any space but nothing blunt or direct, so she compensates  by alternating between me and my brother's room and my sisters. My brother and sister have also voiced that they're getting tired of my mom's constant visits as well.\n\nAt this point, its been about 6 months since school began and she still has her nightly visits despite being half way through the school year.\n\nSo today, I decided to confront her about it, about how I hated how she comes so often and how I just wanted some privacy and I was getting tired of having her over for so many nights where she could have just stayed in her room but she doesn't take any of this well at all.\n\nShe was in disbelief asking me how could I drive away my mother like that and stating she feels like she can barely live in this house anymore. She eventually breaks out crying and leaves to her room.\n\nAfterwards my sister told me that I went way too far as she doesn't have anything to do and she's been through so much raising us.

He then proceeds to drop a singular, wrinkled dollar into my cupholder and gets out of the car. \n\nNow, I wouldn’t have been mad about it if he had at least given me enough to get a monster on the drive back, all things considered, but the fact that he gave me the worst bill he had pushed me over the edge. I ended up calling him and asking why he hadn’t given me any more than a dollar for taking the time out of my day to make sure he got to work on time, to which he said that, “You said that whatever is fine so I gave you whatever”. \n\nAITA for being upset that he took advantage of that technicality?

      "description": " First off: I wasn’t the most responsible perso, I had one dog that escaped and got put in the pound and when that happened I had lost my job due to some personal issues at work. I couldn’t get her back cause they charged per day to keep her, as soon as I had a job I looked everywhere for her but assume she got adopted since she was a sweet beautiful dog.  I feel I had matured a lot since then and feel horrible for what I did, found a stable job got promoted quickly and been more responsible as a whole. Now my girlfriend: she had been severely depressed and said a dog would help her cope so I had bought her a dog I spent 500 on him well she said she technically paid for him but I had to pay her rent so I feel like I bought him. Anyways me and her are in Love with the dog and her landlord said she couldn’t keep it even if she got him approved as a emotional support dog which I don’t thinks legal specially since he said that she would need a big deposit for animals which I was willing to pay. While she was figuring it she figured if perhaps she couldn’t keep the dog she would give him to her sister, and she would train him first cause her sister was too busy to train him and wanted a trained dog already. Now I got really upset and said I would take care of him but she said I wasn’t responsible enough which made me upset cause I honestly really have changed for the better, the house I share with my roommates is dirty yes mostly laundry and dishes but I ain’t cleaning after 5 dudes just my part and her house,it was the whole reason I moved to her town to get away from my past. I told her why I am responsible now but she wouldn’t let up I feel cause she didn’t want to say no to her sister so I got really upset and we Fought over it. Is it wrong of me that I said I should keep the dog since I technically paid for it and am a more responsible person? ",

I smile back at her, so I go back to looking at clothes and she approaches me and says ''hi''.\n\nShe then introduces herself and says that she thinks I look really good, I say thanks and we chat for a bit. She then asks for my number and I give it to her, and then we depart.\n\nAnyway, I gave her a fake number. I was surprised by a few things:\n\nFirst, that she approached me. This has never happened before. But I loved the validation/attention I was getting. This made me feel really good\n\nSecond, she asked for my number instead of social media (Insta/Snapchat/Facebook)\n\nThe reason I gave her a fake number?

I shout at her that I want an explanation and she says that I’m supposed to ask her before I swap them.\n\nNow, I ask every single time I know it matters, if I want to throw something, if the dishes are supposed to be here or there (Jewish very religious meat milk thing(I think it’s a bunch of bull crap)) and whenever she tells me not to touch something I simply don’t, but she says I had to ask her if I can swap between an empty orange basket and a full black basket and ask if I can move them, she didn’t even notice for a month, and I didn’t know it was even important.\nSo, I keep shouting at her (sometimes calling her an idiot and stupid and a bitch) and she keeps saying that I’m:\n1.think too highly of myself and that’s why she tries to tell me I’m stupid all the time (but when I admit I’m wrong it’s to show of even more {when she couldn’t say I never say I’m wrong she switched to “it doesn’t matter you only do it when it’s convenient to you and only to make your ego even higher”}).\n2.don’t have respect for her things even though I ask her about the dishes and ask if I can throw stuff and don’t touch what she tells me not to touch.\n3.that I have problems and I need to address them, even though I’m completely healthy IMO.\n4.that I disrespect her and belittle her when she keeps doing that to me, and when even if I’m with her she keeps thinking I’m against her.\n\nNow she tells me I can’t live with her which is totally fine I mean it’s still her house but I really do think I’m not the asshole... am I? I did shout but she did too, I did curse (a lot more then her) but she did too, she also cried and I just said that it’s stupid because she has nothing to cry about.",

      "title": "WIBTA if I secretly visited a friend at university without telling my other friend who goes there?",
      "description": "Okay, so I have a feeling that I might look like an asshole straight away from the title, but let me give a bit of context.\n\nI’ve been friends with this girl since we were young, we’ll call her Lily. For the first few years, everything was great, but as we got older the friendship became quite toxic. Lily fell out with pretty much everyone I knew, and became very jealous of my other friendships, claiming that I was replacing her. For a while she was my only friend because I felt bad for being friends with anyone else. Then I realised that I couldn’t spend my life like that, and so I reached out to other people more and made some new friends. Lily was friends with them at first, but eventually fell out with them too. We had a huge fight about it just after we left school, and almost broke friends, but she apologised and I forgave her.\n\nWhen she started university, I went to visit her quite early on. At the time she was friendly with her flat mates, so I talked to all of them and became quite friendly of them. I exchanged contacts with one girl (we’ll call her Nina), and over the next few months we talked a lot and became quite close friends. In that time, Lily fell out with most of her flat mates, and had a huge fight with Nina’s best friend, ending up with the friend kicking her out of their plan to share accommodation next year. Obviously, Lily hates her now, and is on speaking terms with Nina but doesn’t like her very much. \n\nRecently, I went to visit Lily again. A few months have passed since my last visit. It was a bit awkward because I wanted to spend time with Nina too, but the only chances I got were at night when we ran into each other in the kitchen when Lily was asleep. Then I met another friend of Lily’s, who she’s planning on living with next year. He also hates Nina and her friend, and told me that they kicked him out of the housing plan too. I asked Nina about it, and she explained that he’s basically been stalking her friend, even going into her room at night when she was asleep, and so they decided they couldn’t live with him. Obviously she could be lying, but her story matched up completely with what I’d been told by Lily already, just putting things into the right context, and also Lily has twisted stories in the past to the point that I don’t trust anything she tells me anymore. \n\nSo, after I’d returned home, I was still in contact with Nina. She mentioned to me that there was a shop she’d like to show me next to her university next time I was down there (it’s several hours from where I live). I told her that, much as I’d love that, i didn’t think I’d feel comfortable with visiting Lily next year if she’s going to be living with this creepy friend. Obviously I’m going to try and warn lily about this friend, but I haven’t done so yet as I’m not sure how to bring it up. Nina said I was welcome to visit her instead, if I’d still like to visit.\n\nI would love to visit Nina, because we’ve grown quite close recently, and I think she’s an absolutely lovely person. Staying with her would be so much fun. But if i stayed with her, I’d also be staying with her best friend who Lily hates. Lily would never let me do that, because she believes that I shouldn’t be friends with people who she hates (which in some cases is fair enough, but let me remind you that she hates nearly all of my friends already). I would have to keep it a secret from her. Of course she may run into me there, but I’d try not to let that happen.\n\nYou may also be wondering why I don’t just break friends with lily, since she’s so controlling. I know I probably should,  but with her track record of falling out with people I worry that she’ll never keep any more friends. She has a lot of mental health issues, and at one point I had to call an ambulance because she was texting me threatening to overdose. Her mental health is a bit better at the moment, but could quickly get worse, and I worry that if I leave her she may actually do something.\n\nWhat should I do in this situation? I don’t want to be dishonest, but I kind of already am being dishonest just by being friends with Nina. I don’t want someone controlling who I spend my time with, but I can’t just abandon Lily, because then she might have nobody. I feel like lying about it is the only way.",

      "description": "I really like falling asleep cuddling my boyfriend. I cherish the time we spend together in silence, just listening to each others breathing and drifting off to sleep. However, most nights he likes to watch YouTube videos until he falls asleep. I usually just lie next to him and fall asleep before he does while he is still on his phone. Sometimes I spoon him while he watches. His lack of attention towards me at bedtime makes me feel a little neglected... I think that this also affects our sex life because when he is distracted by his phone he doesn’t get turned on or initiate sex. It’s not like this is a problem all the time though, we still have sex fairly regularly. If I try to initiate sex he sometimes doesn’t notice cause he is too focused on the phone.  I have told him that I really wish he could fall asleep with me without using his phone but he tells me this is selfish because he enjoys his bedtime YouTube routine and this is what he used to do before we dated. AITA for thinking that falling asleep is something for couples to do together? Or am I just being needy and wanting his attention when I shouldn’t?",

      "description": "I’ve always lurked this subreddit but never thought I’d actually ask anything. Obligatory “this was yesterday”.                 \nI’ve recently kickstarted a new lifestyle and have been eating better and also started attending an LA Fitness. I hate the treadmill with a burning passion, so I’ve been trying to find more creative ways to be active (hiking, tennis, etc).             \nOne thing I’ve really gotten excited for is Zumba. The gym has classes nearly every day for it, and it kicks my ass. Supposedly people come for certain instructors but I just come whenever I feel it fits my schedule.            \nYesterday I went to a 10:00 am class and there were tons of people waiting outside as there was yoga going on until the Zumba class began. One older woman left the yoga class a little early and came up to me and this is how our convo went:                 \nHer: What class are all these people waiting for?          \nMe: Oh, it’s Zumba!                    \nHer: Who’s instructing?              \nMe: Oh, I’m actually not sure....               \nAnother girl: It’s Jamie.                \nHer *turns back to me*: Is she as good as Megan or Ashley?                     \nMe: I’m sorry. I don’t actually know the names of any of the instructors. I just come whenever I can.                     \nHer: You don’t know Megan or Ashley? And you’re supposed to be a Zumba dancer? Who comes to classes and doesn’t know the instructors? These classes are for people with a special love for Zumba and people like you who think it’ll make you actually look good ruin it!!!!            \n             \nThis got me really sad and angry as I am pretty overweight and dancing makes me happy and I didn’t understand how this woman could be so shitty. I basically told her that I never called myself a “Zumba dancer” and that she could fuck all the way off if she thought I gave a shit about what she thought about my workout decisions and she huffed and walked off.             \nI told one of my girlfriends about it and she said I could have been nicer or just ignored, but I don’t think this lady has the right to tell me if I can be in a class that’s for all members.              \nI probably shouldn’t have told her to fuck off but... it felt deserved. So, AITA?             \n       \nTLDR: Lady gets upset that I don’t know the instructors by name, says that I’m ruining Zumba and that it won’t make me look any better and I tell her to fuck off.",

      "description": "Everything in my head tells me I did nothing wrong here, but I'm also socially stunted and notoriously bad at reading social cues, so I'm second guessing myself here. \n\nSo some context before I begin. I live in an apartment complex that comprises of several buildings scattered across what used to be open farm land. I live on the second floor of a building thats at the very end of said farmland. So you need to drive a bit to get to my building and climb a large noisy set of stairs to get to my apartment. Furthermore, I have blackout curtains. They don't filter out everything but you have to be seriously scoping out my apartment to know if the lights are on.\n\nI also used to work door to door sales for several companies. The first rule of door to door sales, is to identify yourself the moment you get a response at the door. Not doing so increases your risk of having the cops called, or worse, being shot. Not even exaggerating, it's happened. \n\nThis happened awhile ago and I'm wondering if I was the asshole for how I reacted. It's 6pm on a Sunday night, and I'm half way through a bottle of wine chilling in my living area when I hear a loud engine pull up to my building below. Someone gets out of the car and absolutely charges up my staircase to my apartment door. At first I think it's my neighbor next door. We get along well and sometimes when she's coming home from a party she uses my stair case instead of hers (our porches connect).\n\nBut this isn't her. She runs up my staircase which my neighbor has never done, and starts banging on my door like she's trying to break it down.\n\n\"Hello!?\" -- it's a womans voice\n\n\"Hello? Who is it?\"\n\n\"Hello, can you open the door?\"\n\n\"what do you want? And who are you\"\n\nno answer. but also no footsteps back downstairs so I know this person is still at my door. after a few seconds she starts banging at my door again. \n\n\"Ma'am you need to identify yourself!\" -- still no answer. Alarm bells are going off in my head. Again, I've worked direct sales. This person is refusing to give at least a name, then they're not police and they're not a salesperson for any company. I'm also at that level of drunkenness where you're nice and warm and very aware of your limitations. If this person forces their way in I won't be able to hold my own in a fight. \n\n\"Lady you need to tell me who you are or I'm calling the police. This is not okay.\"\n\nThreatening to call the police must've scared her because she starts charging back down my stairwell at this point. once i can't hear the footsteps anymore I grab the small knife from my cutting block and run downstairs. I get to the bottom just as the woman is getting in her car. I call out to her but she doesn't respond. finally right as her car is in front of my stair well again she gets out of the car and addresses me. \n\nShe's looking for building 5. \n\ndafaq really? Building 5 is two buildings up the drive way and it's where the laundromat is so it's well lit. I point here in the right direction and head back upstairs hiding my right hand from her. I'm still not completely calmed down right now, and I'll be definitely sleeping with the boot knife I keep on my night stand. I guess I just need to know if I over reacted here. ",

      "description": "Alright so this is a long one (sort of) so bear with me! \n\nBackstory: I’ve dated this guy for two and a half years, the first year into it he cheated on me while I was away for about a month getting my health in order \n\nRecently, we’ve just gotten off our seasonal job of 6 months and that was already stressful for our relationship, and now we are having money issues. He can’t save money worth shit, and owes his stepfather and me (me being around 400 hundred dollars). I, on the other hand, am doing decent with saving money but I’m the one paying bills and all the groceries as we live together, and stuff for our new cat (that he decided he wanted that has now turned into MY cat).\n\nNow, I’m only 20 years old and he is 24. I have the internet in my name, and he has the power in his. His mother recently decided not to pay her own internet in a different company’s name, and decided to sign up with my company and use my name as the account owner. I told my boyfriend that I didn’t want her stuff under my name as I’m the “child” in this situation, and she’s ruined her sons credit and her own by never paying bills and the bills collecting. My boyfriend then told his stepdad for me (as I was too scared) and his mom found out and it was a very ridiculous situation where she was taking advantage of me because I don’t know how to say no, and now her stuff is now under my name. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, I noticed that my boyfriend has been talking shit about me to his mom, about flights home to visit my family for christmas and how I always bring up money issues (which I do not, I might have mentioned a week ago that I was sorry and could not pay his ticket back from my parents) and lied to his mom about how he thought I booked return (I definitely did not and he knew), and his mom is now bashing me, blaming her husband and her fighting on me and that she will “call my mom” and have a discussion with her. I finally told him last night to f*ck the money he owes me, and that once we hit my parents place I will be staying a bit longer to visit.\n\nIn reality, I plan on staying at my parents and not returning as I’m fed up with all this that has happened, and tons more.\nSo, AITA for wanting to finally be done with this relationship? Or NTA? \n\n(also, sorry if there is any confusion, this is a jumbled mess but tried to be straightforward as possible!) ",

      "description": "I rent on my own a semi-detached home. It’s in a good location for me (very close to the train to work and there’s a supermarket that’s walking distance as well). Despite a small yard out the back, the lease explicitly states that there are no pets or animals allowed on the property (I assume guide dogs would be fine though?).\n\nThrough work I had to go out of state for around a fortnight. My girlfriend (who lives with her parents) offered to housesit since she’s on uni break and set herself up more in my place.\n\n3 days before I’m due to return, property management emails me to say I’m in breach of my lease with a pet on the property and that nuisance barking has been reported (attached is a photo of a dog in my yard). I need to fix the problem or I’ll be asked to vacate if it’s not fixed.\n\nI call up the missus and ask what’s going on. It was supposed to be a surprise, but the dog is a rescue and apparently was days away from being put down due to being unadoptable. Now it has a forever home at mine and we’re bloody heroes for saving it.\n\nI definitely my cool. Threw around a lot of fucks. “What the fuck were you thinking?”, “stupid fucking decision”, etc. I reckon I threw in an insult or two as well. It was a fight and I felt I had no control of the situation.\n\nUltimately, I say the dog has to be gone by the time I’m back. Not my dog, don’t make it my problem. I return and the dog is still there. It’s a nice enough dog (barking aside) but I can’t have it as I don’t want to risk my lease. I don’t particularly even want a dog right now and it’s just a problem I don’t want to deal with. The dog has to be gone. \n\nApparently I’m a heartless bastard because according to the missus, if this dog is returned it’s curtains for it and it’s put to sleep. Girlfriend’s parents can’t have it for some reason and no one else wants it. So for the past few days the missus has been crashing at friends places with the dog she refuses to get rid of. Some (not all) of our mutual acquaintances are pissed at me because “real men don’t act like that”. \n\nI don’t really feel like the arsehole here, but that’s probably what all arseholes think.  \nSo, I’m opening myself up to judgement (although it's with a dirty throwaway).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**  \nGirlfriend was housesitting my place. She adopted a dog from deathrow. My lease doesn’t allow pets. Get warning from property management about the dog so I tell girlfriend to get rid of the dog potentially condemning it back to deathrow.",

      "description": "Good friend of mine and myself work in the food industry.  We are both chefs. I recently took a new catering gig and hired him on as my Sous. \n\nI put my name on him in order to get him hired. A couple weeks go by and we are killing it although he has made a couple of bad first impressions amongst the owners and other management. \n\nFast forward to the night before it all went down. We are having a few beers. Its 10:30. I go home because we have to be at work at 8am. He stays out for \"just one more.\" I go to sleep and wake up at 5:30am to him calling me, he is plastered drunk wanting to go in to work immediately. I tell him to go to bed and that he better be there at 8.\n\nI call him at 7:45, no answer. I go to work and he's not there. His girlfriend texts me and says he's in the hospital. Apparently he passed out on the street and woke up in the hospital.\n\nHe shows up to work at 9am pissed off because I told his girlfriend he's probably fired. We have a back and forth. I tell him that I covered for him and if he just goes to work we can forget about it. He starts working but is being an asshole to everyone and has a crazy look in his eyes. \n\nHe wants the day off because he just got out of the hospital,  claiming he wasn't drunk at any point last night. I asked him if he remembered talking to me at 5:30 because he sure as shit was drunk then.\n\nI told him the friend in me says go home and sleep but right now I'm your boss and you gotta work. I know you just partied all night and fucking wound up in the hospital. \n\nI told him it's up to you, go home or work but you know what's going to happen if you go home. He went home. We haven't spoken since, it's been about a week. \n\nIn my mind he blew off work by drinking all night. Not taking this seriously at all. He was making me look bad at my new place of employment. I felt like I had to put my foot down and let him know we cannot be late and that we need to lead by example.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n",

I’m going to be totally honest with you, I never considered myself to be the asshole in this situation but I’m starting to doubt myself. Recently, I told this story to a group of friends and they all said that I had done a really shitty thing. I’m posting here to get more opinions because, of what I did was asshole-ish, I really want to know. \n\nWhen I was in college, I took this one class that had a ton of group projects and group papers. We never got to pick our partners. It was annoying, but it wasn’t really a problem until the last project of the semester. \n\nFor our last project, I was placed in a group with two other people. Let’s calls them good student and slacker.  Slacker was known for not putting much effort into the group projects. For this reason, good student and I decided to give her the easiest portion of the project. In hindsight, we should have just done the whole thing ourselves but, at the time, we felt like there was no way we’d get it done without any help from slacker. \n\nWeeks go by. Good student and I are working very hard on our respective portions of the project. We hear nothing from slacker. She’s been cutting class and won’t answer our emails. \n\nFinally, one week before the project is due, I get a hold of slacker’s phone number and text her telling her that we need to know whether she’s going to complete her portion. She assured me that she is working on it and that she will get it to me in time. I’m somewhat doubtful, but I have other classes to worry about and can’t afford to take on her part of the project. \n\nTwo hours before the project is due, slacker sends good student and me her portion. I’m reading through it and it sounds surprisingly good but it also sounds familiar, as if I’ve read it before. Good student points out that it looks a lot like one of the articles we used to research the project. We confront slacker and she admits that she used the article but that “it will be fine because I changed some words.”  \n\nUm, no. Changing a few words is not enough. \n\nGood student and I freak out. There’s not enough time to redo her portion. We’re both feeling really stupid about not just planning on doing her part from the beginning. \n\nWe decide to submit the project as is but I email our professor and tell her what happened. I ask that we each be graded for our individuals portions of the project. Professor agrees. I never spoke to slacker again, but I heard that she had to retake the class. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So me, my parents and my little brother went to a park reserve for an afternoon hangout. We walked to the view point, where we sat and had lunch. When we were done, my mom pulled out some plastic bags and we cleaned all the trash we had left behind. We were left with 3 small trash bags. We then continued to walk around the park for another hour or so, continually searching for bins to which we could throw out bags into. The park had no bins whatsoever. We searched EVERYWHERE and even asked the handful of people who were also there (there were no park inspectors or anyone official for that matter) but no one saw any trash bins anywhere.\nIn the end we decided to leave our bags on a branch of a tree at the entrance to the park (near the parking lot), where if someone would come to clean he wouldn't miss it but it wouldn't be just stranded in the middle of the park. Our car is rather new and very small, and we didn't feel like it's our responsibility to take the trash with if the park inspectors don't even care about putting trash bins in the park. \n",

I'll spare you the details of the conversation we had after about the why/how, but i was supportive as hell and i told her i'd think about it\ni'd be lying if i said i hadn't desired other people before, but never thought about acting on it purely because it was only physical and because i didn't want to ruin my awesome relationship (me and gf are also just really good friends, and i know that in the foreseeable future i won't be connecting emotionally with anyone other than her)- so i'm pretty much down to try this but am i the asshole for being gender biased? i can definitely see myself being disturbed by her picking certain guys, but not any girls.. am i the asshole for thinking we should be able to veto each other's 'candidates'?\nthanks for your input\n\nL\n\ntdlr: AITA for thinking we should be able to veto each other's possible fuck buddies?

      "description": "I've had a tough year - my mother and two good friends passed away, I've been very ill, had two colonoscopies, my daughter started kindergarten at a private school, and my partner and I are trying to gain custody of his eleven year old daughter - so I haven't been working as much as I usually would, especially during the holiday season. I do freelance work, so my employment isn't is danger, I'm just processing a lot, and haven't been working any more than I have to to pay the bills and, like, buy tea.\n\nDue to everything going on, I decided to paint pictures for the people on my list. The kids are getting a few items, but they're also getting paintings from me instead of their usual one big gift. My partner is still getting them gifts,too.\n\nThese are paintings that I usually sell anywhere from fifty to a hundred USD, and they're gallery quality. I finish them with resin and gold gilding, and each painting takes anywhere from three to eighteen hours of *hands on* time, not to mention how much time it takes each painting to cure. \n\nI mentioned to a buddy of mine that everyone was getting a painting, and she called me stingy, lazy,  and said that I'm shaping up to be a nasty 'evil step mother' to my step daughter, and it was an asshole move. She really harped on the fact that I was going to ruin my kid's Christmas with paintings, and that my step kid would hate it.\n\nSo, will I be an asshole if everyone gets a painting for Christmas instead of gifts?",

We recently talked about moving to a new place of our own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really like her and I'm sure living together will work great. The only problem I might have with this is that she currently doesn't have a job. She receives about 700€/month and wants to live in a 1000€/month appartment (so 500€/month each). I can't see how this will work out. Either she will have to live off her savings (which are not illimited I guess) or I will end up paying for most of the stuff we need. Plus, if things don't work out for the two of us, I definitly can't afford a 1000€/month appartment on my own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI obviously don't have to tell her how to manage her finances but this situation makes me uncomfortable. Would it be reasonnable for me to ask her to wait until she finds a job before looking for a place for us ? Or WIBTA ?",

      "description": "AITA for not giving my absolute max into my degree and for thinking that my parents should let me deal with my health and do things at my own pace?\n\nI am a college student (19yo). \nI started last year and failed the year (my first time failing ever). I'm studying Biochemistry, which i dont really enjoy and am not really good at. I was pretty much pressured by my parents to study science when my passion has always been art and languages.\nHowever, they are paying for my studies (like they did to my older brother) and it does not come too cheap (my family isnt rich but not struggling), but I swear I am trying to make it worth. Possibly not my best, but the best i can do for now.\n\nI should talk about my relationship with my parents. It is not good. Pretty toxic. Psychologically abusive father and my mom uses me as a emotional cane. They dont believe me when I say I'm struggling. Be it physical health issues or psychological. I moved away because of college, and I could finally see a psychiatrist on my own accord.\n I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and when I told my father, he laughed. My mom simply said she didn't think it was a real worry. The doctor said I've been depressed since my pre-teens and I've recently started to take antidepressants (barely 2 months in) and things seem to be slowly getting on track. But by then, my second try at the first semester was already doomed.\n\nMy parents treat every little academic failure of mine as if it is a huge dissapointment. If i get a bad grade the automatic reaction is a sigh and a \"i dont know what will be of you.......\" it just makes me feel even worse and frustrated because i know i can do better, but somehow, right now, i somehow cant (does it make sense?). I absolutely hate to feel like I am wasting their money, and I hate feeling like I failed. I pretend to pay back my first year (failed year) when I start working.\n\nI chose to prioritise my health over my studies at my parents cost and pretty much against their will.

      "description": "We've known each other for more than 10 years and have had a FWB relationship for most of that time but nothing that ever lasted more than a few months at a time and always ended mutually. Because of this we have always been good friends and always seem to end up in each others lives every few months. I should also mention that we are both addicts and struggle with substance abuse, but I am almost 5 months sober.\n\nAbout 6 or 7 weeks ago she (32F) called me (30M) out of the blue asking for help. Long story short, she said she wanted out of her situation with her then boyfriend, alcohol addiction and other shady lifestyle choices (red flags 1, 2 and 3, I know). I offered to help her by letting her stay at my house so she could detox, find a job and get herself back on her feet as long as she was serious. She agreed, ended her relationship and came to live with me.\n\nIt was a bit rocky at first but once she got through the withdrawals we started having a lot of fun with each other. She found a job fast and was already contributing (without me asking). About 2 weeks in her first relapse came. I'll admit I was probably a bit more upset than I should have been so we argued about it. I explained to her that recovery is the most important thing in my life and her using makes it extremely difficult for me. I stressed that I want her to be able to talk to me when she is struggling since I am going through the same thing. She apologized and seemed to understand.\n\nA couple weeks go by, she texts me at work saying she invited her ex over to drop off some of her things she left. At first I didn't mind (at least she was up front with me about it), but then she came home drunk and tried to hide it. I had to call her out on it before she admitted to it. She also insisted that she truly only wanted to get her stuff from her ex, but we still had another argument that lasted a couple days. Things cooled off as the week went on and I forgave her. Another couple weeks go by and everything is mostly great.\n\nUnfortunately, last night she had another relapse (and tried to hide it from me again) and that pushed me over the edge. We had a huge argument that lead me to kicking her out that night. I explained her that I've lost her trust because she continues to relapse and tries to hide it from me, and that it is affecting my own recovery. If its recovery we both truly want then a relationship between us isn't going to work. Its going to be the same thing every time.\n\nIn the end she was able to find someone to come get her within an hour of me telling her to leave, from some guy she had been talking with on Snapchat. She also left all of her belongings at my house (including her dog and phone) which have since been boxed up and put in the garage. She most likely did not show up for work today. I feel rather guilty because I care about this girl, and that I probably brought this all onto myself. And now that I've kicked her out I've screwed up her recovery process too.",

      "description": "So, I have two of my friends who are in a relationship currently living with me in a studio apartment. They have the living room, and I have my “bedroom” with no door. We’ll call them Mike and Anna.\n\nLiving arrangements are definitely subject to change in a few months once we’ve saved up enough to move to a 2-bedroom. The reason we’re all squished in here is because the two of them needed a place to stay to get away from Mike’s narcissistic parents who essentially were trying to ruin Anna’s life over her “taking him” from them.\n\nAmong the other issues that can arise from three people living in a studio, Mike and Anna obviously have sex. Most of the time, they’re not bad about it and either do it when I’m not home or at night when they have a video playing or something to muffle the noise. \n\nThey aren’t loud and obnoxious about it. Usually. The problems arise when they don’t have anything playing to muffle the sounds and I hear....well, everything. And I can’t make myself to go sleep until they stop. Even if I can’t hear it, just hearing it start and knowing it’s going on is enough to keep me on edge even with headphones. Usually it isn’t for long.\n\nLast night though, I got about four hours of sleep just because they started at around 12:30am and kept at it till about 2:30-3am. And it was a good bit louder than it usually is. Ended up blasting videos from my phone at full volume because I left my headphones at work and was also annoyed that it kept going for so long. And very tired. I realize it was petty, but ugh.\n\nHaven’t mentioned it to them as of this morning. Don’t know if I need to. Still irritated about losing sleep over it. I can’t exactly tell them don’t have sex. But I dunno, it’s always skeeved me out when people bang near where I can hear all the little noises and such. \n\nWould I be an asshole for asking for...some kind of compromise, I don’t know what, with having sex? Until we get separate rooms in a new place, that is. I don’t want to make them feel unsafe or that they need to walk on eggshells around me. Do I just keep quiet about it and try to find a pair of earplugs that render me temporarily deaf for when I go to bed?",

      "description": "Hello AITA. I’m truly torn on this one so looking for judgement.\n\nTo set the stage last night we were at a sidewalk bar since it was gorgeous out. We were right next to an intersection with a stop sign and all of sudden a ridiculously nice car pulled up to the stop sign with a much older man and a girl that was MAYBE 19. He was screaming his head off calling her c-word, b-itch, that she had broken thier arrangement and on and on. They were there so long the car behind them honked twice to get them to move. \n\nAll of sudden the guy says “fuck this!” Really loud and his phone came screeching across the sidewalk and landed right under my chair. My friend saw him throw it and they drove away.  I assumed it was the girls but it was unlocked so I checked and judgeing from this dudes Instagram with hundreds and hundreds of duck lip selfies, it was his phone. \n\nI quickly changed the passcode and we spend the next 10 minute laughing out asses off how ridiculous this guy was. All of the sudden his car pulls up the the intersection, he turned on his flashers literally blocking traffic so he could get out and look for his phone. He went up and down the bar seating asking if anyone had seen his phone but IF Anyone saw we had it they didn’t say anything because he was such a douche.\n\nSo cops came and warned him to move along so he did. Maybe 30 minutes later the phone locked with a message “this is douchey douchersons phone. Huge reward. Please call me at xxx xxx xxxx if found.” \n\nI have a friend who works at the bar across the street so I went over, called from thier phone and called the number. He said his reward was $40. I literally laughed at him and hung up. In the next 20 minute the phone was apparently remotely erased. \n\nSo that’s it. I have no idea what I can do with this phone and at this point I think it’s a done deal. Part of me finds it karma, part of me knows how I’d be freaking out if it was my phone and I habe some sympathy. But I would never chuck my phone out a car window to teach my hot sugar baby a lesson. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Background Information:\nI have a discord server that I go into about every day and it's the main way any of my close friends contact each other. I have known most of the people in the discord server for about most, five years and least, one year. We post very personal information inside it, and is just an all around safe place for me and probably my friends. The server is split owned by all four of us, we all have access to the main owner account of the server. We are all basically co-owners.\n\nStory:\nMy friends and I recently started to play a game called CS:GO together. We have been playing it for about the last three days, when some guy on the other team decided to send a friend request to my friend, that I will call Friend 1. Friend 1 decided to accept the friend request, but I didn't really think much of it. Until when we que up for another match of CS:GO and this rando joined in our party. This confused me a little but didn't care much since we would get in a match with randoms anyway. In the game the guy doesn't seem to speak much and is quite, in fact I had more fun talking to the other guys in the match then him. My initial thought after that match was that it seems like this guy doesn't talk much and will probably be forgotten about. I then tell Friend 1 that I'm going to go make some food, watch TV and be back later.\n\nAfter about two hours of eating and cleaning, I come back to none of my friends in the discord voice but they were all online. My first instinct was to @ them, after I was invited to a group voice call a few seconds later. It had Friend 1, another close Friend I will call Friend 2, and some random person that I did not recognize. They said they were all playing Roblox prison escape, which was weird becuase I haven't played Roblox for a long while, but I decided to join them. While this whole game is happening, I ask who the stranger is, no response. I ask again, with no response. They just keep talking about the game, I check to see if my mic is muted and it's not. I ask another time and finally get the reply of \"It's the guy who friended Friend 1 in CS:GO. This shocked me becuase I didn't think there was any connection with the guy but obviously they thought otherwise. After a long two hours of playing this game and still barley talking to this guy, I decide to pack up and go to sleep.\n\nThen the next day, I wake up and have a normal day doing normal me things. When near the end of the day I dicide to check on the discord server. To my dismay, I see this random dude I just met, is in our personal discord server. (Anyone we have added into the server, one of us has at least known for a whole and met them in real life at least once), but now there is this random guy.\n\nI talk to Friend 1 and my other friend, Friend 3 about it. Neither seemed to care too much but I later convinced Friend 3 this was an issue. I didn't want some random guy in here. It seems like he is also treating this server to himself, as all the chat rooms are filled with pictures he uploaded and text conversations. All of these together made it almost impossible to just ignore him. \n\nI bring it up to Friend 2, who is apparently the guy who invited the random. Friend 2 seemed to have a _crush_ on this guy, someone we literally just met two days ago, over the internet! I am outraged and tell him to please not bring random people into this server unless we all agree on it. He tells me that I am being an asshole and that he will leave if I kick home. At this point i felt like Friend 2 liked this random guy over me. I talk to him about how we should all agree on things like this and not go behind each others back. After a while it became a shouting match and everyone was getting irritated, but then Friend 3 kicks the random out of the server and I feel better. Friend 2 gets mad and leaves the server, as in he actually leaves the server not just the voice channel.\n\nI think Friend 2 is over reacting and I only wanted to keep the server with close friends. Friend 1 is complaining about how he thinks we both were overreacting and that I was apart of the issue.\n\nI think in all, the random guy should of been kicked no doubt about it. I think Friend 2 should of never invited him into our personal discord channel without asking all of us first.\n\nAdded Info:\nI don't mind talking to new people and would love to actually meet the guy, but I would only like for that to happen outside of the discord channel first, then a decision would be made about inviting him.",

      "description": "So over Halloween my girlfriend and I had our big group of friends over before we all went out. Some girls in our group are friends with this girl (we'll call her Kelly) but my girlfriend and I are not close with her at all.\n\nIt was Kelly's first time over to our place but we knew her through these friends. Since it was Halloween we had a bunch of candy here.\n\nKelly got extremely drunk and then poured the candy (which was in the individual wrapping) all over herself, the couch and the floor intentionally, thinking it would make a good joke. Then she jumped up and announced that we needed to get downtown and got people to start ordering Ubers. \n\nAll of us were then pushed to get our shoes and stuff on and get out the door because she had already ordered us a 30$ Uber. So my girlfriend and I didn't have time to clean up.\n\nWhen we got home, the candy was everywhere, along with other stuff she left and messed up in the apartment. And we saw that our cats had gotten into the candy. \n\nMy girlfriend and I then had to clean up this big mess she left and we called her out in the group chat that we had made. Just saying that she made this mess, that the cats got into it, and that she could and should have cleaned up the mess that she made. She then got back saying that when we had the party we should expect a mess to be made, which we did, and that it's not her fault and that we make messes at her house (she lives with our friends) and that we don't clean it up.\n\nWe knew that there was going to be a mess of some sorts but what she left was extremely excessive and it is definitely her fault. Also we go to her house but we never make a mess and if we do it is cleaned up and it's always small.\n\nSo now 4 months later she has distanced herself from our entire group of friends, not even acknowledged myself or my girlfriend, and won't even take part in things like roommate Christmas or doing chores around the house that she lives in with our friends.\n\nSo Reddit was I the asshole for getting mad at her and would I be an asshole if I drank the whole bottle of tequila that she left at my place\n\nTL:DR, my friends roommate came to my house on Halloween, got drunk, poured candy on the floor that my cats got into, I got mad and she got defensive. She then stopped speaking to me or my friend and I want to drink the tequila that she left at my house\n\n",

They're friends, not particularly close but they talk occasionally.

I was slightly bitter but figured its whatever they're just getting lunch no biggie. The part that upsets me is that after lunch she invited him into her home, just the two of them. He said no, of course, because he agrees its pretty strange. \n\nI confronted her on the issue and she was pretty upset saying I didnt trust her and I shouldn't care because they're just friends and wouldn't do anything. She made me feel like the bad guy and I kept wondering \"am I really being irrational?\" But I kept coming back the the thought- it just doesn't make sense for them to hang out alone at her place when they're not super close or anything.

      "title": "AITA for sheltering a stray cat?",
      "description": "I recently went from living alone to sharing a house with three other people. This week, a stray cat started wandering into the house. Two days ago it started to get bolder, going down to the ground floor. This tuesday night, I decided to go to the terrace and I found the cat huddled in the neighbor's roof. It allowed me to pick it up, and I brought him back to the ground floor and fed him.\n\nI suspect it is a female in heat, due to the way it's acting (pacing around, headbutting my hands to be petted) and the fact that I heard a cat screaming like females usually do after coitus the night before. It also has a wound in the head, probably caused by a street fight. The wound spreads to the ear and seems to be dirty, with some spots still bloody. It also seemed to be really hungry.\n\nThe thing is, my housemate will have absolutely none of a cat inside the house. She doesn't like cats, think they are dirty and wanted me to put it back outside at once. I initially refused, at least till I could feed it. I've already contacted the NGO that helps stray animals in my city, and we are looking for a temporary home for the cat. I told her I could keep it locked in my room for the night, as it late at night when I've caught it, but she didn't agree. She said it would be better for the cat to be put back outside anyway, as cats prefer freedom to roam.\n\nWe compromised by shutting it in a small storage room we have, but this space has an open roof that leads to the second floor. When I woke up in the morning, it was gone, and I found him laying in another neighbour's roof. It stayed there during the day, where I couldn't reach it, and wouldn't come when offered food. In the afternoon, it jumped the neighbor's fence and disappeared for the next day, wich brings us to today.\n\nI was in my room a few hours ago when I heard that scream again. I immediately went upstairs, where I saw the cat leaping back to the terrace. When I followed it, I saw it staring down a second cat, probably male. After some time, the second cat went away and the first moved to a spot where I could pick it up. It's now in my room. I've fed it again, cleaned his ears and applied a bactericide to the wound.\n\nMy roommate is not at home right now. She will probably spend the night away. I have no intention to keep the cat as a pet, nor to home him for a long time. I only want to keep her from running away again until I can found someone to shelter her, at least temporarily. When I moved in, the issue of bringing a cat to the house was never discussed, as it was not my intention to do so in any future moment. TBH I'm not a big cat fan, but I dont want to let this one run around with a wound that can get infected and a very real possibility of getting pregnant (my town has a pretty big stray problem). I would like to at least have her spayed before she goes back to the streets. But OTOH, I don't want to bother the other people in the house. AITA?",

As I still maintain a relationship with him, he has told me that I will be the listed beneficiary to essentially everything when he goes, and to \"figure it out\" with my sister when that happens.\n\nMy sister wants nothing to do with him anymore, and I'm virtually certain she will refuse anything offered. Would it be ethical to just keep everything if she doesn't accept it? At the moment it looks like when our parents pass we'll be splitting whatever our mother leaves us, but I'll be getting everything from him.",

      "description": "I have a few friends from college and we are all in a group chat together and have been for about 2 years, about 6 months ago we met this girl, let’s call her Abby, and she was nice and we got along well so she ended up being added to the group chat.\n\nAbby can sometimes be quite narcissistic and a little self centered, which most of the time is OK and none of us mind, however she has a tendency to send selfies and fish for compliments when we’re talking about something serious. We are also the only female friends that she has.\n\nOne example is a month ago another girl “Charlotte” had to put her dog down and was upset and wanted to let her feelings out on the chat as we were her only support system. Abby messages the chat saying “Oh no i’m sorry :(“ and disappears for about 20 minutes while we’re trying to help Charlotte feel better.\n\nAbby is back online and sends some selfies to the group asking what we think, which we all agreed was a bit insensitive and I messaged Abby privately telling her that and she ignored the message, so I assumed she got the message.\n\nThis is becoming a regular occurrence and almost everyone in the group has told her that there’s a time and place but we have just been kind of brushing it off.\n\nLast week one of my closest friends dad got diagnosed with cancer and messaged the group asking if we can come round to her place as she doesn’t like to be alone. We all agreed apart from Abby who wasn’t online. 45 minutes later she sends about 15 photos all at once to the chat asking to pick out which one would be the best for her instagram.\n\nCharlotte messages me privately asking me to remove her, as the other girls are getting annoyed at her behaviour during serious times. When we’re all joking around Abby is funny and can be really fun to hang around with.\n\nI don’t know wether it it’s because she doesn’t understand how to react in certain situations, or if it’s coping mechanism but it is starting to grate on us. I would feel bad cutting her off as we are basically her only female friends, but we have tried to tell her how to react and never called her out on it publicly or in front of one another. \n\nWould it be a dick move? \n\nAlso sorry i’m on mobile I know I suck.\n",

In our work environment he is the only co-worker on my shift and we are constantly next to each other in a small room.\n\nSo here I was sitting down when he hasn't done work all fucking night, he shows me some stupid cheese meme and proceeded to full belly laugh at it for 20 plus minutes. Finally I snap and tell him \"Dude shut the fuck up and go do your patrol it's an hour before we get off. And it's obvious your not really laughing cause it sounds so forced\".

      "description": "Last week was my (M26) girlfriend's (Tara) 21st birthday. My friends and her friends all took a trip to Atlantic City where we all paid general admission to have a good time for a DJ she was dying to see. We pregamed with enough alcohol in the parking lot and even some of my buddies I hadn't seen in a while were there.\n\nAround halfway through the night, she was dancing with her friend (Meg). I saw a bouncer approach Tara and Meg and told them to go with him. I grabbed Tara and told her to come with me, not with him because I could see what was happening. It was loud, so we didn't converse but Tara gave me the \"1 Second\" finger and slipped past the VIP ropes and onto some guy's table where they handed her and Meg champagne glasses and she \"cheers-ed\" with them.\n\nTara came back probably within 5 minutes and Tara didn't drink the champagne but Meg stayed, so that's not my problem. My problem is after she left me to go with the bouncer, one of my buddies (who I hadn't seen a while) Jay, saw this happening and told me \"Don't worry bro, she's probably just trying to get a free drink.\" but for this to happen in front of all of my friends is humiliating and I looked like an idiot in front of all of my friends. If my girlfriend wants a drink, I can happily pay for it; especially on her birthday.\n\nThroughout the night she was taking snapchats with other guys (and girls) and not really paying much attention to the group she came with, but lingering around with other friends she bumped into and then rotating between our group and her other friends.\n\nAfter this we went back to the car and talked/argued the rest of the night. I told her that her leaving to another guy's table was the cherry on top and she seemed more focused on others rather than how her actions were making me feel, but she says she was thinking about my feelings the entire time and thats why \"she came back\" after going with the bouncer and accepting the champagne.\n\nTara says she only went with the bouncer to another guy's table because she initially thought he was going to boot her and she was afraid of being kicked out, but I said then she should have just come with me and we could be kicked out together. (But I figured she wasn't getting kicked out in the first place) My best friend also agrees with me, and based on Jay's comment; I think he does too.",

Five minutes later the assistant coach walked straight up to me and told me to go fuck myself and stormed off. I wasn't sure if he was joking or not, so I started to go after him. He turned and followed up with, \"Get the fuck away from me.\" It was pretty awkward, because everyone heard the whole thing.\n\nFor context, a couple months ago the assistant coach added me and a few other guys to a group chat and all we do is roast each other.

      "description": "So basically, my girlfriend and I have been dating for a relatively short time (5 mo.) and we have been long distance for about 3 of those months. We have a solid relationship, not in love yet, but really enjoy spending time with each other, sex is great, enjoy each other's company, and are very similar in many ways. \n\nRecently I have been concerned about the amount of time we get to spend with each other. It's very difficult to develop a relationship with her in NY and myself in Michigan. Her birthday is in May and she is going to Florida to celebrate with her friends a week before her birthday. After asking what she was doing ON her bday in NY, she told me her friend is coming the day before her bday and staying with her the weekend. I made it apparent I was a bit peeved that she did not express she wanted me there for her birthday, something I thought was pretty normal for a budding relationship. She reassured me that she would be in our hometown a week after her birthday. I assumed from that she meant we would make time to celebrate then. She lives in a small, one room apartment so visiting her while her friends are staying with her is not an option. Should I feel upset that she did not invite me or express she'd like me there ON her actual birthday in NY? I guess I feel like she should want me there but is fine with spending time with her friends over me. I have expressed I would fly over whenever she has time, and I was assuming I'd get an invite because birthdays, in my mind, are a time you always spend with your significant other. Am I being too insecure and was I an asshole for getting upset? Should I let it go and be content with seeing her a week after? If I was in her shoes I would want her to fly to see me or I would want to fly to her and I suppose I feel that this is a red flag that she wants to spend time with her friends and really did not think about or address my feelings. \n\nThanks.

You can get in a lot of trouble out here for it. \n\nAlso, I live in an apartment. My apartment has checkups every so often by maintinance to check smoke detectors and air filters. I don't want to end up getting raided or something because a maintinance guy catches a whiff of the green stank that's finding it's way into our apartment.\n\nMaybe I'm worrying too much. Maybe it doesnt matter. But just the other day, coming home from the store, I swear I could faintly smell weed in OUR ENTIRE APARTMENT. Maybe we have a connected HVAC or something, who knows. I know they do it on the balcony, and it woffs up to our apartment through our door. \n\nShould I tell maintinance/landlord? Should I tell the authorities? Would I be putting someone in a lot of hot water over something trivial?\n\nTldr; The people living under us smoke a lot of weed, and it is making our apartment spell of said weed.

It was 9:45 and my mom needed to go to work but the dog isn't very well behaved and isn't allowed on her job site.  Her roommate won't allow her to leave the dog there unattended.

She reluctantly takes the dog to work with her knowing her boss would be unhappy but not force her to leave. \n\nLunchtime my mother calls me desperate for help as Kim isn't giving her straight answers about where she is and what she plans on doing with her dog. We go for lunch and try to get ahold of Kim before both going back to work. \n\nI message Kim and she responds right away. She tells me she's at a friends house and she's getting a ride home right away. I tell her I need to drop off her dog right away and I can meet her anywhere she is or give her a ride home.

So as far as I know, H doesn't have an urgent need for repayment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there's me: 18, working my first job, averaging about **25 hrs/week,** just received my 2nd paycheck (first was already spent on some essentials), currently looking for a 2nd job, having a cosigner, and having imminent student loan repayment in the coming months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI obviously don't want to make my cosigner worry about me not being able to pay rent and mess up that trust, so I planned on saving this paycheck to ensure that I always have enough to pay my share of the next month's rent/utilities/etc. So I say my plan and it does not sit well with my other roommates apparently. One suggests I should pay at least half (when my paycheck is right about half how much I owe when I need to do other things like open a savings account. \n\nI then bring up that my hours are soon going to be cut from the **25** to about **12 hrs/week** (you know, literally making half as much money) while I still don't have a 2nd job and that H will be paid when they will be paid and I'm trying to ensure some stability for myself so I don't have to worry about not having enough to cover my share and having to then owe either my roommates or my cosigner money for paying the rest for me. \n\nThen H responds and says that she would like the remaining month rent and the necessities paid for at least and the current month's rent by my next paycheck (this is the first time I had heard any specific deadlines).\n\nKeep in mind, nobody has ever had issues (maybe didn't vocalize, but I'm doubtful) with me repaying them. As well, while I'm fairly certain even with making half as much I'd still be able to cover my share of rent but I just wanted to be secure. And of course there's the fact that this is literally my first time managing my own paycheck and monthly expenses so I'm still hesitant about things and learning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to start paying H by my most recent paycheck paycheck and delaying payment by at least a few weeks? It honestly just felt like my other roommates had a very \"fuck how you feel, you need to pay\" mentality. ",

      "description": "To make a long story short, a friend of mine has been seeing someone for the past year or so. \nFor context: I have known this woman for 5 years. We have an internet-based friendship. I have been speaking to her almost daily over that time.\n\nFor the past year, she's been talking about almost nothing but her girlfriend.\nThis wouldn't be an issue if their relationship was healthy. I'm fine with the \"oh my girlfriend is so great and I love her look how proud I am!\" type deal. In fact, it makes me happy to see my friends have finally found someone who will make them happy in turn!\n\n\nBut it's not. \n\nThe overwhelming majority of the time, she's talking about how she wants to kill herself because of the things her girlfriend is saying, or how she feels valueless because of something her girlfriend has said. Or sends me screen-shots of her girlfriend where she's intentionally gone out of her way to goad a reaction out of my friend. Or made her upset somehow, or manipulated her into doing something she didnt want to, or completely invalidated her feelings... A few times her girlfriend has upset my friend by trying to force us to stop talking because she's apparently jealous my friend RPs/spends time with me... You get the idea.\nQuite a few of these topics fall close to personal triggers. She is aware of this. It still happens anyway.\n\nA few days later, it's like she's forgotten the conversation entirely - and goes back to sending me screen shots of unrelated topics and conversations with her girl, often following the lines of (their) in jokes, or things they find funny.\n\nIt jumps back and forward between \"My girlfriend upset me, look at this\" or \"I am upset because of something my girlfriend did\" or \"I want to f** die because of this: (screenshot)\" to \"lol (insert screenshot of in joke)\" \"(insert conversation about their two characters)\" \"(completely out of context screen-shots that have nothing to do with me or our conversations)\" \"(out of context sexual screenshot) would you believe me if i said this was about dragons lol\"\n\nOn the rare occasion, she'll ask for my advice regarding her relationship. Then ignore all of it, and forget everything I said as well.\n\nThis has been going on ever since the start of their relationship. So.. About a year or so.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I asked her to stop talking about her girlfriend, period?\n\nAnd.. If not... How should I go about this?\n\n\nTLDR: Friend is in a relationship. Relationship is dangerously emotionally and mentally abusive. Friend jumps between venting about how bad the relationship is, and how much she wants to die because of it, to sending screenshots about their in-jokes and unrelated conversation. \nWould I be the asshole if I requested she stop bringing her girlfriend up - good AND bad - all together?",

My sister and I (male) both endured abuse growing up by my father. A lot of the beating happened because of bi polar reasoning's of my dad, my dad not happy with B+'s in advanced math classes, and just anything that made him angry. Even my mother has suffered abuse (MOSTLY verbal, emotional)  from him and we've BOTH witnessed it.  He's not willing to accept his wrong either, when we got older I called him out on it and basically told me that i need to stop complaining about it and that its a normal thing in life, \"get over it\".\n\nSo i was talking to my older sister today (lets call her Nura) after i came back from college and was complaining to her about how much i hated coming home during the break because then i'd have to interact with our dad. I'm just saying things like \"idc what he wants, im gonna do whatever i want to do. I just want him to leave me alone or just accept I wont be like how we wants me too\". After hearing this Nura starts getting annoyed and says im too \"entitled\" and tells me off for wanting to much. \n\nSo AITA for not wanting to do anything with an abusive father who refuses to change?",

I’ve been telling him for a while that this needs to change and he keeps saying he will start a diet tomorrow or next week or when we pick up the next load, but it never happens and there is another bag of chips and a 2 liter in his hand. I’m worried that he will get disqualified medically from driving for his high blood pressure.\n\nI always have fresh fruit and vegetables in the truck and thing like lean cold cuts but he just keeps getting junk food.

      "description": "I started a job at a catering company as Catering Supervisor 5 years ago and I was given an assistant to help do setups. I quickly discovered my new assistant never stopped talking. We would work 6-8 hours doing these setups in a ballroom by ourselves and she would go on long rants about the most mundane things. At first I tried talking to her like any normal human being but I soon found the conversations with her to be uninteresting, boring, lame, etc. Worst of all, most of the time when she talks, she stops working. She just stands there rambling using her hands to emphasize what she’s saying. I’ve said to her in the past, “Hey I don’t mind talking but let’s keep moving while we talk.” That lasted maybe a day before she went right back into doing it. \n\nShe also seems to miss social cues when people try to tell her they’re not interested in what she’s saying. \nFor example: one time we were sitting down for lunch and she starts telling me and my boss about some vampire anime she discovered. After about 10 minutes of explaining the show, my boss very politely said “Yeah that’s not really my kind of show. I’m not really into vampires or anime.” Instead of changing subjects or moving on, she continues to explain the show for the entire 30 minute lunch break. Me and my boss would try to change subjects and she would loop it back around to her vampire anime. \n\nSoon after, my company hired two of her friends. When we would do setups, the three of them collectively would just rant about whatever! I don’t think I’m an asshole boss but I had to get on to them several times. “Girls, you’ve been talking for almost 10 minutes and you’ve done nothing. I don’t want to be here all day. Please, move faster.” \n\nI finally went to my boss and pleaded, “I don’t think _______ is right for this job. She never stops talking. She stops working when she’s talking most of the time. Her friends are just as bad. Can you please say something to her?” And my boss basically said “Well, we need the help. Just ignore them.” It’s hard to ignore someone you’re stuck in a room with for 8 hours who never shuts up. \n\nI don’t know if you know someone like this but it’s so obnoxious. I use to pretend to go to the bathroom just so I could cut off her train of thought. Or just leave the room in general to stop hearing her voice. I would come home every day annoyed and not wanting to speak to anybody because I felt I got ear-raped every day at work. \n\nFinally, I came up with the idea to just wear headphones. I would wear headphones during setups and she would yell my name or tap me on the shoulder to get my attention. As soon as I answered her question, I put the ear bud right back in and went right back to what I was doing, I could see the look of defeat on her face when I wouldn’t engage her in conversation. We would be in the middle of working and she would tap me on the shoulder and start telling one of her pointless stories. I would cut her off and say “I’m sorry I really wanna hear this podcast. I’ve been waiting all day to hear it.” Things got done quicker, every hour was way more productive and I became less annoyed at work. \n\nNow, fast forward to today and we have three women at work (my assistant included) who do this exact same thing. I’m not trying to be sexist but no male that I work with excessively talks. One girl, we’ll call her AAA, tells these long drawn out stories and she’s very loud and boisterous when she tells them. It’s a little obnoxious. She’s a cool, nice lady but once she gets going there’s no telling when her story will stop. You’ll be leaving a room with your hand on the doorknob and she just keeps going and going. \n\nThis other girl, BBB, is a bit weird and will also never stop talking. We will sit down and eat lunch and she’ll come over to where I’m at and talk the entire lunch period and never touch her food. And her subject matter is always a little weird when she’s not talking about her cats. She interrupts people ALL. THE. TIME. You could be like, “My car had a flat tire the oth-“ “SPEAKING OF CARS...”\nAgain, she misses social cues and doesn’t know how to read the room. People have been straight-up rude to her to let her know to be quiet and it seems to go right over her head. She’ll even follow me around during caterings (when I can’t wear headphones) just rambling about whatever. \n\nIt’s so bad that one time my assistant and BBB were locked into a conversation with each other and me and some coworkers were making bets about who would walk away first. \n\nSo now, whenever I work with any of these three coworkers, I put on headphones and completely ignore them. I will go so far as to not even make eye contact because if I do, they will try to engage in conversation. I feel this is better than me finally snapping on them and saying something like “YOUR STORIES ARE BORING, LAME, NEVER-ENDING AND NO ONE WANTS TO LISTEN TO THEM! PLEASE STOP TALKING AND LEAVE ME ALONE!!” I don’t even give them a chance to speak to me. \n\nTL;DR I work with three women who talk way too excessively so I wear headphones around them snd ignore them so work gets done faster.

      "description": "So two nights ago I matched with a girl who seemed pretty cute. We sent maybe three to four messages in total but they were pretty deep from the outset since she opened with a question about what I liked about my personality. Overall I could tell she was pretty smart and part of me wanted to end up trying to see where things but part of me was also hesitant. I was hesitant because I apparently hadn't realized that she had kids when I originally came across her profile. At this point in my life (I'm 27/M) I don't think I'd be ready to have kids or take on the responsibility of dating someone who has kids. I was considering the possibility of trying it out until I came to the conclusion that since I'm not too sure about it, I probably shouldn't go for it since I would be entering a dynamic that might cause more harm than good. As for why I matched with her, some days I'm in the bad habit of just swiping off the first picture or so and then other times I actually take the time to read all the way through a profile. I know this is a bad habit and after this I don't think I'll ever do it again. Anyways, AITA for just straight up unmatching her yesterday morning without telling her my reasoning? We had only sent in total like 4-5 messages each but I feel like a jerk for not saying why we unmatched. Maybe I'm over thinking things but part of me wants to message her on facebook and apologize since I know how it feels to match with someone and then get unmatched. But also I don't know if telling someone \"hey I'm sorry I matched with you, but the reason I did was because I don't think I'm ready for kids\" especially after I've already done the deed would be a good idea either.

      "description": "I know it's perhaps unreasonable to even scrutinise myself this much because in the moment it was a clear \"strange behaviour, so report it\" kind of case. I guess I'm just here for reaffirmation that, perhaps, you would have made the same choice in this situation. Or confirmation of what I have been thinking, that perhaps I was out of order. \n\nI walked into a KFC with the only intention being to use the restroom. I get into the restroom and it only has 2 urinals and 1 toilet stall, and the toilet stall is occupied. I had a lot of bags so I wanted to go for the stall since then I could put it down more comfortably, and out of the way. The toilet stall door was open and with the way I was stood, I could see the reflection of the man standing in front of the toilet on the tiles, he couldn't see me but he must've been aware of my presence. \n\nAnyway, I don't peek and just kind of space out for a second while I wait, and it's getting to be quite a while now so I start to pay attention. Then I noticed the quieted grunting, the jingle of a belt rattling quickly, and I see his reflection and I see his arm vibrate. At this point I think this guy is rubbing one out and get out of there and report it to the manager.

I have worked at a store before but this one is so incredibly different and involves much more stress and areas to cover, and I don't think I am able learn everything in the span of a week. I was afraid telling the truth wouldn't have mattered and my boss would have convinced me to do it anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boss told me they would have a hard time replacing the shifts this week and the evening where I would work alone. Am I the asshole for declining this offer and possibly causing them loads of trouble just because I'm not willing to take this risk?

      "description": "Hello people of reddit, first time poster, recent reader and a very Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you all!\n\nSo I'll try (and most likely fail) to keep this short and sweet. Every year, my family travel out to my Uncle's house a couple of days before Christmas to get together and celebrate in our own way, so we can spend time with our partners, wives, husbands, children etc\n\nNow for most of us its about a 2 hour, 130km (85 miles for those in the U.S) drive. This year I was tasked with being my Aunt to the party. Now unfortunately she is the WORST backseat driver because if you go over walking speed, she freaks out and starts screaming and yelling at you to slow down.\n\nFor the record, shes perfectly able to drive herself, but doesnt like to drive anywhere she doesnt know\n\nNeedless to say, I wasn't looking forward to this as it would turn a 2 hour drive into a 3 hour drive.\n\nSo I pick her up, and drive slowly, and save one or two complaints about the weather, its actually a very nice trip, until we get to the motorway/highway.........now in my country, there is a minimum speed limit on the motorway of about 50kph/30mph, this is a legal requirement and you can get stopped by the Police for going under it.\n\nSo we get on the motorway and she immediately starts freaking out. Shaking, asking me to slow down, blessing herself, screaming when a car goes past etc.\n\nSo to try and keep her happy, I slow down to about 50kph and talk to her, explain that this is as slow as I can go but that shes safe and that we're going to get there safe and sound.\n\nUnfortunately this does nothing and she keeps ordering me to slow down, slow down, SLOW DOWN!! Even slapping me on my arm. At this point, I warned her to keep her hands to herself and just kept driving.\n\nWe continue on for a few more minutes and she keeps telling me to pull over, which you can't do on a motorway outside of an emergency, I ask why and she wont give a reason, so I keep on driving, at which point she grabs the steering wheel and pulls it causing me to cut across a lane of traffic and grind against a guard rail, which also tears off my wing mirror.\n\nBy some minor miracle I dont crash and get back in control before coming to a stop, but not before having to physically restrain her to keep her hands off the steering wheel.\n\n\n At this stage, I dont feel safe with her in the car so I pull off the motorway into a service station and kick her out of the car along with her suitcase, after taking photos of some of the damage to the car itself. And off to the party I go, despite her very vocal objections.\n\nNow most of the family are angry at me for leaving her all on her own at the service station, and she has been trying to get me to cover the taxi and hotel fare she had to pay to stay at a local hotel.\n\nSo Reddit, I ask for your Judgment, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I was caught in the middle of a very uncomfortable road rage incident this morning on a two-lane expressway.\n\nI was in the right lane going the speed limit, listening to music and maintaining my speed. I know I’m not a fast driver so I always stay in the right lane to let people pass me or let cars merge onto the expressway without difficulty. It's morning. We're all likely commuting. I just want this to be easy for everyone.\n\nA pick up truck (I’ll call this PUT) pulled up next to me in the left lane and started matching my speed.\n\nAt first I thought PUT was trying to pass me, but when I slowed down or sped up, PUT matched my pace and stayed completely adjacent to me. So I just kept my eyes forward on the road and maintained the speed limit, not looking at this driver who is now making a huge line of traffic behind both of us. (For what it’s worth: I’m female and have been in situations before where a male driver pulls up next to me and tries to get me to look at him. I’ve learned from experience that it’s best not to look, because I really don’t want to see whatever it is that he or his buddy is trying to show me.) PUT could pass me if he wanted. Out of the corner of my eye I could see the truck was really beat up so I thought maybe it was having engine problems.\n\nI turned off the music so I could better hear PUT’s engine. That's when I realized that the whining hum sound I thought was being made by PUT was actually the car behind PUT honking obnoxiously. Just one long, whiny honk. So I guess PUT was in the left lane matching my speed to create a blockade to punish the car for tailgating or beeping or something and now it had escalated so this car was furious. I dunno. \n\nThankfully I get to my exit and steer off out of this mess. The car speeds into a left turning lane so he can get past PUT, beeping at PUT the whole time (I could watch this now, because I was at a stop sign.)\n\nCar gets in front of PUT and slams to a halt.\n\nPUT has to hit the brakes too. Like I said, PUT is not in decent shape. There’s no guarantee that PUT would have been able to stop so quickly.\n\nThe car speeds up abruptly and slams the brakes again. I’m watching this all because if these idiots crash into each other someone is going to need to call an ambulance.\n\nI had to drive away at this point, so hopefully they didn’t crash.\n\n\nSo, I believe that both of these drivers are assholes for creating a dangerous situation. My question here though, is: Am I also an asshole? Should I have sped up to try to get away from these two? I feel like I did the right thing but I also feel bad for all the people stuck behind my dinky little car tooting along at 55 and these two dildos having a speed war at 7 AM. What would you have done in my situation?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I'm not sure what it is that is holding her development back. She wears a diaper, she doesn't talk often and when she does she screams until she gets what she wants. \n\nThe problem isn't so much that she is or isn't, the problem is that my daughter who is 3 is so much more advanced than her that people often think my daughter is older. She is potty trained, she gets her own food, brushes her teeth, takes her own baths, she is very self sufficient.\n\nEvery time she hangs out with her cousin, she regresses hard. She cries for her water bottle that is 5 feet away, she says she wants to be in diapers again, she won't feed herself.\n\nI hate it. She loves her cousin but I'm sick of her holding my daughter back. It's not my fault sge can't figure out how to not shit herself when watching TV. Her parents refuse to do anything to better the situation or correct her. At this point I find it more detrimental to allow my daughter to continue being around her than benefit. \n\nMy niece doesn't hurt anyone on purpose but she does have bouts of rage and if she does hurt someone she thinks it's funny. This has lead to my daughter hurting my youngest with excuse \"I was just trying to be funny.\"\n\nAt this point I think it's more detrimental to my daughter to be around her cousin than a benefit.\n\nSo.

      "description": "A little backstory; this girl (we'll call her Amanda) and I used to date (a whole different story), we ending things, and after a month of mutual silent treatment, began to talk again. We both had emotional troubles, and we would help each other through them as they came up, but a few months before the story takes place she began to constantly prioritize her problems over mine, and her depression got worse, and I begin to get tired (literally) of staying up until 2am listening o her rant about how no one cares about her. \n\nOn to the story.\n\nIt was early April of 2018, and Amanda had been talking a lot about suicide for the last month. None of it was serious, just \"oh my math homework makes me want to jump off a bridge\" type of thing.  I knew she was depressed but didn't see these red flags. Then, on the sixth, we get to talking like we do most nights and it eventually comes out that she had been cutting herself. It wasn't life threatening, just a scratch with a safety pin, but I was understandably concerned. Not only had she not told me when she had done it, but she was playing it off like no big deal. I didn't know if this was the first time, but I didn't think so. I told her that I would call the police or an ambulance if she didn't tell me immediately the next time she felt like cutting (seems harsh, I know). \n\nA few days go by, a mutual friend and I talk with her nightly and six days later (on the 12th), she sends me a picture she drew of a bear that had red lines on the arms and legs (I think it was a bear, it's hard to tell). At the time I was exhausted, and fed up with helping her. She had been making me nervous the whole week with scant replies and unread messages, and when I glanced at the photo, I didn't see the now obvious cut marks. I ignored it and went about my business. Then she sent an improved version. I'm already in bed at that point as it was 9:30 (I know; that's early, but I was tired and I had school the next day), and I was dozing off, when 20min later I got a text from our mutual friend who is freaking out as well. \n\nAmanda cut again. \n\nI responded to Amanda, asking how she was. She lied and said she was \"great\". I wasn't having this. I asked again. She says she's \"just fine\". I know she's lying. I engage in a quick exchange where she claims I should've seen the picture and known what it meant, but I'm fed up. It was only a few scratches with a safety pin, but I had promised, and her family needed to know (they already might have, and I made an educated guess that they would be supportive). I went out to my living room, and texted Amanda and our mutual friend the whole time (our mutual friend also suffers from depression and was feeling pretty crappy about letting this happen). I told my parents, researched Amanda's house address, and called the RCMP. The operator was understanding that it wasn't necessarily a life threatening emergency situation, but I stayed up talking to Amanda until 10:30pm exactly when Amanda sends:\n\n \"\\*insert my name\\*...what did you do?\".\n\nThe officer didn't stay long, but Amanda was livid. If a mean name exists, I was called it after that incident. She still hasn't  forgiven me, and we still, when we speak at all, get into heated debates about what I should have done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, AITA for calling the police on friend who lied to me about her self harm, and risking us both of us getting in potential legal trouble?",

So here I am for outside judgement on my/his behavior. \n\nI've been dating this person for a short while now, less than a month. Obviously I like him quite a bit, and in most aspects he's kind and considerate. The hitch is that it's fairly obvious to me that he has what some might call a \"fetish\" for women of my race. He himself has admitted that he prefers dating this type of woman, and all of his past partners have been of the same race. Also (and I think this is what really tipped the scales for me) he enjoys including racially stereotypic language into our sex life... what you might call racist dirty talk (\"race play\" is the proper term). I'm totally kink-positive and open to indulging him there, but I also suspect that this is indicative of (at least somewhat) genuine feelings he has about my race. At the very least, it doesn't seem to square super well with his respecting me as a person. \n\nMy feeling is that he has some unhealthy views about race, and I have told him as much. Of course he denies dating me *only* because of my race (and that there's nothing wrong with liking a certain look), and also that being into race play is not indicative of sincere prejudice. I'm sympathetic to that, really. But I don't want my affection for him to sort of gloss over what could be a very real problem.  \n\nI apologize if that all sounds very confusing!

      "description": "I was dating this girl for about 4 months before I went on a month-long solo trip to Europe, something I'd never done before. We weren't exclusive at both of our agreement, but were heading to serious territory. She proposed that if I messed around with anyone overseas, she doesn't care as long as she doesn't know about it, which was fine by me and I asked her to do the same. We talked constantly through the whole trip and it felt like the distance really did bring us closer together. I brought her back a gift from one of the countries I visited (and wasn't cheap at all) which was both a memento from my trip and a kind of token that I was ready to take things to the next step.\n\nI get back and she can't wait to see me. She loves the gift and says she'll have it with her forever. The next week we're attached at the hip - going on dates, lots of sex, cuddling, and all the good stuff. Then, out of nowhere she ghosts me. A a couple weeks later she finally gets back to me saying that she doesn't want to date anymore. Her reasoning was, IMO, bullshit for various reasons especially with how out of the blue it was. If she was lying and had met someone else, I earnestly don't care. We weren't exclusive so I understand. However, when it was clear that we were done, I asked her for the gift back since it does mean a lot to me and I only gave it to her for hopes that things would be more long term. Now, I'm not one to do something like that - a gift is a gift - but given I'm not sure when or if I'll be able to visit those countries again and I was home for barely a week before the ghosting, I felt justified in this case. She told me off like I was being a psycho and completely cut me off.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "This is probably going to be a no brainer for you guys, cus I sure feel like a piece of shit.\n\nSo my husband is overweight and has tried going on diets and exercise programs multiple times, and it seems like every time I'd compliment him on weight loss, he'd gain it right back.\n\n Last week, he said he was going on another diet and the other day, texted me that he lost 3 lbs and showed a picture of the scale. My husband has this pattern of relaxing on things whenever I give him positive reinforcement, we'll get to that later, and so instead of complimenting him, reminded him about the factor of floating weight. He did not respond to it until this evening when  he stepped on the scale with his clothes on and said that the reason he gained some weight was because he usually weighs it when he's nude, and then again I responded that floating weight is a thing. He then got incredibly upset and said that he needs encouragement from me, and not negative feedback, otherwise he'll feel like he's not making any progress. I tried apologizing and explaining that it wasn't negative, and that he seems to have a pattern of gaining the weight back whenever I compliment him, and said that I felt that the best thing to do would to be to not compliment and remain neutral. \n\nHe then blamed it on other factors; like the time I got kicked out of Planet Fitness was what made him stop exercising and made him gain the weight back (then afterward said \"I'm not blaming you for that\" as if that would make it feel like I'm not being blamed for getting kicked out.)\n\nI then tried apologizing again, and tried giving another example of how me giving positive reinforcement doesn't work for him, as he does not do his chores or help clean the house on his own, as he needs me to tell him to and then compliment his work when he is finished. He then responded \"Oh so we're making this about that now?\" \n\nFrustrated, I left the room, saying that he's not entitled to my emotional labor. I feel horrible for brushing him off like that, but I really don't know what else I should do. Am I the asshole? Should I keep giving him positive encouragement and just keep coddling him in the hopes that he'll improve? Or should I just not talk to him about any of this?",

      "description": "Some background for context: My long time boyfriend and I recently celebrated a move and have been loving it. We even have some extra space, which admittedly we haven’t found a use for yet. Now don’t get me wrong, one of the things I love about him is that he’s very kind hearted, which can lend itself to being easily taken advantage of. I’m also a kind hearted person but I refuse to be taken advantage of. One thing we have disagreed with a lot is that his younger cousin (20F) has been seeing a guy off and on for around 2 years. The relationship has always been pretty messy in my opinion, but I keep that to myself as it’s easier to not rock the boat. As they are very off and on, when they break up it lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days tops. When they break up she usually comes running to her cousin aka my boyfriend to rescue her and give her a place to live/pick her up. Every time it happens, it seems like I’m the one that has to sacrifice and cater to the situation by giving up my work time, my educational time, missing events, etc. It has happened multiple times where she will come to him with a sad story and then he recruits me to fix it all and by the time I make the hour drive there, she either doesn’t answer the door or totally ignores me, wasting my time. I have been so frustrated that it’s beginning to wear on me. \n\nThis brings me to the most recent situation yesterday: her “boyfriend” breaks up with her for the 10th time this week. She now has “nowhere to go” (not true, she has a mom and dad that would take her in). My boyfriend then goes out of his way to get her a bed/furniture/etc and gives her the extra space that was to be used for a nursery (we have custody of his son on weekends, not all the time). He invited her to not only live in our spare bedroom without even asking me but now he’s really spending all kinds of money on it that could really be used for better things. \n\nNow I know they don’t have the closest of family, but he put me on the spot today in front of her asking if she could come to my family’s thanksgiving celebration. I wanted to not be rude so I said that i would have to ask and make sure it’s ok so we could discuss privately how I would rather it just be family there, as badly as I feel for her I just don’t see why she can’t spend it with her own mom or dad instead of with my family. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to tag along for the holiday with my family and preferring she find some other arrangements as I’m more than confident that’s possible? I feel like I’ve already made some heavy sacrifices (ones I knew asked for )\n\nSorry if this doesn’t make senses 🤷‍♀️ may make some typos so bear with me! \n\nNicole \n",

      "description": "I dont want to want to waste too much time with back story. So basically I've known this guy (lets call andre) for about a year. Durring that time he has asked me out in one form or another 3 times. Now our friendship is far from perfect just about every other month we get into an argument and we dont talk for a few weeks. Becasue of this I dont really like him, as a friend or as a potential boyfriend. Hes close freinds with all of my other friends so it's hard for me to just never talk to him or see him again. Another unrelated bit, andre was telling me about some girl in his art class who he had a crush on so I assumed he was over me.\n\nNow for the story. So I was on the phone with andre talking about how my ex had just broken up with me and I'm kinda sad about it but we were better as friends anyway. Then I look at and see I got DM from him that says knock knock . At this point I'm confused why is he DMed me while we were talking so I asked him why he couldn't just talk to me. He says just respond I want to tell you a joke. So I complied said who's there and he texts doya I say doya who and he says do you want to go out with me. \nI thought he was joking so I just said no. If i knew he was serious i would have told him no in a nicer way. When I found out he was serious I was very upset. I got dumped the day prior  and I've told this guy I dont want to date him for the 4th time now. After I go on my little \"are you fucking serious\" rant he tells me that my other friend told him that he should ask me out, which I immediately call bullshit on because that friend doesnt even know my ex and I broke up. Then andre starts begging me to not tell anyone because they'll make fun of him. I told him I hand to go and hung up. \n\nWas this an asshole thing to do? Should I have been more sensitive?",

      "title": "WIBTA for asking my sisters boyfriend to move out of my family home?",
      "description": "Okay so this has been happening for 2.5 years now, and I’ve finally reached my breaking point. \n\nMy sister (currently 18) started dating her boyfriend (21) in July before I (21) started living on campus at my university.  He lived 30 minutes from our house and when he visited my sister, he would stay over so he wouldn’t need to drive home late at night. After a couple months, he never left and has lived in our newly renovated basement ever since (bed, dresser, closet etc) He does not have the best family life (parents are divorced, dads an asshole, stepmom refused to accept the age difference between my sister and him) so at first I was understanding and tried to accept him despite us disliking each other due to conflicting personalities. After first year I began commuting to school and now live at home with the 4.\nEventually, it became clear to our relatives and friends that he is just using us. We eat at restaurants 2+ times a week and pay for him every time, buy him groceries that he asks for, drive/pick him up places when he wants to drink, let him have whatever friends he wants over without needing permission etc...\nHe has a full time construction job and pays for his truck insurance and phone bill. Last year, he was at fault for an accident and refused to discuss any matters with my family. He has been laid off since December due to the weather and sleeps in our basement until 4pm everyday when my parents come home from work. He occasionally brings home coffee, picks family members up with our vehicles if he’s free and will buy dinner once every 6 months. He does no house/yard work, does not help with pets etc. His chores include tidying the basement (his bedroom).\nFor example: If I want to go downstairs and relax or do homework or anything, I have to ask permission to use it and have to go upstairs when he decides he wants it or wants to go to sleep.\nA month ago, his truck was repoed due to missing the last four payments and again he refuses to discuss it with us - despite us letting him freely use our spare vehicle. \nHis presence has ruined the relationship between myself and my mom/sister because they consistently choose him and his feelings over my own. I have tried multiple times to talk with my mom about this and it has gotten to the point where she refuses to answer if i question anything. My dad knows it will hurt my sister if he makes him leave but he says if I ask him to, he will. I have not so far because I feel guilty about it.\nEven going downstairs to do laundry feels like walking into a strangers bedroom. \nMy sister recently told me she wants to leave him but feels bad as he lives with us. After talking to him about it, he broke down and asked for another chance.\nHe has had 2.5 years to figure out a living situation since he decided not to live with his family, and I personally don’t think asking him to figure his shit out would be unreasonable at this point. \n\nWould I be the asshole for asking him to move out?",

      "description": "I've been married for 6 years and we have shared finances. We both work but I do make a little more. My wife works from home.\n\nWhen I met my wife, she didn't really have any hobbies or friends. She's reclusive and introverted but is very passionate about things. My issue is the current \"thing\" changes every few months and I worry about our financials.\n\nThree years ago she decided to pick up guitar. Great! That's a wonderful hobby to have. She spent something like $600 on a guitar and $1500 on pedals and amps and other stuff. She was very enthusiastic about it for a month or two before giving up.\n\nTwo years ago she decided to get heavy into board games. She bought like $900 of board games and half of them still remain wrapped. We haven't played a board game in over a year and I've tried to initiate it a few times to no interest on her end.\n\nJust this past September she decided photography would be her new thing. $1500 camera and $3000 in lenses layer, none of it is being used anymore.\n\nTwo days ago she's looking at a new guitar to buy, \"maybe I didn't get into it because I didn't like the guitar I got, maybe this one will encourage me\".\n\nI try to support her and try to get the most out of these things (hell, I ever took an interest in photography and use her gear when I need to), my issue is she picks up a new hobby sometimes at $1000+ and then a month later it collects dust. I only mentioned the biggest ones, I didn't even mention the computer keyboard phase (???), book phase, vinyl record phase, etc.\n\nAITA for wanting this to stop? I've encouraged her up to this point but I want to stop it and try to refocus her on stuff she's already blown a lot of our money on rather than pick up new things constantly.",

      "description": "Back story required. Names have been changed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend, we'll call him Doug, and his girlfriend, we'll call her Diane, recently split up. They dated for about a year a couple years back and recently got back together for a couple months before calling it quits. It wasn't really a messy break up, but they both hold resentment towards each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, myself and Diane have a little bit of history. We were always decent friends and almost got together on a couple occasions. Doug, knowing our history, said he wouldn't be mad if I hooked up with Diane, so long as I told him about it. He claimed it would \"let him know that she means nothing to him anymore.\" I told him I wasn't going to go out of my way to pursue anything, but if it happened, it happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks and myself and Diane are at a bar with mutual friends. One thing leads to another and I end up bringing her back to my place and we have sex. A couple of days later the same thing happens. I didn't want to tell Doug right away because I didn't really know how to bring it up, but I told some of our mutual friends what had happened. I assured them I was going to tell Doug what had happened, and they agreed not to say anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, Diane and I have been talking occasionally, but I assured her I wasn't looking for anything serious and we haven't slept together since. One of the mutual friends I confided in said that Doug had been asking him if I slept with Diane, but he denied knowing anything. I was in a different state visiting family, but I decided as soon as I came home I would tell Doug what had happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this is where things go south. One of Diane's friends, who also happened to be close with Doug, found out about the situation and told Doug. Doug was hanging out with the mutual friends that knew about the situation when he found out and became instantly upset that no one told him. He stormed out, and our friends called me upset that I put them in this situation because it all could've been prevented if I was up front about it. Doug then called me and said he wasn't upset I slept with Diane, but was unhappy I didn't say anything to him. If anything, he was more upset at our friends for not telling him.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? While I do feel bad that I put my friends in this position, Doug did give me permission to sleep with Diane. My friends have since forgiven me, but Doug still holds it over my head.",

      "description": "I am 30, she is 29. We’ve been friends since we were children.\n\nShe lives in another city in another state, so we see each other when we can. The last two times I saw her were extremely awkward. She didn’t ask anything about my life, completely ignored my fiancé (we were at dinner), and wanted to just sit and gossip about her friends. She has always been a bit self absorbed, but has become much more shallow in the past 5 or so years, and I feel that we’ve grown apart as people. The next time I saw her, she came over, and the same thing happened. She ignored my fiancé, only spoke to me, and only wanted to talk about her life. She didn’t ask about mine, didn’t engage with me on anything, and if I wasn’t asking her questions about her life, she sat quietly, and it was very awkward. \n\nShe asked if she had done anything to deserve my lack of attention lately, because I’ve not been reaching out to her, so I told her how I felt about our most recent interactions, and told her that I wasn’t sure we were compatible as friends. She said I’m the most important person in her life, that she loves me more than anyone on earth (I don’t feel the same), and that she held something against my fiancé that he did when we first started dating, and she could never really get over it. I have no idea what she is referring to, and she said she didn’t want to dredge things up if they were things I’ve already dealt with personally, and that she would get over it so as to avoid our relationship suffering.\n\nShe has always needed me so much more than I need her, and it makes me feel like the asshole because I don’t have the same attachment to her.\n\nAll of my other friends find her extremely stuck-up, and she lends them no deference when they’re around her. She pretends everyone is invisible but me, and has no interest in interacting with anyone other than myself. \n\nShe also got angry at my fiance at our baby shower because she made a (very thoughtful) gift for me and I didn’t give the reaction she wanted when she opened it, so she took him outside and confronted him, saying she knew he told me. I was very pregnant, and the last thing I wanted was for her to make that day about her. She was angry with him, even though it was his baby shower too.\n\nShe posted on twitter last night (she never posts on twitter—she clearly just wanted me to see it) that she had been crying all day (after our conversation) and her Apple Watch told her to breathe, but she couldn’t because she was crying so hard. It feels like emotional manipulation and guilt-tripping. And it worked. I couldn’t sleep after reading that.\n\nShe’s been REALLY considerate of me at times. When i was broke, she bought groceries for me and had them delivered to my house. She randomly sent me flowers once. She’s not a bad person, which is why this is so difficult, and I feel so guilty.",

      "description": "So, to start off, maybe, it was a bit petty of me tbh. Anyway, I asked this girl Clara out on a date about a year ago. I was a completely different person then, and she turned me down. It stung like hell, but it did encourage me to better myself. Since then I've gotten in better shape, became more confident and generally I've had more luck with girls. I still never forgot what made me improve though, and that will always be a shitty memory.\n\nAnyway, me and a few friends I've made since last year went out to a gathering. I'm still fairly new in their circle, and surprise! Clara was there. I think she recognized me but I wasn't sure. Me and her hit it off, and at the end of the night we had a date planned. The date went pretty well and we went on our second one last friday.\n\nAfter this I went home and thought about where to go next, and I realized I couldn't really forgive her. So, she hit me up asking if we were going out again, and I sort of make a joke of it, blew it off and put her on mute. I haven't responded since then, and our mutual friends say she's been pretty upset, since she gets attached to people quickly, but the revenge I got was so sweet! \n\nBut, maybe I was an asshole though, what does Reddit think?",

      "description": "My sister is 5 years older than me, she ran away from home at 14, came home for a short while and then moved, had three kids within 8 years and is now addicted to meth and loves halfway across the country. My mom went to see her before we found out about the drug addiction around Christmas time two years ago. My sister kicked my mom out of her house on Christmas Eve which set off this two year grudge, I’m my moms bestfriend, and am always there for her when she needs me to be, and help financially while she raises my nephew. I recently found out that my sister gets a crazy amount of money for someone who has never worked more than two months at a time and has a drug addiction. She still gets child tax credit for one of her kids that she doesn’t even have but whatever. My niece is raised by my grandmother, my nephew by my mother , and my baby niece by her father. I’ve been helping my mom as much as I can after I moved away and got a good job, this was after two years of college so I obviously have some debt. My mom has been defending my sister every chance she gets since she went to rehab last year and has was clean for 110 days. I told my mom that I can’t afford to help out as much as I do anymore as I think it’s time my money that I earn is mine (my mom works, gets support for my nephew and compensation for a work related injury) she was pretty mad at me at first and I didn’t know what to say as I don’t think I was in the wrong. My sister started messaging me asking for money again and I confronted her that she should be helping my mom instead of my mom needing to pay for everything, my sister technically still has custody of my nephew because his dad left him behind but is now involved in his life again. The confrontation resulted in my sister trashing my mom to me and I ended up blocking her on all means of contact and deciding that I don’t need it in my life. I just found out she is expecting baby number four and while angry about it, most of my family supports it. Therefore none of them ever want to talk about this but I need opinions on if I acted the right way or not. ",

Honestly, I'm thinking of quitting my job and skipping town, so she can't get me for child support when the kid is born.\n\nI feel so fucking split. She was really nice, and had this never happened, I could see myself spending a good few years with her, but no way that I'm dealing with a kid. I'm 23, waaaay too young to put everything on hold for the next 20 or so years, and I guess I looked out for myself. \n\nI've never had much money, so the idea of spending thousands when I finally have cash on a kid I don't want is crazy. Am i the asshole, and if so, how big of an asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for using my boyfriend's phobia to prove a point?",
      "description": "This happened a little over a week ago and I still feel bad about it. So, my boyfriend has a bit of a hobby collecting knives. Switchblades, butterfly knives, he's pretty proud of all of them. Now, I have a small phobia of my own. My father was very abusive, and of the few memories I have of him, he was often threatening an infant me with a switchblade. As such, I'm very uncomfortable around them. My boyfriend will often point his in my direction, and when I get upset and tell him to stop he says I need to get over it. That I might need to use one some day. That I should know he'd never hurt me. I guess he feels like if he exposes me to it enough, I'll learn to trust that he won't stab me with it? But it's not like I think that to begin with, I'm just uncomfortable around them.\n\nWell, he has a very intense phobia of a specific monster. I don't question it. For some reason, it's much more intense than my mild annoyance/breath stopping moment at the blades. He completely freaks out at even just a picture, shuts down, has nightmares for nights. If there's a chance of one showing up in a video he will whimper and whine and either stop it all together or close his eyes and ask me to tell him when it is over. I promised him early on that I didn't find it funny like some of his friends do and wouldn't use it to prank him.\n\nWell, the other night after cutting some cheese with his stupid knife, he tried waving it at me, knowing how uncomfortable it makes me. So I pulled up a particularly horrifying image of his phobia on my phone and shoved it in his face. \"How does it feel? You know what a phobia is like, right? Just get over it!\" I tried to paraphrase him, and he got really upset. I feel like I may have gone overboard and honestly feel guilty, but he hasn't messed with me since.",

      "description": "Throaway because my friends follow my main, and this topic is kind of heavy.\n\n\nSo last Sunday, I went to the beach with my family. My mom was there with us and everything seemed fine. After texting some friends, I decided to put my phone away and go near the shore. I put my phone in my backpack and leave for an hour or two. When I come back, I notice my mom looking glum, and a slight feeling that something's wrong. When I check my phone, I notice some chats I hadn't opened where now opened, which surprised me (My phone has a password, but if you swipe near the time it's locked down you don't have to put it).\n\n\nI asked her if she grabbed my phone, and she replies she didn't. But I know something was off and decided to just let it go. Our relationship is pretty shaky, so she might just have been mad at something I did. Last night though, she entered my room and asked me a bunch of random questions, finishing it with \"Have you ever had sex? Was it with a girl?\" I replied yes to both, and being a guy I found them completely normal mother-teenage son questions.\n\n\nThen, however, while we were talking about something else, she starts telling me how she browsed my computer and phone since she had heard a rumor about me doing drugs from a friend of hers. Not only was this not true at all, I just wanted to drop the subject and go to bed. That's when she said she had read my texts with a specific girl. Let's call her S. I immediately froze because she's my best friend, and one of the two people who knows I like guys. She kept bringing up how she did it for my own good and how all she wanted to help me. I was trying to keep it all together, but this was sort of like the cherry on top of everything. I told her it had just been one guy and we hadn't done anything together. He had just been friendly with me and there was a connection. And that I still preferred women (I don't).\n\n\nAnyways, this went on for two hours. She kept telling me she did it for my own good and how she wanted to help me because I \"needed\" help. To clarify, she doesn't mean correcting me or anything, but she thinks that just because I like a guy, my life is going to be a depressing nightmare of shame. \n\n\nThing is, I've known that I'm gay for almost 4 years. My 2 friends have been really supportive and I feel like I really am fine. In the end, she told me to either get help myself or she'd call the school for programs.\nPersonally, I feel like she snatched my thing from me. I wasn't planning on coming out to her anytime soon, but I still feel like this really wasn't the way things should have gone. But what really annoys me is that she justifies breaking into my phone and reading my private conversations just because she's my mother. I'm not speaking to her anymore.\n\n\n\nTLDR; my mom checks my phone while I'm not looking, sees things she shouldn't have, now believes I need help for something I really don't.\n\n\nSorry for the bad formatting. I'm on mobile.",

      "description": "Backstory: Last weekend I drove out to pick up my gf at the train station in another city. On my way there a dog ran in front of my car and I immediately braked but wasn't able to stop in time. Couldn't avoid it either as it's a busy street. Also it was dark and the dog came from behind a 'speed bump' kinda thing that separates the street from the bike lane (which is why I didn't see the dog in time). I heard my tires screech, followed by a howl of pain from the dog. This happened all in an instant and I was freaking out that I had ran over a dog but then I saw a flash of the dog running across the street. I don't think this whole lasted more than 10 seconds. I drove about 10 meters to where I could park and ran across the street to go look for the dog and met 6 or 7 people. This family owned the dog and saw everything, asked me if I was ok and telling me not to worry, that it wasn't my fault (they had just moved there and the dog didn't know the surroundings). After calming down I searched with them for about 20 minutes before leaving. I picked up gf (had already called and let her know what happened) and drove back home, didn't see the family when passing the same place.\n\nToday (4 days later) gf showed me a facebook post. Someone had found a dog ±7km away from where it happened. I told her before that it maybe was a beagle. Now this was certainly no beagle it did have the white, brown &amp; black colors so maybe this was it? Messaged the guy, explaining the situation. He told me he took the dog to his local police station (same city as the owners) and that it had difficulty walking but seemed fine otherwise. I thanked him and called the police station. They told me it was already in an animal shelter. I said that I might know who the dog belonged to but didn't have any contact information from the people (which in hindsight is pretty dumb in case there would've been damage to my car or something). But I knew the address as I saw the number while searching (thought it might come in handy) &amp; knew the street. They asked the address again to be sure it was the right one and told me they'd look into it. I thanked them and hung up.\n\nGf wants me to drive to the address and tell the people about the post. I told her I wasn't gonna drive over to another city to some strangers house just to show them a picture of a dog that \\*might\\* be theirs while the police already would handle it. She told me I'm being insensitive and lacking compassion. I also talked to my dad about it who thinks I did plenty and shouldn't even have contacted the facebook guy or the police. I disagree with that last part tho, calling to let the police know the possible owners isn't that much trouble and the dog wasn't chipped so unless the owners see the post there's no sure way for them to know. He also said that it isn't my fault or problem and that I had already done enough when I stopped my car and checked for the dog.\n\nSo 2 different opinions from 2 people close to me... AITA?",

      "description": "This happened a while ago. I was with a friend at a small get together with three other people (so, 5 total). The intent of this get together was to play a few board games and generally hang out. My friend knew that I am not hugely into board games, but invited me because we are close and enjoy each other's company. I had not met any of the other 3 people before, they were mutual friends of my friend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got there, introductions were made, and we sat down to play a game. I declined to play, as it was a four player game and I don't really enjoy board games, I just wanted to socialize. They finished the games, we ate pizza, and another board game was started. This was also a four player game, so I declined again to let the people who liked board games play. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also left early (middle of the second game, about 2.5 hours after arriving) to get a tattoo. My friend knew in advance of inviting me to this event that I would be leaving before they did to get the tattoo. My friend lives in a city about 2 hours away from me, so part of my weekend plan involved getting a tattoo from an artist in that same city. My friend did not request that I move or put off the appointment, but they may have just been trying to be polite? In retrospect, I shouldn't have gone to get the tattoo (that was rude) but that's not really the focus of my question. I just think it may be relevant.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later, my friend told me that they were upset that I had not played any board games, and that the people I met at the party were hassling my friend about why they were friends with someone (me) who didn't enjoy the same activities of them. I had no idea that it bothered my friend so much. They did not bring up the event between the time I left and when they told me that my not participating bothered them, except to tell me that the people I met at the event liked me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I was the asshole for leaving early. I wish I'd realized that earlier and been better. But am I the asshole for not playing any board games? Do I just come across as an asshole because I left early? Please be honest, I'm not very good in social situations and I'd really like to know if not playing was rude so that I can avoid similar situations in the future. ",

She has been harassing, teasing and openly shaming our classmates from high school and she keeps talking to herself on her own posts (she posts same thing everyday, 50-60 times). I tried to reach out to her but she just says everything is okay and that I’m jealous of her (I’m not jealous of her, I’m just really worried about her). I am really far away from her and can only do so much over phone calls or social media. No other friends or even her family are bothered to help her. Our mutual friends keep asking me but I feel ashamed because I don’t know exactly what is happening and how to fix it.

      "description": "Before telling you the actual story, I genuinely wish everyone a merry Christmas and happy new year. Please spend your holidays peacefully with your family members. It should be a season of love of joy, and you share irreplaceable bonds with your family members, so treasure the loving moments you spend with them, because sometime you have no idea that a simple word could just completely destroy everything and turn your life upside down. \n\nSo this just happened today. I planned to go to my parents' place for Christmas on the night of the 24th. This has always been the plan from the beginning because I have some other plan on the day of the 24th. But my mother called me this afternoon, saying that I absolutely need to go back tomorrow morning because she has invited my SO's family over on the 24th for lunch. Our families made arrangements about a gathering during the holiday season for awhile now, and I've always been aware of that, but I was never told when the meeting would actually take place, so I thought no time has been set and it would definitely be after Christmas. \n\nSo needless to say I was really surprised and completely incredulous when I heard about this, yet my mom adamantly claims that this plan has already been communicated to me before and it's my problem that I have other plan on the 24th and I need to cancel it. Her claim that I've been told about the gathering on the 24th is categorically false and to be fair outright ridiculous since I wouldn't have made another plan on the 24th had I known and even if my some miracle I've forgotten about the gathering, my SO wouldn't as well, and she also never told me about it! So I decided to text my SO's parents to confirm about this meeting. They first asked me if my parents' are back from vacation, and I replied yes they just got back yesterday. And their response in their exact words was \"we can discuss about the gathering after few days of rest\". \n\nSo with my presumption that my mother wasn't being honest about the gathering time already set in stone on the 24th, I immediately interpreted this as irrefutable proof that my mother wasn't telling me the truth. So I immediately texted her and said that she was lying, because my SO's parents just said we can discuss about the gathering after they rest for few days of rest. My mother was furious and showed me some old texts, and it turns out they did actually made a plan to gather on the 24th beforehand, but my SO parents thought that maybe they could use a few days of rest after just coming back from a trip, and I misinterpreted that as \"there never was a gathering planned\". So I was indeed wrong to have accused her of lying. But while I was not at all happy that she's making me cancel my plan on the 24th to attend the gathering with such a short notice, I was not mad and just accused my mom of lying casually like that with zero intention of being mean to her or hurting her feelings. More like sheer annoyance of \"why would you come up with this false pretext so I would have to cancel my plan just to come to home with no sight of my SO's family??\". This isn't the first time my mother used such a tactic. She once told me they adopted a dog so being the dog lover that I am, I went home on that same weekend only to find they got a ceramic dog...Now I understand a mother wanting to see her son who lives away and doesn't come back home often, but coming up with false pretext isn't honest and hence why I started with the presumption that this is another one of her pretext. \n\nNow I know seen some families who have really strict rules about what the children can say, with \"liar\" being the equivalent of curse words that must be never used against another individual, let alone your parents. Although my mom often hasn't been honest in the things she say to me, I've never before called her a liar before and today was the first time. But I never anticipated that she would basically disown me over this. I don't want to get into the details of what she said since this is about whether IATA, but it let's just say that with what she said there's NO WAY I can go back home this holiday season and enjoy spending the time with my family and that what she said is so hurtful and has caused a PERMANENT fissure to form between us. (I always love my father more but my mother and I have never been on bad terms and I do absolutely love her. Being a very sensitive person I never imagine these hurtful words coming out from her, which is why I'm so devastated). \n\nSo I'm emotionally exhausted right now and utterly regretful of this little misunderstanding developing into such a nightmare, but most of all confused at how or why this even happened in the first place. I really want to believe that I've something terribly wrong and absolutely deserve this, but maybe I'm just such an oblivious jerk that I can't even see what's so terrible about what I said.  \n\nSo please, by all means share your honest belief and judgement. If this is indeed so bad of a insult I will never ever use this word in the rest of my life against anyone under any circumstances, but I'm afraid that this one-time mistake has just permanently damaged my relationship with my mother. \n\nAITA?",

Next day she went to check if everything was packed, she threw a fit because dad packed the food in glass containers, instead of single-use ones. So naturally, after all that work he's done, he got angry and told her to suck it up because he made her breakfast and packed her shit, and this is what he gets in return.  \nBecause of her, my dad is constantly angry. She ignores him, doesn't do what he asks her to do, and is basically a lazy pig.   \nI lost it and told her to shut the fuck up and to stop being a bitch. She pushed me to the side and stormed off to her room. Of course, mom told me that things I said were \"inappropriate\" and \"disgusting\"  \n\n\nI truly believe that she is the epicentre of my dad being angry, and all the fights that happen in our house. When she's not home, there are no fights, my dad isn't angry and we are much happier.  \n\n\nSmall rant but eh  \n\n\n(Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language)   \n",

For the last 6 years while I have been in school, we have lived with roommates (for obvious financial reasons.)\n\nDuring this time I have kept a pt job, consistenly made the dean's list, been involved in community band, cared for our two dogs and my aquarium hobby. Every summer I work full time as soon as class ends.\n\nI struggle with depression and anxiety, and am incredibly aware of how it affects my day to day life and social interactions. \n\nI have secured a job that starts in June, and have taken 2 weeks off between my old job and starting my new one, given the intensity of the program I just completed.\n\nMy husband works incredibly hard in the resource industry. It mostly requires him to work out of town between 6 to 12 weeks at a time for about half of the year. He makes good money when he is working, and often pulls 16 hour shifts. He is an excellent problem solver and can fix anything with moving parts. Last year he suffered a debilitating injury that required 2 surgeries. \n\nWhen he isn't working, he too suffers from depression. He has difficulty accepting help for these issues, but we do our best to work through them. \n\nAs I stated, we have a roommate.\n\nOur roommate pays his rent 5 days early, mostly keeps to his room and is a nice enough guy. He has been with us for nearly a year.\n\nI want him gone. \n\nI'm at my wits end, exhausted, and barely holding it together.\n\nI'm tired of my dogs barking every time my roommate comes home, I'm tired of the burping, loud yawns, the food containers in his room, the detergent all over the counter, cleaning the bathroom for 3 people, waiting for the bathroom to be free when I need to get to work or class, the constant weed smoking, the dishes not being put away, the unsorted recycling and the fucking hair in the sink after he shaves his head. \n\nI'm so tired. I've tried to be polite, and my anxiety makes it difficult to really impress how bothered I am by these things. When my husband is home, he adds to the mess of the house and I'm just done. \n\nMy husband balked when I suggested we ask our roommate to move out, he cites saving money and also the fact that our roommate has a degenerative bone disease. Our house is close to his work and convenient for him, but I would love to have his room as a guest room, but also an office where I can close the door and my husband can go to his garage to work on his cars or play in his storage. \n\nI just want some space and peace where I can decompress without having to share my home. I don't care about the money he pays, because to me, it's not worth it. My husband thinks I'm being unreasonable and that I should concede given the reality of our financial situation.\n\nAITA?",

To understand the story you need to know that I'm female and half korean and half german.\n\nA friend and I went to a nightclub one weekend. When we went outside to get some fresh air I noticed a group of five people about 10 meters away looking in our direction and very blatantly talking about us. This did not stop for about five minutes and I was uncomfortable, but I just tried to ignore this. I just wanted to have fun and did not want to have any kind of confrontation with anybody. I could have walked away, this is true. I didn't because while it was awkward, I didn't want to give up my sitting space.\n\nAfter 5 minutes one guy from this group stood up and walked towards us. Then he said \"hey, sorry for bothering you. But me and my friends have been talking about you for the past minutes trying to find out where you're from. Like, you don't look german. So, where are you from?\" and I replied \"Frankly, it made me umcomfortable that you spent the last five minutes talking about me and looking at me. I'm not a zoo animal.\" \n\nHe was taken aback and clearly hurt.  Without a word he walked back to his friends. Maybe I'm the asshole, but I didn't enjoy getting \"examined\" by them. It made me feel alienated and like I'm different, not like them. Tell me what you think. I'm willing to learn from this. ",

      "description": "I’m sure we’re all familiar with Snapchat streaks, a challenge for users to keep a score with their friends by sending photos daily to one another. \nMy girlfriend has way too many of these streaks to count and every day it seems she is sending pictures of herself half-naked. Mind you I don’t know any of the people on her streaks list, but I know many of them are males.\nNow don’t get me wrong, I love her being confident and proud of her body; but when the only pictures I get of her she has sent to 30+ people before, it loses its importance. \nAm I an asshole for getting upset about this?

      "description": "My fiance and I talked in the spring about getting engaged over this past summer. We have been together for 3 years and living together for a year. It didn't happen and he never let me know why. I got pretty depressed in the fall and cried a lot because I felt like he was saying what he thought I wanted to hear but dragging his feet. He finally talked to me and said he was paying off a ring (turned out to be a small lie, he was saving money to pay it all at once. I guess he lied so it would seem further along or something). This back info is just to explain that he knew it was very important to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally over the weekend we went up to the finger lakes in NY and he asked me. I am excited but I'm also really hurt by how he did it. The little get away was really nice but that was the only thing he really thought about... And he didnt really come up with that idea - his brother was there the weekend before. The spot he proposed to me was on snapchat days before (which is when i discovered another lie because when i was crying in the fall he told me he had it planned).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was a little drunk because we had been hitting wineries all day. We walked to the waterfall and he said, \"I don't want to take advantage of a drunk girl, but will you marry me?\" got down on one knee with the ring. That was it. No nice things about how much he loves me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said yes and we started walking back to the car and I asked what my parents said because I had told him before that I wanted him to ask them. He didn't. He said he chickened out.  \n\n\nLater I was really looking at the ring and lost it. Started to bawl. We had looked at rings together a few months ago and he got me exactly what I said I didn't like. I told him I love him very much and wanted to marry him but felt unimportant to him and like this isn't what he really wanted so I didn't want to wear the ring that night. Cried A LOT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided the next day to just exchange the ring and I just picked it - which I hated to do because I wanted him to pick it but I thought I had done a better job of explaining my style.. He said that he loves me more than anything and wants to re-proposal when the ring comes back (just for us, people already know we are engaged so we aren't going to start telling a different story. Just leave out the crying.) I REALLY want him to do this for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not focusing on the happiness and the future rather than the disappointment? Should I have not told him? ",

My family and I are well off (not sure the income) but we can afford basic needs like groceries, WiFi , and can afford a middle class house. Now that we have that covered I’ll explain why I feel like an asshole.\n   \n     So the reason I feel like an ass is because I ask my parents for a console. And I know I sound like it isn’t that important and that it’s pretty petty but I genuinely can’t really relate to most of my friends nevertheless play with them. The thing I play on is a Inspiron 10 laptop which I would say isn’t that bad, but the problem is it doesn’t preform well I had to buy a cooling pad to help it perform but it didn’t help that much.\n\n     The problem is that I don’t really have a means of getting money at my age and I can’t get money from doing labored tasks like mowing lawns shoveling snow or sweeping a driveway because I live in a middle class area where they wouldn’t pay someone to do it if they could do it for free. I also don’t get and allowance from my parents and I mostly get money from birthdays and or Christmas.\n\nFinal note: I just want to know if I’m being ungrateful and an asshole for asking my two parents who already work a lot for something like a console because even I think it’s kind of a shit thing to do.",

      "description": "Hi folks, this is something that has been pressing my mind for a while, and after some more recent events, it's been heavily on my mind. Sorry it's a little long, but I'll put a TL;DR at the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 21-year-old college psych student who is about eight hours away from her parents. My mom and dad are divorced (I believe they divorced in 2008) however they keep in very close contacts with each other. Like, people mistake them as a married couple all the time. This is relative but isn't the issue I'm having.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom has a lot of mental health issues and is very gullible when it comes to social media. In the past year, she met someone online, on a popular dating app. The guy is pretty good looking from his pictures, in the army, and I guess he is very charming. I say I guess because she has never physically met the man but is obsessed with him. My mother is almost 60 years old, and this man looks like he's in his early 30s. Which, hey their both adults. What bothers me is that the man (I'll call him R) ask for money constantly to where it has put my mom very far in debt. I believe he is a catfish trying to scam my mother. Every time he says he's going to meet her, he never shows up and says that he can't because 'the captain wants him to stay' or 'he doesn't have the money to get back.' R also says he's in the military (I think the Army), but the pictures he's sent my mom are always in different uniforms. I don 't know a lot about the military, but I know that if you're in the Army, you usually don't wear a Navy's uniform, or etc. Yet, the pictures have different uniforms on each time. Also, the guy always looks different to me in each photo, as if they were different people.\n\nR also asks for ridiculous amounts of money too, the most he has asked for is $4,000 in USD, but wants them sent to Ghana. Before my third year of school started, my mom said that if I wanted to live there I'd have to send R $3000  (I had some money from a car accident I was in and was compensated for) and we would call that the rent. Because I had nowhere else to go (I will explain why in a bit) I did it. I'm not proud of it, but I didn't really have a choice. \n\nMy mom has also asked me to text R, and I say no because I don't trust him and she becomes verbally and emotionally abusive when I say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, is generally a nice guy. I'm really close to him, and he's a bit more street smart. However, my dad does a lot of dangerous shit like drugs and hangs out with crowds I'm not comfortable with. He also believes that R is a catfish, but my mom will lash out at my dad too. My mom thinks my dad is still in love with her, which is not the case. My dad has an on-and-off-again girlfriend who I will call B. B I have met, and from what I have seen about her, I also do not trust her. She has been civil with me, so I return the favor. However, she is more addicted to drugs then my dad has many accounts on apps like Tinder, POF, etc. and she gets physically abusive on my dad. For example, B once threatened to stab my dad, then she blamed her 'rapid mood swings' on being diagnosed with Bipolar 1. (Which btw, that's not how Bipolar works, people with Bipolar do not become rapidly and dangerously angry in a few hours.) People with Bipolar usually go from manic to depressed at the quickest, in a month.) So I think B is really dangerous for my dad.\n\nMy dad will also expect B of cheating on her because she was an 'adult entertainer' before she met my dad. She will go out at odd hours and come home 3 hours later. My dad gets really mad about this, and once he strongly thinks she is cheating on him, he will think he has her, come to me or my mother, bawling his eyes out, plot some type of revenge on B (getting her housing taken away, getting her arrested for prostitution, etc.) though after a week they will get back together. This cycle repeats once a month.\n\n Because my dad stays with B, when they fight, he is homeless and asks me for money. They live in a pretty bad area of town too that is known for gangs, drugs, prostitutes, and dangerous crimes, (I've been groped by strangers when I went to high school in his area twice) so I refuse to go live down there. \n\nI'm okay with my parents venting to me because, hey, we all need an open ear, but when I try and offer them advice they either ignore it, get mad at me, or block me. A few weeks ago my dad ranted about B kicking him out again, only for today he got back with her and now is thinking about moving cities with her. They broke up the 10th of February and made up the 14th of February. (I wrote this on the 17th of February) I told him that maybe they should really think this over, since it's been an off an on thing for a while, and if your name is both on a lease, then it will be hard for him to get out of that. He told me he talked it over with B, and they would be happy, and he wasn't worried about a 'little fight.' And it's not kind of judge B.\n\nMy mom asked me to text R because they got into a fight, and I said, no because I don't feel comfortable fixing their fight. My mom told me to go fuck myself because I don't like R. My mother even said that if it was my dad and her getting back together, then I wouldn't fight them on this. This is also untrue because they are very unhealthy for each other too.\n\nAs you can see, I'm very upset about this, and I told both of them that I was tired of being a scapegoat and if they didn't want to listen to the issues I have with their S.O then I'm not going to talk to them. Both of them are in a very unhealthy relationship, I don't really like either of their S.O, and I don't want to really talk to them until they break up with them or get some help, which they don't do either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth don't really have anyone to talk to because my mom is a hermit (literally, she stays in her house all day) and my dad doesn't trust his friends. Both have been known to have suicidal tendencies, and I feel like if they did break up with their S.O and I didn't talk to them, they might try to kill themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister and my friends think it would be a good idea to not talk to them because I'm in the middle and they use me as a stress relief more than an ear. My brother and some of my family thinks I'm being too hard on them and to not give up on them because they are family and if I give up on them they might hurt themselves, and I'm being selfish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in my 3rd year of college and getting ready to explore grad school. Part of me even wants to move out of the state because my life is less chaotic when I don't have to deal with their bullcrap. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I think my parents are in unhealthy relationships and they want me to fix everything. I tell them I don't want to hear it, and not to talk to me until they break-up with them. ",

      "description": "I'm planning a trip with 3 or so friends to go to France in the summer. Now I speak fluent French, although I'm rusty, having done it for 7 years through school (ages 11-18) and using it during my degree for research. 2 of my other friends also speak the language to varying degrees, mostly at a conversational level. \n\nNow something has cropped up which is bothering me- namely that on a few occasions I've had members of the group openly assume that I'm going to be a translator. On one occasion we were looking up some tourist sites online and some art thing we found was in French only. One of the friends who wanted to go to this was saying \"well that's not a problem, you can translate\", making the assumption that I'd be happy doing this, which I'm not. I said this at the time and it caused something of an argument, with her saying I'm being selfish and me saying that it's more so to simply expect that I'm going to do something without asking. \n\n As far as I'm concerned, it's my holiday too and the last thing I want is to be a workhorse, especially when in at least two people's cases they're perfectly capable of working things out for themselves using a phrasebook or simply learning stuff beforehand. Neither is it totally impossible if they're that worried about their language skills, especially with the Internet, that we couldn't find things to do which have the option of using the English language. \n\nSo, WIBTA?

      "description": "This is in the UK, if that matters.\n\n\nMy[22M] SO[21F] has an older friend [40ishM] 'Bill' whom she is very close with. Their relationship in my eyes is too close and I've discussed this with her before but she thinks I'm being an over protective and reading into things. \n\n\n I don't know much about Bill, other than that they met through facebook before I knew her. He's in a relationship I think, and works in a carehome with kids.\n\n\nTheir relationship has always been a point of arguments for us. Bill often sends her money, and pays for gifts for her (like phones) and even drives 2+ hours each way to see her sometimes, as we moved to a different city recently. He even got a tattoo of a line from one of her poems on his arm.\n\n\nThey use to send each other messages daily and talk about very emotional stuff. They'd send lots of kisses at the end of each message and she told me they even say they love each other. She insists this is all platonic and they both only see each other as friends. She's never hidden any of this from me which leads me to believe she isn't lying. However, she has hidden Bill sending her money before and almost seems to deliberately move away when they message sometimes. She says this is because I try to read the messages over her shoulder, but he's the only person I've noticed her do it for. Also, when he comes up to visit her, it's when I'm busy or they go out alone together. Even if I'm free, and I'd be willing to go with them. She said it was because she wants to spend time with her friend alone.\n\n\nWe'd argued about this before and ended up arguing about it a few times more, but finally we came to a kind of conclusion where I thought she agreed with me that my insecurities were valid and she'd lower the level of the relationship. From then she stopped messaging him as much.\n\n\nHowever, from before all this ( before me and my SO met even) they'd arranged to go to a gig in another city (Bill is paying for everything, tickets, hotel and anything like food). Now, this is not all I am concerned about. Initially I was weary about this, had said to her I was anxious as well, but was going to be ok with her going. \n\n\nHe's driving the 2+ hours (out of the way I should add) to pick her up and then they are driving to the other city ~2 hours from here. This is on a Friday. It turned out my friend who lives in that city wanted to meet up with me and her, so I said it would be convenient if I could go with my SO and Bill as they drive down. I'd meet up with our friends as they see the gig and then me and her spend the rest of the weekend with our friends and get the train back. (Note: my SO is the one who told me they wanted to meet up, and I said it was the same weekend she was going away so it would work. She didn't realise it was the same weekend.)\n\n\nShe said sure at first, but we didn't actually talk about it. As it's coming up closer I was trying to figure out what we're meant to be doing and she didn't really seem like she wanted to talk about it. Then she started saying how she'd feel bad about ditching Bill on the Saturday. I said we wouldn't meet our friends until the evening anyway and that me and her could spend the day with Bill. She said she didn't want me there and would rather spend the day with him alone, as Bill has spent all this money on her and Bill know I'm not his biggest fan. Then she started saying how she felt like me saying I should go down with them was me keeping an eye on them, and that it would be awkward for all three of us to go together. I was a bit upset by this, and I really need to know if I'm being a dick by being anxious about all this? The argument got a bit heated and now she's said she wants to go down to see her family a few days before.\n\n\nAITA for being concerned by all this?\n\n\nHappy to elaborate or answer any questions people may have! Thanks for reading.\n\n",

      "description": "A lot has happened at work recently. Here's some background:\nOn a Friday, the entire company was informed a specific branch was closing. It was a small office of only 10 people but one of them \"G\" did the most important job for my 10 person department at the main office. \nThis was news to my manager who was technically G's supervisor. \nCue some frantic scrambling the following Monday which was cut short by a company wide tech issue that afternoon. Who would take over G's job was still a priority but it seemed like it was put aside for the time being.\n\nThat Wednesday I was unexpectedly offered G's job by our manager with supervisor present. I officially accepted Thursday morning. This wasn't an open position and I wasn't anticipating the offer. I was happy with my current job and left it up to my superiors to decide who could fill the role.\nOn Friday I hear my coworker \"S\" talking about asking our manager for G's job, S had scheduled a meeting already and was asking for tips on how to secure the position. He mentioned he wanted to go through all his recent accomplishments before actually asking for the job.\nI was technically eavesdropping but there had already been a couple opportunities for my supervisor or manager to announce my promotion to our department. They hadn't and figured it was for a good reason so I didn't want to announce it myself. \nI texted my supervisor to ask if I could tell S he should cancel but she was in a meeting and didn't reply in time.\nS spent an hour with our manager marketing himself and trying to get the job.\n\nCome Monday and I am announced as the recipient of this promotion. Ever since S has been acting weird around me and so have the other couple coworkers he had told about wanting that promotion. \n\nI didn't ask for this promotion but telling him that won't help, S is absolutely qualified for this promotion but for whatever reason I received the offer. I wanted to tell him before he spent the time to present his case but I didn't trust him to keep it to himself so I wanted explicit permission first. I'm honestly not sure if he knows I had the job before it was announced or if he thinks I tried for it too.\n\nAITA for letting him spend time on \"applying\" for a promotion I already had?",

I'm 15 now and i'm still wondering about this though) when we had a class board with like.. these cartoony owls pinned on them. Every person had their own owl with their name on it. One day, some genius started getting pins and pinning them on the owl's.. crotch?? Just making it look like the owl had genitals.. The whole class was laughting about it and they started doing it to literally everyone. It was all fun and games untill my best friends friend, let's call her Sarah, decided to take a handfull of them And pinning them all in one poor owl, creating a gigant hole in the board. (it was a foam board) The teacher got really mad and confronted the class about it. My best friend had some sort of.. spíte towards me?? I'll call her Alli. She and Sarah said it was me. My other friends said it  wasn't me, So the issue remained unsolved. Alli then got really mad at me And never talked to me, and trashtalked me alot of times. I honestly have no idea why, but overtime i snapped. At the point i snapped i was just.. bullied by her. I befriended her best friend (Andy) and kind off.. stealed Andy from her?? Idk- \nShe became even more angy and told her parents. She basically had a big breakdown. That really.. guilt tripped me since her dad and my dad were great friends And i felt really bad since i didn't want them to stop talking, also because they are coworkers and I didn't want my 'problems' to affect my dad's friendly workspace. At that point it was the end of the school year and i would be switching schools, And i didn't want us to end on bad terms so i gave her a set of art supplies for 20 US dollars. (We're both artists so yeah-) it ended on good terms And i was happy, until a few years later Andy told me my whole old class hated me because Alli told everyone i poisoned her dog (which died from a completely different thing. The dog was a hunter dog and basically she suffocated on wires while She was hunting with alli's dad. He couldn't get to her in time) and alot of other stuff. She even had some voice recordings. To this day i'm wondering if i deserved all of this?? I know this might seem stupid but i'm really curious. I'm sorry for any gramaticall mistakes i'm from czechia And english js my third language-",

      "description": "I'm (30f) and married to my husband (30m) now for 6 months. We had been dating for 2 years and when we got married and we moved to a new town together and then moved in together. He has a 4yo daughter who I had a pleasant relationship with. I've watched her grow up. I think she is a cute tyke but I dont love her. I've tried, believe me, but we are not compatable. Now that we have all started living together, I'm starting to dislike her personality and the way she acts just like her mother who I have an okay relationship with but do not particularity like. I feel like I gave it a real chance but I told my husband that I was thinking about divorcing him. He got upset, as expected, and told me that this information should have been provided before I married him. I told him that I love him but didn't truly know that living with him and his child would be so difficult. He said that I would grow to love her and that I should stick around. I disagree and I think I've really given it a fair trial. AITA here? ",

Charlie tried to pull me aside and say that if we let her come he would get her her own room and she wouldn't bother us.

      "title": "AITA for telling my S/O that my friend is using her boyfriend (my S/O's friend)",
      "description": "So this is a long post, TL;DR at the bottom\n\nI've known this girl for several years now, I found out back in July 2018 that she was going behind her boyfriends back, talking shit about him, comparing him to her ex in everything he did, she even sent me a screenshot of a conversation between her and some other guy, basically them flirting. I didn't say anything about this to her, thinking it wasn't my place to get involved. \n\nMaybe a week or 2 after that, her boyfriend found messages on her laptop (unintentionally) to several other guys that she's been texting and flirting with behind his back. This obviously upset the guy, so he came to my S/O and told him about all this. My partner came to me, and told me about this, because seeing as she's my friend, I should try and talk to her. I confronted her and she went to her boyfriend, and started giving him shit for going to my S/O and \"spreading gossip\".\n\nSomehow, me and my partner turned out to be the cause of they argument, which we weren't keen on being involved in in the first place. And we lost touch for most of the summer.\n\nWhen I came back to university in September, my friend and I briefly met up with another mutual friend of ours, we seemed to talk it out, and come to the conclusion that what happened during the summer wasn't anyone's fault and it was just a big misunderstanding where everyone ended up getting heated and overreacting. This was fine, we ended up talking and stuff again, seemed like everything was behind us.\n\nRecently we met up again, she had a few drinks and accidentally let it slip to us that she was planning to break up with her boyfriend after she finds her own place to move into, because she \"doesn't see it going anywhere\" .. \"he's just not (her ex's name)..\"I just need a place to stay at the moment and have nowhere else to go\". This surpised and shocked me, and I asked her is she sure she wants to break up because them two seem to work so well.\n\nAt the end of the night, I came home to my partner and tell him about this as it was kind of concerning me. He told me that he was thinking of just going to her boyfriend and telling him about this, as she is just using him and it isn't fair on the guy. I thought it was the right thing to do, so I ended up texting my friend and gave her a heads up. Basically saying \"hey look, I told my S/O about what you said, with all the breaking up and stuff, sorry, I know it wasn't my place, but it didn't seem fair\" she then came at me saying that she had never said that she was definitely going to break up with him (she did), etc. And that now she's gonna have to deal with that, thanks a lot.\nMy partner didn't even bother contacting the guy anyway though. \n\nI dismissed these as I knew she had a few drinks earlier that night, but she texted me the next day saying that I've always been a horrible friend, and that I only ever met up with her and our other friend to get the gossip, and then \"report back to your keeper\" which I found absurt and laughable to be honest.\n\nI have since stopped talking to her, blocked her on social media. I did see her a couple of days ago and we exchanged a few words, in which she informed me that she has in fact broken up with her boyfriend and that she has found a new place to live in, etc. I'm just not sure if I was an asshole in this, telling my boyfriend in confidence something that was bothering me.\n\nTL;DR: ex friend was using her boyfriend, his money, car, house, etc. She was planning to break up with him as soon as she had backup, and told me this. I told my S/O about this as he is friends with her boyfriend. He wanted to text him to warn him, I talked him out of it, but still told my friend that I had told him. She flipped out and started insulting me saying that I can't keep my mouth shut",

My boyfriend bought himself a car that I can \"use\" until he gets his license and I can't afford to get a new car and still need to pay off my loan. My boyfriend also offered to pay my loan and then I can pay him back.

      "description": "I’ll try to fit in as much detail as possible. This is something that has weighed on my chest for a long time and probably indirectly led to the end of my relationship with this person. \n\n\nSo I was dating a girl (M) who lived far away from me. Like, across the Atlantic, in the UK. She and I got along very well, and always made plans to see each other one day when the time was right or opportunity was available. One day, my family and I started planning a trip to the UK and it was then that I was able to go see her, she lived in Birmingham so that was a little out of the way but I paid for the train ticket and was able to spend the day with her and even now it was one of the most magical, “holy shit this is happening” days of my life. Nothing could ever be so surreal as physically seeing her after months. \n\n\n\nAnyways, for almost as long as we were dating she’d been struggling with depression. She made me promise to never tell anyone about it, and talked to me about thoughts she had about ending her life and how she was completely unhappy. I did all that I could without physically being present, but she always seemed to deteriorate more and more, and it was at its worst when I finally went to see her. She was extremely happy and so was I, that goes without saying. However as soon as I left she sort of went back to the same state of mind, which I expected because depression is a monster that isn’t easily or quickly defeated. Fast forward a couple days and she tells me she wants to actually kill herself. This sends me into hysterics but I didn’t show it since we were talking over text and then I Skyped her to try and talk with her as calmly and as reassuring as possible. I end up being unable to talk her into promising me she wouldn’t try anything so I spilled everything to her older sister, who was at home and could talk with her physically and stop M from doing anything if need be. I never told M that I told her sister, which is an asshole move on my part and I regret entirely. \n\n\nA couple months later her sister tells her what I did, and M goes off on me, calling me a dick, a loser, untrustworthy, that she was stupid to have trusted me, and completely ceased telling me anything, even just her daily life. For a few weeks after that our texts were short, the Skype calls dried up, and eventually she broke things off with me and we went our separate ways, with her saying she would never forgive me. \n\n\nIn my mind, I was just trying to save her. It sounds cringy but that’s what I was thinking in the moment. I could never, ever have forgiven myself had something happened to her and I be the only person that knew and said nothing to her family. I thought that stopping her from potentially hurting herself was more important than an (in hindsight) impossible promise she made me make. Am I the asshole?\n\n\nTL;DR: Long distance girlfriend, struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts, only tells me, I tell one of her family members when she started implying she wanted to hurt herself in the moment, indirectly causes her to break up with me.

      "title": "AITA For being mad about my boss recording me at work?",
      "description": "Hi everyone, first post ever, so bear with me. TL;DR at bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context: I'm a data entry worker in an office making minimum wage, and my boss is a middle-aged man; He's kind of obnoxious but generally very nice to me.  I'm in school for music (I'm a classical singer), and this office job is what I do for spending money.  \n\nSometimes at work, I sing for my co-workers with when we're bored.  It makes them happy, and while it's not my finest singing (no accompaniment, no warmup, etc.) I'm happy to do it because I believe music should be a part of everyone's daily lives and I love sharing opera with people who don't usually listen to it.  I've done this 4 times over my time there.\n\nThe first time I sang for them, I didn't notice I was being recorded by my boss until after I was finished singing.  I didn't want to say anything for fear of being asshole-y, but I did find it rude that someone would record me without my permission.  I thought it was common courtesy, but I digress...\n\nTime #2: The day after time #1, my boss ordered me to go outside and sing for another co-worker who missed my singing the day before and wanted to hear me.  I did it because it was more fun than working, and I felt very put on the spot.  Again, I don't want to be an asshole, so I obliged.  She did not record me, and was happy to hear some music during her workday.\n\nTime #3 of singing at work:  A new guy joined the staff, and I made sure to ask the group not to record while I was singing.  The new guy recorded me anyway, and again, not wanting to be an asshole, I didn't ask him to delete it, but I did ask him not to send it to anyone.  He left the company shortly after.  \n\nTime #4: My boss' boss (BB) was coming to town, and my boss jokingly-but-also-not-jokingly told me I'd have to sing for BB when she got here.  I get that I do an interesting thing that not everyone sees every day, but I'm not a bird.  I don't sing on command and TBH, if you're going to ask me to sing for you like this, at what point am I doing free work I would normally charge for?  This is my profession, and I make a lot more than minimum wage when I perform professionally.  I tried to reject the request in a joking way, but I felt bad, so I offered to sing something short after work when BB left.  After saying no to singing for BB, my boss said \"oh no worries, I have my own recording to show her!\" I asked to see the recording, and he tried to show me by scrolling through a text conversation between him and someone else, meaning he's sent this video to someone.  He never found the recording on his phone, and dismissed me after a few seconds of scrolling.  Right before I sang for the group later that day, my boss mentioned off-handedly that he sent the video of me to the whole district.  I sang for them anyway, because no one had their phones out, and I promised one woman in particular I'd sing for her because she hadn't heard me before, but I was very angry after hearing that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't said anything to anyone about it because I don't want to be a diva or a jerk, and I don't want to blow anything out of proportion.  I have mentioned that I have a YouTube channel in the hopes that this will stop people from feeling the need to record for themselves.  Again, I don't want to be a diva, but singing *is* my career, and as a young artist I'd like to have as much control as possible over what content has my name and voice attached to it.  In the videos I have posted online, I look and sound my best; When I sing for funsies at work, I do not.  I know no one at this random office has the power to make or break my career or to make me go viral, but it's the principle.  I don't think I'll sing at work ever again which makes me sad, but if people can't respect my boundaries, I can't continue to put myself in that position.  I fear my pushy boss will make things awkward the next time he tries to make me sing for someone and I decline, but I want these recordings to stop, and in a perfect world, the ones that do exist would be deleted.\n\n**TL;DR**: Professional singer being asked to sing for office fun at side-job.  I do it, and some people really enjoy the music and are respectful, but others record and share it w/o my permission.  I'm planning on refusing all future requests to sing for people at work and might even talk to some about deleting any existing recordings on their phones.  I don't want to rob others of a fun thing they seem to really like because of a few bad apples.  AITA?",

I am a satisfied bachelor at the moment but figured i would give it a shot b/c what the heck. We begin to text to try to get to know each other. About a week and 75 texts later I feel no chemistry or real desire to continue the conversation. Texting back becomes a chore and I found myself waiting sometimes hours. I made the decision not to lead her on or anything and told her that I wasnt really looking for a relationship and I apologized for jumping into something before really analyzing my motivations.\nCo workers who set me up are livid. They express that im rude for sending that message without getting to know the girl better. Called me judgy for not giving her more chances.  I thought I was being quite civil about it. \n\n\nTLDR: coworkers set me up, I wasnt feeling it, coworkers upset calling me names.",

I replied no as I did not want to have the screen far away from me and I didn't want to assist in an emergency. Then, they just said ok and let me board the plane.\n\nBecause, I was travelling with some sports equipment, I had to go to the odd sized baggage outlet to claim my baggage. There was a stroller already there when I arrived to the conveyor. 5 minutes later, my equipment came through and I heard a guy shout from the other side: \"No more already\". Could this possibly mean that I caused a handicapped person to miss their flight.\n\nAdditional info: I chose my seat but I am not sure if I had to pay for it.\n\nPersonal reflection: I would gladly pay the average seat change fee so that a handicapped person would not miss their flight but not for them to avoid inconvenience.\n\n",

      "description": "My birthday was last November I'd call it an alright one. I spent time with my family, my friends took me out, I had a lovely time except for one thing: my boyfriend did nothing for me. I got a happy birthday text but other than that no presents or plans of any kind. This did bother me so I brought it up with him and he told me birthdays aren't his thing, he doesn't even celibrate his own. I was disappointed but accepted that that's just the kind of guy he is, it's not like I had a bad birthday anyway. I made a metal note that he doesn't do birthdays left it at that. I feel the need to point out that this is a newish relationship, we've been together since last summer so we're still learning little things like that about eachother.\n\nFast forward to last weekend and Saturday was my boyfriend's birthday. We had a quiet night in, watched a movie, ordered take out and hung out. We were cuddling when he asked me what I got for him. I was surprised, said I didn't get anything and reminded of the conversation we had after my birthday. He pouted about it and asked why I didn't bother doing anything. I reminded him that he did nothing for mine, but he insisted it was different because I'm, in his words, \"A birthday person\". This honestly made me mad because this seems like a bullshit double standard. He does nothing for my birthday and that's okay, I do nothing for his and that's not okay? Seems like nonsense to me.\n\nSo my question here today is am I the asshole here? My boyfriend insists I am but I really don't think so.",

      "description": "I met my current girlfriend in community college three years ago. When we first began dating she said that her parents would never let her date until she was completely finished with her university studies so that meant that we had to hide out and her parents could never find out. Furthermore, she also made me promise to never tell my own parents as we live in a pretty small town and she was paranoid that somehow if my parents knew they might run into her parents and they would find out and she \"would be disowned.\" I did not understand this as we were both legally adults, but nonetheless I went along with it as she explained that in her family's culture it's normal for parents to be very overprotective of their children well into their 20s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the next two years we sort of made it work as we spent a lot of time in school together and we would occasionally go get food or hiking after school. Often times she would be visibly uncomfortable and attempt to hide her face if she suspected that someone her family knows was close by. This seemed ridiculous to me as our college and the areas we usually hang out at are a solid 30-minute drive from her town. Despite us dating for a long time, this behavior has not gone away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, I was about to finish my studies at CC and was accepted into a university I really wanted to go to, but this university was several states away. I let her know of this and she broke down in tears and begged me to instead study at the university closest to us which is about an hour drive away and she promised she would tell her parents about us as soon as she was herself in university. I felt bad for making her cry, so I accepted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to this past November which was towards the end of my first semester at this university. One day when we met up near CC she told me she was changing her career path. She originally was planning on getting her BA and then applying for a teacher's credential program to teach at the elementary school level, but pressure from her family made her switch to being a doctor. She explained that her family would never allow her to date while going to medical school and that our relationship had to be kept secret until she was out of medical school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis felt like a bomb had been dropped on me as she was essentially saying that our relationship would be kept secret for nearly a decade before I would even get the chance to be introduced to her parents. I don't know what to do. I sincerely love my girlfriend, but I sometimes feel like I have wasted the last three years of my life in this relationship as it has not felt normal in the least bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My gf and I have dated for three years and she's forced me to keep our relationship secret due to her strict parents and is telling me it has to remain that way for at least another six years. I want to break up, but I'm afraid of this coming off as heartless.",

I don't like shouting because I think it makes me look like a lunatic, but at the same time I've lost all patience.\n\nLast election day I was in a multi-car accident that was my fault. No one was hurt, and most of the damage to all the cars was minimal. But the insurance company decided that the cost of repairs to my car was valued higher than my car, so they totaled it. \n\nAfter 10 exhausting days of test driving &amp; trying to decide on a different car, I decided that I loved my previous car so much that I bought another similar used car; same make &amp; model, older year. It was mint condition and I was excited. The car dealer was an hour from my house, which didn't seem like an issue at the time of purchase.\n\nWhen I drove the car home, I noticed an oil leak on the floor of my garage. Called the dealer who said he would take care of it and 2 days later he gave me a loaner car until it was repaired. \n\nDriving home from the dealer, I stopped to get gas and noticed my bumper had a hole in it and a bumper light was cracked. At this point I'm feeling jinxed, but I reach out to the dealer again who promises to fix it since it happened in his lot.\n\nThis was Thanksgiving week and the following week I was scheduled to have a mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. Having a ton of anxiety about the upcoming 10 hour surgery, my husband assured me that he would take my car to the dealer for repair while I was home recovering. At that time he was going to be off work to help me, and I was glad that I didn't have to think about it anymore.\n\nMy surgery happened, he was off work, and my parents even stayed an extra week to help with the kids...But my car sat in the garage. I wasn't able to drive for several weeks due to the type of reconstruction I had. After my surgery, doctors said I would need chemotherapy because my cancer had spread to a lymph node. I'm a real fucking sob story these days.\n\nLast week I drove the car to the dealer on my way to chemotherapy and dropped it off. I took a train and several uber rides to get to chemo, my husband picked me up after treatment and drove me home. The dealer said the repair would take 2 days, and after a week he finally said 5 pm on Friday. I said I would pick it up Saturday and texted him when I was about to leave. At that point, he told me it wasn't going to be ready until Monday because the repair wasn't good enough and needed to be redone.\n\nI know the dealer is the asshole in this story, but I'm also furious at my husband for not handling this 2 months ago as promised. I told him I need him to drive me to the dealer to pick up the car but he said I'll have to take an uber. I don't think I should have to go alone. I don't want to go alone. I don't even want to have to deal with this. Shouldn't he have to drive me? Isn't that the least he can do?!",

      "description": "I manage a new and used furniture store and the other day I took a little cat nap in the office. Whoops. I know that's super unprofessional, but it was a painfully slow day and it was the first one that I've done in a very very long time. \n\nMy office manager apparently walked in with photo of a table on her phone and shook me awake to get a confirmation on a price for a customer. I apparently said $300 and went right back to sleep.  I wake up like five minutes later, continue helping at the same customer, and looked at their invoice on the computer. I noticed a table on it and asked her \"Amanda, what the hell is that?\" She said \"It's the table.\" \n\"What table??\"\n\"The one I asked you about in the office while you were sleeping...?\"\nI had no idea what the hell she was talking about and saw the table that she apparently showed me. The table was a handcrafted all Oak and mahogany dining table and is going for $1,000. At that point I just had to admit and explain to the customer that I have no recollection of her asking me about this table and give him the actual price it was going for. He starts going off saying \"no, that's bullshit... that's what I was told and agreed-upon... so now you have to eat it and give it to me for that much.\" \n\nI explained to him that I can't give it for that little  and I'll be willing to compromise for this misunderstanding and give him a 20% discount as a floor model and give it to him for $800 instead. He didn't even speak to me directly and starts claiming me as a \"snake\" because that's not what he heard and I'm going back on my word as a business owner and \"a man\". I told him that I could easily say that he's a snake back for trying to take advantage of me while I was asleep.\n\nThis goes on back and forth for like a good 40 minutes and, mind you, we haven't run a single card and we haven't touched a dime of his. But to him, we already owe him this table for not a penny more than $300. No takesy backsies. It finally escalates to me just ignoring the issue with the table all together and asking them what color does he want the other items he ordered in. He said he doesn't want to buy anything at all anymore. So I said \"Great we're done here then\" and just deleted the invoice altogether. Now the dude asked me if I want to talk to him outside. \n\nI said \"What we got to talk about? I've been taking to you for past 45 minutes.\" \n\"No, c'mon, I just want to talk to you.\"\n\"Why we gotta go outside for that?\" \n\"I can talk to you behind that counter if you want.\" \n\"Really, with all these cameras are around us?\" \n\"Yeah I don't care.\" \n\"Yeah man, I don't want to talk to you man.\" \n\"Yeah, I bet you don't....\" And he walks out and waits there by his car for me to get out. \n\nBut it's a good thing he did though. The second I saw that door close, I called 911. I let them know that a customer threatened to assault me because of a misunderstanding over a price. About 10 minutes later while the guy was still outside, three cops showed up and started questioning him. They came in and questioned me, I told him what went down, and they told me if the guy comes back, I can call them up and they'll take him away. They're right down the street. He eventually left after he saw the cops weren't leaving. We locked up and I was walking to my car to get home safely\n\nI told this to a few members of my family and friends and they told me one of two things: \n° \"This wouldn't have happened if you weren't sleeping on the job like a bum. Clearly, he was way more wrong, but you weren't right.\"\n° \"Next time you get a situation, or deal with a person like that, just give him what he wants and get him the fuck out of your face.\"\n\nI take full responsibility for sleeping on the job. It's just wild to me that the day ended up so \"Murphy's Law\". It's the first nap I've taken in maybe 10 months and the one person it would have fuck me over with just happened to be the one I got.  But I got it disagree with giving him what he wanted. To me, that validates his behavior and lets him know that he can pretty much do that whenever he wants in my shop again. Or others for that matter. And not just for him, but maybe for his buddies too.\n\nSorry this post went on longer than expected, but what's your guys take on it? Am I the asshole for not living up to those two bullet points?",

      "description": "Sorry for the formatting,I am on mobile &amp; TL;DR in the end\n\n\n\nHello guys how are you doing. I am a 17 years old guy and I've known this also 17 years old guy for about 2 years now. He transferred to the school I was in and I was the first person to talk to him. \n\nI started hanging out with him the first friday of last year's school year. We hung out we had fun and we'd hang out pretty much every Friday. \n\nHe has depression but he never likes talking about it. I've offered help numerous times or if he wanted to talk to anyone I am always here.\n \nHe was good until this year started when he started smoking and was way too negative, it started effecting me and how I view things in life. I've started getting mad over literally anything which I was no-way near before. He'd always say negative stuff all the time about himself,other people and things in general. \n\nSo today I sent him a message saying this \n\n\"Hey (insert name) How are you I hope you're doing well. \nI am here to talk to you about the negative energy surrounding you and how it affected my personal life. I decided that we can't hang out anymore for the fact that I've started thinking about smoking &amp; for the fact that I am never happy with whatever happens to me which affected my relationship with my family &amp; Loved ones. I want you to know that I am still here for you and if you want to talk about it then I am still here. If you ever feel like changing your way of how you see life then I am more than happy to help it's just I can't take that much negative energy on a daily basis. You have my social medias you have my number and I am always here for you. Best of luck\"\n\nI checked a few hours ago and he blocked me on every social media account. And I am almost positive that he blocked my number. Which made me feel bad about myself. \n\n\nTL;DR I cut my best friend of my life because he's way too negative but still offered to help him . Then he blocked me on every social media account.\n\n\nSorry for any grammatical error I am not a fluent and if you see any please mention it and I'll edit it ASAP ty. ",

      "description": "So about a month ago I was banned from my favorite Discord server, and the reason for the ban took me by surprise. I had often been using this server as a way to vent or to ask for advice (there were channels both, which I used), often discussing sensitive topics in my life such as self harm. \n\nOne day, I brought up the fact that I had talked with my therapist about self harm, because this was a difficult thing for me to do and I was proud of myself for doing it. I mentioned that my therapist did not treat it like it was a big deal and did not tell my parents, and several people were concerned and said that my therapist is not doing her job. I went on to say that I myself do not see my self harm as a big deal, and believe that it was something I have under control. They told me that any self harm is a big deal, and I should go to the hospital and get help. I hadn’t even self harmed in weeks. The argument went on, i continued to be stubborn and say that I’m fine. I truly do believe that I was fine. I still do. I’ve never been better actually. On the other hand, they argued that I needed a new therapist, and that i was not fine, and that i needed to seek help. \n\nThe argument sort of fizzled out, and about 15 minutes later I received this message from one of the server admins:\n\n&gt;so it's been decided that you'll be banned. you come here and abuse this community by being a help vampire. you go on and on about your self-harm, but whenever anybody offers you help, you make excuses for why you can't do anything, and you deny that anything's wrong. it's hurtful and emotionally draining on the people who try to help you. this is not okay. we hope that you get help, but the mods have to take into consideration the wellbeing of the people you're hurting, some of whom are also vulnerable and in bad places.\n\nWell shit. I have been beating myself up about this for a while, and I still can’t believe how oblivious I was to how this might hurt other people. I guess I didn’t think that they would actually care about me enough. So, am I the asshole for not being considerate of their emotions? \n\n ",

      "description": "So me and my roommate have been pretty good friends but as happens in these situations there have been some difficulties but for the first year things have actually gone pretty well until recently. I'll call my roommate Arthur and his girlfriend Mary.\n\n\nOne other thing I should mention is we live in a house that I'm in the upstairs and hes downstairs, this was his decision as the downstairs has a bit more storage and higher ceilings to fit his television.\n\n\nRecently he started dating Mary who i feel has been trying to slowly push her way in. I would actually be okay with her moving in, with the condition that this would mean I could move out and she would take over the rent, which may be a bit expensive for Mary but that's not really any of my business.\n\n\n I also have a GF I have been dating the entire time we have lived together. She stays over one weekend night a week and visits for about 2 hours from 6 to 8 most weeknights. Since Arthur has started dating Mary she is typically over when I get home from work until my roommate leaves for work in the morning.\n\n\nOn one occasion when she was staying over for the third night consecutively, I texted my roommate that if she was going to move in I would start looking for a new place. He did apologize, said she was over too often and that there had been special circumstances in this case. This would not be a normal thing was what I was assured. For about 2 weeks this was true, Mary only stayed over once or twice and when she was over there was definatemt a reduction in volume so I thought things were on the right track. \n\n\nThis pattern of her staying over consistently has begun again though with her being over 4 of the last 5 nights to sleep. \n\n\nThere are two living room areas outside of the bedrooms. His is downstairs. My television is in the upstairs living room which has no separation between it and the kitchen. \n\n\nWith just Arthur this was never an issue as he generally kept to his own stuff, wouldnt be making excessive noise and usually completed whatever he was doing in an hour at most. \n\n\nMary however loves to bake, and does have a kitchen available at the place that she rents. Usually I'd just go to my room and watch some videos on my phone but I had a hockey game on in the evening that I had no way to record, when I came home I didn't even have the time to finish serving the pizza I'd picked up for my GF and myself on the way home for work before they were climbing over me to get to the stove. They had also been home for at least an hour and a half before this. \n\n\nArthur notices that I give Mary a look when I have to carry my pizza around her to the plates I had just set on the counter, that she decided to stand between myself and the box. Arthur asks if I have a problem with them being upstairs and I awnser that I dont mind having him upstairs, but that his girlfriend doesn't need to be baking him cookies here, she could do that at her house and bring them here. She stormed off downstairs and my roommate proceeded to be upstairs until midnight making his cookies (from 6:30 PM). \n\n\nI just dont feel comfortable.coming home from work and having them in my space. It also bothers me how long their sessions upstairs seem to be. Generally when they bake it takes between 6-8 hours until I can be sure that a stranger isn't going to be in my living area. I probably would not have said anything if not asked but now I feel like I need to set some boundaries and I'm wondering if people would think these rules are too strong. \n\nThese rules would also apply to my girlfriend as well as his. \n1. 2 Overnights per 7 days (I was thinking 3 but I feel like any leeway I give them they will take advantage of)\n2. Guests should ask permission before parking in driveway. (Takes my spot every night I come home and makes a big stink when I get her to move). \n3. 24 Hour notice if guests are going to be in the other person's living space\n4. Guests may not use kitchen or laundry appliances\n5. Guests should only arrive when invited ( Mary likes to show up and bang on the door at night to wake her boyfriend up to let her in, it doesn't bug me as I usually stay up later but its knocked some of my valuables off shelves). If they arrive unannounced they should contact the resident by phone instead of body checking the house\n6. Guests should clean up any messes they leave in the house. ( I dont mind if my roommate leaves stuff in the sink for a day or two, I'll usually even clean it as that's usually easy as putting it into the dishwasher after emptying, but I'm not cleaning up after her baking and he doesn't either)\n\nAre these fair rules or AITA?

      "description": "My brother got married last weekend, about 2 weeks after my partner first dropped the divorce bomb on me. I held out hope but it became clear right before I left for the wedding that reconciliation wasn't going to happen. I still went to the wedding, but was obviously upset. \n\nI had been working and didn't have a chance to see or talk to my family prior to the rehearsal dinner. When I got there, my parents asked me where my partner was, so I had to tell them that we were facing divorce. A lot of my family comforted me and let me talk it out, but my brother was busy with his fiancé and wedding things.\n\nThe wedding itself was obviously emotional for someone in my position and I cried a few times. My parents and some family took some time to comfort me, but it wasn't like they spent the whole day glued to my side. \n\nThe day after the wedding we were having lunch at my mom's house and my brother told me that he thought it was rude that I didn't keep the divorce to myself until after the wedding. He accused me of taking all the attention away from him and his new wife. I told him he was being an insensitive jerk who clearly doesn't value family. He told me if I wasn't trying to seek attention, I would've told my parents to stop comforting me and go back to the wedding. I'm upset that he questioned my emotions like that, as if I am not genuinely upset about my situation. AITA?",

      "description": "Important history: G &amp; L sorta dated. L is like a brother to me. G is a friend in the friend group that broke L's heart. Please, ask for more information on that if you want it, otherwise assume it was a fuckery. (There's much more history in general, but character limits are a bitch, so).\n\nI started organizing this group event (coinciding with my birthday in November) in like July. I get numbers so I can plan ahead. G and L are both meant to be there originally. So G texts me to tell me (not ask) that she's bringing new man to the event. I ask her if she thinks it'll be weird for L and she says it'll be fine and she'll text him (at this point, L has requested she not reach out to him until he's ready). The long and short is that L tries to compromise, and G eventually decides if she can't bring her new man to the event, then she's not going to come.\n\nOther things G has done since this: brings up her sex life at any possible moment, in great detail. Never asks anyone how their life is going, only chooses to complain to us about her shit. Stopped showing up to our final semester of lectures (and basically said she was doing so because she was too busy having sex) and proceeded to fail exams accordingly and then whined about having to retake them. (It should also be noted that throughout all of this, G has also remained friends with someone that was INCREDIBLY unkind to me and her supposed best friend, so I've already felt like she doesn't know how to do friendship). She also got into an argument with myself and our other friend (both LGBTQ+) about how she thinks there's a right and wrong way to do gay pride.\n\nMost recently, she reduced our mutual best friend to tears by berating her via text about how it was unfair for her to be left out of a group present (an inadvertent group present) and that she knew how alienated G felt by our group (self imposed, from how little she showed up to things) and that our friend was basically a horrible person for making her feel bad when she has exams coming up (the second shot at them, due to her having failed, due to her not having shown up to our last semester, or really having studied at all). They've basically not spoken since, despite having been best friends up until this point.\n\nNow, whenever G sees me, she's big on affection and asking how I am and how my life is. I presume that it's because she's limited her friends because of alienating people with her behavior and she thinks we have something in common with our career choices? AITA for not really wanting to associate with her much? She's disrespected me, my house, my best friend, proven that she's willing to stay friends with people that literally reduced me to tears with what they said, shows poor judgment and generally just drains my goddamn energy any time that I have to deal with her?\n\nTLDR: my friend has a history of shitty behavior, AITA for wanting to keep her at arm's length?",

Unfortunately, I usually start homework and other things around 8pm due to extracurriculars and end around midnight. Now here is where things get iffy. My dad is a super light sleeper and so am I. So whenever I’m up late at night let’s say in the kitchen I try super hard to be as quiet as I can to preserve my dads sleep. Now when my dad is up in the morning he’s pretty loud making coffee and such. I’ve asked him so many times to please try and be a little less loud but he doesn’t seem to be trying. I’ve tried to use earplugs when I’m sleeping but those don’t work very well. WIBTA if I just stopped being super quiet at night if he isn’t quiet in the morning? ",

      "description": "Okay, let me preface by saying i am a high school senior with Autism. Everyone in this story is aware of that fact.\n\nNow, for the last few years I have had a large group of friends - about 5 of us. But in the last year, the group has gotten a lot bigger. To around the 11/12 person mark. Which in itself has bothered me due to there being too many people. With this, there has also been an increase in noise, to a level that for me isnt manageable.\n\nBecause of this, I starting spending time with other people, a group of Junior girls who are much quieter and as such i feel more comfortable around. As well as this, these people are a lot less into drugs and alcohol - substances I am totally against (although i don't judge people for alcohol consumption)\n\nThe group of Juniors started pointing out how poorly I was being treated by my Senior friends, as stated they were quite rowdy and that meant I was jumped on a lot and thrown about - which given my condition meant that i sometimes went into overload or had to leave the situation.\n\nAs such, I began spending next to no time with the seniors, they, having noticed, started to get more agitated with me. Over recent months I have constantly been pelted with food and with wooden cutlery and lots of snide comments have been made towards me and to my Junior friends. To the point where one has become really upset and another has said that they wish they had never befriended me.\n\nI have recently realised that the Seniors have been doing this because they want me back in their group which has made me feel quite shit.\n\nSo, AITA for ditching the Seniors for Juniors? AITA for putting the Juniors in a situation where they are getting insulted and having things thrown at them?\n\nTldr; I ditched my friends for another group who i was more comfortable around, I was getting abuse but now I know it was because they wanted me back\n",

I'm living next to my parents, in my own house, and they are professional dog breeders, so we are having puppies a few times a year.\n\nI have a cousin, he is 6 years older than me (I'm 23) and we never really got along. Since we were small, he always insulted me at family gatherings, that he has better clothes, grades. In my early teens I decided to become an actor (musical), so each and every time he told me, that I am an idiot, but he's generous and will give me some change, when I will be begging on the street later on in my life. I'm now working as an actor btw. He learned to be a pilot but stopped before the final exam and became an engineer. This resulted in a huge fall out with that side of the family. He has never contacted me during those years, but he got married and got 2 children as well. Now we are currently having a litter and he contacted me (not even my parents) if they could come around. My grandma would really like us to have a good relationship but he has been always an asshole to me. Even my father said that I should host a party then, but I am really not interested in him. Would I be the asshole if I just told him no and blocked him?",

I am mean to everyone, rich or poor, white or black, happy or depressed, i will textually abuse you to no end, despite anything, because i'm an asshole, but i'm an equal opportunity asshole, so i think i'm more of a decent person than usual redditors who will only talk relentless remorseless shit about people who their group deems should be demonized, and then be all pissy and defensive if anyone talks shit about their group or people they defend.   \n\nI preach saying I should have the right to beat other people's children in public. I preach telling people we should kill all of the kids with cancer and old people to save money on health insurance, I preach saying that when people wanted equal rights for slaves that means the whites should have been enslaved, when women wanted equal rights that means men can no longer vote. I will be mean to everyone and disrespect everyone. Nobody is better than anyone else, they are all the bottom rung of society, so I hate everyone to the degree that a vehement nationalist racist would hate a black man who flew a plane into the world trade center and raped 100 white women on the way. Everyone is that shitty to me, at least I'm an egalitarian though. I'm not that angry, the way I feel about people is like having a retarded child, you just stop giving a fuck and hope the child dies instead of making your life fucking intolerable and painfully retarded just by existing. Of course it can be said I am so viciously pretentious, conceited, and arrogant that I have a God complex and I am consumed by attention seeking narcissism, but on this website that would be like saying that I breathe oxygen.

      "description": "I'm 14M, he's 16M and autistic. This took place a few weeks ago. He was having one of his meltdowns this evening (for reasons I don't feel like explaining) but much worse than usual. Now when my brother has meltdowns he usually just screams and flails around a lot. On rare occasions he might try to hurt himself or break stuff but it's really not too bad. For some reason I legitimately do not know he decided to be a cunt to me in particular that day and get all up in my face. I got the fuck out of there as quickly as possible and let my parents handle it. \n\nAll was well for about half an hour untill my parents decided that it was time for everyone to go to bed so they took my brother upstairs. All our bedrooms and the bathroom are upstairs so that's where I was. One should also know that it's pretty common in my family for multiple people to use the bathroom at once.\n\nMy brother had calmed down a bit so my parents let him wonder around while they got ready for bed. I really had to pee so I decided that this was my chance. I went to the bathroom where my dad was showering and my mum was brushing her teeth so they were both out of action. \n\nWhen I left the bathroom to return to my room my brother saw me and freaked out again. He was going absolutely ballistic. I got into my room and tried to shut the door on him but failed. He was flailing around like mad, screaming his head off and getting really close to me. He ended up backing me into a wall. I was screaming at my parents to get him off me but they didn't come right away. We started pushing each other. He was still screaming. I just couldn't get him off me so I took a swing at him, right in his face and as hard as I could. That's when my parents finally came and got him out of my room. \n\nI know fully well that he wouldn't hurt me in a billion years. There is zero chance that he would have done me any harm if I had just waited for my parents to come. I was aware of that then too. The thing is that my brother is a full foot taller than me and having him scream at me and flail aroud like a madman while having me up against a wall is quite a terrifying sight. I'm not gonna lie though, the main reason I did it was because I was fucking pissed. I had done nothing to him and he had no right to behave that way. But well, he can't really help it so maybe that's a bad excuse. Still though, I get that he's disabled but that doesn't give him a free pass to come into my room and fucking assault me. I'm honestly kinda toarn here though.\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "title": "AITA for hiding my romantic interest from a close friend?",
      "description": "I had an LDR with someone over 4 years ago now. It was a good relationship, it just fizzled out over time and after just short of a year we broke up. For the most part just me, her and one other (her best friend at the time) kept in contact. They've moved apart and fallen apart. I've also stopped contact with my ex fairly recently (but we'd stayed friends with semi-regular contact until now). Mostly this happened due to some choices my ex made that aren't really relevant to this story. Her friend and I have kept a healthy relationship for 4 years and we've got to become pretty close. For a while now we speak daily, on call as well as video chat and in an almost continuously flowing text conversation (i.e. it doesnt really start/stop we just message each other as and when without the \"hello/goodbye\" normal conversation starters). This person has always been someone i've liked a lot but never had any romantic notions towards. After my ex and ibroke up, we got closer and i kinda grew to look at her like a younger sister i was close to. We've had nothing but a platonic friends hip the entire time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point is that recently my feelings towards her have started to change (obvious i know). I feel like that \"grow to love people over time\" thing has happened to me. It's probably been going on for a while and i've only just now noticed it (think slowly boiling frog analogy). We were talking about how we both care too much for people. I realised I care a lot... In fact i care about her more than almost anyone else and as much as my closest family when i started to really think about it. The reason i question my \"assholeness\" isn't really so much the closeness to my ex or whether i think that makes it wrong for us. It's been a long time and neither of us want to be with the other. The problem mainly comes from the fact that this girl has been a close friend to me and I to her for so long with no romantic undertones whatsoever. As i said she's been like a little sister to me. I know she isn't my sister but it's a weird and kind of uncomfortable realisation that i'm actually attracted to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think by telling her this it will change very much... I'm not sure i'm ready to be in a relationship or if she is. And even if she was I don't think she's attracted to me in the same way. Personally i think she can do better anyway regardless of how much i care for her. I feel uncomfortable hiding my emotions from her, it's not something i really do. I tend to be honest to the point of being rude, personally I wish that's how everyone worked. It feels like a deception and feels wrong to not disclose my feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinding it hard to stay within the word count. I feel like there are more reasons I should be honest with her and more i want to say but i suck at being concise so **TL;DR** = AITA for lying/hiding my emotions for fear of ruining the friendship?",

      "description": "So the story is that I grow up living together with my mother and my grandmother. My father killed himself just before my birth and because of that, I have never had any fatherly figure in my life. My grandmother was a very heavy person, she had terrible anger management issues and was everything opposite of a good grandparent. My mum never left her because for god knows what reason she felt the need to stay with her. Anyway, the biggest problem was not her but my mother. Of course, she also got a short temper but it was more developed into a manipulation. Also, she did drink a lot. And every single time she would go drinking I would need to go with her because when she's drunk she would just lay on the cold ass ground, even in freezing winter, and would refuse to move. I was a child and the scariest thing for me was to lose or her being sick so I would try to make her get up and get home safe. And for that, I would get beaten a lot. I could not say the word. If I would I would get beaten more or threatened to be given up for adoption. When she would be sober she would act like nothing ever happened. She would manipulate me a lot if I would say something that she did not want to hear, blaming me that I wanted her dead and stuff. \n\nWhen I was 19 I moved to another city, and at 21 I moved to a different country. I could never stay near her. Now I am 25.\n\nThe older I get the more I struggle with severe depression and anxiety, and more I think that it was her fault. I was not supposed to take care of her drunk ass, I was a child, she was supposed to do that. And she still tries to manipulate me if I don't talk with her (she texts me at least 3-4 times per week) or that I am not visiting her enough. All these things I do just because she is still my mother but I can't talk with her about anything, she has no idea in what kind of life holes I've been into. She is a stranger to me. I know one day I am going completely cut all the connections with her.\n\nMy boyfriend thinks I should not do that, even if he knows my reasoning.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "This happened a few years back but whenever I think about it I feel guilty. \n\nI was in a rock ensemble in college where the singer was a blind girl (19f at time). Her and I (26m at time) became pretty friendly over the semester despite our age difference. One day after practice we were shooting the shit and she brought up that she wanted to smoke some pot. I was all about it so I got her some and met her at a park not far from her dorm. I gave her the baggie and we toked a little bit. Afterwards I offered to walk with her back to the dorm but she insisted it was out of my way and I shouldn’t, so I just hopped the nearest train home. \n\nBut when I saw her a few days later she had a big ol’ bruise on like 2/3s of her face. She wouldn’t tell me when, but she told me she walked into a pole. I’m 90% sure it happened right after our smoke session, but it also could’ve happened while she was stoned on her own at some point I guess. \n\nSo reddit.... am I a huge ass hole for not finding some reason to walk her back to the dorm for what could’ve been her first time ever being stoned? (I don’t know if it was her first time, but she was pretty young and naive so it’s likely) Or even just for getting her weed in the first place?",

      "description": "So to get this straight this happened back 2015 going into 2016 \n\nAfter a short relationship for about 6 months, me and my ex decided it was best we stay close friends. It was working well for a while we even decided to try and work together to make a little visual novel (I'd write, she drew and a few of her friends would help) during Christmas she knew I'd collect video game consoles fix them up and sell them to friends if they wanted one. I was willing to give her a 2DS o recently finished fixing after a dent in the screen. This was over a skype call so it was never written down. She was willing to pay 50 for it cause she was my ex and I knew she was tight on cash at the time(it would have been a net lose if I did that but I'm generally too nice for my own good sometimes) \nShe need one for one of her nephews cause she wasnt able to get them anything for Christmas.\n\n So when I went over to give it to her and get the,   money a week later, she back tracked and assumed I was giving her it as a gift. I told it wasnt and that she would need to get me the money at this point I didnt give her a date of when to get the money just telling her i needed the money. She agree and I left. After a while of thinking I of how nice I was being with her and thought I was being too nice so I decided to call her. I told her I wanted the money before June 1st so I'd have to take back the DS. I think this pissed her off cause when she agreed to it she said I'd have to pay her back for the 10$ game she just put on it so her nephew could play it. I explained to her that wasnt going to happen and after little bit of back and forth we stopped and just hung up. \n\nA few hours later, in the skype chat where were in together to help keep track of who was helping us with the visual novel, I see a message from her saying I was being an asshole and before I could even respond she kicked me from the group. I messaged anyone who in the group privately and they sided with her. After that I went to one of my close friends at the time and told him what happened. Apparently he talked to her too and Sided with her. He was calling me names and shitting on me while I stood there and took the insult (by the way there were times I help this man go through tough times when he was low and he showered me with unasked for gifts) a lot saying how I wasnt a friend to him. That was the last I spoke to him that day.\n\nAfter a while I was sulking from how many people I knew calling me an asshole that I believed it. I lost contact with some good people and lost all the progress I made in the visual novel ask she took over all the documents I had given out. But I had other friends to lean on and they got me through it. But it's been bugging be since then If I was being an complete asshole that day. Cause I mean if so many people say I'm an asshole then it must be true.",

      "description": "My parents are in the middle of a divorce because of some serious illegal activities performed by my dad. We found out in October. \n\nI have been working as a contractor for the company my dad works for. Dad is going through legal things right now but it was a good part-time position so I kept working there. For the last month I've been spiralling into a depression and he knows that. So about 3 weeks ago I told him that they needed to find someone to replace me because I'm going to be done working for them. I needed space from him because I'm only allowed to talk to him about work and it was getting stressful. (Something to do with his therapy process)\n\nIn all honesty I was going to stop working for them around last week but then he said he found someone to hire and I didn't mind being the one to train new guy since I know I'm the only one that knows what I do.\n\n Dad said right away so I waited. And waited. I confronted him this morning about it and he said that he wouldn't start for 2 weeks and that they expected me to stay till new guy starts. I told him that I'm not comfortable with that and that I'm going to be done working for them as of now. \n\nFor him that meant that I don't have contact anymore (personal because of above issues). And that I didn't give him a timely notice. \n\nI think he is frustrated because he won't be allowed to talk to me anymore after this and he thinks I hate him (not true, I am disappointed). I don't think he actually cares about the job. \n\nI feel like asking him 3 weeks ago to replace me was plenty notice. So AITA?\n\nSide note: I don't want to talk about the divorce. Or why they're getting a divorce.",

      "description": "In class today the usual late bird came in with very smelly soup, a big matcha frappucino, and a bag of croutons. She sat right beside me and started loudly slurping her soup. Now, I don't like soup. To me it kind of looks like barf. And this soup was very pungent. It smelled like fish chowder but was also very tomatoey. She also started slurping her drink very loudly and started eating her croutons very loudly. At one point she started dumping them in her mouth from the bag.  \n\n\nI tried to ignore her but then she started leaning closer to me and was looking at what I was doing on my laptop. I should mention that I have sensory issues and was already getting overwhelmed by the smell of the soup. Her chewing in my ear just tipped me over the edge.  \n\n\nI turned to her and asked, in an admittedly more aggressive tone than I meant to \"can you please stop doing that? It's really distracting.\"  \n\n\nI really didn't expect her to look so hurt. Like, she was acting as if I had just called her fat or something. She put the lid back on her soup and I saw her lip quiver a little. I haven't been able to stop thinking about this all day and I feel so bad. So, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My brother lost custody of his two children and his ex lost custody of the other two as well.  So my mom is raising four children, only two of which actually are biologically related to us. My mother lives in the projects, can barely pay her bills, and is mentally and physically abusive to these children on occasion.  I spoke with DCS and they said, “Hitting a child in the face doesn’t necessarily constitute abuse.” So there’s that.  However, my brother who has been six years sober is attempting to regain custody of his two.  He isn’t necessarily able to get the youngest two as they aren’t biologically his.  My youngest niece is seven. Again she’s not biologically mine but she’s been my niece since she was born.  She lived with me when she came home from the hospital along with her mother. Anyway, she told me recently multiple times that she wanted to live with me because her sister (11) beats her up all the time and tells her she’s unwanted.  My sweet seven year old niece told me that’s terrified that her biological dad (an abusive sex offender) will come steal her away because that’s what her sister tells her. And that her real mom and dad don’t love her and that’s why they don’t see her, all because my biological niece tells her this. \n\nI asked my mother if I could adopt her. I live in a different state. I’m in the military and I have two children on my own. My reasons were to get her away from her abusive sister and my abusive mother, to offer her a home with a mother and a father in it, and to give her something that she doesn’t think was given out of obligation, something that nobody can ever take away.  \n\nMy mother screamed and cussed me when we talked about this. “How dare you try to take her Way from me.” The evidence for how much better quality of life can b me for a child with a mother and a father is staggering, but my mother wouldn’t hear anything.   \n\ntl;dr - I want to adopt my niece because my mother is a crazy person.  She said I’m an asshole for suggesting it.  ",

She was going to be visiting the town I live in so I figured why not catch up if I had the time. \n\nThe day of the plans, my current gf (29F) starts to express her concern about how I’m choosing to spend time with someone who wasn’t very nice to me when I haven’t been paying that much attention to her. (It’s not the first time she’s brought up feeling unimportant and unappreciated. And my ex wife was a biiiiitch when we were together.)\n\nMy gf said she was uncomfortable and went to bed. I left to meet up with my ex, but on the drive, I started to feel like I had made a mistake. Like I was ignoring the pleas of my gf for intimacy and connection. \n\n(Icing on the cake: I got a call from work saying they needed me. So I felt doubly like I should skip dinner plans.)\n\nSo I cancelled. I went home, had dinner with my girl, worked for a bit. \n\nNow my ex wife is angry because we had those plans for a while and she was “really looking forward to it.” She feels like she came all this way for me only for me to flake. \n\nBut we are not very close friends.

      "description": "So right now I'm about to finish my second semester of community college, and over the course of this semester, I've gotten so picky to the point where the only real dinner that I will eat that's not fast food or pizza is either red meat and poultry, and my parents have increasingly tried to push new foods on me more than once. I've become notorious not only my family but my friend group as well for my picky selection. I don't eat vegetables whatsoever and the same goes with fruits, and this New Years Eve was when I decided to eat a grape in line with our Spanish culture. I've never had a grape before, and when I had it, it tasted awful, and I started gagging. Naturally, my parents did not react to this very well, and this has been the case for every fruit and vegetable that was introduced to me. Bananas, strawberries, cherries, apples, all of which I've never finished or just spit out at the first bite. They've made full dinners before like meatballs with small chopped up carrots, or soup with some carrots in them, and they were absolutely terrible. I've tried to eat vegetables before on small occasions, only to seriously regret it later on. They've tried to introduce new stuff and prepare new dishes but my daily diet has slimmed down so much, my dinner is just rice and chicken or specifically a skirt steak. I've had to put food as leftovers. They're upset at me for not wanting to try new things, and I'm upset at them for pressuring me to try new things. So am I the asshole for not wanting to try new foods? Am I the asshole for being picky with my food, even when I can't stand the taste of it?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my daughter that her mother went to jail?",
      "description": "So my daughter's mother and I separated about 3 years ago after being together for over 3 years. When we were together she hardly worked or did anything helpful around the house, deciding just to spend what little money she had on beer and cigarettes. We finally separated after she disappeared with my daughter one night drinking while out drinking with her friends while I was working.\nFast forward to earlier this year. I had primary custody because I lived in a better area and paid for everything anyways. The agreement was that my daughter would be with me during the school year and visit her every other weekend and for holidays, then vice versa during the summer. It went fairly ok until the first week her mother was supposed to take her. \nHer plan was to visit her parents out of the state for about a week. After a day or 2 I get a frantic call from her parents telling me that my ex was freaking out, breaking stuff in their house and left the house with my daughter and her sister (not mine) and were walking around town with no money and nowhere to go. Now they had a history of drug abuse in their youth but have since cleaned up, so they had an idea of what this behavior looked like. They told me that they had suspected her to be using meth for a long time and this was confirming their belief, seeing this as her going through withdrawals. She eventually showed back up to their house and I talked her into letting me take my daughter for awhile until she calmed down.\nI immediately bought plane ticket, flew out to get my daughter, and filed an emergency court order and took full custody. She never appeared to the following court dates so I won custody with no battle. I gave her the chance to visit my daughter during this whole process, which she never did and only called every couple of weeks.\nNow, a couple months ago, she was arrested with a couple people for possession of methamphetamine among other things. I told her that she needed to clean up if she wanted to see her daughter, but she has just denied ever even having a drug problem. I tried to smooth things out with my daughter by telling her that her mother was 'sick from taking bd medicine and had to get better before she could take care of her again'. It was the best thing I could come up with without telling her that her mother is a junkie.\nWell now her mother is telling her that I'm lying and that she was never sick, etc. My daughter was really confused and told me she didn't know who to believe. As soon as I heard that I knew I had to tell her the truth or risk our relationship. So I told her that her mother got in trouble with the police after using some 'bad medicine' and that she needed to make better decisions before she could take care of her again. Now my daughter is making notes for her mother saying shes sorry shes in jail and is mad at the police for arresting her. \nI'm not sure what to do or if I made the right choice in telling her the truth. Her mother already tells me how terrible I am weekly, and it's starting to wear on me a little. Am I an asshole?\nTLDR: Daughters mother was using meth but lying to my daughter (5yo) and telling her that I was keeping them apart for no reason so I told my daughter that she was arrested.",

I take the usual route and after coming out of the roundabout, I see the road is blocked off by a tow truck. Since there is about two streets between me and the tow truck I decide I’ll just turn on the street before the truck and go around. Easy peasy. \n\nI was wrong\n\nThe first road is blocked off from construction leaving me no choice but to go to street two. Before I can reach street 2, someone in a reflective vest comes out and starts waving their little “lightsaber” in a circle-side-to-side maneuver. To me it looked like she wanted me to turn right, and go around which I was already planning on doing. \n\nBefore I can get to street two, she starts yelling at me and waving her little light baton wildly. I turn my stereo down and roll he window down, only to get yelled at by this lady. She goes off saying how blind I am and that it’s obvious she was saying turn around. I explain to her what my plan was, since it’s not too close to the tow truck, but she’s having none of it. She refuses to let me, so I just end up turning around and going back home.\n\nWas I wrong to get that close to go around or should I have turned around?\n\n\nTL;DR: Road blocked off, I want to go around, get told to U-turn instead.",

      "description": "This happened in 2016.\n\nBit of backstory: My mom and Dad had 5 kids together, but my dad wasnt home a lot, she ended up cheating on him and they got divorced. Around 2009\n\nFast forward to late 2016. I know my dads side of the family didnt like my mom even when my parents were together. But my dad passed in late 2016 right around the holidays, my aunt was one of the people that had never liked my mom and always had a problem with her no matter what, and a day before the funeral my mom had come to the house where all our family was to drop some food off for everyone and talk to us kids to see how we were. She left shortly after not wanting to bother anyone for obvious reasons. After my mom leaves my aunt tells my little sister that only family is allowed at the reception (my little sister was 10 at the time) and she ended up telling my mom that while I was in the car with them, I was furious. About a few hours later I caught her talking shit about my mom again saying that she didnt have the right to be at the (my dads) house at all. At this point I'm already boiling, I just start screaming at her. I say \"how dare you have the audacity to say that about my mom, she has every right to he here and she was kind enough to drop off food that you graciously ate, and you also told my little sister that she (my mom) wasnt allowed to be at the reception.\" She started crying and ran off into the room she was staying in and everyone was making me feel bad for screaming at her so I just left the house for a few hours. I dont really talk to that aunt anymore and its always awkward around the family. AITA?\n\nTL:DR: My mom cheated on my dad, they divorced, aunt was talking bad about my mom the day before the funeral saying that she wasnt allowed to be there and I screamed at her.",

      "description": "WARNING: Long post/story incoming.\n\nokay so first off, for anonymity, im gonna change all the names in this story (not like it matters but still). so to start, i went to college a bit late in life at 24 and im a guy. i was single at the time and i thought i would have a good time in my first year at school. i met a girl (lets call her shelby) and we started seeing things casual, just hanging out and sex (i told her from the beginning i didnt want anything serious at the time). eventually it started getting a bit too serious and we (well me but she didnt disagree) decided to end it. i had also just met a new girl (Megan this time) that i wanted to start hanging out with it and thought it would be sleezy to be sleeping with two girls regularly at once. shelby didnt take it well at first but she understood in time and we were able to remain friends (i generally try to remain friends with all my exes and people ive been with), i also failed to mention megan to her but i figured i wasnt obliged to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay now jump forward about four or five months. Megan and I have been dating since basically right after I called it off with Shelby and things have been going great. She wanted to wait to have sex and since I was really into this girl I decided to actually commit and wait for her (instead of bailing to find another casual thing). Shelby and I still talk pretty regularly, I even see her from time to time (she is only 20 so i buy her and her friends booze and we hang out for a few hours whenever i do). Now enter Matt. Matt is Megan's really close guy friend, who i am certain is in love with Megan but it doesnt bother me and I trust them both so we get along pretty well. Matt is trying to get over this girl from the last semester and hasnt been seeing anyone since. I convince him to let me hook him up with someone since I figure its the best for him, and as a bonus maybe itll get him a little less attracted to Megan (win/win). I know the perfect girl; Shelby's roomate. They are both very similair, a little dorky/introverted etc, and i figured they would get along great. I ask Shelby to help me hook it up and they end up going on one date (didnt work out but thats irrelavent). Of course during the date the two of them talk about me and Shelby. Matt had no idea Shelby and I were a thing but I figured either he wouldnt tell Megan (not really any of his business) or even if he did it didnt matter as I broke it off with Shelby before Megan and ive done nothing wrong. Or so I thought. This is the part in the story where Megan loses her actual shit. She blows up on me for not telling her about Shelby and she couldnt believe that I was still talking to her (or any of my exes for that matter). I mean I dont see what the problem is here, I didnt cheat on Megan with Shelby or anyone else, its not like im going to list off every single girl ive ever been with or what girls im texting at the time. Anyways we broke up shortly after and it really got to me at the time but im well over it by now but ive always kinda wondered; Am I Really the Asshole Here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\np.s. This all happened a few years back. Thanks for any advice and words of wisdom reddit",

      "description": "Background: I've been friends with this girl \"Ramona\" since our first week freshman year (1.5 years ago). I think she's an amazing person, she's wickedly smart, she's very funny and I have so much fun with her. Ramona is actually very pretty in the face and she takes very good care of herself considering. The issue she is morbidly obese. I would think she weighs well over 300lbs and she's about 5'5-5'6\" so it's even more prounounced because she's average height. She is 23 (I'm 20) and in the time that I've known her I would guess she's gained 50lbs and it really shows in her face. She was on her homecoming court in high school, and while she was \"thick\" she wore it very well. She claims she started gaining weight after a bad break up her freshman year from stress and the weight just came on.\n\nThe issue is I think we've always had a flirty relationship and I just thought it was part of our \"friend language.\" I really enjoy her company and if she were thinner, I can see dating her and even marrying her--we get along that well. \n\nThings went crazy last night to the point where I don't even know if we can be friends anymore. I had a tinder date with another girl that was a disaster.  It was the first time I'd been on a date since college. I didn't even tell Ramona about it but word got back to her and she flipped out. She must have texted me 300 times or more calling me every name in the book (including asshole) and she had her friends text me so all in all I got over 1000 texts before I turned my phone off. When I turned it on the morning it basically bricked itself because it couldn't keep up with all the texts waiting for it (iPhone 10x I'm still paying for. Thanks). The general gyst of everything was that I led her on for the last 1.5 years and now I've fat shamed her and essentially cheated on her and that I'm an asshole.\n\nPart of me sees the point and maybe I am fat shaming her for a condition she can't help but part of me feels like of I'm just not attracted to her, than I'm just not. Am an asshole for any of the above?\n\n",

      "description": "For starters, my parents kicked me out when I was 17.  I'm 26 now, just finished putting myself through from a masters program in may 2018\n\nIn that time, I've probably had less than a dozen conversations with my parents.  They've tried a few times to give me money, but I only accepted it once and afterwards, my mother has tried to use that instance as proof of how magnanimous she is and that i \"owe her\" a chance etc.\n\nIn one of the more recent conversations with my father, he offered my the money they have in their 529 account because it would go unused otherwise. Since I've graduated and moved into a full time position, I've been much less angry with them and after thinking about it for a couple of months, I decided to accept. The 529 had ~1300 or so and the total for this particular loan was ~4200. \n\nWhen paying with the 529, they cut an additional check and covered the rest of the balance.\n\nOn one hand, I'm thankful that I no longer have a portion of my student loans to pay, on the other I'm waiting for them to tell me I owe them and it really upsets me that they did this without asking if it would make me uncomfortable as I've expressed how receiving any help from them anymore isn't something i'm terribly interested in because of my mothers behavior.\n\nSo.  AITA?",

My partner and I moved into a beautiful three bedroom London apartment about three months ago and two of our friends filled the other rooms. \n\nOne of my roommates got a girl pregnant about 8 months ago and very much kept it on the down-low. He didn't want a relationship with this girl, or even with his son. It's a difficult situation but I guess you can't force someone to be a parent if they're not ready. So they lived separate lives. \n\nShe became homeless. Kind of intentionally? She left her shared apartment and claiming she had nowhere to go came to live with us. The arrangement was that she would live with us until she got a council house. Obviously in London it's not that straight forward. Her baby is due in 3 days, and her housing interview isn't until the beginning of next month.\n\nI don't want her living with us. I'm a student and I have exams in a month when she has a newborn. And to top if off cherry on the cake I'm also 18 weeks pregnant! I kind of just want to enjoy the next few months without a baby around before mine arrives. \n\nOur other roommate is also leaving in a year and my partner has offered to let her stay in his room and use housing benefits to cover the room cost. I want space in my own home to raise my own baby and I don't want another baby who isn't mine there. \n\nAm I the asshole? I just don't want her here but she literally has nowhere to go. ",

      "description": "I told my friends about this, and I got mixed reactions. Which is why I’m here wondering I’m the asshole.  (Also, using a throwaway because she may know my main account)\n\nThese friends said I should forget about it since it happened so long ago and she’s really successful now. That they liked her a lot, thought she was kind and funny, and really enjoyed their time with her. They said that we made a good couple and thought this was something that would last for me. Other friends said they couldn’t date someone who had a misdemeanor on their record and I was justified in breaking up with her. \n\nI was with this girl for about 4 months now, and she recently confided in me that she has a misdemeanor on her record from over 9 years ago. She apparently got a dwi when she was in her early 20s after her birthday dinner with friends. That she blew a .09 and was pulled over for going about 7-8 over the speed limit. She said she didn't have any jail time, it was just hours of community service, and she couldn't drive on the weekends for a year. She told me that it hasn't really affected her life since, that her car insurance was high but manageable for a few years and hasn't been mysteriously rejected from any job since. After she told me this, I told her I needed to think about relationship and ultimately broke up with her a few days after she told me. \n\nI was sad I had to end the relationship, it was going really well until she told me about her past. We had a lot in common, we’re both in STEM fields and she makes good money. (Not that money is super important, but we both enjoyed being able to indulge in small luxuries like fine dining, travel, etc. It was nice to find someone willing to be able to afford these kinds of things with me).  We have a lot of the same hobbies (cycling, running, sketching, video games). We even recently signed up for a biathlon happening later in the Spring and we both started training for it over the past 2 weeks.  I also thought she was incredibly beautiful, she was in great shape and we were having an amazing sex life. I probably would have stayed with her for a long time if it wasn’t for her criminal record. \n\nFWIW, if we ever did go out somewhere where alcohol was involved, she was always very insistent on taking an uber or lyft. Even if I felt like it wasn’t necessary, for example, there is a brewery near where I live that serves really good food; I don’t mind driving there to have a small beer or two with food, hanging out for a bit and then drive home. I’m not intoxicated after that small amount, but she would still insist that we pay the $8 to go there in an uber. ",

      "description": "Theres a few parts to this so bear with me\n\nOk so I have pretty bad intestinal issues. At least from what I've heard. Not sure what it is or how pronounced it is because going to the doctor isn't really in the budget  but when I need to shit. I NEED to to shit. And it's not very friendly with when it wants to act up. So naturally it's pretty embarrassing and I don't really like going to other places for extended periods of time, especially sleeping over at another person's house (unless it's my parents house or I'm house sitting or something). \n\nLast week my fiance's grandfather died, leaving her grandmother pretty lonely. No one really comes over to stay the night anymore and she's naturally a very busy person so the loneliness is hitting her hard. \n\nThe grandmother recently asked me and my fiance to sleep over at her house and drive her to a doctor's appointment in the morning. This is a big no from me because of the staying over part (not a big fan of the driving part but what can ya do), so I suggest my fiance does it. It should be noted here that she's pretty sneaky with what she asks and a trip to the doctor will probably turn into a trip to the doctor,the store, a restaurant, a second store can so forth. This isn't really an issue in this case, as the lady just lost her husband so it's forgivable. \n\nAnyways I suggest my fiance go and do it since I don't want to ruin my, and everyone else's, day with my random shitting. She doesn't want to go alone because she's not the most confident driver and the appointment is big city downtown, and also she's in a really love dovey phase since we're about to be married and besides a few things we are very much compatible, so she doesn't want to be away from me for the night.\n\nBasically it boils down to both of us reeeaaaally wanting opposite things.\n\n We had a big fight and ultimately I stuck to not going and she went. I feel pretty bad about it now, but I don't think I was really that wrong in my decision. I don't regret my decision but I really regret the way it made my fiance feel. Idk man.\n\nSo am I an asshole here? And even if I'm not, am I wrong in this argument?",

      "description": "Hi Reddit. I am in a pickle. I am 18F and my roommate is 20F. However she has a friend staying in the living room, 21M. We all agreed we would split the rent and utilities 3 ways. I recently only moved into the house about 2 weeks ago, my roommate did not tell me about her friend. I was under the assumption it was going to be me and her. I have no problem with him staying as long as he pays his part. \r\n\r\nThere has been multiple issues with her friend. He constantly sets the heater to the highest temp of 90° after I have said multiple times not to put it past 70°. I believe 71° is room temp and keeps gas prices low. Not only does he blast the heater, but my door when open is directly in front it.  Just today I came home to the same thing. Heater was on 90 with my door right on it, and I know it was like that for awhile because my door was dangerously hot, damn near fire hazard hot. I sent a text to my roommate letting her know it’s not me being a bitch, it’s a serious legit fire hazard. I have said it’s okay to close my door or block so it’s not directly in front of the heater. So that’s one big issue. \r\n\r\nFood is another. We went grocery shopping and spent $90. It’s been not even a week and most of the food is gone. The thing is, I’m not home much  and neither is my roommate. We both work and I go to school full time. So only logical explanation is that her friend is sitting at home all day, eating all the food he didn’t even pitch in for. He doesn’t even bother to clean the house while he’s at home literally all day. He hasn’t paid anything yet so you’d think he’d at least try to keep things tidy. I personally went grocery shopping by myself and shopped for specific recipes and meal preps. I got a pack of chicken drumsticks to use. My roommate asked if “we were making chicken tonight”. I told her no I was going to use it for my meal preps. That was literally yesterday. \r\n\r\nTonight I go into the fridge to make my meal preps and discover my chicken not only open but half of it gone. I text my roommate who ate it and told her someone needs to explain it. It’s not even that they ate it, I don’t mind sharing at all. It’s the fact that they ate it after I specifically told her not too and then didn’t say anything or even bother to ask. The fact that they didn’t even bother to ask crossed the line for me. I sent her a text and this is what I said \r\n\r\nMe: Imma need someone to explain. It’s more than the chicken itself, it’s the principle. I’ve been nice and willing to share but little by little I’m getting more and more pissed off. I thought there was a mutual understanding and sense of respect. But guess not, From now on. You or your friend. Don’t touch any of my stuff I bring into this house. I’m neither one of your moms\r\n\r\nI know at first glance it looks super mean. But I’ve talked to them over and over. Idk guys, am I the asshole? \r\n \r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Okay, first time poster (I think I should say sorry for the format because I'm on mobile and any eventually grammatical errors since ending is not my first language)\n\nThis friend of mine, she's been a good friend with one downside. She had never had enough money. She's quite alot older than me. I've always had money since I worked before I graduated but she hasn't because of mental health. Since I've had more money than I needed I've helped her out with groceries, travels to and from her family and friends. A while ago we lived together in my apartment and let her stay there without paying any rent since I knew she didn't have money for it. \nAt that time I had two cats who I loved very much.\nShe then found a bf quite far away, but i decided that she could keep one of my cats since the two I had didn't go along to well and she and this one cat went really good together. The cat was old and sick and we both knew she didn't have long. Fast forward and some more money lent, she calls me saying the cat wasn't feeling well at all and needed to be put to sleep. I was so sad and in the phone call she said I needed to send the money to her bf because her welfare check would be that amount less if I send it to her. I didn't hear that, so I sent her the money. I sad sorry and if the could say it was a mistake from my side (which it really was) and that they could even call me to verify. \nShe probably never did that and sent a passive aggressive SMS saying she now needed to lend from her father to even have enough money to pay the rent. I got angry since I've given so much already and pointed out that before she start complaining she should at least pay me back some of the money I've lent her. She now doesn't talk to me, after around 9 years of friendship.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n",

      "description": "**TL;DR: My passive aggressive housemate has convinced the landlord she's the sole caretaker of the flat and he’s threatened to withhold part of our deposit. Now she’s erected a cleaning record sheet without telling anyone and my housemates are starting to fill it in. But I won’t – so AITA for not following the herd?**\n\nFour of us rent rooms in a flat. Two of us are English, the others are Italian and talk daily in their native language. One of them, who is middle-aged, is passive aggressive (PA) and has hit my red line.\n\nCleaning is her bugbear, but all of us pitch in with chores, buy supplies and so on. But weeks after I moved in, PA texted the flat and landlord that she was fed-up with cleaning ‘the whole flat’ and only the other Italian housemate cleaned at all. The landlord then threatened to withhold part of our deposit if we didn’t pitch in.\n\nI was livid. Not only did I do my bit, but PA never raised her concerns face to face. When she was not hiding in her room, my attempts to calmly discuss it were shut down and the silent treatment started. The other Italian housemate had seen me clean and said there was no issue with cleanliness when I asked the day before (the previous tenant warned me about PA). Plus, since the landlord was that gullible, I started taking before and after pictures of my efforts, which feels ridiculous, but my deposit was steep.\n\nSince then, the mood has calmed and the flat is kept clean. But a fortnight ago a sickness spread, cleanliness slipped, and PA put up a cleaning record sheet without consulting anyone, adding her name and a date next to each common room she supposedly cleaned. My housemates have begun filling it in too, and although I clean I refuse to sign it out of principle. I don’t give into passive aggressiveness, but I worry PA will use it to single me out as a resident slob and take it to the landlord.\n\nSo should I start signing it or stick to my guns? I want to live here in peace, but I’ve fought hard to establish boundaries generally and I feel it’s about time I stopped appeasing assholes for an easier life. But AITA for not following the herd?",

      "description": "For context, BF has a big close family and huge close friend group. He has lots of hobbies and pastimes, a demanding career and overall a very full life. I admire this about him. I on the other hand am a single parent to an 8 yr old boy, have a small family and a small friend group. I don’t do so much by way of socializing, maybe once or twice per month have girls time out etc.\n\nWe’re slated to move in together in the next few months, and have been doing “trials” spending a few nights at BF’s place here and there, hanging out once or twice per week etc. This is our first time spending the holidays together. Thanksgiving worked out nicely. We went to BF’s then to my family’s and then relaxed at the house. \n\nChristmas was always my favorite growing up. My family still had big gatherings when I was little, I got to see everyone, everyone was happy and it was great yadda yadda yadda. Now it’s borderline depressing. No family dinner on my side. It’s basically just me and my son and my mom usually. I was so looking forward to spending Christmas together this year and making new traditions and enjoying the holiday together. Family and togetherness is how I feel Christmas is supposed to be. Well BF too, just a little differently...\n\nBF’s Christmas tradition is to go out and get shit faced with his brothers and friends on Christmas Eve and then go to his parents for Christmas Day dinner. Obviously I said I’d be passing on the eve, that I’ll be home with DS watching Christmas movies and baking cookies and whatnot. And we’re supposed to all go to Christmas dinner.\n\nThen we had talked about New Years, which we decided we’d stay home and hang with the kiddo. I told BF I’d be spending it with DS, but he can do his own thing and at one point BF said we *have* to spend New Years together. It was non negotiable for him. Ok cool, so you’re gonna hang with us at the house and drink fake wine and play music and bang pots and pans and whatnot?\n\nWell tonight he expressed his dissatisfaction with not “going out” and asked if this is going to be every year? To which I replied maybe next year we can switch it up and he can stay home with us on Christmas Eve and I can get a sitter and we can go out together on NYE. He acted like I’d literally just ripped his heart out. Started going on about how I better never try to get between him and his family and friends etc.\n\nGuys. Every time he wants to do something *with the exception of when he’s changing or cancelling plans we already had together* I am fine with it. I don’t give him a hard time about anything ever. He has a very time intensive summer hobby. I’m talking like 2-3 entire days a week every week during the summer. During football season he’s doing that 2-3 times a week. I am not the type to try to come between him and his “him” time/family/friends. I feel like I’m super understanding and do a lot of working around his schedule and doing what he wants etc so that comment was a real slap in the face.\n\nAnyway. He’s going to be doing his own thing all weekend this weekend and going out Christmas Eve and we’re going to his family thing with him on Christmas. And then he acts like I’m the devil for suggesting that we compromise next year? If he wants to spend NYE together *out*, is it really that ridiculous for me to ask that he spend Christmas Eve home with my kid and I?\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Ok, so there's three people relevant to this story: Me, C, and S.  S and C are both girls and I'm a guy.  S and I have been friends (or so I thought) for a while and C is newer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all work together in an office with about 100 people in it.  We're in different departments (I'm an accountant, C is in Business Development (Sales), and S is in QA), but we're in an industry that is full of older people and we're in our mid-twenties, so we tend to hang out together.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last March, it was C's first or second week here.  A bunch of us went to happy hour after work.  Everyone leaves one at a time and C and I are the last two left.  We have one last drink together, end up at her place, and sleep together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I was a little worried about how C would take this at first, but a few days later, she pulled me aside and said \"Hey, just want you to know that I had fun, but I'm not looking for a relationship or anything.\"  I was totally relieved and told her we were on the same page.  From then on, things were totally cool between me and C.  Not even awkward at all.  We ended up hooking up one more time a few months later, actually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA huge mistake I made was telling S what happened.  She was the last one to leave C and I alone, so she asked me what happened the next day and I told her.  Probably not a smart idea, looking back, but I thought we were friends and she seemed curious about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, that was 10 months ago or so.  This morning, I get pulled into HR and was told that S had filed a hostile work environment claim against C and I.  She said the knowledge of us sleeping together caused her to be \"scared to come into work and lose sleep at night\".  C and I are both being formally written up and we've been told not to ask S about this or it will be considered retaliation and harassment.  This is actually the first day of a two week vacation for S so she's not even here to talk to (she filed the claim her last day before the vacation, last Friday.  Probably on purpose).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I was completely blindsided by this.  This happened almost a year ago and S has never given me any indication that this info made her uncomfortable or that she felt the work environment is hostile.  I have noticed that S and C have been falling out kind of lately so maybe this is a way to get back at C? I'm not really sure.  Didn't see this coming at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTalked to C about it at lunch today and we're still cool, amazingly.  She's not even really mad that I told S, but sh'es just as bewildered as I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what's your verdict reddit?  Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Personally, I can't stand small talk, but my workplace thrives on it. I work in a small office in a larger shared space, and there are only 7 of us total. Most of us work in different fields, so conversations about our work are generally off the table, which is understandable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I started working here about 2.5 months ago,  I entertained the small talk mostly because I hadn't gotten to know any of them well enough yet to talk about anything else. But I've started to notice that even though we've had more significant topics about shared common interests (sports, television/movies, etc.), whenever a conversation begins they opt for vapid, generic topics like the weather or what we're going to eat for lunch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's also not just small talk: it's meaningless remarks that I honestly have no idea how to reply to anymore. For example, whenever I use the copier (which is every day) the person who works closest to the copier asks me, \"having fun?\". The first few times I used to joke around and say I was having so much fun I was worried I'd wake up the next day with a hangover, but I've been asked if I'm \"having fun\" every single day for nearly three months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey also regularly come into my office and interrupt my work for the sake of small talk, and if I don't immediately give them my attention they will linger in my doorway staring at me until I ask them what's up and if they need anything, but given the fact that we all work different jobs (just share the office), there is very little reason for them to demand my attention like that and every single time they do, it's only to engage it more meaningless banter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the past couple of weeks I've begun to reply with single-syllable words, \"mhmm\", or just flat-out ignore it. I've even mentioned in the past to them that small talk really doesn't cut it for me. The types of conversation they insist upon have become insufferable to the point where I've started \"working through lunch\" most days (aka hiding in my office browsing reddit while I eat) instead of eating with them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for no longer entertaining their small talk? I'm actively avoiding their small talk right now,  I'm typing this post with fervor to make it seem like I'm working really really hard on something.",

      "description": "This happened years ago when I was almost 15, and it still frustrates me. Keep in mind that I looked a lot older than I was then.\n\n I was shopping at my local grocery store, as I was walking through the produce section when I saw a child riding on the bottom of the cart with his head sticking right out the front. \n\nI calmly walked up to the mom and said I don't mean to be rude but it's not safe for your son to be riding on the bottom of your cart like that.\n\nImmediately I'm greeted with her berating me and telling me to mind my own business and that her son is her problem. She out right calls me an asshole and the store clerk came up and told her the same thing and she repeated what she told me to him.\n\nShe pushed her cart away from us and started walking away, and not more than ten seconds after she walked away she was driving her cart really close to the end caps of each aisle, suddenly this guy came out of one of the Isles and sideswiped her son's head with his cart. The woman then proceeded to blow up on the man who didn't see her coming. And then she turned her anger back to me even though I was a good distance away at that point. She was basically screaming across the store about how I was a \"cunt\" and must have set up the whole situation, then basically said that she was going to sue me for damages while her son sits there bleeding out of the side of his head. \n\nThe store clerk just told me to go to the front and wait for officers to arrive, so I did just that. About 5 to 10 minutes later I saw EMTs rush into the store followed by two police officers. I decided to follow them which I admit was a terrible idea.\n\nOnce back to the area where it all happened, there was a decent amount of blood on the ground and the kid was sitting upright crying. The officers were taking the woman's statement when she suddenly just shouted \"HIM, that is the man who did it!\" She was pointing over at me.\n\nOne of the officers walked over to me as did the store clerk, the officer talked to me about the whole situation and the store clerk defended me and told the officer what he saw happen. \n\nThe kid was okay aparently but he was definitely going to need stitches, and the woman's complaining the entire time saying that I was the problem and that it must be my fault. She went on for a while and insisted that I should be arrested.\nThe officers asked for any identification I didn't have a state ID so I used my school ID. When they realized how old I was, they told me that just head on home and that they would contact the school if they needed any information from me. I was not contacted afterwards.\n\nBasically I've had people tell me over the years that I was the asshole for instigating this situation in the first place. I don't think I'm an asshole because I was concerned for the child's safety. But there are some people who still insist that I was an asshole. So AITA?\n\nTL;DR I told a woman that her son shouldn't be riding on the bottom of the shopping cart, not more than 10 seconds after he gets hit and she blames me and tries to get me arrested.",

      "description": "Some context, sorry for any mistakes, English isn't my native language. \n\nI have had a long-term realtionship with a guy that was amazing. I noticed our relationship was slowly dying and that it was about to get ugly. He would make comments about me, my body, my job which I'm really passionate about. I was starting to do the same. We even got into a fight and hé violently grabbed my arm at some point. Because I loved him very much and didn't want things to get messy between us, I broke up and moved out on my own. \nFast forward to around mis January, I decided to meet new people. Being in a new city, I figured this would help a lot with letting go of the sadness that I had been feeling ever since I had left my ex. I met a very cool guy, good looking, with tastes that are very close to mine. We like the same things, watch the same movies and series, have very similar humour. I soon developed a crush for this guy and everything was going pretty well. We confessed feelings and eventually we considered ourselves as a couple. \nHe left for two weeks because of his job. We would message each other a lot and videocall everyday. But I realised I didn't miss him that much? I wasn't even looking forward to see him again. When he came back we, of course, had sex and it was horrible. I'm a guy as well, so I noticed that he wasn't clean down there. It's the second time this foul smell oozes from him and I'm really attached to hygiene. I tried talking to him about it, but he doesn't seem to care. There's just no link anymore. Sex is mechanical and I just wait for the time he leaves when he comes over. \n\nI think I overestimated my ability to cope with a breakup after a long term relationship. My ex and I try to remain friends and I think that decision weighs in on my ability to start a new relationship. \n\nAITA for getting in a couple too fast, realising I'm not ready for it and wanting it to end? The guy is very fragile, which I've just realised, I'm among the first guys he's been with so he's already pretty attached which I hate cause I'm not. \nThanks for reading this and for your answers.

      "description": "So.. This is quite a complicated story.. Also, throwaway because reasons.\n\nSo, my (16F) boyfriend (16M) lives in a disfunctional family. His dad is abusive, and him and his mom are arguing very often. His dad is Canadian, his mom is Australian. He has both citizenships. \n\nThe dad forced them to come to Canada and live there against their will. (Idk how he did it) My bf’s dad had been really awful to my bf and his mom, he’s done things that I could personally never forgive. My bf’s mom doesn’t have a work permit, but she has her permanent residency. They only have one car, and the dad uses it to go to work. Only the dad works, and he keeps nearly all his money for himself. He gives my bf and his mom a small quantity of money every month so they can buy food. The house is dirty, they can barely take care of themselves. My bf and his mom would gladly go back to Australia, but they would need both parents’ permission for my bf to move back there, because he’s not an adult yet. So basically, they’re stuck here. My bf is often feeling down and sad, and his mom too. And that causes even more arguments. \n\nBut the thing is, my boyfriend asked me to never talk about it to anyone, otherwise he would most likely end our relationship because he couldn’t trust me anymore. Not even a friend, not even a parent, not even my psychologist. But he’s the most attentive, gentle boy I’ve met.. he makes me feel good, he’s helped me a lot with my self esteem issues, trust issues, etc. We do activities together, we really have lots of fun. He teases me, I tease him, we laugh a lot. He’s always been nice to me, he never hit me, or called me names. It’s just that secret thing that has been bothering me. His attitude only changes when he’s at his house, where he seems to become more nervous.\n\nWe’ve been together for nearly 2 years, and it’s just bothering me more and more. I ended up talking about it with my parents. And god I felt better. Keeping all of that inside was getting painful. I tried many times to talk about it with my boyfriend, but he was always saying that now isn’t the good time to talk about it. And I didn’t want to talk about it with his mom either. I feel bad for it, but I’m scared of her. She screams a lot at his dad, she barely gets out of her room anymore and she looks very tired. No expression on her face. My bf told me she’s in depression. The police was involved a few times, the neighbors complained to them because they were arguing very loudly.  \n\nSo yea. I talked about it with my parents. And they tried to support me as much as possible. And they help he find how to help my boyfriend, etc etc. My parents asked my bf’s mom if she needs any help, but she’s always answered no. \n\nBut I still feel bad for betraying my boyfriend. Did I do the right thing to talk about it with my parents? What should I do now?",

      "description": "A little back story, my friend just had a baby last year after trying for a few years to get pregnant. I threw her a reveal party and then I threw her a baby shower. My husband and I are not financially stable but I still found a way to pay for things for her reveal and shower. She paid half and I paid the other half. \nFast forward nine months after she had her son and she gets pregnant again. We're worse off than we were last year financially and struggling to catch up on our medical bills when she tells me that I'm hosting this baby shower.\nIt would be different if I had offered to throw a baby shower but I didn't. She told me I was throwing it. I had been actively avoiding the subject because I know I can't afford it nor do I have time to plan one with having a full time job plus my own family to take care of.\nI will gladly diy stuff when/if I have a little free time but I just don't think I can spend much if anything on a second baby shower.

      "description": "Am I the asshole for being frustrated? \nI’d like to note that I’ve never said anything to this coworker, but it bothers me every day.\nI work at a small veterinary practice in California. I have a coworker who had a baby last year. Before having the baby this coworker was on top of her shit! She was the type to call any of us out on slacking and was the go to for any and all questions. She had a M,Tu,F, Sat schedule.\nThis is her and  her Husbands first child. Both of their families live across the county and both planned on working after the birth so they knew they would have to find a nanny/daycare.\nTowards the end of the pregnancy, this coworkers mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Her mother died shortly after the baby was born. Our entire hospital (we are a tiny clinic) banded together and worked a ton of overtime to accommodate her to be gone a extra few months outside of her maternity leave to deal with the loss of her mother. \nWhen she came back to work she announced that she was putting her baby in daycare Mon-Thur and would no longer be working her normal schedule. She never thanked anyone for stepping up to help cover so she could have extra time off to grieve. She then expected us all to change our schedules on a whim to accommodate the daycare schedule she chose. She now gets a 3 day weekend every week. This is unheard of in veterinary medicine.\nWe again all changed our lives around to accommodate her. Anything to make her life easier with a newborn and dealing with the loss of her mother. We rearranged the break room to give her a safe place to pump. \nShe pumps twice a day for at least 30-40 minutes at a time. She’ll clock out for lunch, clock back in and go pump for 30+ minutes. She’ll then pump for another 30 plus minutes on the clock straight before we close, when she’s done she punches out and goes home. She doesn’t tell anyone before she pumps so we’ll be swamped and suddenly down a technician with no notice. \nHer baby is now 14 months and this is still going on. My other coworkers and I all feel taken advantage of. Are we the assholes for feeling that way?",

      "description": "Alright, so to keep it short, when I was adopted it was from an extremely abusive household, my original mother was a true sadist, and I was her outlet, this is not an excuse, but something to explain why I was that way.\n\nSo when we were in high school, we never interacted much, we had a few classes together but that was it. I knew she was gay, as well as me because of her face book ect, I was not open about being gay and hated it, it was a blight I thought at the time at least because I figured i'd never find a girlfriend. At this point in my life I switched from private school to public, my parents are pretty wealthy but it was obvious I was not welcome in private school, I was a bully, through and through, I only ever really messed with other \"Bullies\".\n\nAnyways the conversation she wants to have is when, I well, (This is not the AITA, I already know I am for this, not sure how this will go for the violence thing) I beat her up in the locker room, Apologized and said I have no clue why I did that.\n\nFast forward to when we are 19 and 18, I contact her on facebook and say i'm sorry, we talk a lot from there and we end up dating.\n\nShe wants to talk about it, but I simply cannot, this was the absolute darkest and most destructive period in my life, I know I am not a good person I know I am \"Evil\" but I cannot have this conversation, my blood runs cold when she even so much as hints shes gonna bring it up, I cannot even fathom to this day, why I did that, I had no control, I was shaking so hard when I got home from school that day I hurt myself a lot. \n\nI can't have this conversation, it brings back such dark feelings that I have FOUGHT for many years to suppress and make die, I like to imagine that was me when my (This will be edgy) Darkness was on the outside, and now i've pushed it inward and locked it away, for good. I don't even imagine myself being the same person back then but I know it is not like that, I was and did do that.. I fear nothing in this world, but losing her, or my close family will stop me dead in my tracks, I can barely even think of what to say my mind races so quickly.\n",

So on my daily commute is a 20 minute highway drive where the speed limit is 65 mph. I get on the highway and people are driving cautious which I expect because at this stretch of highway are several on and off ramps so no big deal. But then I get into the left lane and the traffic is crawling at a painful 45mph. Initially I think there's a wreck right.....nope outta just some scary a$$ non drivers. So I start flashing my lights and lasting on the horn so these non-drivers can get the F out of my way I wasn't trying to speed add I wasn't going to be late I just wanted to go the speed limit. Of course I stare art each driver as I pass them and one person called me an a-hole. So AITA???",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to leave after my partner relapsed?",
      "description": "Backstory: started dating a girl who'd been clean for a year and a half from alcohol, meth, and heroin. I told her when we started dating that if she relapsed, I'd leave immediately. It's a firm line in the sand that I can't have crossed - my ex died from a heroin overdose, and I can't live through that again. I have never, or will ever, use hard drugs like heroin. \n\nAfter about 7 months together, her behavior started to change radically. She switched to a huge purse, which she would bring to the bathroom with her for a couple hours at a time. She'd come out obviously intoxicated, and when I asked about it she would say it was her new medication. In reality, she was keeping bottles of vodka and wine in her purse and drinking in the bathroom. \n\nShe started hanging out with a 'friend', who I had never met. He was showing up at her house late at night, and vice versa. She told me they slept together once, 10 years ago, and had agreed they were better as friends. She also told me that he had kids with another woman and was in a long term relationship so was no threat. I asked her to not hang out alone at his house(or vice versa), at least until I had met him and had a chance to make my own man-on-man character appraisal. She agreed, and promised that if she sensed anything in terms of him trying to hit on her she would stop contact and tell me immediately. \n\nIn reality, they were having sex less than a month before we started dating. He also happens to be a meth / heroin addict and dealer. I didn't know any of those details at the time, nor did I know he was asking her to have sex, sending her nude pictures of them together from when they used to have sex, providing her with alcohol, and sending dick pics. This was occurring almost daily for months. During this period we didn't have sex at all(around 5 months) because she would shut me down every time I tried. \n\nI finally discovered the emotional cheating when I was staying at her house. We had plans to spend the next couple days at my place, but at 2:30am she asked me to have my employee pick me up in the morning and drive me home - she needed to stay at her house alone to 'catch up on housework'. She had been absorbed in texting all night, and when she fell asleep on the couch I looked at what she had been up to. We have an open phone policy, she has free reign on mine and vice versa. She had made plans for her ex to come over at 10pm the next day, after making sure I would already have been long gone. I went through the 5 months of conversation and saw all the dick pics and invitations for sex that she had entertained - \"that sounds really fun\" types of responses every time. I left and went to a friend's, determined that she was cheating on me, and that I was going to leave her.\n\nShe called me over and over again throughout the day, and I agreed to sit down and talk. She convinced me she wasn't physically cheating, so I (like an idiot) forgave the emotional cheating if she promised to cut off contact with this guy.\n\nTwo days after this shit storm, I caught her with a pint glass of whiskey. I watched her go into the kitchen, sneakily fill up the glass from the bottle I keep for guests, and asked her directly when she walked back to the TV room if it had alcohol in it. She said \"of course not, it's soda!\" I grabbed the glass, sipped it, and almost threw up since it was pure booze. She then admitted to having been secretly drinking for months. Since then, she's been working hard on sobriety and going to AA meetings. She slipped up once but hasn't fully relapsed as far as I know. \n\n\n\nThese are my thoughts: she probably cheated on me physically, and definitely cheated on me emotionally. She probably relapsed with either meth or heroin, and definitely relapsed with alcohol. I really do love her, and when she's got her shit together she's great. But I think she hasn't been honest about what really happened when I was at work or bit spending the night during those 5 months. And even if she has been truthful, hasn't physically cheated and hasn't used meth/heroin while we are together I feel like I can never fully trust her. \n\nI feel like she broke my heart with two massive breaches of trust in a two day span, and I've been trying to let it heal but I don't think I can move past it. I'm scared to death that if we have kids together, she'll be picking them up from school drunk after fucking some guy for meth. I'm also scared that if I leave her she'll start using again, and end up dead or worse.\n\nYour thoughts are welcome, and thank you for listening. ",

      "description": "Sorry for the long story tldr at end \n\nLast week my best friend and I were kicking back at home having pizza and watching Netflix. I was not in a super social mood and was going to bed soon anyway. Out of the blue my best friends three cousins and one of their boyfriends came over at around 10pm (we live close to city centre and they had just come from a concert) all wanting to hang at our house until it was late enough to go to the clubs in town. I admit I did not stay downstairs long. I kissed them all on the cheek to greet them (customary in our country) then pretty much went upstairs. Anyway when I was upstairs they had the music up quite loud and our other flatmate who was asleep had work at 6am. So I went downstairs and said “hey would you guys mind turning it down a bit, just because (Flatmate) has got to get up at 5am” they turned it down a tad and it was fine. They eventually moved on to my best friends aunty’s house that is just down the road from us and eventually my best friend followed as wanted to hang with family (of course). \nAnyway my best friend tonight told me that two of his cousins were bitching to their aunty saying I came storming downstairs saying “Turn it the f*** down!!” Which the aunty said she didn’t believe as I’ve known her for years and I’m not a confrontational person I’m always overly nice about that sort of stuff. \nI’m upset as I don’t want shit spoken about me that isn’t true and it just puts down my character and I would never speak to people like that. I ended up getting angry and saying some more than choice words about the cousins that were talking about me. My best friend ripped into me saying “oh get over it they were drunk at the time” “it was debunked by my aunty so who cares”\nI’m feeling like don’t just come into my home drunk, turning up the music loud and then saying things about that isn’t true. \nMy best friend is making me feel like I’m such an asshole. I feel disrespected, but I kinda feel unjustified now :(\n\nTLDR:  family of my best friends came to my house drunk and ready to party; I was not in party mood so went upstairs. They had music up loud, I came downstairs to tell them to turn it down in the nicest way I could, they obliged. They eventually left and told other people I told them aggressively and rudely to turn music down. I had a few choice words about his family for telling people things that weren’t true about me. Best friend told me I’m an asshole for being so mean about his family. ",

It's really tough on the backs of any nurse.\nA few years back, the hospital needed to order new beds because the old ones  were not able to support the weight of some patients. And the stories of the paramedics are sometimes harrowing as well.\nSo am I an Asshole just for saying that obesity is not something to view as pretty or good? I mean it is a huge health risk, that is linked to a number of heart problems and even cancer. ",

      "description": "Background: I take improv classes at a smaller-sized improv theater in a west coast city. Much like the surrounding community, the theater is pretty progressive, taking pride in inclusivity and remaining us that we are welcome with those little all are welcome signs. So it’s pretty cool to have a lot of different backgrounds. My class itself has about 35 participants and is pretty awesomely diverse.\n\nFast forward to last Saturday. We were finishing up a class when the instructor announced that an hour after the class, the POC team showcase would begin. A few times a month the theater has open showcases where students and visitors can participate in improv. There’s one for POC, women/femme, LGBT, and then the all open showcase that anyone can participate in.\n\nSome of us were interested in attending (since participating was limited to just POC and everyone respected that) and a girl (who happened to be white) inquired about ticket prices. Our instructor seemed a bit surprised and said that the show was *only* for POC. She could visit the women’s showcase, all open showcase, or LGBTQ showcase if she fell in that category.\n\nThat struck me a bit because I couldn’t attend any of them besides the open showcase (which I’ve seen often). I get that being a straight white dude doesn’t carry leverage in the topic of discrimination, I really do. It just sucks because I wanted to support some of my classmates who were going to take part in the showcase and hear some insight from different backgrounds (and some comedy!). \n\nThe theater’s director of diversity was there, and reiterated those points, so I assumed that the theater’s director likely also upholds those rules. What confused me even more is that they sell tickets to these showcases to the public in-house.\n\nI guess it would be almost intrusive to view the POC showcase, but I’m also afraid to voice my grievences to my instructor; I have no idea how to approach it without being ostracized or kicked out of the classes (which I paid for).\n\nWIBTA to write a complaint to the theater regarding their practices? The difficult thing is everything said was verbal, so there’s no record of them saying that. I really love the shows that come through there, but I’m pretty saddened and still in some disbelief they can blatantly discriminate like that. ",

      "description": "First post ever even though I’ve been on Reddit for a few years so please bare with me, also on my cell. To start, I’ve always wanted children, but in my family it’s apparently your “greatest accomplishment”. Background info: I’m the first female in my family to not have a child by 18. I’m a 33F have 1 kidney which is a transplant and 1 of my own that doesn’t function. Had a stillborn at 25. I’m raising my 16 year old niece for the last few years. I’ve recently decided not to have children of my own. My family doesn’t agree because it’s something I’ve always wanted and that’s not how they live there lives. Our family is based around the family and everyone having children and growing the family. I only have one cousin (few years younger) that doesn’t have children. If I had a child I would be in bed rest the entire pregnancy, so I wouldn’t be able to work to support my niece and I. After dealing with everything with my niece (who I love immensely and wouldn’t change having her for anything) and everything else involved, ex changing anti rejection meds until we find one that works for me &amp; that wouldn’t harm a fetus. I’ve decided once she graduates I’d like to live the rest of my life doing things I enjoy &amp; things I’ve always wanted to do. I’m not willing to do dialysis or go on the transplant list again (waited 5 years for this one). I don’t want to leave a child without a mother and doctors can’t guarantee I’d survive to raise a child if I choose to have one. My family is extremely unhappy with me &amp; thinks it’s my boyfriend filling my head with bad possibilities (he’s never wanted children of his own but is great with my niece). AITA or selfish about deciding not to have children even though it’s something I’ve always wanted and still partly do, but terrified of trying?",

      "description": "My husband (19)  just got a new job with the state and has to quit smoking weed for a whole year to get all his certifications. I (21) got him the job after begging him to get a job for our entire relationship. I wrote his resume and pretty much applied to the job for him. I quit smoking weed with him last year when he finally started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. The psychiatrist had him quit to see how it affected his mood and mental health. He was doing great and then started smoking again after a few months claiming he was better now and wanted to smoke. I didn’t smoke at all during that time because he needed the support. (Side note: we don’t live together, live 2 hours apart and only see each other every weekend or every other weekend. This is important because we don’t spend a lot of time together.) \n\nSo now, he got the job, and I also just got a new job that’ll further my career. My job is taking care of the elderly (CNA). So I spend all day getting screamed at by dementia patients and *literally* shit on. \n\nMy husband says he needs me to quit because he needs to quit and can’t have people around him smoking because it’ll just tempt him. I said I’d stop smoking around him and will hide all my weed/bong stuff when he comes over. He said no, I need to quit completely the whole time he has to quit. Claims it’s to better myself and himself. But I’ve given up so much of the things I enjoy for him to be happy and feel secure. I don’t hang out with anyone except my sister and all we do is watch tv and smoke weed in bed. We’ll be doing that even when a legit party is going on in the living room. I quit drinking, going out, drugs, raving, I can’t do anything without being heavily questioned, if I mention a new friend he gets suspicious. I on the other hand constantly encourage him to go hang out with friends (which he does every night), go to raves, do whatever if it’ll make him happy. But he doesn’t support me the same way. I’d like to just come home after a 8-16 hour shift of bathing and feeding old folks and smoke a bowl. \n\nI know it’s just weed but to me it’s more than just weed. ",

By no means am I against drinking though, everyone should be able to spend their evening doing something they enjoy imo.\n\nMy roommates quite frequently ask me during the day if I'm 'coming out for a pint later' I always respectfully decline and I usually spend the evening by myself, I'd love to go and try socialising in any other scenario but going out drinking seems to be the norm and it's just not my thing, even just having a soft drink from going out before I feel pressured to drink alchohol.\n\nAm I being an antisocial asshole for not going out with them?

      "description": "My boyfriend (25) and I are going through a rough time financially right now.  However the past few months have been garbage.  He didn’t do anything for Christmas, my birthday, or Valentine’s day.  Not even a card.  I’m mad about this because he had the money to buy a coworker a $50 secret Santa gift card.  He spends money at bars - and he says it is “me time” but then we don’t get to do things like buy groceries or do laundry.  I made him a Christmas and Valentine’s day card and painted him a picture of his recently deceased cockatiel for Christmas.  I used an amazon gift card money and bought him a valentines gift.  I did these things because I care and I want to show him that even though it is hard right now I still love him.  I found free things to do tomorrow and told him a week in advance what they were and that I’m excited for our late Valentine’s Day.  The past two nights he has spent a load of money at some bar he won’t tell me the name of and hasn’t shown up until 5am, drunk as shit.  I told him tonight I didn’t want him to show up at 5am again and that we haven’t spent time together and I’d like to do that tonight.  He said he would come home earlier.  He showed up at 6am and when I asked for an apology he said no.  He said if I didn’t drop it that we were going to fight which seems like emotional manipulation to me because I didn’t want to fight I just wanted to express how upset and hurt I was by his actions.  \n\nI’m angry, hurt, and feel undervalued and I couldn’t even get an apology for shitty behavior.

They both mean a lot so I try to help both, that was a mistake.\nJ= girl bestie N= boy bestie Me= Ne\nN and I had been talking for a couple days, occasionally about the breakup with J. N never specifically told me to not tell anyone but I kept it in confidence until J started talking to me. \n\nJ was really broken up about N leaving her. She was so upset and angry and sad.. I felt really bad for her. She asked if I had talked to N lately and I said yes. After that she asked me how he was doing and if he was okay. She was worried about him because he cut ties with her in every way, but she still wanted to be friendly. I went along because- she’s one of my best friends I can’t abandon her. \n\nAfter an hour N shoots me a text.\n\nN: did you say anything to J? She says that you tell her everything.\n\nMe: I was only talking to her about what happened. I’m just trying to help, she’s really sad.\n\nN: I can’t believe you’d do that to me. Why would you do that?\n\nMe: I’m sorry, I didn’t tell her anything super important. She was just really upset and I didn’t know what to do\n\nN: I thought I could trust you. Why would you do this to me? Back to square one\n\nN: F*ck this. I can’t believe it.\n\nMe: I’m sorry! She’s asking what happened and I don’t know what to say. It’s also really hard to do just about anything when two of my best friends are fighting.\n\nN: You don’t have to worry about me fighting with her anymore. I won’t be a burden anymore.\n\nMe (at this point I’m freaking out bc he has depression): Dude. Stop. What’s happening?\n\nN: I’m stressed, angry, upset, and I’m sad. I’m not you’re burden anymore don’t worry about me. Just do you’re thing.\n\nMe: I’m sorry! I wasn’t trying to hurt you, J was just so upset and I didn’t know what to do! \n\nN: I don’t want to be bothered. I’m done. I can’t stomach the fact you did this.\n\nMe: I’ll give you as much time as you need but please don’t cut me off.\n\nN: Why, so you can just tell everyone what else I say? It takes a lot to make me f*cking cry. I’m sick of this situation. I’m just done.\n\nMe: I’m sorry. \n\nThe whole conversation basically repeats itself until I tell him to breathe and N responded with “I’m done. I have no one to go to. I have no one I can trust.” Throughout this whole text extravaganza J is worried sick. She tells him to not hurt himself and he blocks her.\n\nI texted to N that I was sorry and that I regret ever doing that to him and that I can’t apologize enough for what I did. He hasn’t replied. J says it’s not my fault and that she’ll make things right tomorrow at school. It hope what ever her plan is works.\n\nSo my question for you is, am I the asshole?\n(Sorry for being such a long post, if I talked about J’s side more it’d be too long.)",

      "description": "So recently my parents (I'm only 15 btw) took my phone for like a month for reasons and that's really where I talk to all my friends obviously. However, I have my laptop and I can talk on Skype, Discord, etc. So I've been recently going through some tough times and have been expressing to my friends in school that I feel really alone and just tired with life atm and I've been asking some people to just like add me on Skype or something to talk cause they're my friends and I really need them. I have a few of my friends added now but they keep ignoring me or leaving me on open. I understand it's a little more difficult to text on Skype rather than SC but I was hoping that they'd maybe put more effort. It's making me upset cause whenever my friends need someone to talk to I'm always there no matter what. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being upset or should I accept that people have better things to do then figure out a way to talk to me?",

      "description": "I am going to try to keep this brief, and if anyone has questions I’ll be glad to clarify. \n\nUp until recently (the last month or so) I had been paying for Netflix‘s four screens and Ultra HD tier for a few years. During this time, two of my friends had also been using my account. Myself and one of them agreed it was not necessary for either of them to pay for their access because when we hung out, we’d always split costs on other things like food or drink or weed or whatever else. Netflix raised prices two, perhaps three times during this time. Most recently, Netflix’s price went up to $15.99 for the tier described above.\n\nWhen this latest price hike occurred, I notified the friends who had been using the account that I would be downgrading in order to save money. As a result, they would no longer get Ultra HD quality, and it would only be shared among two screens and not the previous four. As an alternative, I asked for direct monetary compensation instead of the previously stated splitting of costs.\n\nOne of them took this rather harshly. They reminded me of the agreement to split the costs described above. To which I responded by stating that I wasn’t interested in splitting those costs anymore and that I would pay my way when it came to that. \n\nI was accused by the upset party of throwing away the friendship after I suggested that I’d pay for my part in things that we would shared in the future.\n\nI think I am NTA because I made my wants clear. As a result the friendship with the two individuals I’ve described has now ended. I am wondering if anything I have explained here colors me as TA. \n\nI’m too emotionally invested in the predicament to be able to consider it objectively.\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "description": "I work at Trader Joe’s. I’m pretty new there, I just came on as a cashier and I love it. The pay is great and my coworkers are friendly. Yet, I had an experience yesterday that upset me a lot, and I wanted Reddit’s take.\n\nA guy came in towards the end of my shift on Saturday. Immediately, we exchanged looks. I kept catching his eye as he moved throughout the store, the glances seemed more than coincidence. When he checked out he came through my line, instead of choosing a less crowded one. I chatted with the other customers and finally started ringing up his stuff, we bantered and smiled and everything seemed like it was going great. I asked him if he had a girlfriend by chance. Here’s the kicker. He responds:\n\n “Sorry, I don’t date fat girls.”\n\nI’ve had weight issues my whole life. Last year I started keto and lost over 50 lbs, currently I’m 145 lbs and 5’6”.  I’m not a twig, but I don’t consider myself to be fat either.\n\nAm I an asshole for being bitter about this? I understand weight is a preference for some people, but I can’t help but feel it’s unfeeling and insensitive. I’m not unattractive, I know that much to be true. Maybe I’m terrible for getting upset about this, but I feel truly hurt and at the lowest point I’ve felt since I started my weight loss. Is it really that easy to be labeled fat after all the way I’ve come? AITA for being angry he rejected me on the basis of weight alone?\n\nTL;DR: Guy at Trader Joe’s rejects me for being fat. AITA for thinking it’s shallow and rude?",

      "description": "This is going to be long, so TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nMy wife has a friend who we'll call Karen for the sake of this post. Karen is involved in a hobby with my wife and I, along with several dozen other people who we are friends or at least acquainted with.\n\nAbout a year ago, my wife started crushing hard on Karen, who we had known for about 6mos at that point. I'm fine with this (don't judge) and despite my serious reservations (which I voiced), my wife decided to pursue a FWB relationship. 2 months after that, I also got involved and things were going fairly well for quite a while.\n\nIt turned pretty \"date\"-y and we were mostly fine with that, Karen sometimes got a little freaked and would back away, then would come back and get right back into it. She called herself part of our family, we gave her a key to our house, and we even let her stay with us sometimes when her home life got too nuts. Her 3 cats also lived with us for several months due to a sudden living situation upheaval, one of which is still in my house to this day.\n\nOver the summer, Karen got a little weird and I chalked it up to her just not being interested anymore. We stopped sleeping together and while my wife and I were bummed, our friendships with Karen continued. I've never been as close to her as my wife, which is totally fine, and in August they had a pretty big fight. My wife told me, at the time, that she'd called Karen out for being selfish and not a great friend (which is all true and backed by copious amounts of evidence). It was hard seeing my wife so upset by this fight and I supported her best I could. \n\nIn the interim, my wife and I were also fighting a lot about some separate things, but we settled down and got back to our happy marriage. \n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, while on a day date with my wife, she tells me that she's been lying to me about Karen and the fight they had. Evidently, Karen has been seeing someone since BEFORE she and my wife started their FWB and she finally told my wife the truth in August. Let it be known that we are not upset she was dating, we are upset specifically because she lied about a huge part of her life for over a year, all while calling us family, talking about getting a dog with us, having us look after her cats, and being repeatedly, pointedly asked by my wife what was going on because she could tell.\n\nShe lied, to our faces, for her own comfort. We are also loosely friends with this man and now I'm questioning his moral compass as well. I, personally, am feeling very \"done\" with Karen, but I'm trying to respect that my wife is not done. This is her best friend and while she says their relationship will never be what it was (ie. very emotionally close, as best friends should be), she still wants to be her best friend and doesn't want to lose that.\n\nI feel very taken advantage of. I have a lot of body image issues and I have not kissed anyone or let anyone see me nude since I met my wife, over 7 years ago. This was a very big step for me and Karen was aware of how vulnerable I was being with her.\n\nAs a result, I don't particularly want to see Karen, talk with Karen, or even really think about Karen at all. She lied to my face, coaxed my wife into lying to me for 3 months (and yes, my wife is in trouble for her part in that), and the fact that she has still not apologized, even once. Certainly not with any sincerity, despite many opportunities.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to literally ignore her in social situations when we're forced together and barely speaking to her when we are together? We have a large group of mutual friends and still see each other at hobby events (weekly) and at parties and such. Should I fake it to get through? It feels like she continues to get away with treating people like this because no one actually takes her to task over being, quite honestly, a cunt.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "This isn’t one of those validation posts, though the title may seem that way. I’m being accused by my now ex of being the asshole.\n\nYesterday was my birthday, so my boyfriend picked me up to go out to eat when he got off work. We noticed two dogs on the side of the road, wearing collars/tags, and I insisted we stop and try to save them, though he did not want to. I got out of the car and was walking toward them, when two men on bicycles came from the other direction, so the dogs ran across the road, and one was hit by a car. We managed to get the dog out of the road, and I asked my boyfriend if we could take the dog to the emergency vet. He agreed, unfortunately the dog died on the way. \n\nHe subsequently was upset because he was worried about the interior of his car, which I did offer to have professionally cleaned. As I sat there crying, clearly very upset, and said that had I not stopped, the dogs wouldn’t have crossed the road and died, he just said, “probably.” No words of comfort. Though I do believe it was my fault, I was still traumatized. Had he been upset and crying, even if I disagreed about why, I’d try to comfort him. He took me to a bar after, though I just wanted to go home, and freaked out when he finished his drink and I asked him to take me home. I got out of his car and shut the door harder than I intended (100% my fault) and said I’d talk to him the next day. He peeled out, and I was worried he’d get hurt driving like a maniac. I asked him to let me know when he got home, and one hour later with no message, I kept calling and then got sent to voicemail.  At least then I knew he was alive and not in a ditch somewhere. Either way, I sent a text breaking up with him, because he had been a complete jerk and then didn’t let me know he was home safe (I’d also like to point out, I’m not asking if I’m the asshole about the breakup. I shouldn’t have done it the way I did, that definitely makes me an asshole. But it’s also been coming for a few months. Every single person in my life told me they didn’t feel he was right for me, and this was just the last straw for me. We definitely had other issues, both his fault and mine. We just aren’t right for one another.) \n\nAt the end of this, I think he’s an asshole because he cared more about his cars interior than the life of the dog, and treated me like I was the asshole for not caring about his car. Also for not letting me know and sending me to voicemail when I wanted to know he was home safe. And I will admit, I was upset and not looking at it from his perspective, which is why I had wanted to talk about it the next day, when we were both calmer. And he thinks I’m the asshole because he can’t really afford his car and wants to get rid of it as soon as he can, and the dog could have damaged his interior (which he did not I mention before we put the dog in the car, and the interior was not damaged, as the dog was not bleeding.)\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA, or is he?

(I wasn't home and she didn't take anything) Because of this I did not feel safe in this town so I left. I left rather quickly and on the night before I left I discovered a library book I had failed to return. My friend volunteered to return it for me. I agreed as it was late and I did not want to stop at the library on my way to the airport in the morning.\nFast forward four months: I had kept in contact with this friend, we talked once or twice a week. I had asked once, about a week after I left it she had returned the book and she said she would soon. I dropped it figuring she would take care of it. Then, last week, I got a bill from the library totalling $90 dollars. \nI was shocked and called her, I at first thought my friend had dropped it off and they failed to properly scan it back into the system. I was wrong. My friend had never returned it. I asked her if she could, if not I said, I could have my sibling who lived in the same town pick it up from her and drop it off. My friend said they could drop it off, it had just skipped her mind. Then she asked if I wanted help paying the bill, money was tight for this person so I said if they wanted to pay half it would be greatly appreciated. \nKeep in mind, this person volunteered to return the book in the first place, and asked if I wanted help paying.\nI sent her a text a few minutes after our phone conversation to thank her for helping pay the fee.  It didn't go through, she blocked me. She also blocked me on sc, insta, and messenger. \nIt's been a week and she still hasn't returned the book.\nAm I the asshole here??

Our friendship was never romantic, as both of us were in relationships pretty much throughout our friendships. We were best friends, more than I could think best friends could possibly be. I think on both sides there was definitely some romantic interest, verified by our last day together at the end of college having an exchange of \"I love you\"s and reminiscing on what could have been. \n\nH was a dramatic arts major in college and I was in literature. This was before Facebook, early 2000s when we parted ways. H ended up leaving to another city and I stuck around. I told myself it couldn't work because H's work entails constant travel and I already had a position as a highschool teacher (which are exceedingly hard to get, so I couldn't budge). At the time I thought it'd be best we parted ways. It had to anyways due to our arrangements, but I didn't want to pursue anything or feel like I should pursue anything because our lives are incompatible from an employment perspective.\n\nI'd be lying if I didn't follow H around on Facebook when it became a thing. She traveled the world, was in several stage productions across the country. She remained single, though, not completely out of the ordinary considering it's hard to keep a relationship if you travel like that. I ended up getting married to a coworker: my wife and I now have two kids (13F, 10F). I love my wife more than anyone in the world, she completes me in ways I couldn't describe.\n\nIt turns out H retired last year and returned home. I immediately added her as a friend and we reconnected through Facebook. I mentioned this all to my wife and she was not a happy camper about it. I'm going to cede to my wife's wishes, so I told H things have changed too much and we couldn't be friends, and that was that.\n\nUntil four days ago when she sent me a letter. She just wanted to be friends and not impede in my marriage, and I believe her. My wife exploded at this, though, saying because there was some chemistry in the past between H and I, it's a slippery slope to cheating. She said cheating is opportunistic and once I met her in person, I couldn't stop myself. I told her she's a lunatic and she can't control my friendships. But at the same time, I wonder about what she said and wonder if I could even have a healthy friendship with H anyways.\n\nSome hard facts: if I wasn't married, I would pursue H. Even if I was in a relationship, I would jump ship and pursue H. But I am completely devoted to my wife and would not ruin my family over anything. Family comes first. H was my best friend before we parted ways and I would love to have that friendship back.\n\nAITA for wanting to be friends with an old romantic interest?",

My thoughts are that this is a big deal to me because I've worked hard and juggle several things each day while he primarily goes to work and then back home. I also think it would be good for our kids to see because they see me studying and know that we're not taking trips this year due to my school schedule. Seeing the 'pomp and circumstance' may positively motivate them as they get older.

      "description": "In every marriage there are these titantic struggles of right and wrong.  In our marriage, this is but one of many.  It's a tale that instantly enflames passions, and is the source of many snide remarks.  Although this happened last summer, my lovely wife brought it up (again) recently and she wants the good people of AITA to render judgment.\n\nHere's the story:\n\nLast summer I was working from home and our kids were obviously at home doing kid stuff.  It was morning time, and my wife had to run to the nearby grocery store to pick up something.  I can't even remember what, but it was no more than three bags of things.  Nothing particular heavy.  \n\nAnyway, my lovely wife has a habit of locking her keys in her car.  Of course, she locks her keys in her car on this trip.  To solve this dilemma, she called me to come pick her up.  Now, let me set the scene properly.  All three kids (ages 9, 5, and 5) were eating breakfast and I was writing emails.  Things were happening.  I get this call to come pick her up, and say something like \"Uh, can you just walk home?  The kids are eating breakfast and I'm working\".  Her response was \"The store is less than two minutes away.  Just pack them up and come get me.\"\n\nNow, the store is really close.  We can almost see it from our second story.  It's less than half a mile as the crow flies.  The walk is basically to cross two neighborhood streets, walk through an undeveloped field, a crosswalk intersection, and then you're in the store parking lot.  \n\nIn my mind, walking home is kind of nice.  It's not far, and it's not like she had a ton of stuff.  Her reaction was. . . the opposite of that.  She wanted to be picked up, I doubled down and said, \"I don't want to pack up all the kids and stop what I'm doing.  Either walk home or wait in the Starbucks for me to come get you.  Give me like 20 or 30 minutes.\"  She didn't take too kindly to that, and walked home - I think mostly to spite me.  \n\nSo people.  Am I the asshole here?",

They live approx 4 hours from us and when they come to stay they stay for a week or more at a time.\n\nMy BIL and his wife had a baby a year and a half ago and my in laws have visited once a month for a week or more at a time with their two large dogs since the birth. \n\nThis previously wasn't an issue has they had a second place to stay up here that they owned.  However they are planning to sell it this year and still plan on visiting as often as they do. \n\nMy BIL used to have a spare room, but that is now the baby's room.  My SO and I just bought our first house together and we made sure to have an extra room for visitors just in case.  Well MIL has decided that it's HER room and has stated that she can't stay at BIL house because \"shes to old to sleep on a couch\". \n\nThere are other family members that live in our area that the SOs could stay with.  And the BIL has offered to let them stay in his basement, but it's unfinished at the moment and would just be a box springs and a mattress not a room\n\nMy S.O feels as though he has some sort of obligation to allow his parents to stay with us all the time. I do not. I don't mind if they stay with us a few times a year but I'm not interested in giving up my spare bedroom to someone coming in town once a month for two weeks at a time every month. I don't care who you are.  I want privacy and the ability to plan a vacation or make plans where I don't feel obligated to be home instead of hosting all the time.  There have been a few situations where she has become passive aggressive about the fact that even though she's been in town every month for the past year we didn't make time to see her every day she was here.  And I feel it would be even worse if she was staying with us. \n\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR: in laws constantly come in to town and expect to always have a place to stay even though they are selling their house and don't seem to care about privacy or the fact that other people have lives outside of hosting guests. \n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my fiancée while she was in rehab?",
      "description": "First time posting to Reddit, this is eating my soul and I need opinions. \n\nBack story: \n\nI was with my fiancee for 2 years (living together) and things were really great until the last few months we were together. I've never fallen so hard for someone or loved a woman this much, we clicked on every level. She started getting really depressed and sleeping a lot the last few months and I figured it was a phase because she hated her job and had some shitty life stuff going on. Once in the last weeks she started crying (she never, ever cries) and said she wished she was dead, stressed that she didn't want to kill herself and never would, just that she wished she was dead. I hugged her and suggested going to the gym would get her out of her funk, but really I didn't know how to handle it other than that and regrettably kind of just backed away and started to distance myself. The last day I saw her she was on the couch kind of staring into space and said \"If I'm not here when you get home today, it's because I left to get help. I need help\". I assumed she meant for the depression or other health stuff because she had basically stopped eating and had a lot of stomach and sleep problems so I didn't think much of it- she would make an appt with a Dr and be back later in the evening or whatever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree times over the past 6-8 months she also snapped on me out of nowhere at night, said some hurtful things and told me to \"get the fuck out\". Within minutes she would be loving again and forget she had said anything at all, and in the mornings she had zero recollection of these events. She apologized profusely and told me she had taken Ambien and that it makes people say crazy/aggressive things that they don't mean, but I feel like on some level she meant them and Ambien just revealed how she really felt. Every other minute of every day save for those 3 incidents, she was kind, supportive, loving... all around great. But those 3 times eat at me sometimes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was not aware that she began drinking in those last months. She had never been a big drinker, she disliked bars, didn't like the taste of most alcohol. I don't know if the depression led to her drinking, or drinking caused the depression or what. But it was some hardcore alcoholic behavior like buying bottles of vodka and drinking them alone at night after I went to bed. I had **NO** idea. She's a really intelligent girl and this was some upper-level evil genius type ability to hide her problem. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I come home from running errands and she is gone. No big deal, figure she'll be back in a few hours. It turns to night and I begin to worry. I start looking through the house to see if she packed an overnight bag and that's when I find an empty bottle of vodka in one of her drawers and an empty Smirnoff Ice (lol) bottle under the bed. I am fucking pissed because I know she's not a big drinker, so she must have had people over and drank with them. I assume a guy, one of her male friends is an alcoholic and I've always been suspicious of him. Not for any real reason, I just thought of him first and got angry and started packing a bag for ME to leave but decide to stay the night in our house after all. The next morning I get a call from a rehab center saying that my girlfriend checked herself in the previous afternoon and they took her cell phone, she was so bad off they brought her to the nearest hospital to detox because they were worried about seizures blah blah blah. She is going back to the rehab center after that for a 30 day treatment and she will call me when she's physically able but that \"she wants me to know she loves me and is so sorry and realized she had a problem and needed to leave right then to get help before she changed her mind\". Whatever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I am fucking floored... but some of the stuff from the last few months makes sense now and at least I know she wasn't fucking around on me. She's just a closet alcoholic (just, haha). It is such a huge betrayal of trust that I snap and make plans to move out. Get an apartment across town, move out, refuse all her calls from rehab, I'm fucking done with her. Let her come home to an empty house and see how it feels. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I start to regret my decision because who leaves the love of their life while they're in rehab, when they recognized they had a problem and got help?? I can't break my new lease (well maybe I could have but I didn't want to, still angry and confused) but I decide to visit her a few days before she gets out of rehab to tell her I had broken up with her and moved out, because letting her come home to an empty house with no warning was a dick move. She cried a ton and explained what led her to where she was, asked to work on things, etc. Which I considered because I really love this girl and to be honest I'm still considering it 4 months later. But I've only seen her in person a few times since then (2 hour long talks twice and once we just hung out) and have kind of cut contact save for cordial texts. She's doing well and staying sober, she's always been pretty strong and independent and I honestly believe the alcohol thing was a fluke tied to depression and she will be OK on the not drinking thing in the future, but she lost her job and can't afford the old house on her own so she's now unemployed and broke (rehab is expensive, yo). I feel badly about not being there for her for all of this and might want her back one day but the trust is just *destroyed*. And I feel so guilty about leaving her while she was in rehab/after she got out instead of being supportive but for fucks sake I would have been all that if she TOLD ME SHE HAD A PROBLEM instead of simply disappearing one day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust need some opinions on whether I'm the asshole here or nah. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR; Fiancee whom I love had a closet drinking problem and checked herself into rehab, I break up with her and move out before she gets home and I have pretty much abandoned her since then. Am I scum?** ",

      "description": "The house I'm looking at is currently being dealt with by two real estates because it's in the middle of being transfered from one real estate to another.\nWe put in an offer of $256k to the new real estate, but they fucked up and offered $265k, which I didn't find out till this morning. They didn't offer to change the offer, but said another family is offering $260k and we could put in $261k to beat them. A few things stand out here, they're not meant to tell us another party's offer, and they stated the reason for the stuff up was that the OWNER of the real estate put in the offer, not the agent we had been dealing with.\n\nSince dealing with this real estate, I've had bad vibes. They took us through the house before they had full control of the house, and didn't even have a contract made up. They asked us not to go to the open house today run by the old real estate because they didn't want to lose the sale. To me this all seems really shady, but typical for a real estate.\n\nSo, my question is, would I be the Asshole for making an offer to the rival real estate today? I'm even going to make a lower offer than what we have the original real estate.",

      "description": "So I need some outside perspective here.\n\nI (27/M) been seeing this girl (21/F) for a while, and everything was great. Today, out of the blue without warning she told me the relationship would progress to quickly, she was unsure if we did rush things and she still feels drawn towards her ex. Besides making our relationship official after 1 month, nothing feels rushed in my book. She didn’t move in, neither of us have met the other ones parents or anything like that.\n\nIt was her idea to make it public in the first place and she was the one who dropped the “I love you” first. I believe she should’ve checked her emotional state with her ex bf before suggesting being in a relationship.\n\nI told her I’m not willing to sit on the sideline, waiting for her to make up her mind about which guy to be with, and I don’t want to be the second choice if her ex rejects her. I explained this to her, said my goodbyes and wished her well and deleted her number.\n\nSome people might say I should’ve fought for her and maybe give her a chance to figure things out for herself\n\nReddit AITA here and did I overreact? Would a pause in such a scenario be justified?\n\nThank you!",

      "description": "My best friend is getting married and asked me to be her maid of honour. I think it's very sweet that she asked but I don't want to. I could, in theory, afford to, but it's not really something I believe in spending money on. She's very traditional and therefore expects the full monty of traditional wedding costs. If the shoe was on the other foot, it's not a cost I'd ever ask of others. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also live on the other side of the country from her. The approximate budget would be around $4000 as she's requested that I make one trip out for any dress/shoes/accessory related stuff, plus a trip for the wedding itself. It includes paying for a cat sitter, cabs, bachelorette party, wedding gift, etc. Again, I could fairly easily cover that $4000 but part of that is because I'm much more financially frugal than she and most people are. I have a budget, I invest, etc. I live alone in an expensive west coast city and I still have more money left over at the end of the day than her two income household. I kind of resent the assumption she has that I'll just say yes \"because obviously I have the money.\" But it's because I've been more responsible than her. Furthermore, she isn't owed the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut aside from the money, I am just not into any kind of event planning. Especially since I'm 3 time zones over from her. I can't deal with this kind of stuff at work - it'd be unprofessional - and by the time I get home from work it's too late to make phone calls to book various things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said, she's my best friend in the whole world and part of me thinks that I should just eat the $4k so that our friendship can continue. I don't think we'd \\*not\\* be friends if I declined, but the idea of her feeling unsupported by me really upsets me, too. I love her. She's family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My best friend (31F) asked me (31F) to be her MoH in a tradtional and expensive wedding. I don't want to spend the money nor put in the effort. These are not things I value. AITA for not sucking it up and just doing what my best friend wants?",

      "description": "I am currently in my freshman year of college. Boyfriend is actually still in high school even though he's about 4 months older than me because he was held back a year. We have been dating for...7 months or  so. Basically right before I went to college last summer if my math is right, that's 7 months. \n\nI had always made it very known to him that I only wanted to do one year of school in my hometown to do cross classes with my local community college so I could get my math skills more up to par with university level math. He always told me that he was applying to schools, taking his ACTs and would apply wherever I wanted to go next year. \n\nI found out like Friday that he has done literally nothing to get ready for college. He hasn't sent out a single application, he has not taken his ACTs. He is also failing two classes but says \"its no problem because his teachers promise he'll pass.\" \n\nSo that was Friday. When I saw him Thursday, I told him that I loved him on Saturday I just woke up and decided I didn't love him and wanted to break up. \n\nSo I told him Saturday that I was no longer in love with him and I wanted to break up with him. He told me \"literally it's impossible to tell someone you love them Thursday night and then want to break up Saturday and if it is possible you are such an asshole\" (or why I am posting here). I told him that was really enough for me and I left his driveway. \n\nSince Saturday he has either told me what an asshole or piece of shit I am or begged me to get back with him and promising that he'll change. \n\nMaybe it's sort of mean to just decide I don't have affection for another person after 7 months but I don't know what else to do. I care about him as a person in that I don't want anything bad to happen but I in now way want to be involved with him as a boyfriend or friend. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?\n",

      "description": "Okay. Throwaway account. \n\nI am a 23 year old female. I have been in a relationship with 25m for over 5 years, living together for 2. A week ago, I found out that I was pregnant. Trust me when I say, we were being as safe as possible and it was a HUGE shock to us. We both talked and agreed that abortion is the best answer. \n\nSo, we made an appointment with the doctor. We have a mandatory reflection period after the first appointment and before the procedure. My next appointment is 3 days from today. \n\nSo, last friday, I started feeling overwhelmed at work and was kinda losing it in the bathroom when a coworker walked in. She is really sweet and one of the senior managers who helped me out a lot in the beginning. I spilled my beans and she was very comforting and calming me. But later that day, she asks me if I was willing to have the baby, so that she and her husband can adopt. Turns out both her and her husband have fertility issues and there was no way to get pregnant and they have been adopt for a long time now. She said she will help me with the pregnancy, help with the cost, put in a good word with boss at work so my career won't be affected etc etc. \n\nI was really shocked and said I will think about it. After thinking about it over the weekend, I decided that I didn't wanna do this. I was already feeling too overwhelmed and I didn't want to carry a baby only to give him/her up. I don't think I can handle that. \n\nSo, on Monday, I went to her office and told her about my decision. As soon as I said no, she started crying and I just felt so guilty. Because she is a sweet person and would be a lovely mother. I kept trying to explain to her and she wasn't willing to listen and she kept telling me to get out. I thought she needed a moment and left. But after that, she refused to hear my apology or even listen to my reasoning. She was  avoiding me all day. Some of my colleagues came to know about this and everyone was coming over to my desk to change my mind. I was almost breaking down and I kept saying no. Everyone thinks I am the asshole for preferring abortion when there is a good family willing to adopt. \n\nNeedless to say I was quite upset when I got home. When I told my bf about this, he didn't think I was the asshole but he did say this was a good idea and he would prefer this over abortion and he asked me to think about this for some more time and to postpone my appointment to Monday. But I said no, and that i am going to this appointment and that its final. \n\nThen he got mad and said that I wasn't even willing to think about it and that was the least I could do. He was also mad that I wasn't even willing to take his advice and that the baby is also his. I just went to the study room and locked the door and didn't talk to him after that. And also, I took WFH today because I didn't want to face anyone right now. I haven't spoken to anyone since last night.\n\nThis whole week has been an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nSo, AITA?? ",

He can be a become a bit aggressive towards people and doesn’t like sitting for too long etc. \n\nThe nurses here are absolutely fantastic at managing this, however for some reason whenever I’m around he calms down and will sit and talk to me. Sometimes I’ll approach him and talk to him, ask him for help with something and he calms right down and will sit with me for ages chatting about all different things. \n\nAnyway, as one of the nurses pointed out one day, they speculate that it’s because I look and sound like his daughter. I didn’t think too much of it, but he repeatedly tells me he loves me (of course I say this back to him) but I don’t correct him when he calls me by her name, or when he asks about the family I always say they’re good etc. \n\nI know that it might sound a bit trivial to some, however the place I volunteer at values honesty and integrity, it really is a great place to work. I’m conflicted because I think technically I’m lying by not correcting him, and that goes against everything I’ve ever been taught/do. \n\nSo what do you think guys? \nAITA? ",

They all say it’s her children and her decision and hopefully nothing happens to them but if it does then we’ll be there to support her.\n\nSince everyone thinks I’m the asshole I’ve been thinking about making up with her but I can’t bring myself to do it just yet, I’m still so angry that my sister turned out to be a moron and I don’t think I’ll ever see her how I used to, she’s my big sister so I had a lot of respect for her.\n\nTL;DR: I’m mad at my anti Vaxx sister and all of my family thinks I’m in the wrong because I stopped talking to her.",

My dad always lived abroad and called me on birthdays and visited maybe once a year so I never really knew him and still don't. I grew up with my mom, two younger sisters and an abusive step-father. At 16 I ran away from home, rented an unapproved flat in an industrial area of my city and worked part time at a restaurant along side college. With no financial help from either of my parents and almost no contact with my mother since she was still in love with her abusive husband. At 18 I dropped out of college. Fortunately I got a student loan to move abroad and study a trade. Again no help from my parents what so ever during that time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow at 24 I'm a co-owner of a semi successful company in my field, owner of a few apartments in my hometown and making almost 200k a year. I know that is really good and I'm so proud of myself.\n\nRecently I've had heated arguments with both of them because I get mad when they say they are proud of me. I feel they don't deserve to feel proud of my achievements because they did not help me in any way to reach them. In fact they only made it harder for me. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way and telling them they don't deserve to be proud of me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I feel my parents don't deserve to feel proud of my achievements because they only made them harder to reach for me.

      "description": "Hey AITA! This isnt a new situation that just came up, rather one that happened a few weeks ago. Idky i thought of it randomly, but wanted to see how youd all weigh in since Im on the fence.\n\nAnother warning, this isnt about me directly, but rather something that happened  between my mom and sister. Mom is M, sister is S. Mom is mid 40s, sister is mid-early 20s.\n\nM was informed by her mother (my grandmother) that their live-in-friend (lived together, im unclear on their relationship since--for at least 20 some years--gma lived on the bottom floor and her friend lived on top but shed make him tea, cook the odd time and hed cook for her, hed drive her places, theyd smoke together, watch tv together, etc) had passed due to lung cancer. M passed along her condolences and that was that. Call done. M told S what had happened and S was upset, asked about the funeral and M told her that if she wanted to go, then she could call Gma herself and get the details as she, M, did not have them since she did not plan on attending.\n\nS gets mad but leaves and gets the details for the funeral. S tells M and asks her if shell go now and, surprise surprise, M's decision hadnt changed in 36hrs (day and a bit idk the exact time frame) and said no. S gets mad and offended and asks if M will go to support her, and M again said no.\n\nS and I knew the guy who passed away. Hed been very kind to us but 1, we havent seen him since we were 12 (so about 10 years ago). 2, when we did see him, it was once a year. Yes, he was nice and cool and awesome but there wasnt much to the bond (S confided in me that she was sad but not like devastated or anything and felt like she had to go because she knew him).\n\nOn the other hand, M did NOT know the guy who passed. She saw him even less than we did (2hrs top a year when she dropped us off to spend a week with him and Gma). He came into her moms (Gmas) life, AFTER her dad left Gma. M also does not get along with her side of the family. At all. She especially is not fond of her brother who, of course, was also giving M shit for not going along with his wife apparently. M also especially doesnt like her mother (Gma) who was pretty damn verbally abusive to M when growing up. I do not blame M for not wanting to go in the slightest. \n\nS is.... tunnel visioned in things and just got more and more POed with M. I understand the need for support but like, if S needed it then she also could have asked me (early 20s,have comforted her at many a-funeral before) but she never did.\n\nTldr; S is claiming she need moral support at a funeral to a gentleman we kinda know but hadnt spoken to in close to a decade. She demands that support from our mother, but mother doesnt know the gentleman and doesnt like her family and is refusing to go.\n\nSo, is my mother TA for not wanting to attend the funeral? ",

      "description": "People don't usually say things like \"it is OK if you don't believe the Earth is flat, but you should respect deeply the ideas of those who do\". However, for some reason this is often said about religions.\n\nWhy is that we seem to be socially allowed to make fun of the lunatic ideas of those who believe the Earth is flat, but for some reason we must remain silent and respectful when the lunacy has religious grounds? Why should I remain respectful of ideas that make no sense and are false, ridiculous and even dangerous?\n\nSome people will say: \"but you should respect people, not ideas\", and for the most part I agree. The problem is that the line between making fun of an idea and making fun of a person is often blurry when it comes to religion, as religious ideas are rooted so deep inside believers that any criticism of religion is often perceived by them as a personal attack. This is where I get annoyed.\n\nSomehow, we all have unanimously accepted that certain things cannot be said because they would annoy religious people, which apparently is a big deal. Furthermore, we have taken this so seriously that there is a social consensus about how disrespectful it is to say almost anything that goes against religion.\n\nFor example, if I were to say something like \"baptism is such a ridiculous ritual\", even though I wouldn't be attacking anyone personally – but just be giving my personal opinion about a nonsensical religious tradition – many would consider that I am being disrespectful.\n\nThis is, as soon as religious people take offence in your words because you criticise or make fun of their religion, you are perceived by society as someone who is being disrespectful. I think this is complete bullshit.\n\nIn my opinion, we should be able to criticise and ridicule religious ideas without being labelled as disrespectful, no matter who gets offended. However, as much as I think that my opinion is neither crazy nor too extreme, every time I dare to say it, I get told that I am just a disrespectful asshole... So I would like to know what you think.\n\nTL;DR: I don't think religions deserve any kind of respect. I should be free to make fun of them and criticise them without being considered disrespectful, no matter how much offence religious people may take at my words. ",

Plenty of people seemed to think it was pretty good and entertaining, even the hostess. Other people didn't. \n\nA little ways into the night after everyone had a few drinks, one guy and I got into an argument over a game of cards. Then he started interrogating me about the question, asking me if I was a racist, if I really supported the Confederacy, etc. \n\nEventually he shoved me, and I guess I shouldn't have but I really didn't want to let some guy push me around, so I shoved him. I don't even really remember who threw a punch first, but we got pulled apart before it could escalate into a full-on fight. \n\nThen I got thrown out, since apparently my costume \"sparked\" it. Now everyone in our general social circle seems to be pissed off at me, including a few of my friends.\n\nI don't think I even did anything wrong, and even if you think wearing the costume was somehow wrong I wasn't the one that started the fight.

In the end his little cousion started digging in his bag and faound the drawing and showed it to him parents.\n\nHis parents got really pissed about it and I don't know even today if it was something that he deserves or to fell bad that I acted to much like a fool and hurt my friend.\n",

Normally we get along fine and she was super excited to have me stay here during the holidays. However, she's extremely uptight whereas I'm super easy going. But it has been fine so far.\n\nWe've been talking about getting a Christmas tree today some time after my lunch plans, but never chose a time. I went to lunch then got home and she was at the grocery store. I had a headache, so I went to lie down. When my mom got home she immediately said \"let's go get a christmas tree\" and I told her I was lying down. Immediately, she got upset, yelled FINE, I'LL JUST DO IT MYSELF, and left to go get a tree alone--which is something that I consider to be a special thing you do with family.\n\nSo, she got back and asked me to help her decorate it. However, at this point, she couldn't wait \\~1 hour for me to be ready to go pick out the tree and I feel like her inexplicable need to get the christmas tree RIGHT THIS SECOND when we hadn't planned anything (and trees would still be there an hour later) means that her neuroses are more important than doing christmas things with her daughter. So I told her if she didn't want my help with getting the tree, she wasn't gonna get it decorating it. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "ever since I was 15 (back in 2013) this second mom/second family has been in my life. I’m 20 yrs old now(I dated their son for a couple of months back when I was 15 and he was 16, he came out as gay so we continued a friendship together and I was like a daughter to them. LITERALLY,they always said that. I would walk over to his house whenever, even when he wasn’t home I would go over or his mom would invite me over and we would just hang out. We would go shopping talk about boys, she never had a daughter so she loved to gossip ect.. shes extremely outgoing and she’s the PTA mom type and also the can I speak to the manager type(which didn’t bother me too much). We kept this close relationship till I left for college in 2016. she said she was voting for trump it threw me off but that’s fine she has the right to vote for whoever she wants, what started to steer me away from her is her rhetoric regarding trumps politicies. Shes just a hypocrite she’s always saying stuff like build that wall! And I came here legally!(She’s half French and Spanish) her parents immigrated here from Europe back in the early 60s when she was 1 yrs old she didn’t have a say in whether or not she came here legally or illegally just like most immigrant children today. U would think she would be a little more understanding but she’s not. She doesn’t work because her husband makes enough money for her to not to work, she hasn’t worked in over 20 yrs(Which is fine) but it annoys me because she always complains about how the gov is taking so much of her taxes ect.. and how illegal immigrants are taking jobs and ruining the country but she’s so lucky in life it’s insane. The only things she has to worry about are shopping and decorating her house that’s the majority of what she did back when I was in high school and I know it still is now that Both of her boys are in their 20s and don’t live at home. it just kinda annoys me because I feel like she’s so out of touch on reality and the worries most people face in life, like she’s in a bubble. Also her son who’s still my friend jokingly says the n word a lot like hard -er. (I’m a black female) and its really getting on my nerves. I haven’t reached out to them in over a year. I guess cause I don’t see them the same way anymore.it saddens me I loved this family, I will really listen to ur input and change my views accordingly if I am the asshole, thank u for reading!💕",

      "description": "Background: I just moved in with a buddy from work.  About 4 days into my stay I asked if I could go ahead and pay rent.  He directed me to the online payment and I put in my card number.  Regrettably it saved my card as an option for payment on his phone too.  I told him to be careful with that but trusted him enough to leave it there. (bad idea)\n\nSure enough, about a week later he came up to me apologising saying he accidentally paid both mine and his portion of the rent on my card; 1452 dollars total.  I was visibly not happy and we talked about it and I realized since it was for rent and not just a random charge that it would be ok and he could just pay me back.  \n\nThis is where the excuses started.  He claims that he can only pull out 200 at a time because of the type of account he has. So to make a long story short, it's been about a week and he's paid 400 of the 720 he owes me.  We got paid yesterday and I said you can just ask for 320 in cash and deposit the rest.  He claims he can't and also said their systems are messed up and I'll have to wait another day and then still another day for the final 120.  I feel like that's total bullshit and the longer it takes the more I feel that there was no accident and he's dragging this out for hidden reasons.  AITA for feeling this way?",

      "description": "So I have this friend who I grew up with and known. We spoke every day and played xbox, because he moved to another school, until he met a new group of friends.\n\nI was fine with this until his new friend group started to dislike me and stop playing Xbox with me. I was didn't think much until he started neglecting my messages, over the summer we would play xbox, but I woke up at about 12 so he would play with his friend group until I woke up, I was fine with this. There started to be a lot of fighting between me and him if he stopped talking to me for about 2 weeks, I decided he needed more space.\n\nOne day I got home and it was one of the times I was good with the new friend group, they told me to buy a game on sale. As I looked into the game, I decided to give it a try, I enjoyed for about a week, but my friend started to join their games and they would repeatedly kill me over and over. It wasn't fun, but I didn't care much because I had other friends to play with. We stopped playing that game for a while, and the friend I game share with started hanging out with me more, we talked shit about his other friends saying how they're breaking this friendship apart. I agree 100% with this, because for the past years we were great friends.\n\nThis was fine until more of his friends got the game I was previously talking about, he started the same shit over. He got back to me when a game he knew I would buy came out, he played that game with me for about 2 or 3 weeks, but then he started playing the original game I bought with his friends and never invited me because I would be insta-kicked from the party.\n\nThis brings me to where i am now to where I stopped gamesharing, he started to talk to me more and his friends started calling me out on it but they never message me until recently. Everytime I stop talking to my friend I wake up feeling I was too harsh. I started gamesharing again but I can't switch back to my xbox because I ran out of switches and I can't change until I manually go on my friends xbox or until next year, my friend now knows this and neglects me overall, he only messages me when I ask why he didn't join me and he says because his new friends are better, but they don't give him the games he plays most. I didn't mention that he has 8 times the amount played on the original game than me.\n\nTLDR: friend meets new friend group in which I'm not welcome, and uses me for games",

He fought me on this but agreed in the end.\n\nLately hes been upping his walks to 3 hours and walks through the down town/ river front of our city. Not the best place to walk at night, lots of bars, drunks, bad neighborhoods (we have a bad drug and gun violance issue here) So I asked if he could shoot me a text half way through just an I'm fine see ya at so and so time. Just so I don't sit here and worry. Also He tends to have me pick him up and its nice to know Ive got x amount of time left before I have to get rdy to go out.\n\nHe seems to think that Im being controling, when I just want him to be safe, and not worry all night about him walking alone in unsafe places.  \n\nHe says that having to be on a timer stresses him out and that its too much of a hastle to txt mid walk. I could really care less how long he walks for, sure I worry, sure I feel lonely bit its some thing he needs for his health. I just hate sitting there worrying, more so when I call him before I head to pick him up and get no reply and its been hours since he left.\n\nSo Am in the wrong  for asking for a mid walk check in to aleavate my fear and worry?  I don't feel like Im asking much in a quick txt, He feels like Im cutting in to his freedom. \n\nP.s. He has been hastled by cops a number of times for being in the parks along the bike path where he walks, generally for just stopping to use the bathrooms along his way. And he does not fallow a set route so I wouldnt be able to even look for him if some thing did happen to him.\n\nThanks for the help!",

      "description": "Bit of background: my grandmother and grandfather were together since my grandfathers death a few years ago, they had a very traditional relationship where my grandfather controlled all finances, big decisions etc, and my grandmother would do the cooking and cleaning (note: she has worked in the past and has helped when my grandfather had his own buisness).\n\nEver since my grandfather passed away, my grandmother has been very reliant on my mum and me (aunt/mum's sister isn't very nice and lives quite a distance away) which makes sense. Due to bereavement, her memory has gotten a bit worse but she's had medical tests and there's nothing permanent. She needs glasses and a hearing aid (but refuses to wear them). I love my grandmother but I am more protective of my mum. I can see that my grandmother constantly relying on my mum to do everything for her (besides bathe her) is taking a toll. My grandmother is competent but doesn't want to learn how to do anything my grandfather did for her. \n\nNow the event that leads me to ask AITA: recently, whenever my mum has given my grandmother a time to arrive, she is always an hour to two hours early. Even if these times are 9:00am, she will arrive at 7:30am. Even if she writes the time down, no matter how many times my mum or myself tell her a time, she is always early. This used to be just a bit annoying but now she has started barging in when my mum is with clients (mum is a mental health adviser) and doesn't understand why my mum won't give her attention/hang out with her. I put my foot down and said that it's getting too much and is getting in the way of my mums work. Grandmother's response is that we treat her horribly and she wants my mum to quit her job. I tell her \"you need to be on time, check your phone or watch for the time. 15 minutes early is fine but an hour isn't! My mum is working.\" She asks \"what do you expect me to do?\" I say \"be on time\" and she then leaves.\n\nSo reddit, AITA? ",

      "description": "TLDR friend wanted to do a side job, i said said no because I had a long day next. \n\nBuddy and I clean rest. Equipment at night for our main jobs. I'm a gm and hes my employee. \n\nHes got a girlfriend and lives at gone with his parents. Alot of credit card debt, loan, and car loan stuff and pays them some utilities. He works 38/40 hours a week for me. \n\nI am married with 2 children and have 2 children from a previous relationship. I got invited to one of their baseball games Tuesday and I also had a GM meeting that day and mid day a training class for CPR/AED. \n\nWhen we do the cleaning we leave at 9pm Monday night and get back between 5 am and 6 am Tuesday mornings. I worked 9am to 5pm Monday and didnt want to over night clean then sleep a few hours before my meeting that I had with my bosses and then the course for CPR. I had enough time to leave there, eat, then go to the baseball game. \n\nI told my buddy I didnt want to do it and he immediately said \"well that's going to f*** me pretty hard\" I told him wed been doing to many to fast recently and if we kept at the pace wed end up screwing ourselves by not having any one of the following months and on top of that I didnt understand why he needed one so badly when hes been selling off some collectible things he has and working another job with his GFs family making some money. He replies with \"fine it just f***s me but fine.\" I left it at that and didnt feel like arguing about it. \n\nLater Monday be text me saying \"so I assumed were just saying f*** me? So I know how to proceed with me evening?\" I replied reiterating some of what I said about how he had made extra money this month and how doing 6 straight weeks wasnt gonna fly for my work and home life and that we were stilling going to do one next week he should be fine. He replied stating that all the extra money he has made so far he out toward his loan so he wouldn't have it anymore and that he needed this week and next week plus regular work to make ends meet. Then said \"so f*** me I'll just use the f***ing money from selling a huge part of my life long possessions and continue with this month to month cycle of being f***ing broke as shit making all of my efforts for f***ing nothing oh and I have to come up with 374 dollars for the taxes on my truck by the end of the month but it's all good I guess enjoy your night off I'll figure it out...\" to which I didnt bother replying.\n\nSo the last 3 days of working together hes given me the silent treatment. At this point I find it it sad and pathetic to continue a silent treatment and going to any extreme to avoid speaking to me for having other responsibilities etc. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for wanting the night off?",

      "description": "It was my grandpa's 80th birthday and we had travelled 12 hours to come celebrate with him and that side of the family. For his birthday, about 15 friends and family went to a nice restaurant. The waitress was smart and asked about how the bill was going to split before hand. My grandma wanted the food bill and uncle took the drink bill. Both of her told my mom not to worry about it since we traveled so far. Mom was persistent for a bit but let it go. \n\nNow my philosophy when it clears to someone else paying a big bill like that is offer to split 2 times. If after 2 they still insist, just say I'll get the next one and move on. \n\nWell the bill finally comes, and my mom starts flaunting around her card yelling \"we're paying for half the food\". My grandma said no, they've got it. For 10 minutes (I wish I was exaggerating) they fought over the bill. About halfway in I nudge my mom and tell her to stop. She gives me the death glare and says to mind my own business to which I tell her she's making a scene (all the tables around us were looking at her since she was the loudest of the group and incredibly persistent). She gives me  the \"shut up or I'll end you\" eyes so I count my losses and turn away to chat with my cousins. \n\nMy grandma eventually got tired of her persistence and ended letting us pay the entire bill. So I guess a win-win? Idk. \n\nMy mom called me an arrogant asshole in the car while we were on our way back to grandparents house and I chose not to defend myself since I was driving and didn't want to engage in a fight right then.

      "description": "I matched this guy on some dating app and he wanted to meet for drinks, since I work from 9am-12am most days I told him that it would have to be on a free day. He was super upfront about what he wanted - something long term, serious, etc etc. I don't mind I'm open to anything. A few days go by and he keeps pushing on when I'm free - I already set a date sometime in the next week but he still kept at it. Then he started telling me that we should schedule a time to watch Netflix together, drink dates ,etc. I told him that I would have to let him know because for one, I haven't met him yet and he's already planned out my week and two, I am extremely busy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter four days of having matched him and NOT met yet, he said \"If we like each other how much often can you see me?\". Honestly, okay, definitely a valid question for someone that wants something long term and serious but I kind of got uncomfortable seeing as I haven't even met him yet. I just said that my priority is work (which it is) but if I find someone that I like and want to get serious with then obviously I would make time for them (which is true), but seeing as I haven't met you yet, obviously I'm not going to make you my priority.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I decided that this is just way too much for someone I haven't even met yet (there's more but let's just skip it) so I told him this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Hi \\*\\*\\*\\*, I'm really sorry I don't think I'm too keen on meeting for drinks. I just think that we're not a good fit.\n\nHim: How come? So out of the blue\n\nMe: Really sorry, just thought you should now rather than later\n\nHim: Haha. Whatever\n\nMe: Know now\\*\n\nHim: Whatever\n\nHim: Can you please stop messaging me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI blocked him immediately after that because honestly it was only 5 days of matching him but AITA? Because I thought his response was quite rude. Just seemed like he couldn't take no for an answer but I thought it was better that I let him know now rather than later and waste his time seeing as he wants something serious and long term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Matched a guy on an app, decided to turn him down because he was way too pushy and got a (for lack of a better term) pretty bitchy response back",

      "description": "It started back when I was 16. I was in a relationship with a girl who I truly liked, but she was much more conservative in many ways than I wanted to be at the time. During the relationship, I spent time with people from my new job, and our main cause to meet up was to smoke marijuana. None of this was a problem, but eventually my girlfriend and I broke up which led to me spending a lot more time with my coworkers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the girls at my work was almost the dream girl for an (at this point) 17 year old like me. She was 20 years old, extremely attractive, fun to be with and we got along very well. We talked everyday and she asked me about her problems and I did my best to help. There was definitely some underlying context for a long time but it was extremely platonic, we even slept together at her house without doing anything because it just didn't feel right at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a couple months, marijuana started making me act up and made my anxiety come front and centre, whereas before it did the opposite. It was a pretty big part of my life so I was reluctant to give it up because I had really enjoyed it in the past. This is where the context ends and where my fuckup happens. There were 4 of us, with one of our friends driving around and the rest of us were drinking. Near the end of the night, me and the girl were sitting in the backseat holding hands and it was obvious for us that we wanted something more out of the night. By the time it came to drop us off, we had made a discreet plan that I would be dropped off at my house and I would go over to her's \"to smoke weed\", so as to not make it obvious what we were doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all happened, and you can probably tell where this is going. We smoked, went back to her room, and did the deed. I was extremely uncomfortable the whole time and I wished I could be anywhere but there. This was my also first time having sex without a condom, and I had no idea about her history so this only added to my anxious feelings. Eventually we finish and clean up and I left right away without so much as an explanation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this I didn't message her at all, and gave simple replies to her. We still saw each other at work, but I could not begin to explain how extremely uncomfortable the whole situation made me. She sent me a long message eventually that I just ignored and went to work without a care and was surprised when her friend asked me why I never responded. For the next couple months we only talked when we were out and drinking and she wanted to know how I could've done what I did, but I had too much pride to really explain how awful the situation was for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what do you think? Was I the asshole?",

For the purpose of this story 20M will be A and 20F will be B, and other 20M will be C. \n\n\nWe all moved in together in September but met last year in residence. For a couple months we all lived harmoniously as a friend group, until A and B started having feelings for each other. They had a small fling between Oct-Dec but A ended it because he couldn’t trust her. \n\n\nMyself and C were happy it stopped because we had all agreed last year that we didn’t want to live with a couple and they ended up practically being a couple anyways. A and B remained close but we were a group again. \n\n\nA few weeks ago, A was going downtown to go drinking with his friends from home. B and C were at home for the weekend, so he asked if i wanted to come with him. I’d previously hung out with his friends, so i went and i had a great time. I really clicked with the girls of the group. \n\nAround that time, A and B started becoming more than friends again. Now they spend 90% of their time cooped up in his room, they sleep in the same bed every night, and we barely see them. C and i again feel like the group dynamics have changed and we’re spending more time with our other friends. A and B are constantly snapchatting, texting, and talking, meanwhile C and I barely see them. \n\nA few days ago A mentioned it was his friend’s birthday and he was going downtown on friends bday to celebrate. I was under the impression that he was going by himself, but it turns out he invited B without asking C or i if we wanted to come too. Now, i get you’re probably going to say that they’re allowed to hangout without us and whatever, but we’re the type of friends who invite each other to things pretty much whenever we go somewhere, and the last time it was one of A’s friend’s birthdays he invited us all to come with him. \n\nI’m annoyed because I feel like when A and I went downtown together on our own he was just asking me because B couldn’t go. I also would have liked to see his girl friends again and I don’t know why he wouldn’t want us to come too, plus he and B are just being shady about whether or not they’re a couple. I want to talk to him but I don’t think I can bring it up without sounding like i’m mad that I wasn’t invited. \n\nI’m more upset that we explicitly all agreed we didn’t want to live with a couple and they’ve become one and it’s changing our friendships.

The girl I have feelings for just got out of a relationship a week ago with one of my close friends, and I don’t want to hurt him, even if it was a short term relationship. \n\nI wouldn’t have even been in this situation if my friends hadn’t stolen my phone and found a shitty poem I wrote in my notes. Like it’s real bad, total roast material, and normally I wouldn’t care, but it was a little personal and it put me in a weird spot. So I lied and said I liked someone else. Ever since then, they’ve been trying to figure out how to set me up, which has caused me and the girl I lied about a little bit of stress. The other female doesn’t know that I said anything, but I can just feel that it’s coming out eventually.\n\nSo AITA? And if I am, what can I do to remedy the situation?",

I follow friends on instagram because I'd like to see what they're up to and photos of themselves, their art, and what they do with their friends and loved ones. But this guy posts nothing but photos of his girlfriend and her selfies that she sent to him. It's not even a joint account. Guy legit just wants to show off his new Asian girlfriend and I get that it's a sweet thing when your partner shows you off to the world... But it's too much? If I want to see photos of a random woman I don't even know flooding my entire feed, I could just follow her own damn instagram instead right?\n\nThe guy sent me a dm, being offended and asking why I unfollowed him and we're not friends anymore (just cause I unfollowed?) I told him as politely as I could that of course we're still friends but I'm just simply not interested in seeing photos of her. He called me an asshole, said I can't be happy for him and that I'm jealous (apparently cause I'm also a woman so I'm jealous of his girlfriend??). AMTA?\n\nI get that there's the option to mute the account without unfollowing, and unfollow without unfriending. But the photos annoyed me so much til I just didn't want to have any social media connection with him anymore because that's all he will post in the future too. I never intended to not be friends at all irl though. ",

      "title": "AITA for cutting my husband's friend from my life?",
      "description": "TL;DR: Friend of my husband's has a habit of screaming at us when we do something wrong or that she doesn't like/feel is right. After she yelled at me for ruining her weekend I decide to step back, and with what's happened since then, cut all contact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStrap in for a long ride, my friends. Thanks in advance for those of you who will take the time to read it. For those who won't... I totally get it. \n\nI met this person two years ago. When we first met, she spent the entire hour talking to my then-bf in their native language and didn't speak to me at all, even though she can speak English very well and at the time I couldn't speak their languague. I didn't like her much at the time, of course, but I tried not to go into judging mode so soon into knowing her.\n\nThen I moved in with my bf more than a year later, and she invited us to a bunch of stuff. I never wanted to go but I did, to accompany my bf. The first time was whatever, but the other times were better. She is the kind of person who brags and humblebrags about their life all the time, and who thinks they always know best (\"oh your favourite restaurant is restaurant x? I promise you, restaurant y is much much better, you won't even remember x anymore\", or cutting into a conversation with \"of course he'll do x, he is your husband, that's what the man has to do\": these kinds of comments riddled the whole conversation when with her), despite that, I had a decent time and she showed her friendlier sides.\n\nNow a recollection of time we spent together. I think it's important in order to get the whole picture, but go ahead and jump it if you like. A few months ago she said the three of us should meet but only if my husband and I didn't kiss or stay too close to one another because she had fought with her bf and didn't want to see couple-y people. Fair enough, I noticed she has a rocky relationship with her bf (to say the least), so from then on when the three of us met, I didn't kiss or hug or show affection to my husband, we just held hands. About two months ago we were out, the three of us, and I commented I needed to buy a new winter jacket. She said she had one that didn't fit her anymore, sent me pictures, then brought it to me. That was nice and we asked if she wanted something in return. She said she wanted us to bake a treat from my home country for her and we'd eat it together. Another time we were 15 minutes late to meet her and she berated us, saying it was really shitty of us, that she almost left, that if we did this again she'd stop meeting us. I felt very bad and almost cried because the reason we were late was a fucked up depressive episode I was having so I was already on edge, but she didn't know this, and it wasn't an excuse to being late, so even though her means of conveying her frustration were arguably not the best, she still had a point, so we sucked it up and didn't try to respond or excuse ourselves. \n\nCut to a few weeks ago. We went to an event where I was very clear from the beginning that I had three things within it which I wouldn't miss (they were the whole reason I was there, tbh). My husband and she didn't really want to see anything specific, we were there because I said I really wanted to go, and she changed her mind a bunch of times about going or not and finally decided she would. While there, I quietly agreed to doing whatever she proposed as long as I didn't miss these three things. She seemed to understand that, was nice about it and always said stuff like \"we will do this then go to your thing\". One time she didn't want to stay with us in the middle of the crowd so she waited somewhere else. Some of her other attitudes annoyed me, like complaining about the service everywhere, but she can be nice and indeed was, so I just didn't say much and didn't add much to their conversation to avoid me going against her because I knew it'd be a shitshow. She's not my friend, she's my now-husband's friend, I thought, so I'll stay out of it and ignore some things. I wasn't physically affective to my husband, we just held hands, and I made sure to always use the second person plural in their language when asking what they wanted to do next or if they wanted to eat, except when she started ignoring me (we'll get there soon). I hate selfies but my husband loves them so he asks me we take one together, just the two of us: this happens twice. Once randomly and the other time on the second day of the event, when she and I had an argument about marriage and it ended with her not speaking to me for many hours and leaving us behind when walking. We just let her be and gave her some space, which we thought was a good idea. Afterwards she said she didn't talk to me because she was mad at her boyfriend, which I don't totally buy, but that we could talk to her again. \n\nA parenthesis: the marriage thing. We were going to have breakfast but we were on a table far away from the other tables and no one came to serve us. She said \"I'm going to go there and ask them what I can do to get service around here\". My husband said \"just say you want some coffee, and they'll get the message\", but she stomped away. I said to him, jokingly, \"don't you know your own friend?\", and when she came back she said the waiters were standing around just talking and got in a bad mood after she asked them if there was a way she could get some service there (I wonder why they were in a bad mood: we'll need Sherlock Holmes on this one). I tried to be extra nice to the waiter and felt embarrassed they might think I was like her, because being rude to workers of the service industry is the kind of attitude I abhor. Then a while later she said marriage is forever and she will never marry because she can't know she'll be with someone forever, and she thinks divorcing is wrong — fair game. I was getting more and more annoyed, so this time I didn't just stay quiet, saying instead that I disagreed and that was her opinion and it was fine but it's just her opinion. She proceeded to try and convince me that it's not her opinion, it's the truth, and that actually I agreed with her. I said I do want to stay with my husband forever, but that doesn't mean we agree because I don't think it's an requirement in non-religious weddings/marriages. She said that staying together forever is the basis of marriage in Western society, and that those who divorced had the right to, but were wrong in doing so. I didn't back out and calmly insisted that it was her opinion and it's all swell, but that doesn't make it an absolute truth. The argument then derailed into random hypothetical cases from her part, as if to test my morals. I said a couple of times \"we have different opinions and it's fine, let's leave it at that\", because I didn't want things to keep escalating (which they did). I said I grant myself the right of changing my mind when I learn something new which might change it, and that things are grey for me, not black and white, both ways of seeing the world are valid, but they're just that, personal opinions and personal ways of seeing things. She said society wouldn't have so many problems if there weren't people who change their minds all the time. I saw that as a personal attack but kept my cool and stopped arguing. She then said that she was going to give up trying to argue with me because it was impossible and I kept changing my mind, which I didn't, but even if I did, my whole point was that I'm okay with changing my mind and I have diverse opinions within the same theme, depending on the case \\[such as: is it wrong to lie? my answer: it depends\\], and she didn't need to agree with that (just leave me alone, I suppose). It was exhausting. I felt like there was no getting though to her.\n\nThe previous night she had screamed at my husband's face because we were at the after party and I was dancing with my eyes closed and my face turned to him, and he wasn't dancing at all. She complained that it was no fun going out with us and we were ruining it for her because I was dancing only with him and he wasn't dancing. I said I had my eyes closed because I was tired and the lights were hurting my eyes, which was true, but what I didn't say is that I was with my eyes closed also because she wasn't dancing and I felt judged by her while having fun despite the two of them not moving. I even sang \"Don't Stop Me Now\" out loud with a complete stranger, it was AWESOME — I payed total attention to the stranger woman here, because if I looked at my husband the friend would feel left out and if I looked at the friend I'd feel silly and judged and would want to stop singing. \n\nAll that, together with the hours of her ignoring me, were enough to make me want to stay away, but again I thought \"not my friend, and sometimes she's nice, let's leave it at that\". That night she was still in a bad mood but apparently better. So it's over, I thought with relief. Apparently the devil caught wind of my relief and decided to play again. She said she wanted to see something but then we could leave for my thing, so five minutes before it started I said I wanted to leave to go to see my thing. She started fighting with my husband. I didn't hear the details so I said \"what's wrong?\" and she said \"you're really getting on my nerves right now\" and tore me apart for not being friendly to her during the weekend, ruining it for her, acting like a couple the whole time, leaving her to walk metres ahead of us (I thought she was doing it on purpose, because when we got closer she walked faster and she didn't look me in the face), doing just what I wanted, never asking her opinion or doing what she wanted, not acting like a group of friends (which in my head we weren't anwyay), taking pictures without her, and now I wanted to see the whole concert????, so to her I was just all aroun",

      "description": "Around early February, somehow my friend ended up getting my crush to confess to me through call, and it was moreover of a \"cool. we both like each other.\" But somehow he gets the agreement to date while I'm in a daze.\n\nAnd so over the time, it's starting to get really uncomfortable for me. He's already told his parents (high school btw), tried to set up a date. sent multiple messages with lovey dovey stuff, and gave candy in a plastic baggie. I don't want to say anything, because I don't want to ruin whatever we've got. We had a good talk session once, and turns out, he's been screenshotting the call. Things like \"best hour of my life 😍😍\" and etc. I wasn't ready to go public, so it was creeping me out. His friends started to make fun of me afterwards. \n\nAnd on Friday, basically one week before Valentine's Day, which I am severely stressing about because of the horrible timing - he asks me to wait outside after lunch to take a picture. Cool. Meet him outside, take a very awkward selfie together on his phone, think nothing of it. By sixth period, it's hell. Everyone who has his social media makes fun of me, since he put the caption \"I'm so lucky\" and etc. This is where I've realized I've made a big mistake. So after school gets out, my friend (who helped to get us together) listened to my story and helped me to basically text \"hey, can you tone it down since it's really awkward for everyone to be making fun of me.\" He responds later telling me he's sorry, and\"I'm just so in awe of you.\" \n\nThis is where I tell myself I can't keep doing this. So once he starts up a conversation, I tell him the truth. I tell him it's been really awkward for me to act like I'm only known as his girlfriend, and it wasn't what I imagined,  I wasn't ready, and I hoped we could still be friends. He says he can't see straight, and I just wait for him to respond.\n\nI check his social media, nope. He's posting really angsty stuff, general break up quotes; okay he's overreacting, and I understand, so I give him the weekend. Around Sunday/Monday, he posts publicly again, saying about he's been ashamed, embarrassed, angry, etc. In his post, he said I was the one who started the relationship and who also broke up, and he was even more heartbroken since it was Valentine's week. I broke up before Valentine's Day so I wouldn't be wasting his time to get me a gift of sorts.\n\nI privately message him - he tells me to never interact with him, and that my actions speak instead of my words. He didn't post my name so my \"reputation\" wouldn't be ruined, despite  that same week he posted a picture of us, the previously mentioned selfie. I'm really hurt, since I thought we could handle this maturely, and by the time we get back to school, he isn't talking to me completely. It's now even more awkward since we're in the same group of friends - people keep on telling me I didn't have enough communication, and everyone keeps on harassing me.",

I have for a long time thought she is the one and I know she has too, as recently as a couple of weeks ago we talk a lot about getting married and it’s always been assumed I guess that it will happen, point being we’re fairly committed, in my mind at least anyway\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome more background, she likes going out for a casual drink fairly regularly, which I have no issues with and like her spending time with her genuine friends. For the most part she’ll just have 1 or 2 then head home. Also, just recently she has started a new job and I have been very proud and supportive of her and know how hard she has worked to get there. Things were really going great I thought, up until last week and now it actually looks like we are going to break up which would absolutely break my heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have a current issue which we fundamentally disagree on which seemingly out of nowhere is threatening our whole relationship - \n\nLast week after work she told me she was going out for a drink, usually she’d be home fairly early so I waited around for her to come back home for dinner which we do together pretty much every night unless something else pre-arranged. I didn’t contact her expecting her home at any time, then got a message at 930pm that night from her telling me she’s just about to go out for dinner with her new boss and some random team members. I asked her why I’m only finding this out this late. She immediately got defensive with me for questioning where she was. She came home an hour or so later drunk and pissed off with me for questioning where she was. Told me that I apparently have an issue with her success in her new job (this couldn’t be further from the truth) and stopped talking to me for the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext morning when I questioned her about it, she told me as part of her new job, it will require her being out late during the week on short notice (this is 100% not the case - this is her choice, her job is a 9-5, non customer facing role). This week she had a pre-planned dinner with her new boss and team. Because of the blow-up we just had, she said she’d come home straight after dinner. Dinner was at 6, so I expected to at least hear from her sometime around 8ish I guess. it got to 10pm and I was still annoyed from the Thursday night, so I messaged her asking her where she was and that I thought she was coming straight home. She got furious, came home an hour or so later and said that she will go out whenever she wants with whoever she wants and that I am controlling her - said that I had embarrassed her in from of her colleagues (not actually sure how my text message did that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left it till the morning just to make sure any alcohol had worn off, then tried talking to her about this and she said she doesn’t want to be in a relationship where she can’t go out with whoever/whenever she wants. That night, I tried talking to her again and she said she is not moving on this and then gave the example of if her boss is in from out of town and wants to have dinner with her, then she wants the freedom to do so without asking me if it’s OK. Up until that point her boss had never even crossed my mind as a possible cause of the change in her behaviour. I have always trusted her completely, but thought this was strange. She had mentioned in the past about the girls thinking he’s good looking etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext morning, same thing, and same example, wants to be able to have dinner/drinks with her boss when he’s in town. I haven’t questioned her about her boss at all as it is literally a brand new idea that he could be the cause of her change in behaviour. For the last 2 years, she’s never mentioned once about me being controlling. Now her stance is that I am completely controlling her. She said that I have to compromise on giving her the freedom to at any time without notice she can go out for dinner and/or drinks with anyone, and that I have to accept this or the relationship needs to end. I have told her that this to me is not acceptable behaviour and not the relationship I want to be in. I see it as being disrespectful and that we are in a committed relationship and I deserve to be with someone that respects our relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really do love her more than anything and want to make this work. This is completely out of left field behaviour so it’s really throwing me. At the same time, I feel I am definitely within my rights thinking her request is not acceptable. I don’t want a set a precedent of letting it go and have her out for all hours without any regard to our relationship. She has suggested we go to relationship counselling which is maybe a good sign, but it is very clear that she is not going to compromise, so not sure how that will go, but can give it a shot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion is, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I haven’t mentioned anything to her about her boss other than to ask why she keeps using that as her main example. I don’t want her to think I now have trust issues (on top of being controlling). I really didn’t think I did, but her behaviour is completely abnormal and her refusal to talk about it is really messing with my head. It’s really shit, can’t sleep at the moment thinking that our relationship is now (out of nowhere) looking like it could end unless I agree to something that I just don’t think is a reasonable demand and probably just drawing out the pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: Girlfriend (with whom I am in a committed relationship) has had sudden change in behaviour and wants now to be able to go for dinner and/or drinks any night of the week on short notice with anyone she chooses. With her genuine friends, every now and then I’m OK, but want to know I’m the priority. With random new people I don’t know, I’m not OK with this. - am I being controlling?",

April 2nd comes along, and they come back to Twitter, making a ‘coming back’ Tweet as if nothing happened.\n\nNobody seemed to be mad... until someone else (we’ll call them Sah) started saying stuff like “this tweet is disrespectful to people with anxiety” and “this tweet is disrespectful to people might have lost someone after a tweet like this”.

      "description": "So this guy, Daniel we'll call him, is a pretty chill dude in school. He and I are in the same sports club, and we talk a lot.\n\nOne day, while changing clothes in the locker room, I accidentally saw him opening his Tumblr account on his phone. Discreetly.\n\n I shouldn't have done it, but out of curiosity, I searched for his Tumblr username... and found out that he's a furry. He posts in these cringey asterisks, uses a lot of text emojis and shit, hell he even posted a lot of selfies of himself wearing those furry costumes. He covered half of his face in those photos, but I swear to God I could've recognized him even if he only showed his fucking eyebrow. Some photos were borderline NSFW, paired with very overt descriptions I wished I have never fuckinh read. I felt like my eyes were tainted.\n\nNow Daniel was a super normal guy on the outside, and showed absolutely no indication that he was a furry, at all. He's pretty charismatic, and we have tons of mutual friends. I wasn't even supposed to know these stuff but my stupid ass had to look them up. I can't look at him in the eye anymore, and my skin crawls when I think how different he is with his furry persona.\n\nObviously, he doesn't want people knowing about his secret, and I can't/don't want to confront him about it. I've read enough of his posts to know that he'll probably have a breakdown if he knows that I know. I just- I try to avoid him because I just can't accept it. I know that's what he likes, but I can't control my feelings. It's super awkward. He and the people around us are starting to notice my behavior towards him. I don't plan to out him, but I'm thinking if I should just ghost him instead and just let things between us fade.\n\nMe and my dumbass curiousity. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Sorry for the length of this post and the formatting. I'm on mobile. There's a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo the other night I ordered takeout through a food ordering a delivery app. I put the other through and paid on my card. I got confirmation that it will be here within an hour. Now this is a bit of a long wait, seeing as the place I'm ordering from isn't very far away and when I've previously ordered from there had the food delivered within 30-45 minutes.\n\nI just bit the bullet and said fine I'll just wait that little bit longer. So the hour passed and no sign of my food. I'm pretty hungry at this stage and constantly checking my window for the guy. 20 minutes pass and I'm starving and getting a bit annoyed. I go to the app as they have a live chat support if something goes wrong with your order.\n\nI start talking to the representative and explain the situation. He says he'll get in touch with delivery service and see what's the hold up. He then tells me the food is 2 minutes away and sorry for the wait.\n\n5 minutes pass and still nothing. I'm still in touch with the rep about my order because I was fearful it would be cold when it gets here. Another half an hour passed and I'm now incredibly annoyed by the situation. I didn't get mad at the representative because it isn't his job and not his fault of course.\n\nSo now nearly 2 hours since my order, I get a knock on the door. Now here's the strange part, the guy is wearing a completely different uniform from a rival service I ordered from. Like not even close. So I get my food and ask why did it take so long. The guy seemed really confused about this saying he just got this order. I didn't want to lose my temper so I just took my food from him and went inside.\n\nNow the food wasn't freezing cold or anything but it was nowhere near as hot as I've gotten it previously. I still have the representative on the chatline and I tell him the food is okay but I'm really not happy about the situation. I then tell him that the guy who delivered it to me wasn't wearing the company uniform but the other companies uniform. The representative apologizes to me saying this shouldn't happen and we're very sorry, take this discount code as an apology and such. I just want to preface and say I wasn't actively trying to get anyone fired.\n\nI get a call a couple of minutes later from the service. I pick up the phone but I can instantly hear in the background, he's getting sacked no doubt about it, he's not going to be working here anymore. I don't think they realized I had picked up and then they started talking to me, offering apologies and saying that this was unacceptable.\n\nI told my brother about what happened and he said it was a bit of a dick move for what I did but I only got in touch because it was taking so long and I had already paid for my food.\n\nTL;DR: Ordered and paid for food from a delivery service app and food arrived an hour late and was delivered by a guy from a different company. Got in contact with a representative about it and accidentally heard the driver who was supposed to deliver my food seems to be getting fired.",

      "description": "So a while back my mom found a mother cat with a bunch of kittens in her shed. She decided to adopt out and asked me if I wanted one. She mentioned that she saved the chill, shy one for me. \n\nWhen I was growing up our family had a cat and she was amazing. Totally made me a cat person.  She was super independent, spent the day outside and kept to herself inside mostly while at the same time being SUPER friendly and affectionate. Also rarely meowed.\n\nI also happen to have a cat door at the place I live and think the property is cat heaven because it’s in the wilderness (fenced in so it’s pretty safe) and other tenants have had cats that adore the property as well. \n\nSo I think it over and decide sure, why not. \n\nWell... I’ve had this cat (who is less than a year old) now for about 2-3 months and it’s been a learning experience. \n\nThis cat is nothing like the one I had growing up. I can put up with him ruining things and making a mess around his litter box... But This is the most needy, poorly behaved cat I’ve ever known. He meows INCESSANTLY if he’s not getting attention. And every day at 4 am starts to meow (he always has food) because he wants to play. I’m pretty sleep deprived constantly because of it. He is timid about the outdoors (again I’ve never known a cat to not want to be outside over inside). But recently has been going out more and more. But always comes back after 30 min or so. \n\nMy hands and even parts of my face are covered in scratches because of his preference to play indoors rather then outdoors. He is not a stereotypical independent cat at all. \n\nI was honestly imagining a scenario where I let him out during the day after feeding him, and then greeting him and letting him inside when I get home from work with more food. Typical cat petting and purring and then he goes to sleep. Rinse and repeat. This hasn’t been the case at ALL. \n\nHe’s cute, and sure I love the bastard and wouldn’t put him in a shelter, but I don’t think our personalities are a good fit. I’d probably adopt him out after reviewing somebody from Craigslist etc. or just return him to my mom. \n\nSo AITA?",

She showed them her ring and said shes taken, and really I'm more asking am I an asshole in general? Does wanting to fight a man who flirts with your fiance and tells her that a ring isn't important asshole behavior or is it understandable and alright?

      "description": "Some context: Things have been tough with my (30F) boyfriend (30M) for the last several months. We’ve been together nearly 2.5 years and currently live together. He’s working on a 7-week job halfway across the country right now. He’s been there 2.5 weeks and won’t turn till the end of March. We haven’t talked much because he’s been working and then he was sick and then we had a fight on Sunday over the phone. I’ve been contemplating breaking things off for a while, so I have been more distant, guarded, and cooler lately. I still think he’ll be surprised because we’ve gone through a lot of shit together and I’ve never even threatened to break up with him in the past (but it would have been understandable if I did). This man has a lot of baggage and for a while it was fine, but nothing is improving and I’m calling it. \n\nThe thing is, though, would it be more of an asshole move to break up with him while he’s away at a mentally and physically job or fake it for another month and drop it on him when he gets home? \n\nThe other piece of the puzzle is our lease ends March 31, which is 5 days after he gets home. We could go month to month after that, but I don’t think either of us wants that. I love him and do care deeply about him, so I honestly would be fine to pack up his stuff to be ready to move when he gets home, or have it in storage already depending on what housing I find for myself. I just want to do this as painlessly as possible. \n\n*TLDR: After 2.5 yrs of supporting my boyfriend, I’m throwing in the towel. But do I break up over the phone while he’s away on an exhausting job for another 5 weeks or do I drop it all on him when he gets home?*",

He immediately handed it over to a friend, and I never got it back. But whatever, it was a pencil. I lent him my charger a week ago, and at the end of class, he and another friend start lying and saying that it’s their’s, and try to rip it out of my hand. I managed to hang onto it, but I vowed to not trust Jacob with my stuff.\n\nFlash forward to today. I bring my charger to class, Jacob asks for it. I gave him a hard no (ngl, it felt REALLY good to turn him down). He got pissed, demanded I let him use it, verbally berated me and threatened to cut my cord next time I saw it. I held fast and he pissed off eventually after a few more threats and accusing me of being a racist. \n\nI don’t believe I’m an asshole here in the slightest. Here’s where it gets tricky, though.\n\nOne of his friends (we’ll call her Jackie) walks up halfway through the period and asks for it. I turn her down, and that’s that, right?\n\nWrong.\n\n10 minutes till the end of class, and she comes back. She asks for it again, and I refuse, saying i’m charging it. She demands to know what percentage I’m at (40~%) and says her’s is dead and to “stop being like this” and let her use it. I refuse again, mostly out of the fear that she’s going to hand it off to Jacob and I won’t see it again.\n\nShe storms off, and I later overheard her complaining that her parents were going to beat her ass (she often talks about how her parents are hardasses and physically abuse her). \n\nAITA for allowing this to happen, especially when the girl hadn’t done anything wrong herself?￼",

      "description": "To start of this story I had just gotten out of the ER after staying in it for 2 days for mental health issues. It was also the day before the new school year started. My best friend at the time (Ryan) called me when I got home and asked if his girlfriend (let’s call her B) could stay with me for the night. His parents wouldn’t let a girl stay over but B really needed a place to stay as her parents were abusing her. The girl B was staying with before kicked B out as well so B was basically going to have to sleep outside. I said that of course she could come over as long as she let me rest. I still wasn’t feeling very well and I was sore from the IV I got at the ER. I picked up B from Ryan’s house and took her to my house. (My mom wasn’t home as shes a flight attendant and is never home). I had meet B before but only at parties or when she was with Ryan. I let her shower and borrow some clean clothes for the first day of school the following day. In the morning I took her to school and even bought her lunch. She told me that she still didn’t have a place to stay and asked if she could stay a couple more nights until she either went home to her abusive parents or found another persons house to crash at. I let her stay two more nights when I started to lose it. She started to act like she lived at my houses. She worse my cloths with out asking, took showers when ever she wanted and even moved things around in the guest bedroom she was staying in. I had even given her an old phone to use and school supplies, she never said thank you once to me. She also borrowed my prom dress , with out asking, to wear on a date with Ryan. The breaking point for me was when she told me ,not asked, me if I could drive her to Ryan’s house and then to her house to pick up some of her things. I was still dealing with my mental heath issues and I still hadn’t healed physically all the way. At this point her three day stay and turned into a week and my mom was heading home. I finally broke down told her I wasn’t her Uber and told her to get out. I told her to call Ryan and that she needed to leave. I needed space and I couldn’t support her anymore. This really impacted my friendship with Ryan as he thinks I’m an asshole now and now B won’t even talk to me. Am I an asshole for kicking an abused girl out? ",

I'm happy to cook, I love cooking the only thing is I'm a vegetarian. His parents know that and have made some rude remarks about it, but I mainly brush it off.\n\nAnyway last time I went to dinner at his place they knew I was vegetarian and did not make a single dish that had no meat. I thought at first that they had possibly forgotten about it and I juat sort of picked through the meal. They brought it up at the table and they started placing pressure on me saying, \"Come on teenage_whore, we made it especially for you\". I finally gave in, but I still hate that I let in to it.\n\nSo for dinner at my house, I printed out a menu and gave it to my BF [15M] asking him if, the menu would look Ok. He showed it to his family and according to him until I show a menu with \"real food\" then they're not going. I really want them to like me, but this would piss them off.\n\nI still somewhat spite them for last dinner with them, and want to show them how it feels.\n\nSo WIBTA, for lying to them about the menu and surprising them with a different meal?",

Cop said he would let me know.\n\nCome first week in February I had heard nothing, so send email and call officer. Nothing.

IA calls the next day, cop calls the next, he is yelling at me because \"IA is for serious shit, they think this is ridiculous, etc\".\n\nI got my phone calls and emails returned, am now scheduled for the March court date, etc. Cop is pretty pissed since he has a complaint in his record and he helped me out getting the bike etc. So it worked in terms of turning the bureaucracy but seems to have damaged a cop who actually was really nice until he went awol.\n\nI'm not unsympathetic to the ridiculousness of contacting IA over a recovered bike, but when I asked him what he proposed I should have done instead his response was \"be patient\".

      "title": "AITA for pushing my girlfriend to go further sexually after promising not to.",
      "description": "Context: Around a week ago, my girlfriend and I met up and she was in a 'weird mood' (her words). She told me that she didn't really want to do anything sexual that day, and, despite that, I kept trying to ask her and push her towards doing sexual things. Obviously I was the asshole in this situation and I have no doubt in my mind about this. There are more details, but the important takeaway is that I didn't respect her desire to not engage with what I was wanting during that moment. As I touched her I kept asking if she was okay with it, because deep down inside I knew that she wasn't really into it, and so I kept asking her whether she is okay with this or not and she kept saying that she was fine with it, and eventually she said that she wasn't and I immediately stopped right before any clothes were removed. I realized that what I did was wrong, as I was aware the entire time that she was not into the experience despite the mixed signals, and I apologized to her, to which she was so unbelievably amazing, forgiving, and understanding that I was taken aback. She instantly forgave me and told me that she doesn't blame me for anything. Because of this, I made a special promise to her that I will make it my absolute priority to never, ever do anything like what I did that day ever again, and told her that I owe it to her to uphold that promise because of how well she has treated me (I would have made this promise even if she had not been as forgiving, obviously, but because of how understanding she was I made sure to tell her about how much I owe her and how much I appreciate her kindness).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, after this, a similar situation happened again. The exact details of what we were doing aren't important, but I was pleasuring her and it was very obvious that she was extremely into it and was having potentially the most enjoyable sexual feelings of her lifetime. We took a short break, and I asked if she wants to go further (e.g. do something sexual which we haven't done yet - we are working our way up towards 'more' sexual things, going from shirt to skin, feeling to seeing, etc. We are both Christians and do not wish to have sex before marriage), and she said that she wants to, not now, but in a month's time, as she isn't ready yet. I asked her if she wants to go further in another way, and she said that she will want to soon, but that she isn't ready to do that yet. She then said that we can move to the next level tomorrow, instead of in a month. I then asked if we can go further in a very small way just quickly today before we take the bigger jump tomorrow, and she said okay. We did, and it ended up going much further than just what I suggested as the small thing, and it was in every way a positive experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, I asked my girlfriend whether I had broken the special promise that I had made to her - the promise that I owed it to her to keep. She told me that I hadn't at all because she said yes, but I said that I feel like I have, because she said no multiple times, and each time I asked her if she was sure and if there is no possibility that she doesn't want to do something else. While ultimately there was no harm caused by my actions, I believe that I may have violated a trust with my girlfriend. She had not thought about / realized that I have possibly broken my promise until I brought this up to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I realized this, I immediately thought that I am the asshole. However, the idea that I kept to the spirit of the promise, just not the exact wording of the promise, came to my head quickly; in the first example, it had a strong feeling that she did not want to continue, despite her stating that she did. This feeling turned out to be correct. In the second example, I had a strong feeling that she did want to continue, despite her stating that she didn't. This feeling also turned out to be correct. Therefore, I kept the spirit of the promise - I did not put pressure on my girlfriend to go further sexually when I could tell that she did not want to - but I may have broken the wording of the promise. Both my girlfriend and I currently hold the opinion that I kept the spirit of the promise, and there is no dissent between us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason why I'm posting this here is because I am worried that I am a manipulator without being overtly aware of it. I feel like I am too controlling and manipulative over my girlfriend sometimes, and I worry that I brush these occurrences away via the means of mental gymnastics, as demonstrated in the paragraph above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for pushing my girlfriend to go further, breaking the promise I made, or am I in the right, as I kept to the spirit of the promise and did not try to make her do anything that I knew that she did not want to do? Also, is my justification of my actions an example of manipulation, or is it simply a legitimate way of thinking about a situation in which I was not quite at fault?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: my girlfriend knows that I am posting this because I am worried that I am manipulative, and she will be reading the comments too.

      "description": "My good friend moved into my apartment recently and he has been making a lot of changes in the name of “de-cluttering” the place. Most of what he has done I agree with but others seem unnecessary and seem to be more about him wanting to re-arrange the space how he would prefer. \n\nThis afternoon I returned from work and my roomba, which has resided in an out of the way corner of the living room, had been unplugged and placed in a pile of junk in a closet. My roommate claims seeing it in the living room makes the room seem cluttered and the wires required to charge it makes things look messy (it’s under a desk).\n\nMeanwhile the living room has a bunch of his electronics and kettle bells laying around in it. It just seems to me that he doesn’t mind “clutter” as long the cluttered items are his...\n\nWhere the roomba used to be was pretty convenient for using it to clean our living room floor because I could just activate it from its charger and it would dock itself after it was done.\n\nRoommate wants me to keep it in the closet as opposed to the living room but there isn’t enough floor space or a reachable outlet for it in there. Plus it kind of defeats the convenience of being able to let the roomba do its thing having to retrieve it every time I want to clean up.\n\nAITA for wanting to keep my roomba in the living room where I use it?",

      "description": "Okay, so. My best friend (the bride) is getting married in June and asked me to be her maid of honour. Of course, part of that is planning the bachelorette party, and the hardest part of THAT task is coordinating schedules among other adult women. When I asked my bestie for a  guest list, she said \"bridal party only\". Well, two of the bridesmaids are Bride's nieces... But not their mom, who isn't Bride's sister, but actually her ex-sister-in-law (SIL going forward). (Long story short, bride's brother effed off to the other side of the state, got another woman pregnant, THEN divorced SIL who is still treated like family by Bride's parents. Brother has no further bearing in the story; Bride doesn't even want him at the wedding.)\n\nSo I set off to call SIL and find out when their father has visitation in early June so I can plan a date for the party. Her response was, \"But aren't I invited too?\" I told her that Bride had given me a list of people to get for the party, and it was for the bridal party only per her wishes. I could tell SIL was upset at that point, and she said she'd have to check a calendar and call me back.\n\nThis was three days ago. I've heard nothing back. And then today I learned that first, SIL went to Bride's mom crying because she wasn't invited and pitched a fit. Then, about two hours ago, Bride texted me saying that she went ahead and asked SIL to be a bridesmaid, partly because one of the previous ones dropped out and Bride needs four maids to balance the groom's party.\n\nSo I guess tomorrow I'm going to try to reach out to SIL for Attempt #2 to coordinate with her. 🙄",

      "description": "My cousin and I have always been incredibly close. We do everything together and pretty much hang out all the time. I moved away to college and that has kind of changed our relationship as she’s still in high school. She and her boyfriend have been together for a year now. \n\n\nRecently, I’ve noticed that she tends to blow me off to hang out with him. I usually don’t mind if they had plans before I came home. I wouldn’t even mind if he came to hang out with us too. Lately though even if we do have plans she blows us off to be with him (not just me her other friends too).  We could be out to dinner or hanging with friends and she’ll suddenly leave to go be with him. \n\nThe biggest instance was that she and I planned to attend a party. It was a party we had been planning to go to for months. We’d bought matching outfits (it was a pajama party) and made sure to clear our work schedules to have that night off. Before I came home we both made sure to have no other plans. The night of the party, I got dressed and hung out in the living room watching Netflix. I was waiting for her to get off work so that she could get ready. We weren’t trying to be early so she still had time. \n\nOnce she comes home, she sits on the couch and complains that she has nothing to wear. I was confused by this and asked her about the pajamas we ordered. She revealed that she didn’t even get them. I wasn’t so angry at that because she’s in high school and we can’t always afford everything. So I suggest a different pair of pajamas that she already had. She says it’s not for that. That she and her boyfriend have a date in an hour. I thought that was weird since the party was in an hour. So I asked her how was she going on a date and we had the party. This party that I didn’t know anyone else at and that she was so excited to go to.\n\nShe says that she and her boyfriend made plans two days ago to go out tonight. That they were going to the movies and out to dinner. Okay, this left me with no one to attend that party with because I didn’t want to go alone. So I sit and watch as she gets dressed for this date and leaves. I consider waiting until their date is over &amp;  still attending the tail end of the party with her. I check Snapchat and she and her boyfriend are in fact not at the movies but at an arcade that’s far from where we live. I thought it would make me seem jealous if I kept bringing up the fact that she blows me off so I attended the party anyways. I didn’t want to make her feel bad but also felt bad myself.  \n\nSo every time since then she’s suggested to hang out I’ve declined. I try not to be passive aggressive when it comes to telling her why. Even her best friend has stopped hanging out with her because of the constant blowing off.\n\nAITA for no longer wanting to hang out with her ? \n",

I honestly liked it at first, but now it's just sad. In all honesty I'd rather just masterbate as it's the same amount of gratification. When I try and open up about it she gets defensive and the \"ok let's get this over with\" vibe. I know she loves me, she always wants to sit on my lap, give me kisses, snuggle, long hugs,  ect. Ect. I love that, but I want more to our physical relationship. \n\nSo now when I crave it I just keep it inside. For days at a time, I'm not angry, or passive, just... silent. She believes I'm in deep thought. Though I know of I bring it up, it'll just be more of the same reaction. \n\nTL;DR I hide the fact I'm disappointed in the lack of sex with my gf of 10 years, it's hard to make time, but dammit I want the time!

We've had our ups and downs as with all relationships, but it's been mostly up, and we really enjoy the time we spend together. As our two year anniversary approaches, the topic of us moving in together has come up. We are both excited about the prospect, but there is one major sticking point. She wants us to have separate bedrooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says she needs as much space as possible to sprawl out in order to get a good night's sleep. To be fair to her, I know this to be the case. Sleepovers have been rare in our relationship, and the next morning she always makes some off-hand comment along the lines of \"\\[yawn\\], oh, Im just so tired today\" or \"I really did not sleep well last night.\" It's never the best night sleep for me either, but right now, both of us have full-sized beds. I have offered to buy us a king-size mattress if we move in together, but she still insists that won't be enough space, and we should have separate bedrooms. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day, the topic came up again, and I told her it was non-negotiable for me that we sleep in the same bed if we move in together. I've always looked forward to the day I move in with a significant other cause I love the idea of waking up next to a beautiful girl everyday. Maybe that makes me old-fashioned, but it's something I really want at some point in my life. I told her I'd be willing to buy a pull-out sofa for the living room where I could sleep on nights where getting a good night's rest was really important for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she kinda snapped and asked me \"why is it such a big deal to me?\" and told me I was being selfish and not compromising enough. This kinda hurt me because I feel I do a lot of compromising in the relationship, which I told her. She said I was asking her to compromise on something vitally important to her mental health, and I was being an asshole. We patched things up later that night but the bed issue remains unresolved...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be frank, I think she's being a little dramatic about it, and a king size bed will be more than enough space for us to both get a comfortable night's sleep. If I really felt it would be detrimental to her, I would be fine with separate bedrooms, but most couples sleep in the same bed, and it works out so I'm sure she would adjust. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo tell me jury of my peers, am I the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "A lot of details here I can’t get into for length but the short of it is my SO has in the past taking advantage of going out and staying out very late without keeping me in the loop. The behavior wasn’t purposely done to be inconsiderate, but there is a history in our relationship of them prioritizing their job, friends, and family over us. \n\nIt’s hard to sit at home and go to sleep without knowing that someone you care about is ok. I finally had enough of the stress after a bigger fight and we agreed that together we would establish a time that they would be home by so I can be eased. The home by time isn’t dictated by myself, they’ll usually suggest it based on whatever the outing is and I’ll agree. Seems to be reasonable to me. You let people know when you’ll meet them or what time you’ll stop over so letting them also know what time you’re leaving seems to be along the same vein. \n\nWell, during the recent outing they were having a good time and wanted to stay out later and passively were dancing around saying so in a text, with the goal of getting me to suggest they stay out later. I didn’t. They got back on the dot of the agreed upon time so all good but I was a bit annoyed that they tried to guilt trip me into saying they should stay out later so I brought it up. \n\nThree hours of fighting later and I’m be accused of everything under the sun as well as be controlling and how other people in relationships don’t have to let their SOs know what time they’ll be back by, etc, etc.\n\nI think most other people do let their SOs know around what time they’ll be home by. To me it doesn’t matter what other people do in their relationships anyway. Maybe they don’t, but maybe they haven’t had issues in their relationship where one person is constantly taking advantage of the others time and not being made to feel like a priority. \n\nI made it clear to them that I don’t even like doing this as it makes me feel like I’m monitoring their comings and goings but if we don’t try something, they’ll continue to take advantage without self awareness or admission. \n\nIn an ideal world, after a pattern of times of sticking to coming home at the agreed upon time then we could drop it as it would prove t me that a change behavior has been made and we can go back to simply that they’ll be back whenever they’re done.\n\nI don’t know. I already know that ITA when you look at the basics of it. That it looks like I’m telling them when they have to be home by. But like I said, there’s a history there of taking advantage of my time and the importance of this relationship getting equal priority as the other important things in life; family, friends, job. \n\nSo let me have it. If IATA then I need called out. Do most couples not give each other general times they’ll back from being out at planned events? I’m not talking about food shopping or anything unpredictable but more like a work get together. To me, if we agreed upon a time it’s up to the person that’s out to keep their word as best as they can and not let peers pressure them into breaking that promise. ",

The boy who’s offered her to move in works with her and furthermore he used to be obsessed with her (about 2 months ago) I’m talking she told him she liked dominos cookies once and he sent 15 boxes to her house without her knowing. He’s also tried to get her multiple times on work night outs and she’s politely rejected him. He’s now said he’s moved on but I’m not sure to believe him or not. I trust her enough to not cheat etc but I’m just not so comfortable with her moving in with him.",

      "description": "Me [18M] and a university colleague [24F] were hooking up after some months of consistent chatter on text messages and in campus. We eventually started taking each other more seriously and what started as a FWB type of thing adopted a more commited nature and we kicked it off (at least in my opinion) pretty well. \n\nIn January she had to exit university and start working at an office job as she was only there to improve grades and had already finished the classes in themselves. We said we'd give it a shot and keep trying even though we both knew it was harder for both of us to keep such a fragile flicker of a relationship alight even in distance relationship. We both seemed to be on the same page and even though her life was a complicated mess due to legal issues with her family and the fact that she had a 2 year old son, I kinda told myself to make an effort to see if I could pull anything out of this relationship, against most odds.\n\nAfter work started, she started growing distant almost immediately, I tried to calmly figure out why and she just said that it was hard for her to imagine me being in an environment she's not in anymore and it's hard to continue being herself with me as it filled her with sadness that we weren't physically together anymore, and work had her exhausted. To that, I just responded I understood and would not want from her any time more than what she could give me, as long as she was still the same, and not to stress it as we had agreed to meet on weekends and anytime we could, when she indeed had time. This exchange seemed to me to be pretty healthy and she kind of grew closer for 2-3 days before growing distant again, but I just told myself she was tired and needed her own space and let it be for a while. \n\nAnyway, fast forward about a month of speaking for maybe 15 minutes a day via text and although we agreed to meet everytime we had the possibility, every single weekend she had something important to do or there wasn't enough time for anything. She briefly mentioned she was troubled one night and I tried to seize on that opportunity to get any new type of insight on where we were standing and she just closed on me. At this point our arguments were starting to grow more frequent as I was starting to feel like she wasn't really into this relationship to begin with, and I admit I was maybe brash during this period of time, as I have a short temper naturally and maybe didn't handle the \"conversations\" in the most ideal manner.\n\nOn a Thursday, I gave the idea that I could catch a train and walk to her house (I don't have a driver's license yet) during her lunch break just to give her a kiss and leave her to it on the next day, see each other and kill a bit of the missing. She said it was a good idea but she had to confirm on her schedule. She then proceeded to never mention it again, and as I was sick of being the one to invite her and mention meeting I waited to see if it would ever surface again, be it in confirmation or denial. She never addressed it again. I made a test not to mention meeting in the weekend to see if she would take initiative and ask about being together and again, not only did she not mention it, she spent the entirety of Saturday \"with her family\" and basically didn't message me at all, not even to say if everything was alright. I let it ride until Sunday and despite her going to a popular traditional party in my immediate neighborhood (I could get there walking in 5 minutes) she neglected to tell me she was close-by the entire day, disappearing from morning to noon without a word, despite her supposed hype to meet me whenever she could, again with the pretext she was with her family. I've been with her son before so I wouldn't say that's a problem, I actually really like the little fella and we play around just fine.\n\nAnyway on that Sunday night, when she told me she was in my vicinity and never took a shot to meet, I was close to snapping, but tried to keep it cool and probe where exactly was all this strangeness coming from, which I really didn't expect at all from her. To me we always kind of clicked and got along really nicely. At this point, conversation never really worked with her, talking was impossible and she would generally just ignore the subject I was bringing up and pounce on some term I used that she could attack or would just resort to the \"hms\" and the \"okays\". So as I was trying to work this through with her and showing the discontented state I was in, she just said she felt tired and was going to bed (at 21:30). At that point I snapped and broke everything off, and I also said some pretty mean things in the process.\n\nAm I the asshole? Was any of this justified? Should I have waited longer? I feel like I handled it with relative calm and comprehension, especially before it started to fatigue me. I know the age gap between us may have played a huge part, but if she was unwilling to give it a shot wouldn't she just have cut it off when she was leaving? Why lead me on? Was I only an option when she could have me physically? She always had a kid and her family was doing really well, even with all the legal stress. What could I have done differently? I feel like an asshole for breaking it off so abruptly, especially at a time when she was supposedly so vulnerable, but I really felt like she was purposefully avoiding our relationship, and ended it all in a sorrow state.\n\nTL;DR: younger man gets involved with older woman before she starts to work and he breaks up on a fit of maybe unjustifiable rage",

      "description": "Hi all,\n\nSo this has been eating away at my conscience for years and this happened about 10 years ago when I was 8. My mom was living with my stepdad  and we lived in Arizona. A year before that, my stepdad sent us away to my grandma's house for no reason at all, but my mom saw some dating sites in his cousin's computer history, so she accused him of \"cheating\" on her with girls on the internet. Well, the next year my mom and I went on a little \"trip\" to Mississippi because that's where we were originally from. Well, my mom completely lied to my stepdad about what happened when we got there. About a month prior to us going to MS my mom met this guy on Myspace named \"Mike\" but my mom wanted to keep him a secret so made me refer to Mike as \"him\". When we got to MS she sold her engagement ring to a pawn shop and then we went to Mike's place and I honestly thought he was gonna be my new dad. Mike and my mom would spend most of the day in the bedroom doing god knows what in there while I would be in the living room playing Tony Hawk's American wasteland all day. Well, it didn't work out the way mom thought and we ended up going back to my stepdad. She completely lied to him and even said she \"lost\" the ring and was with her friend over there and he actually believes it still. Now, I would let this stay buried, but almost ANY time they get into some sort of argument (usually my mom screaming at my stepdad while he tries his best to ignore her) she ALWAYS mentions how he \"cheated\" on her because of the online stuff and she still has NEVER told him the truth. It really boils my blood and I don't know what to do",

This semester the school places me in this course (they place you in classes and you can request to switch with the admin once the schedule is released) and honestly, it’s the biggest load of shit ever. \n\nThe professor has only held 3 regular sessions, he has canceled last minute and scheduled make ups for the other ones. Oh. And he’s cancelled all the make-ups as well. At this point, I’ve literally only seen him once because I myself was absent (within school policy for absences). This week he did it again. Cancelling regular time class, rescheduling to a different day, and cancelling that one last minute. \n\nI got fed up and emailed the school requesting that I be able to drop this course and take another one next quarter since I have payed for a full course and should actually be able to fucking have a class. I really empathize and understand that personal issues have stopped the professor from being in class, but I find this level of behavior to be extremely unprofessional. \n\nI still feel bad because he seems like a good teacher, and I don’t even know if they’ll accept my request or if I’ll have to take it higher up (it’s a pretty small school so  it’s actually literally right upstairs). But I’m paying for this and should actually benefit, right? He hasn’t assigned a SINGLE project or given any instructions whatsoever. Just basically talked about what the course is “supposed to be” and not actually taught anything. Honestly, I’m just so fucking frustrated. He goes on and on about us needing to make an effort, yet he is doing zero on his part. I’m exhausted. There’s literally only 2 classes left before the end of the semester, and I just think it’s bullshit I’ve had to pay for this. \n\n\nI’m just wondering, AITA? Should I just shut up and sit through it cause he’s the teacher and it’s up to him? Am I a jerk for calling him out and requesting more professionalism from the school? ",

      "description": "I work at a hookah house that has live concerts everyday it opens. When there are bands playing, it is really hard to talk normally, so we usually go for the mouth-to-ear conversation when taking requests from customers.\nOne of the things that we do is provide an additional coffee table with a hookah if there are none available, they are not heavy but it is a pain to carry since there are no gripping points and hookah vases can be easily broken.\nSo this one time my colleague asks me to open way through the crowd so she can take the additional hookah to where it needs to be.\nAs usual to live concerts, there is no way you're going to ask everyone in front of you to give space so you can pass.\nSo I start creating room by putting my arms through an space and pushing to the side (I didn't shove anyone, just made sure that they recognized me). \nAfter I \"pushed\" one lady that didn't even took the eyes from the stage, just moved to the side, one man puts the hand on my shoulder and starts telling me that I should say \"excuse me\" before \"pushing\" people. To me it sounded as an absurdity as there is no possible way that I'm going to go to everyone's ear and ask for room while my partner is carrying a hookah.\nI just say \"yeah yeah right\" and turn my back.\n\nAITA for going through the crowd like that? AITA for giving that response to that man or was he just trying to white knight a talk with the girl?\n\nTl;dr : Customer scolds me for not saying \"excuse me\" as I went through a crowd during a live concert. \n",

I can't handle it andevery time I come over I just have to say something. He says \"I'm a guest and you should criticise other people's houses and I should just leave\" I'm not Trying to be rude I just don't understand how he can live like this and I think its a huge problem he should address. \n\nI'm pretty sure it hasn't been cleaned since his mum died a few years ago and he lives here with his autistic brother, so some mess is excusable. However it is literaly a crack house with no crack, I woke up after we had an argument about it last night with a baby cockroach on the pillow.  I can't walk around the house with bare feet becaude theyll get covered in dirt, I won't even mention the toilet.\n\nI spennt the first night here in ages hoping I could deal to see him but I can't. Yeah I could just not come here but then I wouldn't see him as often and he whines about spending too much time at my house. Really I'm just baffled that he doesn't think this is a problem and that I'm being rude by bringing it up. \n\nTbh Im pretty sure I'm NTA but just prove it to him I hope.\n\nTLDR: boyfriends house is gross as fuck I can't stay here and he has an argument with me for criticising it because he thinks it's rude.

      "description": "One of my best friends and I became part of a new friend group last year. She began 'dating' one of the guys in this group halfway through last year, although I use that term loosely because they didn't really like each other, according to her it was all just a bunch of sex she did not enjoy. They broke up because they just didn't see the relationship going anywhere. She isn't his biggest fan as he can often be quite cringey, being a stereotypical horny guy in his 20s who works out, only talks about job-related things, and didn't really know how to make my friend get off when they were together. A few times she has been so annoyed by this guy just existing that she wanted to 'kill him on the spot'. Personally, I don't mind the guy, he's just there. If he talks to me, I'll chat with him for a while and overall not have a terrible time. I really don't think he's that bad of a guy. In the end, he's part of the group and I think we should be accepting of him. Let's call this guy F.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, cut to my birthday this Wednesday. I had decided, that with him being part of the group, I should invite him as I had invited everyone else and I hate excluding people. He asked if he could bring over a friend (female) and I told him that sure, it wasn't an issue. Later on in the night, my friend pulled me aside and asked me if she could bring over her other ex, let's call him J.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow. I really dislike J. The guy makes me uncomfortable, he has made my friend cry, belittled her, invalidated her feelings, and overall been an asshole to her. She used to really like him and after not talking for a long while, they have begun reconnecting. Although this doesn't really make me very happy, it's not my place to judge her and I have told her that I will support her as long as she knows what she's getting into. Then again, this does not mean I wanted J at my party. At all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her she couldn't tell J to come over and then she brought up the fact that I had invited F. She was upset about this, and did not understand why I had invited him and yet did not want to have J over. I told her that J stresses me out, he makes me uncomfortable, and I just don't want him at my birthday party. Whereas with F, I have no issue with, he is part of our friend group, and I had never seen her cry over him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe told me that F made her incredibly uncomfortable, there were things about their relationship I don't know about, I had even let him bring a female friend along, and that I hadn't asked her about whether or not it was okay for me to invite him to my party. She said all this with tears in her eyes, which honestly made me feel like shit, and in the end, after everything, when I told her that I had no reason to exclude F from a gathering where everyone else would go to, she told me, \"what about the fact that I'm your friend?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?

      "description": "For as long as I can remember, my brother has been a giant pain in the ass to our family.  I'm not sure exactly what is wrong with him, but he is prone to emotionally abusive behavior, dramatic outbursts, and other toxic behaviors including (but not limited to) gaslighting,  screaming,  and property damage. He has, in the past few years, admitted he has a mental health problem. He says he has been diagnosed with moderate PTSD from his childhood. Our father was an alcoholic and my mother has bipolar disorder.  \n\nOver the past 10 years he has gotten married, divorced, dropped out of college 3 times, had 2 children,  physically abused his wife, lost at least 3 decent jobs,  ruined a plethora of vehicles... all while moving back in with our mother, who he does NOT get along with.  The two are horrible for one another. \n\nThings came to a head today between my mom and brother. He put a hole in the wall of the house she rents and has spent all day berating her. When I called him to confront him about it, he went on a tirade about how bad I treat him and how horrible I am since I got out of poverty. I was willing to let it go, but then he started saying how much he wishes I would die and goes on to say many insulting things about my wife. \n\nSo, I decided I'm tired of his shit. I called my mom back and said I will pay for any eviction paperwork she wants. His ex wife and children also live there because their home got caved in by a tree falling in there. If she goes through with the eviction, he is most likely going to become homeless. \n\nAITA?",

I dont want my wife or our future baby to go through arguments during the pregnancy since I didn't want to complicate things in our relationship and then it getting even worse.\n    So a couple hours before the time came I told my wife that it was not happening and long story short I apologized and hoped for the best and she told me she was really exited that she was really looking forward to it and for me to just say no at the last minute was heartbreaking...

A couple months after I turned thirteen, I started working some neighborhood jobs so that I could afford to buy (almost) every instrument of the orchestra and maybe find some online courses to learn. I want(ed) to be a composer for video games and movies, and orchestral music is good for those. I thought it would be a good idea to record them for approval, so I would want the instruments and the skill to play them for that purpose.\n\nI completed my collection around my 16th birthday. I found some courses online that I paid for with leftover money and took a year to learn all the instruments. When I was satisfied with my ability to play these instruments, I recorded some music I composed while I was still collecting.\n\nI turned 18 recently and my adoptive parents want me to leave my instruments at home for their biological kids (who, by the way, have NO interest in playing an instrument. They've told me before. They've said stuff like, \"I think its really cool that you can create music and play all those instruments, but that's not really my thing even though mom and dad want me to play an instrument.\"). They want me to leave them so that the kids will have \"a wide variety\" to choose from. \n\nI don't want to leave the instruments, and I want to tell them I refuse.\n\nWIBTA for making this decision?",

The people ended up contacting me and I went to meet them, only one dog which I was kind of bummed as I don’t make much money on single dog homes. \n\nI’m chronically ill and this is the only job I’ve been able to pay my bills, there is a camp near me that is specifically for chronically ill kids and is completely free of charge, I went last year and it was so fun! However this is my last year I’m able to go due to my age. I come to find out the dates of the camp is the exact dates the client had booked me. I had a tough decision and talked to my family about it and they agreed I should not miss my last year of camp. \n\nThe clients had booked the dates about 3 months in advance, when I messaged them it was about 2 months to the dates they needed. So I let them know I would not be able to do the original dates and offered a 50% discount for their next booking (which leaves me to make 0 money since it is a 1 dog household) \n\nHis reply was \n“This puts us in a very bad situation, I thought we had that date locked in. We also had you booked for the (other dates) please disregard that as well”\n\nThen a couple days later he sends me another message \n“Considering you didn’t give a reason for canceling over a month away I can only guess it is personal and not professional, either way I’m not going to wonder if you can make a date work for you. I need reliability so we will not be using your services” \n\nOuch it kinda hurts because I’m just a tiny business ran by just myself. Today I looked on next door and he had posted this message for all my neighbors. \n\n“So we contacted (my name) since several people here and elsewhere recommended her we booked her for a date over a month out and two weeks later she cancelled with no explanation and offered a 50% discount next time. Why would I try again when she could just cancel, we will not be using her services” \n\nI feel like he needs someone who is a robot and can say yes to every date he gives. Is that bad of me to say? \n\n(Note he continues to say I canceled only a month out when I know for sure it was two months as I canceled March 1 and their dates are the end of April) \n\nDo I need to give him an explanation ?  AITA for canceling for something personal? Did I handle this ok? Why do I feel so guilty?? \n\n",

      "description": "I don't live in the US but I've participated for the fifth time in the Reddit secret santa gift exchange. \n\nThis year I was matched with a girl from Michigan who indicated in her profile that she recently moved and liked baking. To save money on shipping from Europe I went on Amazon and chose baking tools for her to create one of my favorite baked goods, macarons. I chose a set of three stainless steel wire whisks, two high quality silicone baking mats with macarons template and a stainless steel bench scraper, totaling $29,40. Instead of paying additional money on express shipping I added two Amazon basics locking suction cup hooks for $1,68 to bring the total of the items over $30 and get free prime shipping. All items arrived on December 21.\n\nWith the gifts I sent her a five part note and in the post script I explained why the two peculiar but probably very useful hooks were amongst the items.\n\n\n\nHaving received her gifts on the 21st not only did she not wait till the 24th (rude! :O ) but she sends me the following note in gratitude:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KK3x0jN_d.jpg\n\n**\n\"While they did take my love for baking &amp; go with that, I feel like my secret Santa really did the bare minimum of gift giving (and that’s okay). What’s sad is that it’s people like this who ruin the spirit and meaning of secret Santa. Things like this aren’t supposed to be selfish. If you can’t afford the $30 minimum, don’t sign up. It’s the giving season and I took this whole thing really seriously. You shouldn’t only be in it for the gifts you receive. I’m thankful for what I got, but overall, disappointed in my secret Santa’s clear lack of enthusiasm and apparent selfishness.\"**\n\n\nI was hesitant to even participate this time after the disappointments in the last years. Having not received any gift myself in 2 out of the last 4 exchanges excluding this year where no gift has so far arrived, again...\n\n\nSo Reddit give it to me straight, am I the asshole for not spending more money on this Christmas gift for a total stranger?

      "description": "I live with my girlfriend and my brother. As we were all getting around, making our breakfast Sunday morning, my brother takes the coffee pot over to the sink to dump it because it is several days old. I'm not one to waste, and I don't mind drinking old coffee, so I say to him, \"Hey don't dump that, I'll drink it.\"\n\nWhen I said this to him, he was poised at the sink to dump it, but hadn't started yet. He looks me in the face, blankly, then starts to pour it out. So I say to him, just a little clearer in case he didn't hear me (unlikely), \"Hey, don't dump that, I'll drink it.\"\n\nHe stops and again, looks up at me, but this time with a look kind of like, I heard you the first time, but I don't care. So this time I say it again, with annoyance clear in my voice, --\"Don't dump that, I'll drink that.\"--\n\nAt this point my gf chimes in with, \"We have no idea how old that is, it's probably disgusting.\" So then my brother looks at me with a mix of annoyance and shut-up-I-know-what-I'm-doing. He began to pour.\n\nNow I really don't care how old the coffee is; I've brewed a pot on Monday, and finished it on Friday. As long as there's not mold in the grounds, I'm good. So I'm really okay with drinking this coffee. In fact, all of the static I'm getting over this coffee makes me want it just to prove a point.\n\nClearly irritated I say to my brother, somewhat shouting, \"Are you retarded!? I said, 'don't dump that I'll drink it!'\" With defiance abound he dumps the rest of the pot down the sink, all the while looking me in the eyes with a smug, take-that look.\n\nSo I began to berrate him, and clearly state my frustration as to why he dumped it, I was fine with drinking it, I didn't care how awful it may be, etcetera, etcetera. When my gf tells me to calm down, it's just old coffee.\n\nTL;DR: My brother dumped out old coffee that I told him I wanted several times, so I wigged on him, and my girlfriend told me to relax it's not a big deal. Was I the asshole?",

The guys is like 50 and drinks most of the time he is an alcoholic and I mean aren't you a little to old to be living with your daughter and son I law? I don't even feel comfortable in my one place and I hate that feeling. Also for context he drinks and goes from motel to motel when ever he lived with one of the other of his sons and daughter he would always get drunk and immediately go talk and start arguing with the mom call her names and stuff like that. He wanted to fight me once when I used to live in my other apartment and the mom lived with us because he was so coked out yet when confronted he didn't remember anything or was acting stupid. I personally don't want him there and don't know how to tell my wife right now he has no where to go but I feel like that isn't my problem the guys I to old to be acting like a dumb drunk teenager. No I can't have any of my family over or sibling because they feel uncomfortable as fuck. He said he was going to stop drinking probably do we could give him a chance to stay there but just started recently again even drank most of my beers -.-\n\n\nSo Am I The Asshole for not wanting my father in law to live with us because of all past and present issues and the fact that he shouldn't be my problem as he is a grown ass man?",

      "description": "So I've been working with my colleague for 4 years now and we used to get on great but as times gone by I've become conscious that even though we are meant to be equal, I do far more of the day to day work while he tends to spend his time doing extra projects and other work (which I would also much rather be doing). It's grown to the point where he will not do his actual job for weeks on end and I'm stuck covering for him. Over time he's spent less and less time doing his actual job to the point he doesn't seem to even consider it anymore.\n\nIt became extreme for a period of 5 months last year where our team was reduced to just the two of us. He'd barely help at all so I was tearing my hair out, doing what was meant to be a 4 person job largely alone while he was still signing up to do anything else and was rewarded with opportunities of trips and training. Yet if anyone mentioned anything to do with our job to him, he'd talk as if he was contributing. People seemed to have the impression that he was managing to do everything and he would be thanked for the extra work he was doing. \n\nI became upset and started complaining to him about it. As I thought we were friends I was hoping we could work together to resolve this ourselves but it just became worse from then and the next thing I know my mid year review stated that I have behaviour issues, am bad at working in a team and get stressed easily.\n\nWe then got a new manager and I ended up telling him what was going on and he tried to come up with ways to split the work up more equally but ultimately my colleague barely followed them. It's been months since then and he's helping a tiny bit more but it's still very unbalanced. \n\nI'm sick of this now and have started to kick off. Every one-to-one I have with my manager I end up complaining about my colleague. I've been doing less work in the hope it will force him to do some. Then recently I reported to senior management that my colleague hasn't signed off some reports I wrote months ago (one aspect of this job I can't do entirely on my own) and my colleague had to stay very late to get them done.\n\nI do feel guilty for complaining so much as it's not as if my colleague isn't working at all, he does work hard and frequently stays late. It's the balance between us and how we're treated by others that most upsets me. This has been going on for so long it's like I've developed a vendetta against him and I can barely help but have a go at him any chance I get. Genuinely all I wanted was for us to be a team, each do our share and be friends but it's like I've become obsessed with whether he's doing his job. He will barely talk to me anymore, our friendships pretty much dead.",

      "description": "I met this person, let's call her Chloe, on Discord. We arranged to meet up for a game trade and it was meant to be very short. I went over and she talked a lot about her personal life and current life, which was a bit of a mess. I kind of figured she just needed someone to vent with and while I was not expecting it, I just kind of rolled with it.\n\nChloe now thinks of me as a friend, while I consider her more of an acquaintance. We don't meet up outside of the game events much, but I have given her a few rides to events and such. I also know a fair amount of information about her personal life since she talks about it a lot.\n\nNow with the rest of the game group, she seems to have something if a reputation for cheating. It's caused people to not want to include her in the game events and deal with her directly because she'll give hacked items for legit ones. There's also been teasing and snide remarks made at her. Assuming that these items are indeed hacked, she's given me hacked items.\n\nShe's been messaging me for in game favors, but does not talk to me beyond that. So far I've been making excuses, but it's not really my style. I'm more of a 'this is what's going on and that's why I don't like/talk to you\" kind of person. On one hand she's never offended me personally, so telling her off for cheating and asking for favors seems out of line (I don't know if she really cheats or not, but it seems likely she does). On the other hand, avoiding her requests with vague excuses seems a bit double faced, which might be more douchy. \n\nFor context when I refer to cheating, I basically mean she manipulates the game to get rare in game items/things that I and most other people in the discord try to get organically. There's also a bit of \"I don't want to be associated with her and feel obligated to defend her to others\" feelings because a) she might be cheating and b) I don't want to be perceived as a cheat by association. B is a lesser issue since I have some rapport with people, though I wouldn't say I'm buddy buddy with everyone, I don't have beef with anyone. Chloe on the other hand, has had personal issues with some people in the group.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I told her directly that I no longer want her to associate with me in game because I heard she cheats and has traded hacked items with me? I feel like it can be, because it's partly based on rumors and speculation. However, the evidence certainly points that way and I'm also uncomfortable with how she only approaches me for favors now. \n\nBut I also feel like by not cutting things off earlier, I've led her to believe she has a friend in me and it can be tough to lose a friend, especially when the group is kind of against her. But on the other hand, I kind of feel like this was a disaster of her own making.",

      "description": "TLDR at the end.\n\nI’m a 17 year old girl, and I have been really close friends with this guy (17M) for about a year now. About a half year before we became friends, he started dating this girl who has a lot of issues, and she really isn’t particularly nice to him or me. Basically, she was controlling him, and would throw a fit if he spent any time with friends and only wanted to spend one on one time with him. she got really mad every time he talked to anyone but her.\n\nEssentially, last week, he dumped her, but during the breakup, he kept mentioning my name, so now she blames me for the breakup (even though i has nothing to do with it, because i told him not to break up with her). He was just mentioning me in stupid contexts, but still, damage was done.\n\nAnyways, I’ve been wanting to lose my virginity for a while, particularly to this guy because i trust him a lot and know he’s a good person. Plus, he’s very experienced, so I had a feeling it would be a good time, and I knew he also wanted to have sex with me. However, he told a couple people he wanted to fuck me, and she found out and got really mad and said he didn’t have a right to move on.\n\nRegardless, this guy came to a party with me yesterday night, and we had sex (and goddamn it was good). \n\nI kind of feel guilty because this girl is still not over this guy that I have now decided to engage in a sexual relationship with (purely sexual, no strings attached). However, she treated him really badly, and also was really mean to me. Besides, I feel like he has the right to move on!\n\nAnyways, am i the asshole?\n\n\nTLDR: this guy who is one of my best friends just dumped his bitchy girlfriend who was super controlling. we both expressed interest in having sex, and i lost my virginity to him last night. the ex gf is really mad that he is moving on. We want to continue engaging in sex, but i feel kind of guilty, but at the same time, i think this is a little fair and it’s ok to move on. Am I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "Got on the train on the way home, after rush hour, so all the seats were taken but it wasn't jam packed. I always wear a backpack and it's not that big, so I generally don't take it off. I'm standing and a woman gets on behind me. The woman was clearly irritated and kept giving me looks and grumbling, but I just ignored it because it's public transit and that's just the kind of shit people do. Eventually though, she tapped me on the shoulder and in the bitchiest voice imaginable said: \"Can you *PLEASE* remove your backpack.\" Okay, whatever Karen! Fuck off. You can just move, so I just ignore her. I haven't felt it hitting her, so I don't know what her problem is with it really other than just wanting to complain. She starts in again, asking me to take it off, and so I just snap back with \"When you lose 50 pounds you'll actually fit on the train.\" She was definitely overweight, and I'm not wrong that her whole body mass took up more space than me and my backpack. \n\nShe looks really stunned by this, and a guy in one of the seats tells me to fuck off, and I got off at the next stop because I didn't want to deal with it anymore. She was harassing me over this stupid backpack and I just defended myself. AITA? ",

We have clashing personalities which is fine, I'm not going to be mean to her simply because we don't get along. \n\nIn the UK we have a saying \"Don't dish it out if you can't take it\" meaning don't make fun of someone for banters sake if you can't take it back. \n\nSo we were at McDonald's and were enjoying our food, I didn't buy a lot like i usually do (I'm a big guy. 6'6 200+ lbs) as me and my GF were going to dinner later that night with her parents. \n\nMy GF's bestfriend buys a ton of food she's never going to finish including a 20 piece chicken McNugget box. As expected, she can't finish her food and asks me if I would like any of them. I politely decline, saying we're going for dinner with GF's parents later that day and I don't want to ruin my appetite. \n\nShe immediately starts going \"WEAK! THATS WEAK\" \n\nThere had been a few other exchanges earlier in that meal that had annoyed me, like her making fun of me for playing Dungeons and Dragons and talking down to me in a very childish tone. \n\nIt annoyed me to the point i may have over reacted and said \"You know what is WEAK!?

Watching TV or a movie is a different story but when we're in bed I want her to be focusing on me. \n\nI've asked her to stop many times because it makes me feel like she doesnt care about me or that she'd rather be on her phone than spend time with me. I've told her this and she tries her best but then sometimes she'll get a notification, look at it, and then get distracted with snapchat and start talking to her friends.\n\nI understand if it's time sensitive or important but I dont appreciate her just talking to other people. \n\nToday she jokingly said \"I'm going to go on my phone for 2 minutes and theres nothing you can do about it\" so I left and she got upset.\n\nDid I overreact? Is it too much to ask that she never goes on her phone when we're in bed? Maybe we should compromise in a way that I haven't thought of yet? Do most people go on their phones when they're in bed together and I'm just being weird?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated thanks in advanced.",

Come play. Come play\" \n\nRepeatedly in my best creep voice until she checked the closet.\n\nWhen she opened it I said.\n\n\"YOURE MINE BLPBLPBLPBLPBLPBLPBLP\"\n\nThe Blps were me making noises with my mouth.\n\nShe ran to get my mom who then threw the doll away and rebuked me.\n\nWell i retrieved the doll from the trash and saved it until my sister invited her friends over.\n\nI walked up to her window and started tapping on it. She thought i was in my room so she didnt know it was me.\n\nWhen she gets close I smash the doll against her window and say.\n\n\"YOU CANT GET RID OF ME BLPBLPBLPBLPBLP\"\n\nThis one freaked them both out pretty good.\n\nFinally I placed to doll over my face and ran into her room super fast yelling.\n\n\"I GOT A BODY NOW BLPBLPBLPBLPBLPBLP!\"\n\nShe threw a pillow at me and my dad took the doll away.

      "description": "So a little background: gf for about a year, just now meeting dad this weekend. He’s visiting and leaving tomorrow (Sunday) \n\nI go to school and live on campus about 45 minutes away from where my gf lives. I drive down every weekend to see her and once during the school week. Her dad came into town Wednesday and she wanted me to meet his this weekend. So I come down Friday night and meet him and we’re up pretty late. I’m kinda annoyed because we’ve been up watching movies and I work at 8am and have to drive 45 minutes back so I know I have to get up early. Her dad gets up to go to the store and she tells me he’s leaving Sunday and that after her plans we can hang out cause he won’t be here. So I’m like okay perfect I can have Saturday to myself. I had been needing to catch up on laundry and clean my room and just spend sometime with myself since I see her every weekend. I also wanted to go out with my friends because they always go out Saturday nights and I’m always with her on saturdays. We finally go to bed, of course slept through my alarm and was late (not a big deal) but I went to work and was done early. After I took a nap and woke up to her asking me what I was doing. She called and (jokingly) asked me when she was gonna see me today (Saturday) and I’m kind of hesitant to answer cause I thought I wasn’t coming back until Sunday. She is joking around saying she’s disappointed and usually she’ll stay on the phone with me forever. But I could hear how disappointed she was and she said she had nothing else to say and hung up. So after that I feel kinda bad. And she texts me saying it would mean a lot to her if I went to dinner with her and her dad tonight.  I just met him last night and I just don’t wanna be up watching movies all night like Friday because quite frankly I was pretty bored. And I wanna go out with my friends and have me time. AITA for not wanting to have dinner with her family on the last night her dad is here? ",

      "description": "So I work at a local news station and if you have no experience or knowledge of how the production side works all of our team has headphones with a mic on it so we can communicate to each other. The main purpose is to listen to the commands of the technical director, but as well as the Producer just in case he/she changes something in the show, which happens often. \n\nDuring the week I run the graphics of the show and video/packages and for the whole team it's KEY to listen to the director because he/she is telling us when what and where to run things. We also all chat during the show mostly during commercial but also sometimes during the show depending on the story, but we try to keep this to a minimal. \n\nHere's my issue: we have two producers, but one of them is super loud and doesn't stop talking. He/she was just moved to our show (I work mornings and he/she used to work nights) but everyone from night said he/she never shuts up. I have Thursday and Friday off and I play fortnite with some of the team and last Thursday our director said our Executive Producer came to drop some scrips but also said \"I am going to talk to ***** he/she needs to shut the fuck up.\" Well nothing has changed. Our director has a really low voice (he admits it), so I have to raise the volume of the headphones but it's still at reasonable Volume (12 of clock on the nob). It really hurts my ear when he/she gets into a conversation and raises his/her voice. I literally take my headphones off but I can only do it for a couple seconds cuz if not it's gonna affect to show. \n\nHe/she acknowledge it once when we were talking about something and I had to remove my headphones cuz it hurts and I told her \"Sometimes you kinda scream when you get into a conversation and it hurts and it's not necessary.\" She wasn't rude in her response but you could tell she was defensive when she says \"I don't scream.\" And I apologized and was \"I just meant you can be loud.\" She responded again in a defensive tone \"I don't talk loud. I project. I use my diaphragm, they teach you that in theater. \" I just turned around and rolled my eyes. In my head I was like \"bitch this ain't theater. We have mics for a reason, you don't have to project.\" To be real, he/she IS loud. \n\nI'm conflicted, cuz I hate when people go to a supervisor when it could be fixed by talking with the person directly. Also, the team also agrees with me that he/she is too loud but they are too nice and nonconfrontational. I also ask myself if I'm part of me wants to just go to the Executive Producer cuz I'm supper annoyed about this person but this person has a bit of history of being somewhat unreasonably stubborn. \n\nI have no issue with confrontation. I love debating and have no issue arguing but I don't want this person to have something against me. I don't want any awkwardness. \n\nSo AITA here for not talking to her a second time? ",

      "description": "Since Valentine’s Day was coming up I decided to give Tinder another try because I was ‘in the mood for love’ (terrible, I know). Usually I just set my profile preferences to women only, but this time around I decided to give mankind another chance and set it to both men and women. I’m not picky so I match with pretty much whoever’s in my age range and has at the very least a semi-interesting bio. \nI get talking to a few people, one of which being a very average looking white dude. I suggest going for a coffee date, when he asks me if I have an Instagram. I give him my handle, but he comes back unsatisfied when there are no pictures of myself on there. I ask why he needs more pictures. He tells me that I “look very different” in the pictures I have up. The only thing that changes in my pictures is my weight, as I had been going through very bad cycles of restriction and binging that year. I yo-yo between a healthy weight and slightly overweight- but overall I’m usually chubby, the kind of person you’d say looked “fine” and maybe even “you don’t need to go on a diet, you’re normal” which usually annoys me when I’m overweight because yes, I /do/ need to diet for the sake of my health. But that’s off topic.\nI jokingly write, “what, are you worried that I’m going to be fat haha” and make a few more jokes after that. He just says something along the lines of “yes”. \nThis stings a bit- he’s not too know that I struggle with disordered eating, but I end up lashing out at him. I’m kicking myself for not getting screenshots, but this was the general gist of the conversation: \nMe: Oh, well, I guess neither of us are going to find what we’re looking for. You’re looking for someone thin and I’m looking for someone with a better personality. \nHim: We’ve been talking for like five minutes, you don’t know my personality. \nMe: You’ve made it very clear that my weight was more important to you than getting to know me as a person, so I’m going to take a wild guess that you’re shallow. \nHim: Having preferences isn’t shallow. \nMe: (And this is where I probably took it too far, and was pretty hypocritical of me) Okay, sure. Having preferences isn’t shallow. So I won’t be shallow for saying that I definitely didn’t swipe left for your looks? You’re no stunner yourself. \nHe basically said fuck you and unmatched me. Am I the asshole? ",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to end a friendship because she won't stop talking about her deceased father?",
      "description": "Firstly I'd like to start by saying that I lost my mom 6 years ago. I understand that grief does crazy things, and is extremely hard to get over.\n\nI met \"Stacy\" 5 years ago through university. We bonded over losing a parent so young, and being the same age (her birthday is 3 days after mine). Her dad passed away when she was 16 of cancer, my mom when I was 20 of suicide.\n\nAt first it was amazing to be able to have someone who actually understood the pain, and we became very close. We were each other's support system. We cried together, shared memories. It was really nice.\n\nOver the next year of our friendship, I decided I wanted to go to therapy and began to deal with my grief. I didn't want to talk about it as much, and wanted to make new happy memories. Stacy on the other hand was obsessing over the loss of her dad. Every single time we got together she would bring him up, talking about how she had daddy issues now, how it's been (insert number of years) since he passed, ect.\n\nIn the beginning it was fine, she was so supportive of me and my sadness that I wanted to do the same. I would spend hours listening to her, offering support and sympathy. I suggested different types of therapy, and she would go for a month, complain it wasn't working, then stop. I suggested trying different hobbies, and she would pick something then stop halfway through. Every single time we got together it would turn into her spending the entire time talking about herself. This went on for 3 years. \n\nI tried bringing her into my friend group, thinking that meeting people would help, but everytime we would meet with new people, within minutes she was telling everyone about her dad and his death. She would hijack every conversation and turn it back to her. She has a naturally loud voice, so she would drown everyone out. After many nights of this, my friends stopped wanting to hangout if she was there. \n\nThis all came to a boiling point with my wedding.\n\nI had a small wedding, with just 2 bridesmaids. It was only her and my maid of honour. Now this wedding brought up a lot of emotion for me. It was hard going dress shopping without my mom. Everything wedding related seemed to be about mother and daughters. It was hard. But anytime I brought it up to her, she always turn the conversation back to how it was hard for her to watch me get married because I was lucky enough to have a dad to walk me down the aisle. She put zero effort into helping me or my Maid of honour with anything wedding related. At my bachelorette party she made it all about her and her lack of dad. I am still pretty hurt.\n\nI want to help her, but at this point I am exhausted. I don't know what else to do.\nAITA for wanting to end the friendship?\n",

      "description": "So I had a pair of Birkenstock’s that I wore literally every day. My best friend and I often share clothes/ shoes and sometimes she would ask to borrow my birks, which I had no problem with. A few months ago, she lost one of my shoes (idk how but she did). When she lost them (about 6 months ago) , she said “I’m so sorry I promise I’ll buy u a new pair” but since hasn’t done anything about it. We both are in high school and she has to pay for everything she has (food, gas, clothes, etc.). I feel bad for asking because I know she works a lot but doesn’t make a lot of money but they were my cherished shoes and I’m missing them a lot. I keep jokingly bringing it up to her and every time she says “I’m so broke!!!!” Which I know is somewhat true. Would I be an asshole if I kept asking her about it and made her buy me new shoes or should I just let it go? I don’t want to be a bitch and force her to buy me shoes but she lost them in the first place and hasn’t done anything about it. ",

      "description": "Background: was in a wreck and car was totaled. Husband and I are looking for a car equal to what we're getting back from insurance, but we took out an auto loan so we can get a replacement before our rental runs out. We'll pay it back when we have the payout. We found a car that met all our criteria, but it was two hours away. We called to set up an appointment for Saturday, but he said he expected the car to sell by then. So we made plans to go up yesterday after work. His website shows that he offers financing (important), so I called him back and told him we would be there by the time they close and that we already have financing through our bank so it would be a quick buy. He said okay.\n\nSo we drive two hours, look at the car, test drive, talk it over, and decide to buy it. I pull out the financing paperwork and he says he doesn't know how to do it. I told him it's straight forward and that I can email it to him. He said he doesn't work with banks. I pointed out that I told him on the phone that we financed through the bank, and he told me that he didn't hear that part and if he had, he would have told us not to come. So I asked why his website offers financing, and he said that he doesn't actually accept those applications. I asked if he would make an exception since we drove so far, and he said no because he didn't want to do the title work and wait for the money. He then made some snide comment about how it was obvious that we didn't have cash and it would go to someone else who does. So we left.\n\nI can't decide if I want to leave a review for him. On one hand, the car was in good shape and at a very good price. On the other hand, I feel like his website is misleading and he didn't handle the situation well when there was a misunderstanding. He claims he didn't hear me say anything about financing, but I has no reason to believe he dealt in cash only (nothing on his website indicated that).  If I left a review, it would be more of an \"FYI\" type deal, but I honestly can't decide if that would be helpful/appropriate or if it just makes me a bitter asshole. ",

      "description": "I’m on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nMy friend and I used to workout together, let’s call him Jim, for a few months when I first got my gym membership.  I pay about 20-25$ so that I can get special privileges including bringing a guest.  So Jim would come with me and we would do a workout.  I went about 5 times a week, he joined me for 2 or 3 of those times.\n\nThe problem came when my work schedule changed, I now get off around 6:20 and he gets off about an hour later.  When this change happened I started going without him, because if I don’t go right after work I won’t go at all.  Jim didn’t like that, he said I should wait for him to workout since he doesn’t have a membership and he was always my guest.\n\nNot only that, he doesn’t always bring a change of clothes with him, and I don’t want to waste an hour and a half of time to wait for him.  Going home would mean extra gas money if I just came back out for the workout.\n\nSo after we discussed all this I mentioned he should just get a gym membership.  Mind you he makes plenty of money in his current job, and the only things he has to pay for are his car payment and gas.  I don’t think it’s a big deal, but the way he talks about it makes me feel bad for not working out with him and I feel like the asshole in the conversation afterwards.\n\nI even think paying for your own membership is a good way to motivate yourself.  What do you guys think?  Am I in the wrong?",

      "description": "Alright so there's a lot to unpack here. About 4 years ago I (now 25F) met a guy (now 28M) we will call Gary. \n\nThere were a couple times while Gary and I were both single that he and I were friends with benefits. When I would cut off sex he would usually get salty about it and try to pressure me for sex.\n\nOne of the times I cut him off, Gary attempted to sexually assault me. I went no contact with him (because duh) in August 2017, and just started to talk to him again this month, March 2019. I told him repeatedly, I didn't forgive him and didn't trust him (duh). \n\nGary sincerely apologized for his behavior back then and I'm working on forgiveness (mostly for my own sake). I've been trying to better myself and forgive people from my past.\n\n2 weeks ago, he and I slept together again. I insisted he used a condom, but he wouldn't. I know I should have been more adamant about being safe, but I don't always make good decisions. He and I had sex a couple other times but we never discussed being exclusive.\n\nWell a couple nights ago, I made plans with a man, that I'm now pursuing romanticly. Gary asked me to come over and I declined, as I had plans. Gary tried to convince me to cancel to visit him instead. My interest was already with me, so I refused again. Gary seemed very upset, telling me that he didn't want to sleep with me if I was sleeping with other guys. There's nothing wrong with that, I just didn't like how he handled it.\n\nHe began saying that he wanted his things he left and that he didn't want to hang out anymore. He was very rude towards me about it. I offered to bring his things to him on my way to work, but he refused. He was adamant that he would come over and get them today, but then changed his mind last night, telling me to just bring his stuff to work. \n\nGary texted me tonight to ask to hang out. I told him no because I didn't like how he had acted. He said that I acted slutty and that he didn't approve of it. I feel as though I'm able to do what I want, since I've been being safe, using hormonal birth control and condoms. From my perspective, he was trying to slut shame me, and call me dirty, when he was the one who refused to use a condom. \n\nHe then claimed he didn't know I was active with other men, so I sent him a screenshot of our texts that said I was. Gary then changed his story, of course. I let him know that I felt like he had said we couldn't be friends. He wants to say that we can be friends, but I feel as though it's too much of a hassle. \n\nTL;DR - I have had a friend on and off for 4 years. He gets upset when I stop being his friend with benefits and pursue another man. I had cut contact for 19 months until just a few weeks ago. He has since slut shamed me, calling me dirty when he was the one who didn't like using condoms. I feel like it's not worth it to remain friends. \n\nWould I be the asshole for going no contact again when I was trying to forgive him? ",

These aren't their real names.\n\nSo, Claire and I have been best friends for almost eight years - we met at university and INSTANTLY hit it off, we both had extremely shitty (and eerily similar) childhoods and teen years and our moving to London for uni was an escape for both of us. It was one of those friendships which feel more like a familial connection - something I'd never experienced before and which was life changing for both of us. It was also one of those rare (in my experience) female friendships which don't involve any competition or one upmanship - we both saw each other at our worst moments, were genuinely happy for the others success, we'd chat whilst one of us was in the bath, talk about our poops, send eachother pictures of our ingrowing hairs - it was magical and without inhibition and exactly what we both needed and wanted and had been missing all our lives.\n\nWe lived together for a year and spent a lot of time together when we didn't. We talked almost daily. We saw each other through breakups, through drunken bad decisions - she saw me through a violent relationship; I saw her through finding her long lost family, hearing that her father had possibly committed a horrible crime, held her hand through an abortion aftermath on my bathroom floor... I loved her, and I still do, despite everything that's happened.\n\nSo, four years ago, Claire (who has chronic fatigue) was in a really shitty place with her mental health - she'd left her cheating boyfriend, but things hadn't really been going great for her since we graduated and she spent most of her time in bed in our shared flat, with me looking after her (she looked after me too - I have CPTSD - it was an equal thing). She'd recently made contact with her mother's sister in Australia, and one thing led to another and eventually the auntie invited her to move there. It was a big, emotional, difficult thing but she felt that it'd be a fresh start and possibly the answer to her problems. We talked long and hard about it and I encouraged her to do it - I wanted her to be happy even though I'd miss my mate.\n\nSo, Claire moved to Aus and I moved in with my partner at the time. Claire and I kept in touch with letters, text and Skype and although it wasn't the same we still had eachother. Her life took an upwards turn - a good job, a nice family for the first time in her life, a mother figure, the beautiful weather did wonders for her CF and she didn't relapse for the whole time she was there. I was so happy for her. After two years, my relationship had ended and I'd met my current partner and we were living together here in London. Claire hadn't been able to get sponsored for Australian citizenship and renew her visa and in the end she decided to move back to London with basically nothing - so I moved her into our house so she could get her shit together, find a place, get a job etc.\n\nOver the next six months or so once she moved out of ours, we moved her and all her stuff (she's a bit of an 'accumulator') from flat share to flat share. In the end we moved her four times - not a problem in the slightest, but yeah. It was a lot. During this time she also got pregnant by a guy she was seeing (who was lovely and treated her as she deserved to be treated, but was too boring for her and \"not good in bed\" - she consistently dates assholes, I get why, it's a self worth thing.) - she decided to get an abortion without telling the father, which I had some reservations about but it's her choice, her body, and not my place to critique once she'd made her choice.\n\nI don't drive, and my SO couldn't get time off work, so another friend of ours took her to the clinic, but long story short this friend is flaky and left her alone. Cue my and my SOs panicked attendance and subsequent taking her back home to ours where the whole gory expulsion took place - something went wrong, she lost consciousness at one point - basically the whole thing was a traumatic, bloody nightmare and one she ended up kind of regretting. She said that if she ever conceived again she'd keep the baby. \n\nThen, one morning only about three months later, she called me unusually early. I knew what it was before she spoke. She was pregnant again. She'd been sleeping with a guy she'd once dated, but broken it off with as he was *incredibly* immature for a guy in his thirties - this time it was just hook ups. For some reason (probably alcohol related) they'd not used a condom and there it was - a positive test. She asked me what the fuck she was going to do, and I said we'd do it together. She said she couldn't go through an abortion again, and that this time it felt different - she didn't feel like there was an alien inside her, but a living tiny human. I reassured her that it would be okay - she'd be a great mum - I'd be there - we could DO THIS THING. It wasn't a problem, it was a child. \n\nShe told Pete, and he promised to be supportive - he was excited, he'd always wanted to be a dad one day - something he reiterated to the point that Claire and I felt that he'd kinda wanted this, she started recalling him saying things about her \"child bearing hips\" and so on. Pretty creepy. But hey, he promised to support her financially and emotionally so I was happy about this, as was she.\n\nTime passed, and Pete didn't stay true to his word. He said he felt too \"uncomfortable\" keeping her company when she was having a tough time. He gave her £100... but that was it... in six months. He didn't want to go to anti-natal classes. He didn't want to attend a new fathers group. He did, however, promise to buy her a flat. So off they went to view the first flat - a kinda crappy one bed place above a takeaway shop. It turned out that Pete had zero idea about the cost of things - he'd never been a responsible adult, his mum paid for him and bailed him out and he even had a secret box of debts and bills and fines hidden under his bed. His business was fraudulent, his business partner was skimming the account to buy drugs, it was basically a shit show. Claire was hurt and furious, I was shocked and furious, Pete was stropping like the man child he is and Claire's belly was growing bigger by the week.\n\nObviously I stepped in. We took her shopping and I paid for pretty much everything. All the kit. The whole New Baby Package. I own a small business, but I'm by no means well off - but Claire was basically my sister and her baby was part of my family - that's just what you do. My lovely SO also put in a LOT of money, although they were only friends via me. We moved her into a new flat - a top floor nightmare of stairs but the best option for her at the time, directly across the road from the local hospital's maternity wing. I mention the money not because it's a big deal, but because of what happens later. \n\nSo she's now almost eight months pregnant, and Pete informs her that he's thinking of buying a fucking WEED FARM in fucking ZIMBABWE. Does she want to come with so he can see his kid?! Does she fuck... this is it. I see the beginning of the end. She's about to tell this piece of shit to shove his weed farm up his anus. Claire, my SO and I talk at length, we advise her to see herself as a single parent (my SO has a child himself), she agrees. We're all on the same page. I say that it'd be good if before he fucks off, Pete pays back my SO some of the money we've spent on his child. Claire AGREES. \n\nA couple of weeks pass, and Claire and I are having a three hour phonecall about the impending birth and the utter cuntishness of Pete. She's righteously angry and I make the analogy of Pete wanting a kid like a kid wants a puppy - he wants the baby, but none of the work or poop or sleepless nights. We're both laughing at the nightmare of it all and I've probably never felt closer to her. She says she might name  the kid my second name if they're a girl. It's a deep bonding moment. \n\nThe next day, over PM, I say that we could try to get some of the money out of Pete. She agrees. I say that she has enough on her plate, and maybe my SO and Pete could have a chat \"man to man, father to father\" as it were. She doesn't reply. For hours. As I said before, I've got PTSD and I am a ball of stress 99% of the time and my anxiety likes to tell me that everyone is pissed at me when they're likely not. I message saying that I'm sorry if that's a bad plan. She comes back saying \"No, it's fine I'm just working. I love you.\".\n\nOver the next 24 hours she's silent. Total radio silence. I ask her if she's okay and try to call - she's heavily pregnant I'm concerned. She then unleashes a barrage of anger. \"HOW DARE YOU INTERFERE IN MY LIFE AND MY PREGNANCY, HOW DARE YOU SUGGEST THAT YOUR PARTNER TALK TO PETE, IT'S NOT YOUR PLACE!!\" - I'm paraphrasing, but that's the gist. I'm gobsmacked and start apologising and explaining that I didn't want to interfere, just help take some of the burden off her shoulders. She's not having ANY of it and eventually tells me that she just needs some space. \n\nI'm so upset. It's horrible. I don't understand  what she thinks I was going to do - I have literally never given her any reason to think that I'm the kind of person to just wade in to someone's life or business and do shit without consent or permission. The space she needs turns in to a week. I drop messages periodically  (I used to message every morning throughout the pregnancy) just saying \"Hope you're okay today\", or \"Thinking of you, hope you're alright\", just positive things so she kno",

      "description": "I was out in town with 3 friends, I wasn't drinking (they were) so I brought my car. We all live in a rural area so public transport is pretty much not an option. I live pretty close to them so it wasn't really a problem dropping them home.\n\nGoing in was fine, found a place to park and went around to a few different pubs just chatting. They drank quite a good bit and were fairly intoxicated by the time we were going home, not stumbling around just clearly had lost any filter and weren't really making a lot of sense.\n\nOn the way home they were a bit \"giddy\" and started messing around with the radio, winding down the windows and putting the speaker to max volume. I wasn't really happy with this but they were drunk so telling them not to do it just made them do it even more since they found it hilarious.\n\nOne friend in particular was doing most of the messing (he was in the passenger seat), the other two were just laughing and rolling down the windows. When we were about halfway home (on country roads at this point) he started upping his antics, now he was turning on the hazard warning lights, reaching over and beeping the horn, turning off the headlights, etc. Pretty much any control he could reach he started fucking with.\n\nMe being completely sober was pretty pissed off at this because while there weren't any other cars around and I was on roads I knew very well I still could crash and there are a lot of deer in my area. I kept telling him to stop but he wasn't listening, the straw that broke the camels back was when he decided to pull the gear-stick out of gear (I drive a manual).\n\nAt this point I stopped on the side of the road and told him to get the fuck out and that I wasn't bringing him home anymore (We were still a few miles from his house). We argued for a bit but eventually he did get out and I drove off, he had to call someone else to come and collect him while he was standing on the side of the road.\n\nBoth him and the other two friends think I was a dick, and I shouldn't have just left him there, in the cold, in pitch darkness. I told them I was worried about crashing and their point of view was basically \"you're overreacting, you weren't going to crash...\" and \"you should have went back for him a few minutes later, he would have learned his lesson.\"\n\nAITA for leaving him on the side of the road?",

      "description": "I was a former reddit browser, but this subreddit inspired me to make an account to share my story, so bare with me if this looks shitty.\n\n\nMy roommates and I are high school juniors at a borading school. We've been besties since frshmen year, but this is the first year a three room dorm has opened up, and the previous two years they've roomed with each other, so this was a new experience for me. However, the past 5 months have been some of the worst months of my entire life, bar none.\n\n\nLet's start with my first roommate, who we'll call Louisa. Louisa, while one of my closest friends, has a glaring issue, being that she's a giant ho. This was something I was aware of in my 9th and 10th grade years but it wasn't until this year, when I was literally kept awake into the early morning from her having a different dude in the room like every night. And as if losing sleep over it isn't bad enough, if she gets caught in the act, she, my roommate, and I will all get in serious trouble for breaking the boarding policy. So I could face expulsion from the school over this shit.\n\nThen there's Victoria, perhaps the first friend I made at the boarding school. Victoria is super nice, and I love her to death, but I'll be damned of she isn't the biggest attention whore/drama queen/prima donna I've ever met. She needs all eyes on her, and have temper tantrums involving things being thrown across the room if they aren't; she has serious attachment issues, she'll get genuinely mad/jealous/petty if I hang out with a friend of mine from the basketball team; she storms into the room every day crying about a different thing every day, and half of the time it's so unrealistic I seriously doubt it happened; and to top it all off she'd be just like Louisa if not for the fact that she never gets in bed with any of the boys she talks to. She just crushes on them for a week, moves on to the next one, regrets that decision, I hear about it in her next temper tantrum, and she gets over it and moves on to the next boy in a long line of them. Every fucking week, without fail.\n\nI haven't been able to tolerate it, and no matter what I ask of them it doesn't ever stop. I have no idea how these two can tolerate living with each other for the past two years. But every night Victoria sleeps easy through Louisa's deeds, and every afternoon Louisa gives Victoria a shoulder ro cry on over what happened at school.\n\nThe past semester (and the first two weeks of this one), have been a literal hell. I love these girls to death, but I'll be damned if they aren't the worst roommates imaginable. So I requested to move to a solo room a couple doors down so I can rest easy. I didn't tell them until yesterday, and I moved into my new room today. They were horribly distraught, and were begging me to stay, because had been planning this all last year. Eventually though they gave up and cut me loose. Saying that I was a terrible roommate anyways because I was a slob.\n\nNow they had a point, my side of the room was easily the least cleaned area. However, they were also right in that it's exactly why I should be in a solo room, and they should too.\n\nAnyways reddit, that was my first post, so tell me. Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": " So I (22F) have been part of a friend group since freshman year of college, where I also made close friend A. I am a junior now. I have enjoyed our time in the past.\n\nHowever, there has been some drama, first with A, then the friend group.\n\nContext: last semester was personally very difficult for me. I cried in class on occasion, constantly had death anxiety/existentialist anxiety, pregnancy risk stress, and family problems. On top of it all, I have been experiencing constant fatigue. Basically just a shit storm that made me lose my resilience. I am faring better recently and finally found a therapist.\n\nHowever, when I was in the thick of it, I didn't want to hang out in a group as I found it draining and painful, preferring to be alone, alone with one friend at a time, or alone with my boyfriend. There were many times when I withdrew from hanging out (especially late nights), citing tiredness. Not always, but many.\n\nAt the same time, I reached out to A. When I disclosed how I felt (having had serious talks before), A assured me as best she could. Unfortunately, some of her phrasing came off as \"just get over it\", and some of the other small things she would say came off judgmental and made me feel a bit less connected to her.  Wanting to fix that, I called A and I blithely laid out the things that A had done that had made me feel shitty/uncomfortable. It was a bit unnatural to do over the phone,  and I sensed that I had crossed a line, so I went to go talk to her afterward, but I basically made her feel like shit, so we didn't talk for a couple of days until making up.\n\nHowever, after we made up, she told me that I should avoid addressing her any problems I had with her behavior directly in the future, since she isn't willing to filter if there's nothing overtly horrible being said. I agreed, and the rest of the semester passed by, albeit I was still confiding in her a lot, sometimes ranting for 3min, all I can say is that I was having trouble scheduling a proper therapist.\n\nFast forward to now. I have tried to hang out with the group, but although they seem to express interest, no one has follow through, and recently some of the friend group bailed on a dinner last minute. I've hung out with another friend in the group since, as 'backup' for having the others cancel. Most of us have packed schedules, but I am no exception.\n\nTo make matters worse, when I messaged A to complain, she told me off, citing all the times I had been absent last semester, quipped about my having a boyfriend, then added she didn't feel that close to me last semester herself. Don't know why she came at me like that since I felt like shit last semester and she knew that more than anyone.\n\nI could ignore it and pretend it's fine, but tbh I'm resentful of it all and can't address it, because A literally asked me not to.\n\nAITA if I decide not to prioritize them anymore?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "For a bit of backstory, I live in the UK where the age of consent is 16. My (hopefully still) friend (18M) is dating a girl (15F). \n\nAt first I had a big problem with this but eventually decided to move on and accept it as I truly love and care about my friend and would rather be his friend than lose him to this. \n\nThere hasn’t been any issues regarding this for a while until yesterday. \n\nSo the other day I saw a tweet from someone that said something along the lines of “if you’re 18+ and you want to date someone aged 14-16, please do as long as you treat them well”. Someone responded to this tweet saying “if you’re 18+ and you’re dating someone aged 14-16, you need serious help.” \n\nNow I must say that I genuinely didn’t even think about my friend at all when I saw this tweet and just thought it was a funny snarky response to what was kind of a ridiculous tweet. So I liked it. I liked the tweet. Not even thinking and probably at like 1 am while scrolling through hundreds of tweets but I still liked it.\n\n\nThat brings us to yesterday, when my friend sent me a screenshot of me liking the tweet saying “cool” and hasn’t responded to any of my messages or spoken to me since. \n\nHis girlfriend also messaged me calling me and asshole and saying that it really hurts to see someone she “used to be friends with” liking a tweet that basically calls her boyfriend a pedo. \n\nNow I know that liking the tweet was a stupid thing to do and I should have made the connection in my head beforehand, but is his reaction really warranted? \n\nI think this has effected me more because I’ve lost a lot of friends already this year due to some unfortunate events that were mostly out of my control. So I just don’t want to lose another friend due to something as trivial as liking a tweet. \n\nI’ve apologised sincerely and told them both that I never meant to upset them and that it was an honest mistake but they’re ignoring me.\n\nDo I just have to suck it up and lose another friend, or is there something I can do about this? \n\nAnd of course, am I the asshole?

      "description": "Throwaway, long time lurker, first time poster. Please forgive formatting issues as I am on mobile. TL;DR below.\n\nMy grandmother (and my sister) were basically the ones who raised me since my parents worked all the time. According to them, I was a really affectionate baby and would always hug/kiss/cling to my grandmother. Now, physical contact (16F) makes me kind of uncomfortable. I can only accept small tokens, like touching cheeks for a second with my dad, for example (comes up later) without feeling jittery. Thing is, she keep trying to pull me into hugs randomly or kiss whatever body part is available (cheek, hands, arms, legs when she lays down). Not like brushes, by the way like full on smacking, lasts for seconds, lowkey wet(?) kisses. I told her I loved her but could she please tone it down? \n\nShe didn’t take it well. She said that she spent years of her life raising me, taking me to school, teaching me how to swim and how to sing Chinese songs (we’re Chinese, so filial piety and all that, which factors in later). I don’t want to make it sound like she feels entitled to my affection because she doesn’t but she said that she’s getting old, doesn’t have time left and why do I not love her like I did when I was younger? She also brought up how I show affection with my dad and that I didn’t “show disgust whenever we (my father and I) touched.” I tried to say it wasn’t on the same level, but she didn’t listen to me.\n\nFast forward a bit, she told my dad. He told me that when he was busy, she took up the responsibility to raise me and I need to listen to what she wants. He also said how she was the oldest member of the family, she doesn’t have a lot of time left, etc etc and to just suck it up. \n\nI get that boundaries are a thing so it might look like I’m asking for validation, but in my culture it’s usually adults first, kids last and I’m the youngest in my family (closest one in age is 10 years). Now I’m thinking I should have just sucked it up and not said anything because like everyone keeps saying, she’s not going to be around forever. Obviously, I love her and I’m grateful she raised me well and did her best, but touching just makes me feel too off. \n\nTL;DR: Physical affection makes me uncomfortable, grandmother doesn’t like it when I tell her.

He has Parkinsons disease and has had it since aged just 39 (he is now 60) so as you can imagine he has progressively and gradually declined in health and these days he isn't really my dad anymore like we used to go fishing, football and bike rides. We did everything a father and his son would normally do. As time has gone on he has deteriorated and it has been hard to see him loose his capabilities he once had. \n\nSo bringing it to the present day, i have my own place and live with my girlfriend and i am finding it very difficult because she is wanting us to go round and see my mum dad and family etc but i have slowly started holding off as i cannot bear to see him so ill anymore and it is literally killing me and hurting so much.\n\nLike the other night we went round to have a take away meal and just chill but he couldn't eat his meal due to swallowing (parkinsons affects swallowing and muscles in throat) and he kept coughing and choking, and then after that where we used to have a couple of Drambuies or beers we get into the living room and he is passed out straight away just asleep all night. It hurts that much i just go to sleep myself and let my girlfriend sit up with my mum and chat.\n\nI simply am starting to take the stance of not going around nearly as much or avoiding it as much as i can to save my own mental well being but my dad is slowly withering away from a disease that has no cure and who am i to just stop visiting him, it seems so selfish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I asked my girlfriend what I should do because I was conflicted, I told her I know this is bad timing bc she just told be that she felt \"sketch\" about our relationship but I'm conflicted and I need your help. She was completely against it and was mad about how I just brought this up after saying I understand her issues about her. We argued that night and the next day, she broke up with me because she was not okay with me hanging out with my friend and I wasn't willing to essentially give up a friend for her.

He was quite intrusive and would always ask for my exact thoughts on things and people and him, he looked in my diaries when he came over to my house and insisted on reading them.\nEventually I noticed that he would shut off and would stop wanting to talk to me. He said that I should just be initiating conversations to switch him on. However after a while he became less talkative and one day I went to his house, a 2 hour journey for me, and we started playing video games. After a while we took a break and I tried to talk to him but he didn’t talk to me. I went back to playing, him just on his phone, and tried to talk with him every hour or so, and he would just shrug back at me. I ended up spending the whole day unable to talk to him, and most of the next day too. He then snapped out of it, by using all of his energy to become talkative, and said I hadn’t really initiated the conversation properly. Was he getting bored of me? I didn’t really know.\nAfter another couple of months we went on a preplanned holiday together. He seemed quite happy but could still be very untalkative at times. We spent a couple of weeks together and of course I might have gotten on his nerves.\nHe then came on holiday with me to my grandparent’s house. This time he was extremely untalkative. I woke up one morning and said hi and he didn’t say anything back.\nHe didn’t talk to me until after lunch, saying he was pissed off because he felt sick and I hadn’t asked him if he was ok.\nHe ended up coming to a close family wedding, where I tried to introduce him to some cousins. My family speaks a different language but he’s studied it intensely for about 5 years. He didn’t really talk to them, and didn’t dance or anything. So I’d introduced him to one other person who spoke English too, who ended up dancing with us quite a lot.\nBecause of that I spent most of the night dancing with my cousin and drinking and having a great time.\nHe didn’t talk to me for two full days after that.\nHe then started shouting at me for about half an hour about how I hadn’t introduced him properly or started conversations with him in them.\nHe said he forgave me but wouldn’t ever talk to me again if I did that to him.\nEventually we went back to school and things got started again. I didn’t really talk to him at all for a couple of weeks, realising I didn’t have any friends to fall back on at all. I spent those weeks finding a big group of friends and so did he.\nThen he started trying to talk to me. I went over to his room (boarding school) and he yelled at me again about re-evaluating our friendship.\nHis happened about 6 times over 2-3 weeks.\nEventually we sorted out an arrangement whereby we can hang out every now and then.\nHe then tells me he’s depressed at being so manipulative of me, and that he’ll kill himself if he can’t fix himself.\nI don’t know if he’s tying to get me close again...\nHe’s told me since that he’ll be sending his suicide note and last wishes to me...\nI’ve tried to cut contact again...\nAITA?",

      "description": "Here's my moral dilemma: Many friends of mine, upon getting accepted to a college they're willing to attend, post to social media to celebrate and collect applause from their peers. It's completely routine, but I have some reservations. \n\nTo me, posts like these seem a little self-indulgent. There's a fine line between letting people know what your plans are for next year and gloating to a thousand followers about the prestigious school that took you. (I understand that a certain amount of celebration is in order after such a difficult six months of applying to colleges, and I don't pretend to have a good solution). \n\nI also find that seeing a long list of Instagram posts about other peoples' college decisions can be a little depressing, particularly if your application season has been a series of rejections. December was like that for me (that's the early application season), but now that I've gotten accepted to some really competitive schools more recently, I'm concerned whether there are some ethical drawbacks to making my good fortune known.\n\nIf I do get around to posting to my social media about which schools have accepted me, WIBTA? Is everyone who does this TA?",

      "description": "This actually happened around 7 years ago but I've never forgotten about it and have felt guilty about it for years. I want to know once and for all if I was in the right or wrong. Please bear in mind I was 16 at the time and didn't know how to react, I'd react very differently if I was the person I am now.\n\nSo in high school there was this girl in my group of friends, who I'll call H.  We talked a lot but I just considered her \"one of the boys\" so to speak, and so I invited her to a lot of things I invited the rest of the guys to, such as boardgame nights, movie nights, bbqs, and sleepovers (my parents house had plenty of room so she got a room to herself). I'd also been to sleepovers at hers (which had a lot less room available) where we'd sleep in the same bed, but it wasn't just with me, there'd be another guy or girl in the bed too and nothing sexual ever happened. I didn't really think she felt anything for me in that way, just as I didn't feel anything for her in that way.\n\nShe'd always struggled with depression, abusing substances and self-harm as ways to escape it. I'd always supported her through this, but made her promise that if she ever felt like hurting herself or taking drugs, she'd first talk to me so I could help her through those struggles without her resorting to anything drastic. \n\nOne night we were watching a movie with the lads. I was lying with H on a bunk bed watching the movie. She'd always been a touchy-feely person, not just with me, but she was getting rather close during this session lying behind me. She then wrapped her arms around my middle and hugged me close with her head against my back. It was at this moment that I realized what she felt about me and was freaking out internally as she knew (at the time) I hated people touching my back and that combined with the realization made me feel very uncomfortable. We stayed like that for a few minutes, before I excused myself to get a glass of water. \n\nI can't remember much of what happened after but I know the next day she professed her feelings to me over text. I responded telling her that I valued her as a friend but I didn't see her that way. She didn't respond to that for about half a day but later texted me \"I broke her promise\" (meaning she had hurt herself) and I was freaking out at that point. I didn't know what I know now and didn't know how to deal with the situation. So I fled, metaphorically, from her and my friend group, didn't really talk with any of them for about a week, just went to classes and ignored everyone's messages. By the time I got back she'd left our friend group for her one.\n\nNow this is the part I really feel guilty about. My friend group were basically model students - we didn't drink much, we didn't party, we did our homework and assignments, and we didn't take drugs. We were all supportive of each other through thick and thin, and I'd basically been the reason she left this all behind.\n\nHer friend groups were basically the opposite of that. Toxic people who were constantly backstabbing each other - I'd taken flak on H's behalf defending her from their criticisms on more than one occasion. They skipped classes all the time, and abused drugs. H had returned to this friend group.\n\nI didn't talk to her again for about a year and a half but I kept hearing horrible things. When I saw her again she was basically a shell of the person I knew - she'd gotten in with some radicalized left wing groups and was doing hard drugs and not going to school. I've sinced graduated and am about to graduate University- I see her every now and then but life seems to have stagnated for her and she's still abusing substances, she hasn't gotten higher education and she flits between jobs and partners, not being able to hold down either.\n\nI feel tremendously guilty, as if I singled handedly fucked her life up. I feel like had I not panicked and ghosted her, I wouldn't have chased her out of a positive, supporting friend group and she wouldn't have fell in with the wrong crowd.\n\nTell me Reddit- am I the asshole?\n",

We switched numbers and that was that. \n\nA few hours later he texted me to make sure I was still okay with the plans.

I felt a little irritated by this and told him I had an old car that probably wouldn’t make it the hours drive out to the dunes. \n\nHe then responded telling me his friends have had stuff come up and that it would just be me and him, and that we could go out to eat somewhere in town instead. \n\nThis took me back, I didn’t agree to hang out with just him, especially not on a date. I responded and told him I wasn’t interested in dating at the moment and was grateful for the offer but would have to cancel meeting up. He said, “no problem!” But texted me the next day asking if I wanted to be his date to a school ball. I didn’t respond. \n\nThe next couple days in class I heard him talking angrily about how the girl he tried to ask out wasn’t straight forward and how he hates that girls just don’t say how they feel up front. \n\nAm I the asshole for not agreeing to go on a date with this guy after initially thinking it would be a group hanging out?

      "description": "Some context:\n\nOur group of 3 consisted of me, Lauren, and Megan. We all bought $100 tickets in October for a concert in March. \n\nLauren and Megan were friends before college. They're also roommates and live in a quad with two other girls. I just transferred to their college so I only knew them for a couple months at the time, but we're all decent friends. \n\nAnyways, Lauren and I get closer as the semester went on. We go on a few dates and were right on the brink of dating right as winter break hit. We talked about dating and decided revisit this conversation when second semester starts.\n\nSecond semester:\n\nLauren and one of her roommates, we'll call her, Sarah, start to become really close. Sarah doesnt like Megan, which starts brushing off on Lauren, and gets to the point where Lauren and the fourth roommate move out of the room. \n\nLauren starts acting indifferent towards my compliments/making plans in general. It gets to the point where she cancels plans with me and goes out to party with her Sarah and her roommates instead. Not cool. \n\nMe trying to make things work because I really like Lauren decide I'm gonna do something really nice for her for our date coming up (would've been our first date in a month in a half or so). So i buy her flowers, write a note. I get to her place and she says she cant do this anymore and that she lost feelings for me.\n\nAt this point, both Megan and I are on bad terms with Lauren, but Megan and I are still good friends with each other. Megan and I decide we don't want to go to the concert with Lauren. We tell Lauren that she can sell our tickets to whoever wants to go with her. A week passes. Lauren texts us that no one wants to buy our tickets and it's our responsibility to sell them. \n\nI ask Lauren what her plans are for the concert, and she says she plans on selling her ticket. I ask Megan if she wants to find a different third person to go to the concert with. Megan agrees that she does.\n\nMegan and I find a mutual friend who'd buy the ticket from Lauren. I text Lauren and tell her that Megan and I found someone who'd buy the ticket if she wants to sell the ticket to us. A few hours pass and I don't hear anything back from her.\n\nThen at 11pm I get a call from a number I dont recognize. I usually don't answer calls from random numbers. After rejecting the call 3 times, I get a message over Facebook from Lauren's sister-in-law (whom I've only met once) that just says \"Smh.\"\n\nA day passes and Lauren still didnt answer if she would sell the ticket to Megan and I. So I text her and ask again. She says she's pissed off about it, but she'll probably sell us the ticket.\n\ntl;dr: I tried to sell my ticket to my ex. She failed to find someone to go with her. I offered to buy my ex's ticket after she said she planned on selling it. My ex got pissed, and I got three calls and a text from her sister-in-law.",

      "description": "So, a little backstory. This story takes place years ago, but I still wanted to hear your opinion. so here we go. when I was in middle school, I was famous as being one of the singers in my school, my voice isn't the best, but, I love to put a twist on my \"performances\". Like, adding rap to a song that doesn't have any, adding some monologue to the song, etc. So you got the idea of what person I was. So, I was someone that is \"famous\" to my peers (not someone that is a grade below me, as that fact will be important).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, there was a small stage set up, in the cafeteria (mind you, that only a couple dozen of people is watching, since it was a small stage). Anyone could sing. Of course, I was intrigued. My friend challenged me to sing in front, but to sing for a girl that is with her friend (also a girl). I accepted his challenge and sang for her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, there was rumors that said that she was dating me. Of course most of my peers don't believe that and knew that it was only one of my \"performances\". But, for the ones that is a grade below me, knew nothing about it and thought it was the truth. I tracked down the girl and said my apologies, apparently the one that started the rumors is her friend beside her. her peers tormented the first girl for having an eccentric boyfriend. I was shocked (felt bad for her) and planed my revenge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was going to be a bigger stage setup in the middle of the schools ground for an upcoming bazaar and it is open to anyone (sure enough there is going to be more people there), of course I asked the staff beforehand if I could use the stage. Because of my reputation, I was allowed for a 15 minute performance. I asked the first girl if she could bring her friend (the one who spread the rumors), to the front of the crowd. She agreed and follows with the plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt D-day, I brought up the second girl to the stage and sang the song to her. Of course a lot of people saw this, and soon rumors spread like wildfire. I even asked a friend of mine that is famous below me to spread this rumor about her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, do you think i went overboard in this ?",

I know people like this guy, so that is why I always thought that this guy is probably just looking for younger girls to play with, so last week a friend that still is in touch with her told me that she posted his snapchat ID in her story and my friend share it to me, I gave it to another friend and asked her to try and figure out what this guy is really looking for. She added him, he said that he is taken and sent my friend a pic of my ex, my ex told him that she just wanted to be friends and wanted to found out who he was because she saw him in her related friends stuff to add, in 5 minutes the guy told her that the girl on the pic (my ex), wasn't really his gf, it was just a friend and he uses that pic because a lot of girls talk to him and he gets annoyed with all the girls that are trying to date him, then he started to flirt with my friend and told her she was cute, if she was single and all that. We have screenshots, this guy definitely doesn't love my ex, is lying to her and just wants to have sex with her, fortunately she lives in Madison and he lives in Texas.\n\nNow I don't know if I should tell her or not, I feel like this is not up to me but also I want her to be happy and not to be with a guy like this.",

      "description": "This may be a little long, I’m sorry! This is my first real post to any sub on Reddit after being a lurker for a long time.\nWIBTA? My bf (23) and I (22 f) have been dating for almost six years now. Two years ago, he decided to take a high-paying job with all kinds of great benefits; however, it is almost a two-hour drive away from where I currently live. He moved out there in order to be closer to the job. I did not harbor any negative feelings about this. I was sad, of course, and I still often am lonely without my best friend by my side, but this is what he decided he wanted to do so I offered my full support. I see him a couple times a month at best.\nThe plan has always been that I would move up there with him once I finished my Associate’s degrees at the community college I currently attend. I would transfer to a private online college in order to make this work and everything would be good. This has been the plan for the past two years, and we both have been getting pretty excited bc I’ll be graduating with my Associate’s degrees in June. I was planning on moving out to live with him in late June.\nI applied to transfer to six different colleges back in October, five of which are public state schools and the sixth is the previously mentioned private online school. My GPA is nothing spectacular (just a 2.8) and the state schools are all extremely competitive, so I had assumed I wouldn’t get into these five public schools. I had told my bf that I applied to these schools but that I didn’t plan on getting into any of them bc of my GPA. \nI was accepted into the online private college almost immediately after applying, as they basically take anyone who’ll pay them.\nToday, I got accepted into one of the public colleges I had applied to; one of the best public colleges in the state! I was extremely surprised and over the moon, as I have an “impacted major.” However, this school is fairly close to where I live now, which means I wouldn’t be able to move out to live with my bf as soon as we’d hoped.\nWhen I told him that I had been accepted, he congratulated me and was impressed, but when I told him I’m thinking about going there, he instantly seemed upset that I wouldn’t be moving in with him as quickly as planned. I do not blame him for this, as it’ll most likely take another year and a half to two years before I’d be able to move in with him. I’m trying to think of what’s best for my future career but AITA for not following through with our original plan? ",

      "description": "A little bit of context: before I really realized I was trans or that I was heavily depressed, I briefly fell into a group filled with channers and alt rights and cryptofascists. It was probably the darkest, most fucky time of my life. I was miserable, the people around me we're manipualtive and horrifying, and in general it caused a lot of trauma for me. Needless to say, with this I was exposed to a whole ton of channerspeak, which has become something of a sensitivity and an alarm raiser, even amongst people I know  I can trust absolutely. \n\nToday, while on Discord, I noticed I had someone blocked and I didn't recognize their name. I also couldn't find any sort of previous conversations with them in any way, and they didn't seem like they were too terrible a person. So I asked if maybe they had been under a different name before.\n\nThey asked why I was asking, and I told them it was because I had them blocked and I couldn't figure out why. They told me no, and also made a joke along the lines of \"block me harder daddy\" (which made me kinda uncomfortable, but whatever). I then unblocked them, at which point they made a post with \"kek\" in it.\n\nI mentioned that this was probably why I blocked them, as often it's a dogwhistle for really shitty people. I didn't go into my history because I didn't want to come off as needy or self-important and figured it would probably come off as a moodkiller.\n\nThey got very upset at me for saying this, saying they were nothing of the sort, and that they were most certainly much more far left than that, and that they'd never encountered more than a couple of channers who said it.\n\nWe've made up, however. We're on good terms, it turns out we share a bunch of servers, they know a bunch of my friends, and all of this is now water under the bridge, but I still wonder - was I the asshole for blocking them?",

      "description": "Sorry if I explain this horribly but hear me out—\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my girlfriend (19f) and I (19m) have been together for \\~4 years now. Both of us have always been on the chunky side, but never *fat.* Our stomachs never hang over our jeans, and we're fairly conscious about what we eat. Before we lived together, when I was 17/18 I would go to the gym regularly every day as a part of counseling, to try and improve my appearance and work on getting over severe social anxiety. I loved it, I'd just put in some headphones and watch Flash or something on Netflix while running. \n\nI got a new desk job when I turned 18, and I've been here since. A couple weeks after I got hired, I stopped going to the gym completely. Since then, I've been careful with what I eat as I knew to stop my normal workout routine would have some negative side effects. I sure as hell lost basically all my muscle mass, and put on about 10 pounds over a year+.\n\nBack at the beginning of this month, I began going to the gym regularly 4 days a week with a longtime friend of mine (19m). I never was into the idea of working out *with* someone, but for 9 years he's always been my anchor whenever I have to be in public, helping me leave or fix a situation where I'd likely make it worse or freak out. He basically helps me realize I'm not alone in this vast sea of people. And he's not really *out of shape,* I mean he's kinda pear-ish but he wants to improve his heart. He also doesn't really talk to many people unless they approach him first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince I've been going again, my lady friend has been constantly asking to go with me and getting upset whenever I say no. I've explained time and time again I don't want her to watch me work out, and to be 100% transparent, I'm not extremely comfortable in public with her. She's so friendly and loves talking to strangers, and I'm always just standing there avoiding eye contact or looking like an idiot. She knows I have issues, but she doesn't necessarily take them seriously.\n\nThe gym has always been the one place for me where I feel comfortable, and like I don't *have* to interact with a single soul except the front desk workers. This has been perfect for me. People pretend I don't exist, and I return the favor. It's *ideal.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo finally, **am I the asshole for not wanting to go to the gym with my girlfriend, because I'm afraid she'll bring unwanted attention to me?**",

He explains to me that the reason the restaurant is under new management is because the owner died and the author of the FB post is his son. So I just insulted the restaurant of the guys dead father. I respond to his message and explain my experience to him in and that I meant no ill will and that I would delete my comment.

      "description": "So I am an acquaintance with this person  (Female 14) that feels as if the world conspires against her in a way, which results in people picking on her, which, in turn, strengthens that feeling. She used to regularly talk with me for hours on end, sometimes very late at night, about her problems and I always attempt to help her with the best of my knowledge, but to no avail. Despite it, I decided to continue my communication with her to keep her company, but it was horribly messing me up mentally, causing me to have symptoms for depression and anxiety. On top of it all, I hang out with people that dislike her due to her negativity and often times advise me to stay away from her. I, at first decided, out of mania, to block any form of communication with her because of a small fake lie because I was afraid that if I took the time to explain it, I would’ve felt guilty, apologize, and go back to her. I still feel like shit for doing that to this day. I then apologized for my brash actions and told her the reason in full as to why I blocked her, while she states how I was helping her mentally and me breaking connections messed her up. Anyways, I didn’t talk to her much after that point, but whenever I did, it’s usually for an extended period of time and results in me being depressed for her. I decided to attempt to shut her out again, but this time, instead of blocking her out suddenly, I did it by not responding in ways that extend any further conversations such as throwaway words (cool, dang, etc) for any stories and neutral stances for any attempt at an agreement or a debate. This, in turn, disconnected me from her in a way that made it seem like she’s the one going away from me.\n I’m just wondering if that was the right thing to do in this situation, as I felt I was pretty immature, and, if possible, any better way to handle it. Also, most, if not all, of her friends shared similar personalities with her, making me one of the only people she hangs out with who didn’t share much in common in her and hung out with her in the same time. Speaking of which, she also often times attempt to communicate with people who make disliked her and made disparaging remarks about anything she did.",

      "description": "This happened yesterday and I wanted to see if I was being a jerk.\n\nContext/Background:\n\n* My wife and I have been married for a few years\n* She was previously engaged for several months but then her fiance called off the wedding, so she was never married to him\n* She had an engagement ring and they were in the middle of planning and had already put down some deposits on venues before he called it off (just to give an idea of how far along they were in the process)\n* Last bit of context. After we got married, she had some skin issues and couldn't wear her rings for a bit. Now she is able to wear her engagement ring that we bought together. However, not her wedding band.\n\nWith that out of the way. We are in the midst of moving and as part of that she came across her old engagement ring and wedding band from her previous fiance. She kept them, and her plan was to give the engagement ring to her daughter once she is 16yr old, so she was showing it to her.\n\nThe wedding band was also there and she said/asked: \n\"Oh, this is convenient. I haven't been able to wear my other band for a while now, would you be ok if I just wore this one instead?\"\n\nI was very taken aback by the question. It seemed like a weird question to ask if she could wear the wedding band that she was going to wear for her prior relationship vs ours. She could see the look on my face, so she back-tracked a bit and said: \"...orrrr maybe not\".\n\nI said something along the lines of, \"no, I wouldn't be comfortable with that and honestly, I can't believe you would even ask a question like that? What makes you think it would be ok? It was a really weird question to ask frankly\"\n\nSo yea, we had a fight about it. He point of view was:\n\n* She had never worn the ring at all, and hadn't even looked at it. It came with the engagement ring (a buy one get one free) and she doesn't place any emotional significance in the band. The engagement ring she does cause she did wear it. She said I was placing the emotional significance on it vs her. The ring is a complete non-item to her hence she was ok with wearing it now.\n* I tried to make the point that it was hard for me to separate the band from the previous relationship and the fact that it is called a \"wedding band\" not like, \"random trinket with no emotional significance\". Also, because I was so upset, I said, \"the question felt like you coming to be and saying, hey, is it ok if I sleep with someone else\". A bit of hyperbole on my part, but like I said, I felt upset and kind of betrayed.\n\nWe ultimately agreed that we will go buy her another band together. But she was still not getting that it was a weird question to ask. I know that I overreacted a bit with the whole, \"it was like you were asking me to sleep with someone\" but at the same time isn't it a weird question to ask? \n\nSo that's my question, WITA for getting upset by her question to wear the previous wedding band?",

      "description": "I’m on mobile btw\n\nMy maid of honor is my best friend and has been single. My SOs best man has a girlfriend but has been flirting with my friend or kept asking me if he had a chance. I got fed up and when my friend was staying over I had them chat. \n\nMy SO agrees on them trying out since he knows everything about the girlfriend. (She’s a gold digger who took money and hates it when he hangs out with my SO)\n\nShe stayed over for 3 days the first day was girls night and the next day we were invited to go see captain marvel with da boys. Later in the night was bonfire and we chatted playing truth or no comment. Or asking weird questions like if you were a dragon what dragon. It was a laughing fest they exchanged numbers next day best man invited us to go eat and hang out at his house. They bonded more and I notice the best man was like a guy who found out his crush liked them back.  They hit it off. I didn’t ask what happened but my friend came back blushing. I did ask her if I was pressuring her into dating him. \n\nShe said no because everything felt natural and if anything she had a new friend to hang out with.  \n\nI’m wondering if me and SO are assholes because when I asked his best man if he liked her he said he doesn’t think it was right but kept going along with it because he wanted to be happy.\n\nAdditional INFO: Maid of honor knows about his girlfriend. She sees it as two ways either it could be or just have a new friend. I only once left them by themselves because I needed medicine for a fever. The whole time best man been flirty. ",

      "description": "To add context, I am 27F, and my dad is 54M. Tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nSo my dad bought me a book as a random gift last year. I was touched because I'm a big book nerd, albeit a picky one, and my dad doesn't normally do stuff like this.\n\n Still, I was stoked because he gave me this big long spiel about how he heard about this book on the radio and he thought I'd like it, main character reminded him of me, etc. Nothing but nice stuff. I was touched, and put it on the top of my \"to read\" pile.\n\nThen... my younger brother got sick. He is fine now. But he was hospitalized and it caused my parents to be in the same room together (this is important because they hate each other and don't like speaking, but this forced them to be near each other and communicate.)\n\nApparently, I somehow came up in conversation somehow, and my mom mentioned the book to my dad, because I was so excited at the gesture, I told her about it. My dad then said \"Oh yeah, I bought her that book because the main character has anxiety and I thought it would help her get over it. She needs to.\"\n\nMy mom, puzzled by the difference between what I said vs. what my dad said, told me this. I was devastated. Apparently he said it in a way that had zero compassion regarding my anxiety and really stressed the whole \"get over it\" aspect.\n\nI'm a functioning adult with my anxiety under control. I work full time, have a fulfilling life, etc. But I do have some anxiety stemming from *family situations*. Anyway, I'm deeply hurt at his true intentions behind the book, to the point where I haven't touched it since he said that. I'm cleaning house, and I think I'm going to donate it. However, I know he is going to ask me about it in the future... and I don't know what to tell him.\n\nI have the feeling he will deny what my mom told me, citing their bad relationship, or he will just deny it saying she misunderstood. Either way, I believe my mom so I do think he said those things and meant them.\n\nSo... do I just say \"I didn't like it\"? Do I say \"I haven't got to it yet\"? Or do I say \"I got rid of it because you're a neanderthal\"?\n\nHelp!!\n\nTl;dr : Dad bought me a book for what I thought was a nice reason, found out he got it because he thinks it will help me \"get over\" my anxiety, and now I'm struggling if I should get rid of the offending literature. \n\nPS. Since I know I'll be asked this, the book was \"Turtles All the Way Down\" by John Green. It's a young adult novel.",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile. And this is quite long, I apologise. \n\nSo, my little brother is 15 and he and our dad fight a lot. Whilst my dad definitely has issues with anger, he's gotten a lot better over the years at controlling himself. My brother is super annoying, as most 15 year olds are, but he seems to go out of his way to not get along with our dad. He then talks shit about our dad a lot, saying that his life would be so much easier if he was there, etc. They have not gotten along for as long as I can remember. \n\nLike I said, my brother provokes my dad a lot. He does things he's been total countless times not to do, and any time he gets told off for something (which is often) he twists the situation to try and argue that it's not his fault, when it clearly is. I've had long discussions with my parents about it, and it's apparently something he's done since he was a toddler.\n\nHe and my dad often fight when my mum isn't home (she usually defuses situations), and it escalates quickly without her there - leading to my dad swearing at my brother and saying a lot of nasty stuff to him, and my brother refusing to back down or just accept that he made a mistake and move on.\n\nNow, I am NOT condoning my dad's behaviour. I hate it. However, it would not come to that if my brother was not an ass and if he just accepted that he did something wrong. If he just said 'yeah, I'm sorry, I'll try not to do that again' it would be fine, but he tries to make up excuses about why he did what he did so he can wriggle his way out of it, which never works.\n\nAnyway. When they fight, my brother often comes crying to me to try and protect him or take his side. I'm a 19 year old girl, a lot shorter than him and my dad, so I can't do shit to protect him. If I say something, my dad will get angry with me as well and it'll make it worse. And most of the time I don't want to take his side either - usually because it's his fault, but sometimes just because I don't have the energy to deal with it and I just want them to stop fighting. I've had a lot of exams recently and I've been studying a lot, and I'm emotionally drained. \n\nAfter/during the fights when I don't back him up, or if I call him out and say it is actually his fault, my brother gets really upset with me and asks why none of us care about his feelings and about our dad treating him like shit, and that if I said something our dad wouldn't be as mean. \n\nso, AITA for not 'helping' him when they fight?

      "description": "Hi reddit. Need some outsider perspective. \n\nI had a mutual Best Friend and were super close. I mean, at the hip close for probably five years. Then, her husband was stationed at a military base on the opposite side of the country and literally in the middle of our lunch I had to help her pack everything they had so she could go live on base with him.\n\nThey lived there for four years. I'm a college student so I couldn't afford to visit her. We texted and FaceTimed daily and even and sent each other packages occasionally. We were still best friends despite the difference. Then, one day, he was coming home from Afghanistan as his contract was over and they got to move home! \n\nThey got home June of 2017. A week later we got lunch and I was SO FREAKING HAPPY TO SEE MY BEST FRIEND! I waited four years to hug her again! \n\nLong story short, that was it. For probably a year straight, I asked at least once a week if she wanted to hang out, get a movie, lunch, etc. and I always got \"I'm too busy\", canceled plans, or no answer. Then later she would Snapchat hanging out with other people after lying and telling me she had to work. I think since they've been home we have hung out twice. So I gave up last summer even though it hurt me, but I realized I'm worth more than that. I'm a great friend and I'm not gonna beg for her attention. \n\nI guess last October her husband beat her, had PTSD episode and a mental breakdown, she got a restraining order, he served her divorce papers, and basically went MIA. Not even his parents know where he is. \n\nShe texted me out of the blue the other day, I was surprised but happy because deep down I do still love her, we've been through a lot together. We talked for a few hours and told me she got pregnant by a guy she was seeing last month but he wants absolutely nothing to do with her or the baby anymore. So she was venting to me, complaining, talking about what's going on, and then asked me if I wanted to get lunch and catch up. Also asked if I want to plan the baby shower with her, be her sidekick and help, go to doctor appointments with me, shop, etc. \n\nI haven't responded. Part of me wants to get close to her again because I do miss our friendship, but the other part of me is very bitter and hurt.\n\nAITA the asshole for ghosting her and not responding when she's in a bad situation and needs help?

I just don’t want to be in the bed with him if he decides he’s not going to even get out of bed next time he has to pee and just pees on the bed. \n\nI didn’t tell him I was leaving because he was asleep and he’s already gotten angry over something stupid earlier in the night and I just didn’t want him to get upset or be a jerk about me leaving and will just talk to him in the morning. \n\nAm I the asshole for not staying the night with him?

My step mom almost always makes comments about how I should stay the night, when I am only in town for 2 days with a lot of other people I want to see, mainly my mother and sister.\n\nI just made a trip down for a specific event and only have Friday evening, Saturday, Sunday and then I leave. Being that I have an event on Saturday, I have even less time than I normally do. I call Dad earlier in the week to tell him I will be in town, he answered and they are at the bar (should have hung up then to be honest), we make plans to meet on Sunday, I mention that I can't stay too long. My step mom over hears our conversation and starts texting me things like \"\\*really\\* you can't give your father more time he loves you so much you owe him more\", this is frustrating to me of course because of him moving when I was young. Anyway I respond to the effect of \"I'd love to spend more time with you! You guys should come to event on Saturday!\". She plays like she is going to come. I get in Friday night, invite them to dinner, no we can't. Saturday morning \"hope to see you at event!\" \"oh someone is coming to look at my car I am selling sorry\" Saturday evening \"Leaving event and going to dinner, want to come?\" \"oh we already ate\". Sunday comes around and he asks me if I am still coming over, I tell him no, I felt like I was blown off all weekend. \n\n\"wait what I thought we had plans?\" I tell him to thank his wife, that I am pregnant and not going deal with her behaving that way to me and I invite him over to my (mother's) house if he wants to see me. He just said step mom \"aw babe we didn't blow you off and she didn't mean it\"",

      "description": "There's a new student at my school, whom I'll call Anne. So Anne, Sophia(my other friend), and I were going to meet up at 1 pm and hang out. I woke up late, so I texted them around twenty minutes before we were going to meet up that if we could reschedule and meet up at 2 pm instead. Sophia agreed, but Anne didn't check the messages(she always replies to my messages a day after). She replies thirty minutes later saying that she already arrived and that she was looking for us. Sophia said she'll go to meet her then if she already arrived. Sophia arrived in twenty minutes, but she couldn't find Anne. I finally arrived after twenty minutes after Sophia arrived. Then, Anne texts us telling us that she went home. I was pissed because Sophia arrived at the meeting place in twenty minutes after Anne arrived, meaning she couldn't even wait twenty minutes. I asked her why she went home. She said that she didn't know what to do by herself, so she just went home. I told her that she only had to wait twenty minutes and why she couldn't even wait twenty minutes. She replied saying she didn't know what to do(I don't know what that means). I told her that Sophia and I will wait for her to come back and Anne said it would take around thirty minutes. Sophia and I waited for around forty minutes for Anne, then she texts us saying she can't make it. She's a new student, so I didn't want to be rude, so I just said okay, but it really pissed me off. AITA for getting pissed even though technically it's my fault for being late? I did reschedule beforehand and I don't understand why she went back home because she only had to wait twenty minutes for Sophia(I've waited two hours for my late friends before).",

      "title": "AITA For calling 000 on my ex?",
      "description": "A little bit of an introduction, both my ex and I are 17 and we just recently broke up a few weeks ago. The breakup hasn’t been very smooth, it’s been pretty hard on both of us, I won’t get into details but essentially we just haven’t spoken much. I didn’t take the break up well because to me it was kinda out of nowhere, I found it hard to just stop seeing and talking to the person I spoke to every day for over a year. \n\nAnyways, the past few days we started speaking more over the phone and on text, it was civil and at some points really nice. We spoke about making plans for her to come over to my house today to catch up. With everything that has been going on this made me pretty hopeful because I still love this girl and just a single day where I can express how I feel to her would be amazing.\n\nThen we get to last night, she texted me around mid day and we had a chat for a bit til she asked me for space, and to not text her until later that night. I happily did that and decided to have my best mate over for some COD. Sometime over the night I posted an older picture of myself shirtless on Instagram. For a bit of context my insta only has people I actually know and family, so I thought no bi deal. A few hours later I get a call from the ex asking why I’ve posted the picture and if I’m moving on from her. I got defensive and asked her why it was a problem to her if we weren’t together and that I haven’t said a word about anything that she had posted on social media. At this point I kinda realised that if I kept the argument going it would just get worse and worse so I offered to delete the post, and in return she said something along the lines of “fuck you, you’re moving on, I never want to see you again”. I try to tell her that no, I’m not moving on and that id still love to see her tomorrow. The response I got was “fuck you I’m going to kill myself”. After a bit of back n forth with her saying multiple times that she’s going to kill herself and it’s all my fault, she blocks me. I go back inside and ask my friend who is good mates with her too to chat to her and calm her down. He got chewed out and blocked himself so at this point I got worried. Ex has a history of self harm and mental health issues so I took this seriously. I gave her a few more texts saying that I will call 000 unless she can call me and prove to me nothings going to happen. This probably came off as a threat to her but I was panicking and didn’t know what to do. I tried texting her parents to no response because at this point it was 4am\n\nEnded up having to call 000 and explain the situation and they sent an ambo and cops to her place, waking up the whole house. She ended up having to explain that she was fine to her parents and the paramedics, who wanted to take her to the hospital regardless. The thing that makes this even worse is that she told everyone I told her to do it and that I’ve been harassing her the past couple weeks. I have text message proof of everything so I don’t know why she’d lie. The cops then told her parents that if I message any of their family to get an AVO on me. \n\nPretty much this whole morning her parents have texted me saying that they’re really disappointed for me calling 000, which is fair. I’ve just tried to explain to them that I panicked and after being threatened with suicide what else am I meant to do, especially because she’s hurt herself in the past. Her parents then deny she’s ever harmed herself, which I know that they know of. Regardless, I apologised to them and explained that I didn’t mean to start any trouble and that I respect them, it’s just that I was real worried. \n\nI know I probably did a few things wrong throughout this whole thing, but I’m willing to admit that and try to change, am I the asshole?",

I tried her jacket on, but didn't like the look and fit and i knew i wouldn't be wearing it. Sadly she bought it a while a go and coulnd't refund it, so she sold it approximately for half the price.\n\nI felt kinda bad and appreciated her idea, but i knew it wouldn't make me happy and i would have probably still got the other jacket.\n\nAm i the asshole for making that decision?

      "description": "We met on tinder and have been dating for 18 months on and off like the title says, we hit it off straight away, we (or so I thought) fell in love really quickly. But there was always this nagging feeling that I couldn't shake that something wasn't right. She told me she had an abortion the summer before we met and that she was still trouble by it, I told her I didn't care and that I still like to keep seeing her.\nWe had a brief fight over an ambiguous text that read \"I can't see you tonight, I'm going out for dinner\" a few weeks into our relationship and I took that as meaning she was going on a date; so I confronted her and asked her what was going on and she said she was going out with some girlfriends. (As a bit of background I had been working away for a couple nights and hadn't seen her in over a week). This is where everything seemed to fall apart, she told me she didn't like being spoken to like this and that she felt I was being controlling. So I said ok, I'll back it off a bit and leave you too it. But we kept dating.\nFast forward to Halloween, a few weeks later and she tells me 2 days before that she wants to go to her friend house party but doesn't want me to come. I know her ex-BF (the father of the aborted baby) might be there, and that they had a FWB relationship before me met. This ends up in a huge fight, we meet up the next day and she had bruised knees, tells me she came home alone and slept in the bed with her best friend (female). I reluctantly decide ok, maybe she just needed to recover from some trauma of the abortion, maybe she felt better after a huge blow out. She also tells me she's booked a solo trip to Europe for one.\nBut again something wasn't right. I know it was wrong, so I decide to check her phone and find out that she had been sleeping with her ex-BF for about 3 weeks whilst we had been dating, and that she had sent him a string of drunken messages when he wasn't at the Halloween party, even saying that she was going to drunkenly drive o the next city over to see him that night. He re-buffed her though and she tells me nothing happened. I choose again to believe the original story she gave me about the party, but I still had my doubts.\nWe end up spending Xmas at her parents. It's a really awkward time for me, I'm not much of a family person and I don't really know any of her family, but they all have a very close relationship. I basically spend 3 days, in an awkward silence, and she only really engages with me to point my flaws out to her parents. She goes for drinks on the final night we're staying with one of her friends from home and we end up in a fight on the way back because I've had a few and just tell her I'm not happy.\nThis carries on into the New Year, when we get to a new year’s party. She decide to tell me then that she's booked a trip away with her friends to Edinburgh in early Feb., I'm annoyed that she decide she couldn't tell me until we were somewhere public because she knew that it would piss me off that she makes plans and hides them from me (she admitted she only told me because she thought a friend might mention to me).\nWe go to the house party of her friends (I'm finally invited); at the party the same thing happens that happened at Christmas. I'm abandoned so that she can go and hang out with her friends, literally walks off and leaves me, when I follow she tells me to go mingle. I'm literally at a party with complete strangers who've all known each other for years. This explodes when she decides to go off to the bathroom with some friends, and I literally catch her checking to see if I'm looking, she doesn't see me notice her looking for me as she runs upstairs. When she finally comes down 40 mins later, we have another huge argument about why she's left me alone and snuck off again, it's really big and is basically ends up with me leaving the party and sleeping in my car outside her house (I'm too drunk to drive and I parked there because the party was walking distance). She comes home with her best friend and then a random guy shows up 20 mins later, \"who her best friend might be seeing\".\nWe really don't speak for a few weeks and then she take that weeklong trip to Europe, we're still together at this point but tensions are obviously frayed. While she's away I have heart to heart with a rally close old friend of mine and his exact words to me are \"Are you sure she's taking that trip alone? I mean she's lied about everything else and she decide to go when you were having problems\", I explain to him that she told me it was to clear her head, but deep down I know he's has a valid point.\nHer parents come down late January, and though it's nice to see them again, the first night out I'm once again frozen out in the corner, and she only talks to me to tell her parents about all my faults. We get home and have another huge fight and I tell her that's it, I'm done, she treats me like crap and that she needs to leave. She refuses to go, she gets aggressive and tries to grab me and hit me. I used to be a bouncer, so I literally, spin her around, put my arms around her body and carry her to the front door, I don't want a fight, and I’m over this. At the door I put her down so she can walk out on her own, but she refuses and tries to wedge herself in the door way. I try to pick her up but she sits down, and forgets that the door way is on a step, slips and lands on her arse... hard. She hurt, and she screaming about me \"assaulting her\", she leaves finally. I know she's badly hurt, she's angry and she very emotional, so after 5 mins minutes I decide to go check on her, she still sat in the car. As I walk towards the car, I can see she's on the phone, and that she's seen me, she then immediately pulls off and drives away.\nShe spends the night sending me repeated text messages and calls to ask me to take her back, she's sorry, she'll forgive me (for what?), but I can tell she distraught and having a breakdown. We talk on the phone all night about what's been going on, and she asks if I'll come with her tomorrow night, since we've booked dinner with her parents, and she doesn't want it to look weird. I go. We make up after they leave, and we decide to start from the beginning, just dating, but exclusively.\nHer birthday is a few weeks later and she tells me she doesn't want me to come out to her party, I ask why, and she says it'll be because her best friend is there and that's who she was on the phone too in the car. This was a lie, she was on the phone to her ex, she invited him to the party, and the night of the party they end up sleeping together. I confront her the day after, and tell her I'm done, this time genuinely.\nWe don't speak for a few months.\nA few months later, I'm seeing a few other people. Nothing serious and she pops up in my messages. She wants to meet up and talk. I have nothing serious going on and I want an apology in person (up until this point her only real admissions of guilt had been spamming me messages). So I agree. We end up sleeping together, and I tell her if she wants to keep it going, I want her to be honest with me about who else she's sleeping with. She tells me no one. So after a few weeks, I get that feeling again, and after I confront her, she admits to having been dating her ex whilst we were apart, sleeping with her house mate and a friend from home (who she may or may not have been sleeping with every time she visited her parents previously). But she wants to get back together seriously.\nI tell her, that I still have strong feelings for her as well, and that if we do this, I want her to cut her ex, her FWB and her housemate out of her life. She tells me that her ex is someone she can't cut out, because she wants to know that he's ok and his life has been hard, and that she can't cut her house mate off because she lives with him and it would be awkward with her other housemates. Our relationship drags itself to death, and eventually collapses under the weight of me not giving a fuck about being treated like this, and her constant refusal to commit.\nWe break up again and over the summer I date a few different women on and off again, and I get hit up by GF after a few months. Same story as before, but his time I tell her I'm not interested. So for a few days we go back and forth over, however it's pathetic she come crawling back, and that she just wants to apologize. Long story short, we end up sleeping together again and the relationship builds from there, I know she's cut her ex-BF, the FWB and the housemate out of her life. And I reluctantly decide to give it a go, on the conditions, she keeps all the other guys out of her life, she moves out of her place and into mine (she had been semi moved into mine on a number of occasions) and that she dials back on her selfishness and starts being more considerate to how she's treated me in the past. She agrees. And then goes on a holiday with her mother which had been a long time planned.\nWhen she gets back form holiday, guess who has genital warts? great, now she has an actually STD, but god knows when she got it since I know it can remain dormant for years, so either I've already got it or I'm immune (I'm still getting the HPV and speaking to a doc about treatments). Out sex life is massively hit by it, but we seem to be getting on fine and coping for a few months. A few fights but nothing relationship ending.\nHalloween we have a party at mine with her and my friends there, all goes well, expect I get too drunk and make a tit of myself (apparently it was funny).\nThen her friends tell her they’re having a big reunion, invite her, but warn her that her ex will be there. I've told her I'm not happy about her going, she can see her friends any time but I specifically asked her to have no contact with her ex. She goes anyway, and to justify it by ",

Naive me thought I was in love with her. I told her how I felt one birthday and was (gently) rejected. However I was crushed and went crying to BM and told him all about how I loved her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a long time I still had feelings for MF. I would always moan to BM about how I liked her but couldnt do anything about it. As far as I was concerned, and even though I would never be with her, she was obviously off-limits to BM given how I felt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, BM one day told me that he had matched on tindr with MF and then a couple weeks later, said they had been studying at the library together. I was a bit suspicious but didnt think BM would do anything to hurt me. Eventually however, he told me that he had been seeing her for a few months casually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I heard this I initially pretended not to care but was actually deeply hurt. I told him to stop as it was hurting me. He chose not to. Then one day I boiled over and went to his house knowing MF was there and dragged BM outside to blast him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being made at my mate? Surely he shouldnt have tried anything with her knowing my emotional investment. When my mother found out she was crying because she herself knew how much I liked MF, just for some context.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Okay, before I get shouted at, please do read what it’s about. \n\nMy bf and I have been a couple for the better part of a year now. We’re both at University and have lots of mutual friends. He’s a great guy. Charismatic, kind, smart, looks after himself, and all that jazz. We get on like a house on fire, love going out together and have great sex. \n\nIf you passed him on the street, you wouldn’t think anything was wrong with him. The only issue is he sometimes gets these ‘twitches’ in a random muscle in his body. It’s barely noticeable, just a slight contraction, but if I’m lying with my head on his chest or touching him in any way I can’t fall asleep. He’s not to fussed about cuddling, but I live for that stuff. My favourite thing to do in this world is snuggle with someone on a sofa watching a film after having sex. But with him, cuddling is just slightly annoying. \n\nIt’s not his fault I know, and I don’t want to lie to him if I break up about why I’m doing so. We have a pact to never lie to each other. He’s really mature so I’m confident he’ll at least understand a little, but his disability does upset him as it sometimes gets worse for a few minutes at a time and you do notice. I don’t want to leave him, as I’m worried I won’t find someone else like him, but I just can’t live without cuddling. I think I’m going to have to leave him.  Will I be an asshole if I dump him over something so small he can’t help?\n\n",

      "description": "Me and a girl are friends. We tried a full relationship last summer, but we didn't hit off so we decided to stay friends at least. We had lot of fun, we rode ATV, explored abandoned areas and stuff like that. Usually it was me who had to invent, what we would do. Then, she canceled to meet once. I didn't think much about it, shit happens. Then it happened for the second time. Then it happened for the third time. I was getting suspicious, but I tend to believe people and think that, it is just a coincidence. When it happened for the fourth time, I decided, that I'm just wasting my time. Whatever. I'm okay being internet-friends.\n\nThen at one point she asked me out. I was like ok. Then she postponed it twice. After that we finally had a coffee, but that was it. I didn't notice anything special so I just shrugged it all off as a coincidence. Then she wanted to meet again. I accepted, but later she postponed it and then cancelled it. This happened eight times until finally today, as she canceled once again a postponed meet, I had enough. I was wondering, why the hell would she ask eight times me to somewhere only to cancel it by saying \"college work\" almost every single time. At that moment I realised, all the times when she cancelled a meet, in her snaps she wasn't at her desk doing college stuff but was instead always on her bed. the other reason she used a few times, was that her family is keeping a property display. I realised my family did them too, but it never limited me in any way since I as a youngster don't know shit about the structures of our house\n\nI texted her \"Why you always ask me out and then postpone and cancel it. It is like the 8th time in a row you do this. It really feels like you are trying to get some drama or catfish me, but I don't really get why would you do that to a friend. You always use the same excuses of college work or property display, but you are never doing college work in your snaps then and property display doesn't limit you, I know this, since my family has had them too. What is all this? Why you do this?\"\n\nShe replied \"Where then I should be taking snaps in your opinion? And I don't know if we really click as friends, we don't kinda have the same interests, but I'm not blaming you for anything, you are still good looking, funny and kind. I don't really know why I cancel and I swear I'm not catfishing or anything. This might have something to do with a thing, that I don't want to talk about\"\n\nI replied \"You just can't say you don't know why you cancelled. You decided to cancel completely by yourself and you know it. And when it comes to the thing you don't want to talk about, If I'm affected, In my opinion I have the right to know what it is. As this has affected my daily plans for many times, I feel like I need to know. If I won't be affected by it anymore, I don't need to know it and you can keep it to yourself. And I know I wasn't really soft by writing this, but I feel like I have to tell exactly how I feel\"\n\nShe told me, that she is not going to ask me out as long as she is unsure. I'm kinda happy with that, as I don't want my daily plans to mess up just for basically nothing, but I still feel I was selfish and too harsh to her in the end.",

      "description": "So, I live in an apartment complex that allows large breeds of dogs (+25 lbs). There's no dog park area and we don't have enclosed yards, so you *have* to walk your dog to give them exercise and to allow them to use the bathroom. The problem is that some of the residents seem to be averse to keeping their dogs on a leash while they're outside. It's clearly spelled out in the apartment's handbook that if your dog is caught outside without a leash that you will be fined, but people do it anyway. \n\nI have a 13-year old Cocker Spaniel, and I've had trouble in the past with him being attacked by other dogs roaming around unattended. These are not strays either, because their owner will usually come running up from somewhere telling me how sorry they are. Luckily, he's never been seriously injured other than some minor scrapes, but it's a definite concern whenever we see one of these dogs off their leash. It's happened so often that my mom has resorted to carrying a weapon when taking him out for a walk, in case it happens again.\n\nLast night, somebody had their German Shepard off-leash outside while they sat on their porch playing on their phone. This morning (like 15 minutes ago) there was a guy with his two Pitbulls off-leash running around the community tennis court (there's literally a sign stating \"No Pets\" on the court); the tennis court doesn't have a door, so dogs can (and have) just run out. I feel like the primary reason people are doing this so often is because there's minimal accountability and a general mindset of \"*my* dog would *never* attack anything\".\n\nI want to start taking pictures of people doing this and reporting them to the leasing office. I'm hoping physical evidence might help the leasing office to actually do *something* about it (instead of it just being hearsay), and I'm also prepared to go over their heads to their parent company, if necessary. Literally all I want is to be able to walk my dog around the complex without having to worry about him potentially getting mauled by some asshole's 75 lbs. \"cute little buttercup\". So, WIBTA?",

      "description": "So, little background before all this. I'm in the arts org of my senior high, and I have the position of executive assistant to president and vice president. I was tasked by the president to give updates to our org adviser because his faculty was close to my homeroom and I could reach him the soonest. \n\nThe whole shebang happened a bit before a weeklong celebration in my school where all students are encouraged to participate in and the school orgs are supposed to be the ones handling events and booths the students will be participating in. As the arts org, a lot of pressure was on us, especially on the president. She tried handling a lot of the work, while juggling her own academics on the side and honestly from what I saw she wasn't handling things too well saying stuff she shouldn't have said. \n\nAnyways, our org adviser asked me to ask our president to organize a meeting before the celebration week. I did so in DMs later that night however she replied by cussing out our adviser. Following that incident, were a few other altercations that came with her attitude and finally I had enough and I had decided there was no straight way of talking to her. Couple of days later, our adviser asked me for updates about the org plans for the following week and I decide to tell him everything. \n\nHe was very shocked, ofc as he should be. He asked me for a screenshot of the conversation (I hadn't taken a screenshot yet and this was the only instance I did so when he asked me). D week arrives and we manage to pull through. Yay... So through the week our adviser was considering her removal due to her behavior, and I was trying to lowkey convince him not to do that. I had thought the situation died down because the week managed to be a success for us. A week after the D week (sorry for using the word \"week\" a lot) Thinking everything is dandy, I get word that our adviser had filed a formal complaint against the president for her cussing him out in our dms. She is in her last year, and she might get a hearing, or even held back for this. I am friggin anxious for her situation and did I make everything worse by reporting her? So am I the asshole? ",

We used to hang it with each other lot but around 8th grade he started being a little controlling maybe? He dared me to do stupid shit like steal a pack of gum or whatnot I would usually say no but I didn’t want to upset him so sometimes I would say yes...I got a suspension one time for this so, after this had been going on for a few months I actively tried to avoid him. I wouldn’t hang out with and I would try not to talk on social media. This really pissed him off he started getting aggressive and would say I was being a “fag” or “pussy” I didn’t want to upset him because I felt I had a obligatory tie to him. He doesn’t have a lot of friends so I don’t want to cut ties with him completely because I’m worried he is depressed but I am really thinking about it. If I cut ties, am I the Asshole?",

While things are better than they have been, I myself still don't fully trust her, and she annoys the hell out of me. \n\nShe has a toddler, and they only live a few blocks away. We often coordinate playdates, walks to the park, those sorts of things. My child is only a year old, and when I was pregnant, my SIL was very hostile towards me due to jealousy she felt because her family was more positive about our (husband and i) pregnancy than hers - which arose out of an affair while she was still married. But once my son was born, she suddenly became very friendly and referred to herself as the :\"fun auntie,\" providing gifts and offers to babysit my son so my husband and I could go on dates. \n\nIn short, I feel very strongly that I don't want her alone with my son. Apart from how she has acted towards me, her general personality stresses me the hell out. So even with us working to keep things civil and friendly, I have rejected her request to watch my son multiple times. My husband feels that I Am being overprotective and unreasonable.

      "description": "So me and my (ex) best friend haven't talked since September. Now, let's go wayback in 2018, as this story is quite big and complex. So I had a big crush on this girl for over a year, let's call her Maria and him John. One day, after school, me and John were on our way to grab something to eat, when we randomly bumped into Maria and asked her if she wanted to come with us to eat, which she did. Once I was done, I had to leave as I had a Chemistry lesson, while both of them continued eating. (Mind you, I was a senior in High School and I was taking the exams in June). Fast forward to July, I was done with my exams and a female friend of mine told me that there were rumours that Maria and John went out on a date, and the first thing that came to my mind was that day I just mentioned. So I told her that the rumours are false and they never went on a date, they just simply ate for a bit together once I left the store. At the time, my friend knew very well that I had a crush on her and I was so sure that John would never do such a thing and I didn't even give it a second thought. The same friend that told me about the rumour, bumped into Maria one day and Maria asked my friend if she knew about the rumours, which it turned out to be true. So she told me, and then I asked a really close friend, both I's and John's, if he knew anything about the situation, let's call him Ted. So Ted told me that Maria and John had been talking to each other since last December and that they went on a date where they made out. When John told Ted that he had been talking with Maria and was planning a date, Ted told John that he had to tell me, which he did not want to do because ''it would had affected my exams preparation'' so Ted didn't tell me even thought he insisted. When I found out , I was lost. To this day, I really can't believe, that my best friend of 13 years would make out with my biggest crush behind my back without telling me literally nothing. It's not about Maria, fuck Maria I ,now, couldn't care less, its all about honesty and being a decent fucking friend, let alone homie.\n\nSome of you may think: '' Oh come on man you would have done the same thing\" and I'll tell you something to show you how much friendship and honesty means to me.\n\nOne night, I had a girl literally all over me, but she was an ex- girlfriend of a friend of mine, who is a really cool dude but we were far from close friends. So I said fuck it, Im not hooking up with her it's not right, at least according to my morals, so I was trying to kill time while she was all over me, until we left the club.\n\nIf that was really about not trying to upset me during my preparation then he would have told me after I was done with them, right? Well he had time but he did not.\n\nI do not hold any grudges nor hard feelings, I simply don't want to have this kind of people around me. To this day, he hasn't even said a simple '' I'm sorry''.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This has caused me to develop increased anxiety, depression, and in one case, cause self harm. I am going spend winter break with my girlfriend and her family in the midwest this year to experience a true Christmas for the first time in my life, plane ticket courtesy of her family, and my mother has gotten extremely upset that I am not going home to visit. Yet every time I'm home she is barely interested in my presence, and when she is, it involves some sort of insult or rude comment to me. She tries to make me feel guilty by saying how she would cook for me and how I'm not a good son for not coming home for break. Additionally, when I do go home for break, I am usually alone because I do not have access to a car, live too far from friends to walk, and am basically confined to my room out of lack of things to do in my town.

      "description": "Sorry for the long title and probably bad spelling and punctuation but am glad you are reading this. \n\nOk the title alone probably puts me in a bad position for being called a monster but a bit of context. So my boyfriend and I are in a long distant relationship, have been for two years. It started off really good but now its gotten sour and I feel like I am staying with him for his good and not my own. Now he suffers from depression and has multiple personality disorder (at least from what he has told me). The story I am going to tell is probably a pretty petty one but it happened yesterday so I need to rant and this is the only place to do it. \n\nSo my mum does cleaning for this old lady Monday and Friday and I do dog walking occasionally helping her out of the Friday. Now it was Sunday, mum's just done a night shift when she is woken up by frantic calls from the old lady's neibour who's animal watching the old ladys dog and two cats, she tells mum she thinks one of the cats has had a stroke. This cat is really not doing great as it is being completely blind, almost completely deaf and all matted on her belly where she can't clean and she attacks if you try to get them out (my mums tried many times, at least de-matting her back) so we wait a bit till the vets open before going over there. The cat is stumbling, barely able to walk so we take her up to the vets. Now we to cut the vet a bit short we were there about 2 and a half hours to get seen and to have a blood test, now this isn't looking good for this cat, who is probably gonna get put down maybe before the old lady comes out of hospital (which she had been in since October last year and she is supposedly coming out today, a day after the vet) the whole while you have a 2 year old kid crying her eyes out constantly (not that I blame her, think her dog was having problems walking with the way her nan and mum were crying whatever it was wrong seemed pretty bad, like life or death bad), dogs barking and growling and barking. All of this adding onto stress with my legs that have been hurting rexently due to a shortened hamstring as well as the worried people around me \n\nLucky we don't have the cat put down that day, taking her home to the old ladys apartment type thing so she can at least see her one more time leaving. Now I am tired and achey, mum was going to take me and her to KFC on way back but we messed up dirrections, having takeaway from a more local place adding onto my stress. \n\nNow this whole time I have been messaging my boyfriend and a group of my friends (who had my back while I stressed over the vets) trying my best to not stress my boyfriend out too, he knows I am at the vets and why I am trying to keep me happy, role playing one of my story for a bit before going back to his dbz one (he loves dbz and I struggle to understand half of it) so after ALL this I am walking my own dog after we have eaten (who coincidently has a got limp too recently, who I have worried might not have long left being an old dog and most of the dogs we knew have died too, I had cried when she started cause it was real bad) me and my boyfriend are talking. \n\nI mentioned that I was tired from not sleeping (which was my fault I didn't tbh) and all the stuff I had done today. That's when he comes out with this comment which after feeling like this I wasn't ready for from him \n\nHim:what shit\nMe:vets. Two and a half bloody hours of it \nHim:Oh  is that tiring? You were sitting in a chair\n\nNow I feel bad but I lashed out at him furious how he could say that after two and a half fucking hours\nMe:IT'S EMTIONALY FUCKING DRAINING WTF YOU BEEN DOING ALL DAY\nMe:lay in bed doing bugger all\n\n(having finished school but not going to college yet or getting a job)\n\nHim:calm down baby it wasn't an attack\nMe:Certainly fucking looked like one\nHim:No no no I was just asking and questioning *sniffles* I'm sorry\n\nThis convo continues till I say I am going to sleep for me it would have been about 6pm for me and high noon for him. He begs me not to but I ignore him going to sleep, I text some depressed stuff in my shitty state before I go to sleep, still absolutely fuming at him. He says he didn't mean it and is scared he might lose me, I don't sympathise as I normally would constantly saying I wanna sleep and be left alone till he gives up. (I feel kinda bad for this but still belive he was being horrible.) \n\nI am woken at midnight by him calling me. I deny the call as always texting him to let me sleep starting our texting again.\nMe:let me sleep.\nHim:B..b..b..but you have slept. It's been like 6 hours\nMe:And I would still be Sleep if you hadn't woken me\n\nI then ignored him going back to sleep seeing these messages this morning\nHim:B..b...b..b\nHim:W.w..w.w..w.hy are you so meani\nHim:WHY BABY WHY IVE BEEN CRYING FOR 6 HOURS\n\nI replyed with this long ass text before this post\nMe:Cause I try my best it's never enough for you. You always want more and more and I am sick of it. Stuck in a once skidded relationship where I always try to make you happy but your still always bloody upset no matter what I do cause you REFUSE to even try and better yourself then wonder why your upset all the time. It's cause I am the only one who puts up with your self serving behaviour, I know it's hard to fix it but your not even trying so I gotta ruin myself trying to fix you over and over to no effect. This is probably just gonna upset you more but I don't care, I have to TRY and get through to you without the others forcing us back to that status quo that's slowly draining us and our relationship\n\nThat's it. AITA for getting angry at my depressed boyfriend after he says something so cruel in my eyes, should I have been kind and understanding or was my in the moment rage out justified.\n\nSorry for such a long very furious ranting post but I had to tell someone about this. Thanks for reading and any answers would be much appreciated, thank you. ",

      "description": "There's a girl I'm dating, we seem to get along and are getting pretty close. She tried to arrange having me come to her sister's wedding afterparty, but due to logistics and everything it wasn't completely guaranteed that it would happen. The day of the wedding, she messages me saying to come by. Now, this is a big deal to me since this would be the first time meeting her parents and family. In addition, I knew absolutely no one at this wedding, so you can imagine how that would give me some anxiety. \n\nWhen I arrive, it's past 9:30, the dancing seems to have peaked, with the first guests starting to leave. Everyone is quite drunk, I tend to shy away from tons of alcohol. The girl I'm dating seems drunk asks me to bring her a drink, which I do. She then asks me to bring her a drink two more times, after I say things like \"you sure?\". I'm feeling a little strange since I've never seen her drunk before and she's behaving quite differently. In addition, I've had some really shitty past experiences with an ex who was borderline verbally abusive to me when drunk, and I just wasn't feeling it that night. \n\n I spend about an hour dancing with the family, bride, and whoever else hasn't left yet, and then I tell her I'm thinking of heading home for the night soon. She straight up tells me I can't leave, and that she will get really upset if I do. She then asks me to do some random tasks which I do, like moving wedding supplies into the car and trying to stop the dance floor from dying out. I try to leave a few more times, but she makes it clear that it's going to be really bad if I leave. I end up leaving at around 1:30am. \n\nThe next day I told her that it was weird of her to force me to stay when I wasn't having a good time, and that she should be fine without me there since all her friends and family are gathered at the wedding, whereas I knew no one and it was a weird atmosphere to meet the family. She said that arriving and wanting to leave so soon isn't something you do. I'm not sure how to respond. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She's easily the hottest girl in the gym, blond hair, cute face, skinny waist and thiqq ass. She clearly doesn't skip leg day. That's all totally irrelevant though because the problem is that she's doing bulgarian single leg squats on the only bench press in the gym. To me this is like curling in the squat rack. There's like a million other places you can put your foot. And today is bench press day. So I go up to her when she finishes her set and I'm like \"Hey can I switch benches with you?\" and she says something like \"Oh ha I guess so.. but I just don't like the other benches they're too tall\" and she clearly is annoyed at me so I just say nevermind don't worry about it and find something else to do instead of bench press. Am I an asshole for asking? I know it's a bit rude at the gym, but it's also crowded and if there's only one thing I can do my exercise on and 5 that someone else can, should I be a dick anyways and ask?",

Girlfriend is probably not going to be back living with me until after our lease expires. I have been breaking my back working a ton just to get by with the extra Bills. He told me yesterday he expects me to after this month to pick up her part of rent so he can save up to move out since he will be getting a new place 3 months before our lease expires. I told him absolutely not, I am staying in 1 room of the home and him in the other room (2bed townhome). It has driven a wedge between us and I feel hes trying to take advantage of me by asking me to pay 2/3s of rent while only using half the living space. I told him if he feels that strongly about it we can break the lease and go our separate ways. I understand the obligation for her to pay but she no longer lives here AITA?",

      "description": "I am in exchange I’m Brazil for a year, an opportunity I am more than grateful for. And I’ve gotten pretty close to my host family, but that has been out to a stop lately. \n\nThe problem? My host mother tells everybody, I mean everybody, everything. She also puts everything on her Instagram story. We will call her Maria for now. \n\nWhen I joined rotary, I put my mental illnesses in my medical form, just in case anything happens. It’s suppose to be just between my host parents, and my country officer. Maria one day randomly asks me about this. I trust her, and explain to her what the effects are, what to do if something happens, and how I have what I have. I don’t like to think my mental illnesses are who I am, but I have no problem accepting that and working through them to have an easier life. \n\nAfter a few days, we are having a get together with Maria’s friends. They have brought some other people as well and there’s quite a good crowd. I brought Maria and her friends some drinks and Maria introduced me to the people I haven’t met. She then continues on saying where I’m from, and out of nowhere she states ALL of things I told her about my mental illnesses. \n\nI wouldn’t say I’m ashamed of them, but that was a PRIVATE moment for us. I felt so embarrassed and awkward when everyone went quiet and had worried expressions on their faces. I went outside to take a breather. It was all too much.\n\nLater after it the party was over, O tried explaining to Maria that it was inappropriate to say those things, and that it was said in confidence. She then says (in Portuguese of course) “don’t you think people should know?” I tried seeing that logic, but people I barely know, know about my illnesses before they even know my last name. That reason wasn’t good enough for me.\n\nThere was even a time she told others I had a panick attack. I asked her why she felt the need to tell people I don’t know that, but she said “they need to get to know you!”\n\nSo lately I haven’t opened up to her. She still talks about me, not as extreme as the examples above, but still. Telling people about my family and my childhood I opened up to her about. It’s not the greatest. \n\nI fee like I can’t trust her. She repeats everything like a parrot. I can’t even tell her I am having menstrual cramps without her broadcasting it to everyone at the dinner table. Am I wrong for not opening up to her anymore? \n\nTLDR: My host mother Maria has a big mouth and tells everyone Things I say to her in private. I feel like I can’t trust her anymore. \n\nPardon the typos.\n",

      "description": "Im sorry if this is really long and incomprehensible, I'm rage typing right now.\n\nFirst, just a little backstory: My parents are currently going through a divorce and let's just say they arent acting the most amicable towards each other. I'm already an \"adult\" (I'm 19) so this isnt a matter of who gets custody or that type of thing, so in my opinion I dont think I even need to be involved with the whole situation. However, they are involving me and it's starting to annoy the shit out of me. Sometimes it feels as if they treat me like a therapist because all they do when I'm with one of them is listen to their ranting and say shit like \"yeah\" \"uh huh\" \"wow\" \"sure\". They like to talk shit about each other to me and idk it kinda feels a little manipulative like they're trying to get me on their \"side\". I live and go to school in a different city so most of the time I can get away from all the bullshit, except now I'm back for the holidays and it hasn't even been 36 hours and I'm already losing my shit. I honestly dont know if I will be able to last the 3 weeks. \n\nBack to today: I was lucky enough that my parents set aside some money for me to use when I go to college, and right now my father has control of all of it (he has always been the one to take care of financial matters so this is normal). Today, my mother told me to tell my dad that \"I want access to my money\". This is in quotations because she basically gave me the script on what to tell my father, so essentially she didnt even ask me what I wanted to do and now I have to lie. The reason she wants me to do this is because within the next few days my dad is flying back to his home country for a couple of months to chill until things here settle down and she is worried that once he leaves we wont be able to access the papers, go to the bank and get control of the money. My mother is under the impression (even though she denies it) that my father will take the money and spend it on some other woman and start a new family and forget all about me and I wont have anything left. I feel bad because yeah I love my mom but she is so incredibly hard to live with. She does things impulsively and doesnt always react logically to situations. She has had a history of \"gambling debt\" (that's what my dad told me but idk if I can trust him because he could just be saying that to manipulate me) which is why I for sure would not trust her with my money. And if I'm being honest idk if I could trust my dad with my money either because what if he really does just use it all and forget about me. The only person I believe right now is myself. I went out to dinner with my dad tonight to see him before he leaves and that was when I was supposed to perform my given script. When I got home and my mom asked if I told him what I was supposed to, i obviously told her no. She starts going on a rant telling me that \"you shouldn't trust your father he is a bad person\", \"he is manipulating you\", \"you dont understand, I'm doing this for you\" that kind of thing. Ever since I've been little, whenever my mom starts going off at me I shut down and dont respond to anything because even attempting to say how I feel will result in the waterworks. After about 10 minutes of this I lose my shit and basically tell my mom that \"i dont care what you tell me to do, i will do whatever i want. Stop getting me involved in all of this, I dont care what happens to the money, etc etc.\" \n\nThe truth is that I do want to be able to access my college money but really from just a \"help me learn about all this financial stuff point of view\". But I dont want my dad to think I dont trust him. I also get that what I said to my mom may come off a bit entitled, I kind of lost my shit and just wanted her to leave me alone. Am I the asshole for 1.) Being mad at my parents for not wanting to get involved with any divorce stuff, 2.) Not reciting the script that my mom gave me, 3.) Basically telling my mom to fuck off when I wouldn't tell my dad what she told me to tell him, 4.) Not caring enough about what happens to money that will be important if I want to continue school after my bachelors, and lastly 5.) Am I the asshole for not wanting to be around any of them, like seriously, I have a history of depression and ever since I moved away to college I have never been happier, it's only when I have to go back home that my mental health gets worse.",

I was eyeing him the whole time and right before he lit it he looked at me and said \"the fuck u looking at?\" I politely asked him not to light it on the bus and he told me to fuck off. I didnt want a confrontation so I let it go. My stop was only 8 mins or so away.\n\nAs soon as our interaction ends a guy (roughly 20-23) wants to chime in. \"Oh who the fuck u talkin to. U cant tell him what to do. Who do u think u are?\" \n\nI proceeded to say that I was just asking him to not smoke on the bus and that I didnt want any trouble. He looks like he might be on something but carries on \"fuck u, u cant say shit, I'll fuck u up blah blah blah\" and continues this for a while. I kept my composure until he brought race into it and then threatened to kill me.\n\n\"Blah blah blah who the fuck u think u are white boy? I'll kill u.\" A little insight... I'm mixed (Russian and Ethiopian) and he's black. I have dreadlocks but I had a ski mask on since it was 20 degrees out so he couldn't see my hair and assumed I was straight white. \n\nI immediately threw off my ski mask and got in his face. \"Who the fuck u callin white boy?!\" Cant remember my exact choice of words but I threatened to fuck him up and he turned into a little bitch. Dont think he realized how tall I was. I'm 6'6 and he was about 5'2. \n\nHe jad walked up to me while I was in my seat to voice his nonsense but never engaged me physically. I just feel like an ass because he may have been on drugs and not known better. Since I didnt feel threatened physically should I have just kept my cool? At the same time my life was verbally threatened.",

      "description": "I have been dating my girlfriend for almost 4 years but we still keep separate finances and split rent. There was a period where she was unemployed and I was paying 100% of the rent for which I didn’t ask, nor do I want, her to pay me back. \n\nShe then found a job that she started on the first of the the month. Since she wouldn’t be getting a check until the 15th and had been dipping into her savings to cover other living expenses I said that she should not pay her half of the rent on the first of the month (the day she started her job) and instead just pay me back at the end of our current lease (about a year away).\n\nNow that that time has come, I feel weird asking her to pay me that half a month’s rent from a year ago.

      "description": "This is my first Reddit post so im not familiar on how I should approach a title or text so sorry about that.\nSo basically at the time it was around 6 months ago (I'm 16 btw male) and I took my girlfriend's little sister (she was 5 at the time and we'll call her M for now) to the park so I was on my phone just texting while M was just playing on the slides and then I hear a bunch of laughter and M crying so I run my ass off to her and I see her bleeding from her head so I decide to ask the shits \"What in the fuck happened\" and M points out that they threw a rock and took her doll so I say \"Apologize to her right the fuck now\". They spat on my shoe and told me they don't give a fuck so I told Maggie to go to the ladies room and wait there for me. \n\nI grabbed the little fuckers hoodie(the kid who spat on my timbs) and pinned him to the ground and started beating him and kicked him a shit ton then 2 of his friends ran away but one of them tried to jump on my back for idk why so I fell back basically crushing the kid (because I'm basically 2x his height) and smashed his head against the pole. Anyways I told my mom(she's a cop) what happened and my girlfriends mom police got involved mostly because the parents of the 2 little shits wanted me arrested because the kid I striked first suffered a broken rib, punctured lung and dislocated shoulder. The second kid broke his ribs and suffered a crack in his skull and was a little deaf in his right ear. The most that happened was there was CCTV footage of the incident and what happened to M and the most I did was 6 months of therapy. But I just wanna know of IMTA",

      "description": "So long story ahead.\n\nMe and my girlfriend dated for a few months.  So I ended up moving in, someone we worked with became good friends with us and she moved in, we will call her B. So B was a lesbian and had a girlfriend that never lived here, I never had a problem with her living here and she was great to have around. Not cut to a couple weeks ago, B’s girlfriend is visiting, I didn’t have a problem she was here a couple weeks. One night, a couple friends were hanging out with my girlfriend, B, and Bs girlfriend downstairs, and I was in my room, being a nerd. \n\nSo over the course of the night, they’re starting to get drunk, and that’s all I know, my girlfriend ended up coming into my room late at night, while I was still playing and she fell asleep.  Nothing crazy. \n\nCut to last night. I’m sitting with my girlfriend, and she brings up casually how b’s girlfriend was telling my girlfriend how hot it would be if b made out with her, she ignored it because she’s awkward. Later that night, my girlfriend was hanging out in her room, before she came to mine, and B was texting her about how hot it would be for a threesom. My girlfriend, being naive and nice, was talking about how “what would I even do” and was saying things, that I called encouraging it. I got very upset but know my girlfriend is just really awkward with saying no, and was drunk and didn’t handle it well, I was very upset, but didn’t blame b or B’s girlfriend, I blamed my girlfriend. \n\nIt wasn’t until today, where I finally believed my girlfriend, in her just being bad at saying no (she’s too nice) but once we were talking about it more, I realized that if B was a guy, and was talking about fucking my girlfriend, I would kick her out immediately, I told my girlfriend this, and that’s when she eye openly understood why I was upset, if you just act like she’s a guy, she seems like a fuckboy, even today bringing it up with her, B never apologized, she even jokingly texted my girlfriend “so I guess were not gonna have sex 😂😂😂”. She said it was a joke when I confronted her, but all I could think of, is that is what fuck boys do when they wanna shoot a shot, with little risk. \n\nSo today I decided that she can’t live here, I’m about to go on a three week trip, and even though I trust my girlfriend, I can’t have someone in the house who wants to fuck her. So I pretty much told her I’m an extremely nice way, that she needs to move out, I’m giving her a week because she isn’t on the lease, and she doesn’t have a lot of stuff. She had another place to stay already, 15 minutes away.  My girlfriend said, imagining her as a dude, made her feel uncomfortable, because B would walk in on her changing occasionally, and talked about how hot she was.\n\nAm I the asshole for kicking her out? I know my girlfriend sounds bad in this too, but she doesn’t know when she’s being taken advantage of, and completely sees my point of view once she imagined the roles reversed.",

      "description": "On mobile, sorry. I’ll try to summarize this as best as I possibly can.\n\nThis happened a little over a year ago, but its still something I wonder about. \n\nIt was about two weeks before my sons first birthday, and I was working hard to plan it.  My MIL were talking about the event and I mentioned I would like her opinion on things. I love my MIL, she is a wonderful and thoughtful person, but she has the tendency to take an idea and really run with it. In the beginning when we were talking about the party, I had mentioned that I wanted to do a mickey mouse disney theme (son really loved the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse show on Disney Channel.) The very next day, she showed up at our house with EVERYTHING. Decorations, plates, napkins, party favors, party bags, balloons, and everything you can think of. Everything was themed and color coordinated. At first I felt a little upset about it, because these were some things I wanted to go and get while planning my sons very first birthday party. It seemed like a right of passage type thing and I was kind of robbed of that. Instead I decided to flip my attitude around and think of all of that stuff had been taken care of, now I could focus on other stuff. \n\nI decided I would take care of the cake and a piñata. Two of the last things that had not been taken care of. I made it VERY CLEAR that I was doing this stuff. I sent text messages, and it was verbally said. I sent over pictures of the cake I was copying from the Internet (mickey mouse cake.)\n\nI went to the store and bought a mickey themed piñata and candy to fill it up.   On my way home, I stopped at my in laws house to show it to them and how cute it was. Everyone liked it and that was that. The very next day, MIL sent me a picture of a bigger and better piñata she bought through text. It crushed me a little bit. This may not seem like a huge deal, but I was 3 months pregnant with my second son at the time and I just cried. I felt that everything was done without me. \n\nI told my husband about it, and he laid into me. He said I was ungrateful after “everything everyone has done for us and this party” and that I shouldn’t treat it like a competition. I wasnt, and I simply wanted to plan and possibly get some help planning my sons party. Not have the show stolen from me. Not only did my MIL buy an extra piñata with candy, on the day of the party she also showed up with a birthday cake she made instead. There was not one thing I did alone. \n\nSomething that came of this situation is that I have grown a really strong spine and I have no problem telling people to back off anymore. \n\nDid I make a huge problem out of nothing? The pregnancy hormones really clouded my mind honestly.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Not my story, but my dads girlfriends (who I really support in this story. But this is the view from an outsider) \n\nSo, a few months back my dads girlfriend, who I'll call C, had her kids over (1 girl, who is a gymnast and in college, 3 sons, 1 is depressed, 1 has a wife and three kids, and another who is planning on going into the military. None of this is really important, but it will come up in the story) \n\nC is normally the one to wake up and make everyone breakfast (for my dad, me, my two sisters, and now her four kids, alond with three young children) so, obviously, she put her own kids first, as she hadn't seen them in a long time- since they live with their father about an hour and a half away, and she's always at work (travel nurse). Making breakfast for 12 people is a bit of a stretch. Me and my sisters are still sleeping so she decides to cook for us when we wake up. \n\nBad idea: my dad gets really pissed at her for not waking us up when the food is done. She tries to explain that she was going to cook when we woke up, since we don't like other people, and it was getting crowded. So he waits. We wake up, and she was in the middle of something with her kids so she couldn't cook right away. Now my dad is getting pissier and pissier by the second. He's a big guy, around 6 feet and 300+ lbs- and he has a history of being emotionally and psychologically controlling towards people around him (ex: he makes fun of me and my sisters and constantly tells us our shortcomings) so when he's pissed, it gets scary. She apologizes to us each personally for not making the food yet, and she gets up to do it. My dad, of course, starts yelling at her for not treating HIS kids the same as HER kids. Now, I understand both sides. She lives with him and treats us as her own, but he doesn't treat her kids as even remotely his. My dad tells us to go get dressed to leave, and we do, seeing as we don't want to make him madder. C gets sad and tries to get him to stay,  \"I'm sorry, I'll never do it again\", \"I didn't know I wasn't treating them the same\" etc. \n\nSo we leave for a few hours to do who knows what, and when we get back she had clearly been crying (red eyes, puffy cheeks, etc) but does Dad care? Not one bit. He makes off hand comments about it, making her feel worse and apologize more. As the day goes on, everyone drops the subject, but her kids are clearly mad at my dad for the 'incident'\n\nSide note: I don't know the exact ages of her kids, but the youngest is 16- C is constantly at work so she hardly has any time for herself. On the rare occasion she does, it's either spent sleeping or cooking/cleaning for my dad. \n\nAnother side note, further explaining my dads manipulation: so, C and my dad are planning on getting married, though, SHE has to lose weight before he'll even propose (she has to get down to 160, which I believe she'll look like a twig.) While he's perfectly fine in his almost 400+ lbs lifestyle. \n\n\nRip me a new one here, is C the asshole here? Or is it my dad? ",

I never told anyone about it because it felt good and I remember Amanda being nice. Amanda would tell me that this would end if I told anyone so I kept my mouth shut. This went on for a year until she left for college. I’d see her occasionally when she came home during block parties my neighborhood has. After a couple years though I never saw her again.\n\nFast forward to now I created an instagram account. I thought everyone has one and I don’t have any friends so maybe this would be a good way to connect. I look up people I know and have known and Amanda came into mind. I looked up Amanda and actually managed to find her. It’s messed up, but the first thing I saw was how hot she was and I masturbated to pictures of her. She’s gorgeous and has a prefect body, she looks like a supermodel.\n\nThere’s a girl, Nicole who came to our school in the beginning of the year. We got placed in the same geography class. Nicole looks almost exactly like Amanda. I couldn’t believe my eyes. During class I would stare at her most of the times. Seeing her made me feel giddy and alive. Then I started sort of stalking Nicole. First it was just social media stalking, then I started following her to her classes and to the parking lot when she would leave. She never caught me and I never told her about this.\n\nI have lots of social anxiety and hate interacting with people, but I decided that I was going to try and at least talk to Nicole. So one day in class I sat next to her and started chatting. It was awkward at first, but she and I had some similar hobbies and we got along well. I asked her out a couple months ago and she said yes. So we’ve been dating for a couple months and we’ve only gone to making out and feeling each other up.\n\nShe told me she had sex a handful of times with her previous boyfriend, but isn’t quite ready with me. I’m with that and told her so. When she asked me about my sexual history froze up at first. I lied to her and told her I hadn’t done anything sexual before her. She was suspicious at first(I'm a bad liar and she reads people well), but believes me now. I’ve seen and heard about a lot of breakups and fights over one side lying about their past. Am I the asshole for lying about this to Nicole?",

      "description": "Sorry for the akward title, wasn't sure how to phrase this succinctly \n\nAlso spoilers: compared to a lot of posts here this is probably pretty tame, but it's been bugging me so I thought I would ask.\n\nOh my days off from school and/or when I work closing shifts I swing by the local Coffee Bean to grab coffee and breakfast. One of the girls who works there mentioned she seems me around her apartment building all the time. We realized we both live in the same apartment building called \"[Street Name] Court\"\n\nI was still half asleep from working the closing shift last night so I just absentmindedly said something like \"Oh wow, I'm in unit 201, which one are you\", didn't really think much of it. \n\nImmediately her tone/body language changed and she said \"I'm not telling you that dude\" and then I overheard her commenting to her coworker about how oblivious I am for asking.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Like, we established we both live in the same building, I was just trying to continue the conversation before I got my coffee rather than stand there in awkward silence. \n\nIt's 100% her business if she doesn't want to tell me where she lives, but she was the one who brought up that we live in the same building. \n\nI don't know, it's minor but it's had me second guessing myself all morning. Maybe I just need more sleep and coffee. ",

      "description": "A bit of backstory first, 2 years ago i graduated from highschool and took the university entrance exam in my country (1 exam for all the unis) i wasn’t really sure what i wanted to study on higher education but my parents wanted me to study medicine and i’ve always avoided confrontation with that. So i took the exam and went abroad to study medicine, which cost my parents 15.000€ for the prepatory course and the first semester over 2 years. I’m grateful that they allowed me to do this but i never actually wanted to study medicine at all. \nI allowed myself to get pumped up talking to my parents and their friends all the time and this caused them to think that i wanted it aswell. When i tell them about this they don’t acknowledge it being their influence\nYet i told my parents about what i thought i wanted to study around the same time again (endustrial design) but my mother dismissed it by saying “you only want to do that because you’re lazy and you can’t even draw well” (plot twist: i do draw well).\nI also had a mild anxiety disorder for the last few years and it really flared up this year while forcing myself to study medicine. It once came to the point of being suicidal around 2 months ago. I don’t want to force myself anymore if it does this to me. \nI went back to my home country a week ago and i decided to work full time and prepare for the entrance exams again for this year. And my mother still wants me to go back and continue studying medicine and says that i will basically fuck up my only chance at life if i quit it.\n\nSo AITA for deciding to drop out and start preparing for the exam again?",

      "description": "Trigger: childloss, termination\n\nI am almost 36 weeks with my \"first\" baby\nIn reality this is my 6th pregnancy, with 3 early losses. I have been a complete neurotic wreck.\n\nAnyhow, my mother was quite nasty to me through my very first pregnancy, escaping an abusive relationship with sperm donor, and essentially from everyone around me I was coerced into terminating. And then completely ignored, to try and grieve and heal alone.\n\nForward through losses, turbulent relationships, moving in and out of my parental home, and eventually a confrontation at my parents which led to a psych ward stay. I moved out for the last time, got myself in a great position in life, and am about to meet this baby. \n\nI had reached out to my grandma early on with HG (hyperemesis gravidarum), needing assistance to the hospital. My mother was with her, and found out about the pregnancy. Since, she has gone all sweet about our relationship, over the moon about this baby and her \"finally\" becoming a grandmother. Refusing to acknowledge any of the loss we talked about beforehand and then after this reveal.\n\nI had friends wanting to throw me a baby shower; she has taken over all planning, hosting, and has invited her friends I don't even know (although I am still very grateful for the support). SO and I decided not to find out the gender of our baby. My friend is doing a fun \"gender misreveal\" cake pop treat, one woman she invited (I don't know her) wants to do a gender reveal cake, but BOOKED ME AN ULTRASOUND TO FIND OUT THE GENDER PRE CONSULTATION and then mom makes me reach out to this stranger to tell her no.\n\nThen, she's telling me how she wants to take my newborn for chiropractic care, preaching how it made such a difference in mine and my siblings lives. Which, sure, it may have, but I am feeling railroaded before this child is even born. \n\nI don't even have the heart yet to tell her that she will not be in the room for delivery with me, as I've been having awful flashbacks about being driven to the hospital to terminate.. and I just don't feel I need that stress when I'm trying to hopefully have my first living baby. I feel as though she assumes she will be there. I am stressed about the dynamic of the relationship, and I am stressed about her trying to push her ideals on my brand new baby and my life, which has done best when she is not in it. AITA?!",

      "description": "I have a female friend (let's call her A) with whom I've had sex with regularly and I've had sex with another girl friend (she'll be B) too, of course regarding sex things I'm way too cautious so I wear condoms with both of them.\n\nAnyways, A sent my a message today asking me if I wanted to see her and I told her no because I didn't feel like it and I was working, so she got like \"yeah, OK...\". Fast-forward two hours she sent me another message asking if I had sex with someone else because she had her annual analysis and something was \"off\". The first thing I ask is if she's preggo and she says no, but she tells me that her doctor asked her to have an HPV test because of the results she had. So I'm like \"oh shit\" and thanked her for letting me know and that I'll tell B to get some tests too just to be safe.\n\nThen, A starts going bananas (or at least that's how I felt it), telling me that if I trust all my sexual partners and \"I know I'm taking care, what about them?\" and of course I get defensive because it feels like she's telling me I can't take care of my health and that I'm banging sick people without caring. Then she nags me about not wanting to see her earlier and that how else would she get sick if it wasn't for me, and I recall she told me she was seeing her ex before we started hooking up so I told her what if it was your ex. She got all mad and started again with the same thing about my other sexual partner.\n\nAt the end she told me that her platelets came low in the test so HPV was an option, but I confronted her for trying to blame me before fully explaining the whole situation and she got mad again.",

      "description": "As of December my company went under and I got laid off from my job and haven't had any significant income coming into the house for close to 2 months now because of it. I recently decided to lower my standards a bit and take a lower level job than what I've been working the past few years just as a way to get some income and stop stressing about the money so much. I say stressing about the money because my GF got used to me paying for all of both our living expenses since she works min wage serving jobs and I've been making around 5-6x what she makes so I didn't mind covering things like rent, food expenses, etc. while she really only has to spend on her car payment and gas. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways with Valentines being the other day and me just having started a new job the week before she seemed to expect me taking her out to a fancy dinner like I normally would've done, when I had very little left over in savings and wanted to be able to make rent instead of being short and needing to take out a loan just to go out one night. Keep in mind, even with me being unemployed the past few months, I haven't got a single cent from her towards any living expenses because \"she doesn't make enough\" and \"I have savings I can use to cover this while I job hunt\". Now I take some of the responsibility for not being completely responsible and having a ton in savings like I should've but regardless I still carry my own weight and stay able to do so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to last night and we get into a big argument because she came home at 3am saying she was with a few friends who took her out to dinner because they felt bad \"her lazy bf\" wouldn't take her out for a dinner on Valentines, trying to make me feel like a piece of shit for keeping a roof over our heads since she wasn't contributing anything to it and I'm not trying to go under over a dinner when the first of the month rolls around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like worrying about my financial health is a bigger priority than any hallmark holiday but you guys tell me, AITA or am I acting within reason for prioritizing personal finance over a date night?",

      "description": "HELLO PROBATIVE PROCTOLOGISTS!\n\nI am poor. I recently had a small windfall of $5k, which I have saved $3.5k, spent $1k on stuff I really desperately needed (new shoes, repairs) and put aside $500 for me to spend freely on enjoyable stuff just for me.\n\nBecause i am poor, and have been for some time, I have long had \"supper parties\", where i make a few dishes at home, and my equally poor millenial friends come over and we have a kind of potluck netflix night. My ONLY rules Ive set down for these supper parties are:\n\n* good vibes only.\n* no spending over $10 on your supper dish\n* if you don't have a kitchen or can't bring a dish, bring at a smile, bring an ingredient, and help clean 4 dishes in the sink before you go.\n* HOMEMADE FOOD ONLY\n\nI started these because I couldnt go out because  I am so painfully broke. A year has gone and these rules have worked out PERFECTLY. I have about 15 people over every 2 weeks, my little shitty apartment gets spotlessly clean when the night is over, and everyone has a good time.\n\nEnter Marlame. Marlame is a friend of mine who I recently invited. Marlame is as poor as the rest of us, but 4 parties ago, Marlame brought store-bought cookies, violating Rule 4. I was really nice about it, but told her next time to make something OR do some dishes.\n\nNext party comes around... she buys 4 pizzas. UHMMM.. NO. Rule 4 violation AGAIN. AND WORSE-- others began to bring store-bought stuff, taking Merlane's lead. Again. I was gracious and told her not to do it again.\n\nNext party: she pulls the same shit. It was worse now. When I ask folks to bring an ingredient, at the end of the night, my supper parties usually end with us all making some kind of franken-food from the ingredients people bring over. It has been amazing, usually tasty, and cheap fun. Since Merlane has broken rule 4, however, people attending have slacked off and just gotten stuff from the store and kind of killed off this part of the party.\n\nAt that party, I politely reminded everyone of the 4 basics. Next party, everything was back on track! Marlame called me to ask how many people would be at the next party so she could order Chipotle Catering for everyone.\n\nI gave her a hard NO and told her not to come at all. Her presence since she started coming to supper has made it LESS FUN. She keeps bitching to us all about how much stuff costs... then spends $50-100 every 2 weeks on her supper dish which she was instructed specifically not to do. Literally everyone at my suppers are legit poor as fuck recent college grads. No one wants or needs to hear that shit. The #1 reason Supper Night exists is I am poor, as are my friends, and we were JUST FINE making our own magic, sharing, and getting a little tipsy together *for as little money as is humanly possible*.\n\nMarlane also chewed me out and started posting to social media claiming I excluded her because she was fat blah blah blah... i mean she IS fat. I am very thin due to poverty and not having a car, I am not on a diet.... unless by diet you mean \"eating maximum colories possible within budget\" which isn't much.\n\nSupper happened this weekend. Nobody missed Marlame. Supper was mostly back to its normal thing. Marlame spammed known attendees while they were at my place, and we all had a laugh at her expense in real time. SHE was messaging US. We were all in one place, and she was spouting bullshit, so while we did, as a group, mock her... she literally spend an entire friday night spamming 15+ people's social media and Instas about this drama... that she created.... and what else are drunk folks, all in a room, getting spammed by the same person, gonna do other than mock her??\n\nAITA for putting a hard NO MARLAME rule in place at the next supper party? I mean no talking about her, referencing her, inviting her, discussing her, NOTHING. I just want this drama to end so we can go back to enjoying supper as a group.\n\n",

My girlfriend and i agree to stop talking them and block them on everything due to the immature and nasty things being said. proceed to a few months ago Maria shows up to my girlfriends work to apologize. both agree to stop being angry about it. I tell my girlfriend i don't see me ever being friends with them or wanting to be around them again she agrees that she's not going to be hanging out with them anymore either due to being bad influences(bad spending habits, not focusing while at work by being distracting )\n\n Fast forward to this week where my girlfriend starts posting new pictures of her hanging out with Maria. Starts acting different again dumping money on unnecessary items even though she wants to move into an apartment in the next 8 months together and we've talked about being more financially stable for this move. \n\nwhat gets at me most is she always ask where i am or what i'm doing. but she didn't tell me that she was hanging out with them again? just feels like broken trust when she knows how i feel about them",

      "description": "AItA? Ok so in high school I hung out with this kid I’m gonna call Conor. Conor and I weren’t close, barely more than acquaintances. After we graduated we didn’t see each other for a solid year or so. Every so often I’d see him when we both hung out with our home friends when we came back from college. Never alone together, never growing close. \n\nAs we get older I only ever see Conor at parties involving binge drinking. He always gets way more drunk than anyone else and picks fights and gets angry. He basically sucks to be around. \n\nSo I throw a few of these parties over the last few years and every single time I see him he gets so drunk he can’t see straight then he asks me for his keys so he can drive home and “feed his dog” at 1 AM. I have never let him drive but now I just don’t want to be around the guy. \n\nLike 2 months ago he sent me a bunch of drunk Snapchats talking about how he loves me and how I’m one of his best friends. \n\nA week before Thanksgiving he texted me and asked me if we can get drunk together the Wednesday before. This is not the first time he’s asked me to get drunk with him during a school break since my last party but I just want nothing to do with him or his drinking habits. \n\nI don’t answer his texts or snaps. Am I a dick? Should I be hanging out with the kid? ",

Our family has a rule: we can live within the house rent-free so long as we are either attending school or working. I pay for my books and classes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTuesday night, I became violently ill (TMI: nausea, diarrhea). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not have a gallbladder. I underwent surgery during high school to have it removed. I can typically bounce back from upset stomach but it worsened with aches, fatigue, no appetite, and continuous nausea. I remained home from classes on Wednesday and Thursday, notifying my professors on both days. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI texted my parents on Wednesday: please do not wake me up should I be asleep when you come home. I am so tired and so nauseous that I could scream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom suffers with chronic pancreatitis and declared I have *no* idea what pain is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally received test scores back from two different classes. Both were the first tests. I received a 72% on one -- with the professor explaining people do the worst on this one and including the other scores (C's were the majority).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther score was an 82% -- which I am not proud. I know it can be better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer reaction was an immediate guilt trip, declaring this is what happens when you skip a week worth of school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI literally could not sit through classes with my nausea. I was woken up by how bad it was. I could not be up for more than a few minutes without being dizzy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was allowed to makeup a missed assignment over e-mail. I check to see what was missed. I have been doing assignments when the illness allows. I ask other people what was missed and request to see their lecture notes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Yeah, but their notes compared to yours?

      "description": "So a little backstory, I've been allergic to peanuts for my entire life, but the severity of my allergy has significantly decreased. My family used to buy and use peanut butter anyways while I was younger, until I finally told them that the smell would make me nauseous and I'd prefer if they could switch to almond butter or another substitute (I'm not allergic to almonds). They complied and all was well, save for a few complaints from my sister. \n\nNow I'm in college sharing an apartment with a friend of mine that loooves peanut butter and somehow always forgets I have an allergy (sometimes when we get groceries he buys bread with nuts on it and I have to go back and get my own afterwards). I told him the same thing I told my parents and he seemed upset about it, and cited the fact that he's allergic to pork but says he doesn't mind if I buy bacon, etc. ( I haven't bought any regardless just to be safe). He begrudgingly put the pb back on the shelf and that was that.\n\n...until a day later when he came home from class with a jar of peanut butter. I told him I was upset about it and he couldn't understand why, since he said he will try and be careful to wash the knife and plate, and also doesn't care if I have pork even while he's there. I tried to explain that it's a different situation but he doesn't see it the same way. \n\nAgain, I haven't had a reaction while we've lived together, but just seeing peanut butter in the fridge and the few times he hasn't actually cleaned the mess has stressed me out. He has tried switching to almond butter but that lasted about a day, and he said he misses pb too much. \n\nSince asking hasn't worked I resorted to trying to guilt him into giving it up by saying I will blame him if I do eventually have a reaction, mild or not.\n\nAITA for continuing to push him to give up peanut butter?\n\nTL;DR roommate loves peanut butter and I'm allergic, I try to make him quit eating it.",

Lately he's been caught taking money on a few seperate occasions, with the most so far been over a hundred pounds, he's even gone into people's pockets and taken notes without them knowing.  Whenever we ask him why he does it he says he's trying to save up for a PS4.\n\nAnyway, it's my other sisters sons birthday today. He comes through from the bedroom quite upset because he's lost q sizeable chunk of birthday money. He says he left it and the other boy was the only one who seen where he put it down. By this point my sister and her 4 year old had gone home, so I called her and asked if she could check if he had it. She got really upset about this and both her and her husband started shouting down the phone about how unfair the accusation was and so on. She demanded an apology and I refused, saying based on how often he has done this I thought it was only reasonable to ask. To save an argument I eventually relented and apologised, although they at no point actually mentioned whether it not they'd checked if he had it.\n\nThe time of year peer pressured me into what I feel was an unjustified apology, but it was something I did to avoid Christmas drama nonetheless. It's also noteworthy that it wasn't originally my assumption, it was my dad who first thought of it but he wasn't comfortable asking them, sonic was the one to make the call.\n\nSo Reddit, if I'm missing anything out you'd like to know please feel free to ask, but AITA in this situation?",

I asked her to please arrive at the office this week at 8:30 in the morning since I would be running a bit late (I usually aim to be in by 8:15.) I got in around 8:54 this AM and she still wasn’t there. Now I’m feeling a bit annoyed.\n\nThen, I decide with my boyfriend to take a Friday and the following Monday off next month. I send an email to both of my managers, and get a reply back that my counterpart had already asked for that Monday off earlier in the day after she heard me talking with another colleague about taking those days off.Now I’m pissed. Maybe it’s my work ethic but I don’t understand how someone could be on the job less than a month and then show up late (not even just this morning) AND ask for time off already! One of us has to be in the office at all times, that’s the whole point of having two people working with our titles. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for getting upset and potentially speaking with my managers about her job performance thus far?",

We got back together but I eventually found out about her through instagram, and the only way I confirmed it was by directly messaging the girl, he didn't fess up until that happened, he lied about it beforehand.  I was more pissed about the lying because it we were just starting out and we weren't exclusive when that happened.  Ok.  I still feel ambivalent about my actions and his.  We both didn't act right in that situation.  We're getting better after 3 or so months, or so I thought.  I still have my insecurities about him but I am trying my best to trust him.  The thing is, to this day, he refuses to add me on instagram again. He also doesn't call me his girlfriend but says we are  together.  I just feel like we aren't on the same page about us.  His refusal to add me on instagram, feels disrespectful.  Am I the asshole for thinking that his actions in regards to him not adding me on instagram are just red flags and wrong on his part?  I am not doing it to be superficial, I'm not asking him to add pictures of me, I don't have any of him but am I just supposed to be ok with not being friends on social media?  His refusal just makes me feel like he's hiding something.   I've told him how I feel about it but he keeps saying he'll think about it but after several months nothing has changed.  I don't know who the asshole is in this situation.  ",

      "description": "So my mom has been sick the past few days and I just took her to the doctor's office. We come home and I bring out some of this rice cake stuff that we had from new year's. I was cutting it when I realized it had gotten a little moldy on the side. I prepare to cut off that part and then throw it in the pan just to be safe. However, my mom interjects and says she'll do it. She slices a thing slice off, just enough to get the layer of mold off. I tell her that we should cut off a bigger chunk just to be safe as well as saying the microwave doesn't heat evenly so it's not really cooking everything-we should throw it in the pan to be safe. She says it's fine and she already cut off the mold, see? I repeat my concern at which point she says I can eat however I want but she's fine with this. I tell her I'm more worried about her since she's old and sick, thus more susceptible; I'm young so I'll likely be fine regardless. It's at this point that she tells me I'm talking too much and I should shut my mouth.\n\nNow some background. When my mom thinks she's right, your opinion doesn't matter anymore. Doesn't matter what you say or how much you prove her wrong. Also, she has a tendency to disparage and say pretty hurtful things when she's angry (personal attacks). She's not a bad person but has some flaws. \n\n  \n\nI get pretty mad but I just stew over it. However, it starts up again and I tell her to just be quiet and go do her own thing. This sets her off and she launches into a tirade of how she can say whatever she wants because she's my mom but I have no right to say it back. It escalates until I decide to get revenge on the rice cake. I take it out and throw it on the floor. She threatens to eat it anyways so to ensure she doesn't (and she's not eating food off the ground just to prove a point) I step in it and then throw it away. Now she's saying I just destroyed our entire relationship. ",

My grandmother particularly thinks this is a good idea and considers her “family”. \n\nRecently my family and some friends went out for vacation and gf went with, we were away for a week. She kept mostly to herself, refused to come out her room and bossed my cousin around. By Wednesday she started making threats and throwing cue balls at my cousin(she missed every throw so he’s ok!). After I had heard there was some arguments going on, myself and my family had occupied the room her and my cousin were in. She left, not wanting to bully him around his family. \n\nMyself and my bf tried to talk to my cousin, saying he needs to get rid of her and to possibly try to get custody of his kid whenever the baby comes. He agreed that he wants to get away from her but was also very protective of her. Saying she’s “not crazy”, “this is how she loves me” “she’s just making sure I’m not talking to any girls”. It was really sad hearing this. I let it go then and went on with my vacation. \n\nNow it’s been about two weeks since our vacation and I found out from my mom that gf has broken into my aunt’s home and damaged some of her belongings, my younger cousins belongings, and her boyfriend’s belongings. Considering this isn’t the first time this happened, something inside me snapped. I sent my cousin a text saying to get rid of her and that she won’t stop. \n\nHe argued back saying it’s none of my business and that they’re meant for each other \n\nI was speechless but told him to leave his crazy ass girlfriend and stop keeping her around. I left it at that. \n\nI later get a call from my grandma saying that was inappropriate and to not make a pregnant woman cry. Idk how she knew that’s what I said but I had to live with it. I argued back that my cousin shouldn’t put up with gf and she IS crazy. My grandma reiterated to not say that and it’s rude. \n\n\nTLDR: Cousin’s gf is abusive and kinda crazy. I called her crazy to my cousin. Grandma thinks I was out of line. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My niece got engaged on Valentines day, she is getting married the end of April. We are very close to their family, closer than any of her other Aunts and Uncles. Her dad is in the military, and we happened to live close to them a couple places where they were stationed, and did a lot of holidays with just our two families.  However, they live far away right now, and the wedding is a several hour plane ride away. I only have 2 personal days at work, and it will use up at least one, and maybe both of them.\n\nBut the most important point is that I am not allowed to go to the wedding. She is mormon, I am not any longer. So I will sitting outside while the wedding takes place. I will be able to go to the reception, which will be an open house affair. My husband, who can attend the wedding, is planning on going. I doubt that I will have any time with her at the reception, or before or after the wedding, of course it is her and her husband's day and they will be busy.\n\nMy argument is that I don't need to travel 1,500 miles to not attend a wedding.

      "description": "My partner (23f) and I (27m) have been living in our apartment for 2 years, going on 3. Our landlord has given us a letter notifying the increase of rent (2.5%), which was slightly higher than last year's (2%). We agreed on the increase during the previous year as to not create any animosity. However, this year we decided to decline the rent increase due to our landlord not doing any work in our unit since we have moved in, and also ghosting on us when we needed them. Our building is slowly degrading with multiple leaks in the hallway and holes that have not been covered up after work has been done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst thing we have noticed is that he only gave us a letter to accept the increase and omitted the part where we would either reject the increase or terminate our lease once it ended. We had to print out the form ourselves and mail it to him. Once he received the letter he wanted to meet with us to discuss why he was increasing the rent and negotiate. He did not follow up on us to meet after we gave him our availabilities and explained to him how we were only home during evenings and weekends due to both of us having full-time jobs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few days of our last email to him, he called both of us during the day. I called him back during my lunch break and he listed a few reasons that contributed towards the increase. His reasons were the increase in salary for his employees, having to replace some pipes in the building after they had burst, apartments being taxed more than duplexes (with no proof), refusing to send us how he calculated our rent increase and proposing that we come to his office to see his bills, and explaining how he added a few extra dollars as a buffer for himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe attempted to guilt me by using an analogy of how he was an employee asking for a raise from his boss for doing good work and that if the boss were to refuse his proposal, he would feel like his work had no value. For as long as we have been here, he has not done any work in our unit. There have been times where he has not given us notice before contractors entered our apartment. The first time our lightbulb needed to be changed, he sent someone over without our knowledge, who then told us to contact him whenever future lightbulbs needed changing. We attempted to contact our landlord about borrowing a ladder to reach them when our hallway and bedroom light bulbs burnt out, but he never responded to either of us, which lead to us having to invest in a ladder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter speaking to him on the phone, we sent him an email proposing an increase of 1/4 of what he offered. He responded with how our proposal was insulting and asking if his offer was insulting to us and came across as very rude and unprofessional. He asked us to reconsider or else he would get the rent fixed from the administration in charge of rental housing. We stayed firm to our proposal and he has not replied to us since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "for context, i live in a dorm that’s three bedrooms connected to a central living room. i directly share a bedroom with my roommate.\n\nso my roommate started dating a guy back in october and they soon developed a habit of regularly asking me to sit out in the living room so they could have the bedroom to make out in (i know for a fact theyre just making out and not having sex). they were pretty bad with boundaries at first, but we set some ground rules (weren’t allowed past 10:30 pm, had to let my cat stay in the room if he wanted, etc) and they respected them... but i was still miserable.\n\nnow every time they were technically asking me to leave, but ive never successfully been able to say no. whenever i say no they get pouty and there’s an awkward tension in the room until i change my mind. i also feel guilty saying no because they dont have anywhere else to go; their bf had to get a restraining order against his roommate it’s so bad and his living room constantly has people filing in and out. but ours doesnt; we only have one other roommate and he’a fairly quiet so they would have some privacy if they used the living room. last week our third roommate went on a trip so it was just me and my roommate; they invited their bf over and kicked me out even though they literally would have had the same amount of privacy in the living room as they would in the bedroom bc i was the only other person in the dorm. i tried to say no because being kicked out means i have to lug all my stuff out there and their only argument was that the couch was “uncomfortable”\n\nbut i end up out on the couch again and so that night when im allowed back in the room i told my roommate i was done with getting kicked out. they agreed right away, so i didnt really get to articulate this, but essentially i had two points: 1) im paying thousands of dollars in rent to get kicked out whenever my roomie feels like it 2) this isnt solving the problem so much as transferring it to me. im an introvert with anxiety so the room is my safe space and being kicked out is stressful for me\n\ni still feel bad because they dont have anywhere else to go. our living room is fairly private but sometimes our third roommate will have friends over and it gets rowdy.

The guy did not deliver the food for over half an hour after it says he left the store. We left instructions in the procided section on how to call us if they could not get in our building. There is an intercom out front that will call our cell phones. No possible way to get the number wrong. He said that he was there for a while trying to get in but the number is wrong. I had even waited out front for 10 min when it said he left the store. It was raining and I wanted to be there so they would not have to wait .Nobody was there so I finally went back inside. He finally shows up and I take the food, say thanks and signed for the bill. I gave no tip. I felt bad because I understand that they mostly work for tips in service jobs. I don't like to stiff people who are helping me. I also think that tips is literally an acronym for (to insure prompt service). We did not get prompt service.

      "description": "My roommate and best friend (basically brother to me) has had a german shepard for about a year now. He got her when she was about 3 weeks old and drove 2 states away and back to buy her. At first he took care of her in the best of ways. About a month in I could see him starting to lose focus of her, he had a full time job. And I would help with the basics, feeding and taking her out etc. Then he got another part time on top of his full time. I told him it wasnt a good idea since he already spent minimal time with the dog. Eventually I ended up doing most of the caring for the dog, and he realizes he has to get rid of her but constantly changes his mind about it. I've stopped looking after the dog because the more I do the less he does. So there are days where I feel the dog is neglected. Is it wrong for me to do that? I feel bad mostly for the dog. ",

I would always clean up after myself and make sure I wouldn’t leave any mess \n\nHe came back after the weekend and thanked me. I continued to hand out with him for a while until his sister came home. I was very aware that I did not make any mess what so ever. Not even a stain. But when his sister comes back she lies to him.\n\nShe gets angry because I used there novelty toilet paper cause I couldn’t find anything else. The place was spotless I mean I even came over before she arrived to help him clean every single bit and it was spotless. She blamed me for every single thing that happend that I diddent do and have proof of. \n\nHis parents come home and his sister cries to them now we have a falling out. He said that it’s my fault and blames me for the stain. I made sure there wasn’t any and if I did accidentally make one I would pay for damage or clean it myself. \n\nHis sister also accused me of stealing but when my mate called his mum she took what they thought I stole with them.\n\nI told him “your sister is the biggest fucking asshole for accusing me of this when I have done nothing but help you and your sister out.” \n\nAm I The Asshole for saying that?",

      "description": "This situation is over a year old but things have still been not good between us since. \n\nTo set the scene, I'm at uni right now studying in a field that requires typically 2 years work experience (usually unpaid) to gain a shot at a junior position, post graduation. My degree offered a placement work year that meant I could get a student loan to fund my living costs while gaining that all-important experience. \n\nA few years prior, my mother (who lives \\~3 hours away from me) has some heart trouble. I do what I can to look after her, collecting her from the hospital, making the 6 hour round trip when I can to cut her hair or help her when she's had trouble working the mobile phone I got her (she's a technophobe, bless her). \n\nOne of my brother's announces he's getting married. I'm happy for him, his now-wife is a great person and I think they are perfect together! Only snag is, they set the wedding smack in the middle of the summer my placement year starts. I had been offered an internship overseas at a company that could give me very useful experience and great connections for the future. \n\nThey made it very clear when they wanted me to start, which was before the wedding, and the minimum term I should work there. They had a plan in place to help me settle in the non-English speaking environment and for both parties to gain from the arrangement. Miss that and I couldn't go at all, with nothing else lined up for that period. The company was situated far enough that flying back for a day or two was completely unaffordable for me.\n\nI eventually break the news to my now-SIL that I wouldn't be able to make it. She tells me my brother will be devastated and I apologise, saying I wished I could be there but there wasn't anything I could do. I hoped they would understand that this is my career and I take it extremely seriously.\n\nInstead of telling me he is upset that I can't make their wedding, my brother brings up our mother's health and basically says \"How can you move away when your mother is seriously ill?\" \n\nWhile I can completely understand him being unhappy at me for missing his wedding, using our mother's health like this felt like emotional blackmail. When people try to corner me I come out fighting, so I told him it was wrong of him to say this when I knew more and did more about her condition than he ever did. Communication has all but shut down between us.",

      "description": "So there's this kid who comes in every day to empty the trash bins at each of our desks in our office. He seems like a nice enough kid, but he's like...aggressively friendly. He sees some of the toys and collectibles around my desk and tries to engage me in conversation about them...\"Oh, hey, Star Wars, cool...did you see the new ones? What did you think?\" To which I say \"Yep\" and \"they're cool.\" Normally I have way more to say about Star Wars, but I just don't want to engage with this kid. I feel like he's trying too hard to be friends. Even to the point of telling me about his weekend plans totally unprovoked...\"Hey man, I'm going to see that new Dragonball Z movie tomorrow...\" which is weird because there isn't anything remotely anime related on my desk...but I guess he just figures I'm into geeky shit in general, which I pretty much am, but not Dragonball...anyway, I digress. My response to that line was just a brief, \"I really don't know anything about Dragonball\". That's basically the rudest or most curt that I've been to him. Otherwise I've always just said \"hello\" and \"thanks\" whenever he collects the trash.\n\nOther people in my department are far more friendly and talk to him a lot more. And then I get the feeling that they're silently judging me for not asking him how his gaming YouTube channel is going.\n\nI just don't really feel like making a new friend I guess. And I would engage more with someone else, I just feel like with this guy I'm opening a door to someone who's going to think I'm his buddy when I really don't want to be. But I can't say that without hurting feelings, right? Plus, without knowing his exact age, if I had to guess I'd say I'm easily 10 years older than he is, maybe 15.\n\nLike, I guess I'm being kind of a dick to him, but not really, I'm just not going out of my way to be friendly. And it's not because he's the kid who empties the trash. That has nothing to do with it. I was super friendly with the last guy who did that. But I also never felt like there was a possibility of that person asking me if I wanted to get lunch together or anything, which I don't ever want to do with just about anyone I work with. I'm just not that guy.\n\nI don't know...am I the asshole for just nipping this in the bud by putting up a wall now instead of just being polite in a situation where I think it might be misconstrued as an invitation for friendship?",

      "description": "I came to a tailor to make my dress for my engagement. She said it would take 2 weeks, I could take it on March 01st, I MADE A DEPOSIT OF 1/3 for it (Im sure it was enough for the clothes and decorations). It was expensive but because I hoped it would be great so I didn't care much about the money. The dress must be ready before March 07 as I need to go home on March 08 and my engagement is on March 09.\n\nWhy I chose her? I live an hour driving from my hometown, where the engagement is hosted, and the tailor was around 10 mins from my place. I chose her because the first time I came to her she was very helpful so I trusted her, and because she is near me so I can come and try on early and make any change if needed.\n\nAnd here the story began... As I was busy on March 01, I came to her on March 02, thought that it was ready. BUT IT DIDN'T. She said that she thought the due date was March 04, the dress needed some decorations, it would take some hours and will be ready on March 03. I was very angry. On March 03, I came to her, the dress was ugly, the decorations were terrible so I asked her to change it. I told her that I would come back on March 05. As on March 05 I was busy again so I texted her saying that I couldn't come, I would come on the next day, March 06, she said it was fine, no problem. BUT yesterday, March 06, she wasn't there, I called her, she said she was away and couldn't come back immediately as she....needed to buy some flowers for the Woman's Day (her daughter owned a flower shop next to the tailor). Again, I was very angry. She asked me to come again today, March 07.\nToday, I called her before I came, she also said sorry for the same reason: she needed to buy the flowers. She said she would call me when she was back.\n\nIm writing this at 07:40 PM and I need to go to my home early tomorrow.\n\nThis is over my limitation!!!! I run out of patience.\n\nI had a backup dress. It wasn't the best but I can help me now.\n\nSo AM I AN ASSHOLE IF I WOULDN'T COME TO TAKE MY DRESS AND WOULDN'T PAY HER????",

He went on for a little bit about how the one he wanted me to do was better. \n\nI’m a small, so I might look like I just started lifting and don’t know what I’m doing, but but half of my job is literally to understand different motions and how to target which for different purposes and plan around that. I take people through exercises and tweak them according to each individual client accounting for injuries, mobility, etc. \n\nI didn’t want to start a debate with some random at the gym, but also felt like I should take a firm stand that I’m not doing what he suggested. When he finished, I just said “Cool. I like my way better so I’m sticking to it.” \n\nHe gave me a sort of frustrated look but walked away without saying anything. He just sat down to play with his phone. \n\nWas I the asshole here? \n\n",

Z offered to smoke us out before eating (maybe as a reciprocation for using the gift card?

      "description": "Hi there, so I normally lurk on twitch streams, but I saw a smash youtuber (competitive player too) on today who I liked, so I decided to come check out his stream. He was talking about how character x was better than he thought, and also that character y was really good. Now he had made a prerelease tier list, but what he was saying went against that. I said in twitch chat, \"Make a new tier list.\" :) And he said don't be an \"ignorant fuck\" in a kinda joking way. Then he said that he didn't like chat telling him what to do. I responded with I didn't mean to offend him, and that I was a fan of his character z since smash 4. Following that I was really confused why he was mean to me. He went on complaining about chat in general then. \n\n\nNow shortly after this he ran some ads, and I made the traditional twitch chat joke (common in streams I watch at least) \"ads in 2018 lul\". It's a stupid joke that I see all the time. Streamer comes back and calls me \"fucking scum\". My response was \"you are kinda being an ass, take a joke.\" and then I was banned.\n\n\n\nAITA? I know I could have handled it better, but I was really lost on what to do in that situation. I still like the guy and didn't mean to make him so mad. Thank you.      ",

Her \"childhood story\" has changed multiple times and shes one of the people would say something along the lines of \"and everyone clapped\". She only recently started speaking of depression since she began hanging with my friend group (3 out of 4 of the original people have actually been diagnosed). She tells us /other people that shes depressed because she wears dark clothes and was \"emo\". Which, obviously isn't usually what makes a person depressed. \n\nThe original members of the group have had serious talks of depression/anxiety, but she only cracks jokes (Which I realize could be a coping method, but is possibly unlikely.)  about how shes dead inside and other stereotypical things that typically aren't true about depression. She's admitted to being able to make herself cry and using that to an advantage in class. \n\nI do feel guilty about not beliving her, but with her consistent lying and her not really knowing what depression is, it makes it kind of hard to have trust in her.",

      "description": "Some background information here: My boyfriend and I have been dating for around 2 years now and met as college students on the same course. Before we started dating he liked another girl who unfortunately for him, did not feel the same way. \n\nRecently I found out that while we were visiting our families at home he had met the girl at her house. He never told me he was going to meet her, so it came as quite a shock as he knows I would feel uncomfortable with this. It turns out that he had gone to meet her and they both started drinking together - eventually drinking too much that they both went to bed. Together. In the same bed. \n\nNow I don't know if anything else happened with them together that night - however it is easy to let my mind wander and read between the lines. This was a girl that my bf spent years pining after so you can probably understand my concerns right now.\n\nWhen he was confronted by a mutual friend of ours about this he simply replied that I would not be able to handle the situation, so it would be best not to tell me. However, he stood by his own opinion that he had done nothing wrong, and it was fine to sleep in bed with a female friend.\n\nSo reddit; am I overreacting at this situation, or do I have a reason to be concerned?",

      "description": "Let's get right into it. I got into the college of my dreams in November of senior year, and I was so excited. C (friend) and her sister had missed *at least* a month of school, so me and my friends S and R kinda assumed they weren't going to graduate. By some miracle they did, and while C's sister took a year off before planning to go to mortuary school, C was going to college. My college, which I thought was a bit odd, since it was expensive, I knew she didn't have a scholarship like I did, and she had never expressed any interest in going to college.\n\nCut to college and I was having a meh time. Roommate up and left before thanksgiving for no reason, I was failing math and chem, and I wasn't making that many friends, so I tried to stay in touch with C. Key word tried. She was in a different dorm, a different major, and we had no classes together. Whenever I tried to arrange a meet up, she either wouldn't answer me or just say no, she could or something like that. Half way through the year she stopped responding to me altogether and I had to ask her sister what was up. Turns out, she didn't even make it a whole semester before something happened and she left school.\n\nThis year I went to a community college, and guess what. In August, C told me she was going to the same one. I was a little weirded out, but once again, ignored it, figuring she didn't know what she wanted to do and heard me talking about it and figured it was a good idea. After school started I texted her a few times, asking if she wanted to have lunch together and shit. Once I asked \"Hey, where are you?\" and she responded, \"Jesus Christ why do you want to know?\" like I just wanted to see if you wanted to grab something with me. I stopped seeing and hearing from her two weeks after school started and once again had to go to her sister to find out what was up cause Buddha knows C wasn't answering me. Turns out she dropped out too and now wanted to go to college in Canada to, and I quote, \"Get as far away from here as possible.\" We haven't talked since Christmas when I stopped by her house to drop off a present for their family, and she told me she wanted to go to Canada. \n\nAbout three weeks ago, we had to put my dog down. I was devastated. C was the first one I texted, and she didn't respond, cause it was only 2pm. Lily was put down and I posted something on instagram, which she liked. Two weeks later, she texted me a picture of a random child, who my friend S told me was her 'nephew' which she knew I didn't care about children, and said, \"I just heard about Lily, I'm sorry.\" I was furious. Bitch, you liar, no you didn't, you saw my post and liked it, even if you didn't see my text. I blocked her on twitter so I could rant, and didn't respond. So, am I the asshole for cutting a her out of my life? I feel kind guilty, but she's lied to me, ignored me, and is being a child. Turns out she also moved to Maryland too, I found out from S. ",

Our family moved from Mexico to California when I was 4, and then we moved to Arizona when I was 10, and this sister stayed in California. Since I was ten (I am now 31 YO),  I saw her in person at most twice per year (for holidays), and it was probably less than that because she didn't always come visit for holidays. I probably talked to her on the phone about twice per year also. \n\nI genuinely do not feel close to her because we did not grow up together and have spent relatively little time together. In addition to this, I genuinely don't really like her as a person. My immediate family and I all agree that she is a difficult person to get along with. I consider her to be rude, unpleasant, and just flat out annoying most of the time. \n\nI have visited her several times since moving to California recently and every time I feel like it is a chore, we never do anything fun, I feel like I'm biting my tongue 90% of the time. I find myself making up excuses for why I have to leave early or why I can't stay. I constantly find myself thinking to myself \"god I wish I didn't live so close to you\" and \"I can't wait to move away so you will stop pestering me.\"\n\nI love where I live and I love my job. This is seriously the only source of stress in my life at the moment.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n1 additional fact:\n\nshe is my half-sister, not my full sister, but I that's really a factor in why I want to avoid her.",

      "description": "Me (f) and my gf are both 20, we use parent money just to preface, and I admit we are both in wealthier families. I don’t buy expensive items  a lot because I don’t think they’re that necessary + gf is high expense. Been together for almost 3 years.\n\nI pay for meals almost everyday, buy the stuff she tells me to buy when she doesn’t want to leave home,  flowers, gas money for her car sometimes and even tickets, etc. However, I don’t pay for her clothes when we go shopping since it’s just more expensive.\n\nSo one day, we go shopping and she doesn’t want to use that much money in one day so she told me to lend her 1200 and she will return 300 on a monthly basis. She also hasn’t returned me 400 for concert...so that’s 1600 total.\n\nWe fight a lot, and I’ve been more reluctant to spend money for her and she has been commenting on how I’m being “cheap” and I’m always counting. The only thing I’m not spending is the EXTRA gifts she wants me to give her. (We bought each other same price gifts, and she saw another thing she liked...2000$ holy shit and I said I can’t, and she held this grudge saying since I have a bit of side income so I should be able to afford it and that same price gifts = same thing as buying for ourselves so doesn’t really count as a gift?!!!)\n\nAnyways. Today, is the 3rd month and I remind her, and she gets pissed (again) and says I’m cheap and remembering exact dates. Say that I got a part time job (400-600 monthly)so I should not be caring about the last 2 payments, and I’m being cheap. I got kinda mad because I told her you know it’s parent money right and I pay for so many other things and those don’t count apparently???  And then I got told to fuck off and now I’m blocked...for the millionth time.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading. But AITA or am I being too biased here? :/",

I usually end up providing rides to my friends because I’m the only one who is able to.\n\nWhile I’m driving my friends love to make comments and heavily criticize my driving while we’re on the road. (None of them have their licenses and some of them haven’t even driven for more than a month with their instruction permit and this drives me crazy!) This happens every time we go out.\n\nUsually I tell them to stop talking shit about my driving because it’s distracting but if they don’t stop I just sit there and drive, letting them say whatever about me, but one night I got fed up with all their comments and said “If you’re all gonna sit there and talk shit about my driving then you can get out of my car and walk, I’m not driving you guys anymore, I’m so sick of your comments!”\n\nNow they all think I overreacted and are pretty upset at me for not driving them anymore. Was I in the wrong for not giving them rides anymore, or are they in the wrong for shitting on my driving while I’m just trying to get everyone from point A to point B safely?\n\n",

      "description": "So for starters, I'm a partially disabled, chronically ill young woman who often but not always depends on a cane to get around. It's especially common for me to need to use it after a long shift at my somewhat physically demanding job. I don't get home until 10:30 or 11pm usually on those days.\n\nOur apartment complex gives each apartment one assigned spot with their apartment number written clearly on it. They can also park in any of the spots that are just marked \"Tenant.\" Parking in someone else's assigned spot can get you towed. This is all laid out clearly in the lease. \n\nFor the last few months, at least once a week I've come home exhausted and in a lot of pain, only to find the parking lot completely full, and someone else in my spot. Some of these times I've been upset enough to leave notes on the offending cars - very nice ones at first. \"Hey this spot is for people in unit [My Unit Number]. You don't live there so please don't park here. Use a tenant spot. If there's none left in this lot, you have to use the lot at the next building.\" Sometimes I've been in too much pain to bother. Sometimes I've had my boyfriend go put my note on their car door because I can't but I'm too upset to let it go. \n\nBut now it's getting cold and weather is getting bad and I'm getting pissed. I am fed up with having to go across the street to the next building's lot and park there, and hobble back to my apartment. This is especially dangerous with the roads getting slick and icy. Keeping your balance on icy road is hard enough when you AREN'T leaning on a cane.\n\nMy notes have become more passive aggressive and include \"According to our leases, this is grounds for the complex having you towed.\" And I've signed the last couple as \"cane-using girl in apt [my unit number]\" instead of just \"Tenant of [unit]. Tonight I left one on the corkboard by the door leading out of our building too. \"You know the sign by the lot that says Unauthorized vehicles will be towed? Unauthorized includes parking in other people's assigned spots. So stop doing it!\" \n\nTomorrow I'm going to talk with my apartment complex manager about what to do when people are in my spot and it's not their office hours, see if maybe I can call the tow company myself. Because of course the offenders are usually gone by the time I get up late the next morning.\n\nI feel justified, but still... It's just a parking spot. And the lot across the street isn't all that far away, only another ~100 or 200 steps or so. And often that's not an issue. And towing someone's car feels really petty, especially with the weather being crappy. \n\nBut there's times when every step is agony, and those are most often the times my spot is taken. Usually because it's later and the weather is worse, which ramps up both my pain and the odds that someone is going to park in my spot close to the building's front door. And like I said, bad weather + lots of pain and fatigue = dangerous walking conditions. \n\nSo. Am I being a petty asshole? Would I be if I got these people towed instead of just leaving notes? Or are they the assholes?",

      "title": "WIBTA for ghosting an ex who is potentially in a manipulative or abusive relationship?",
      "description": "This ex and I had a rough breakup. I work a job that requires me to be away for very long stretches of time, and as is common for people with this type of job, was cheated on. About six months into a year contract, she told me she was checking herself into a hospital. Worried, I tried to get more info on her condition, however she asked me not to pry, and not to leave my work site to see her. Obviously, i was worried, but I accepted her wish and texted or attempted  to call her daily, though she stopped responding soon after being admitted. \n\nAs it turns out, what actually happened was she moved in with another man, and didn't have the courage to break it off with me over the phone. So for three weeks, she pretended to be in a hospital unable to answer the phone. When she finally called me back, she admitted that despite still loving me, she couldn't help herself, told me she had moved in with another man, and would be leaving me.\n\nThis really fucked me up. My job is already incredibly stressful, and my thinking she was in the hospital made it more so, so when she left me I found myself virtually alone in another country, stuck dealing with a terrible sense of betrayal. To make matters worse, she would often text me trying to make me feel better about it, though in reality they often made me feel worse. After a few months of this, I had to shut her out of my life, so I told her to stop contacting me, and went on with my life.\n\nFastforward about a year. This bit happened roughly a week ago. I had just gotten out of a short lived relationship with another woman, and again, was not feeling great. Out of the blue, ex sends me a massive wall of text telling me she regrets ever leaving me, that her current boyfriend (the man she cheated on me with) isn't allowing her to see her family, and that she wants me to take her back and help her move out of her situation. I'm a bit ashamed to admit, I seriously considered taking her up on her offer, but eventually declined as I don't really feel like I would ever be able to trust her again, especially with my line of work.\n\n However, we have been in contact for the past week, and she is getting increasingly desperate. From what she has told me, she is in an unhappy, controlling relationship, and is convinced I'm in a position to get her out of it.\n\nThe thing is, I'm not sure I believe her. She already lied to me about her situation once before reguarding the hospital lie, and to be honest, I still feel hurt over the fact that she betrayed me earlier. She had a habit of lying about small things in the past, plus the big one, so its possible that she is just emotionally manipulating again hoping that I'll get together with her again, and the thought of that really makes me angry. I'm considering just ghosting her the same way she ghosted me previously.\n\nOn the other hand, if she is actually in an abusive situation, I would likely feel somewhat guilty for not trying to get her out of it, as I think it is the right thing to do, even if it would hurt to see her again. Despite this, I'm leaning pretty hard on ghosting her. I don't really feel up to staying in contact with her. Would that make me in the wrong?",

      "description": "Hi folks! I’m in a D&amp;D group with a couple of folks. Our current campaign has been going for over 2 years now. I really enjoy playing and it something I look forward to. My fiance and I, host the sessions and I’ve gotten us quite a bit of things to make sure the game is engaging and fun. Miniatures, dice, trays, props, snacks, etc. Over the course of the campaign, we’ve lost folks as as real life has caused changes where people couldn’t commit to coming(work, moving, familial/relationship issues). It happens. We’ve always wished them well, kept their player around in the world we’ve built and kept doing it and occasionally picking up a new player. That said, our DM and my fiance have been playing consistently since the beginning. \n\nNow to the problem. While I love the game and I enjoy playing with my friends, we’ve never really been able to have a consistent schedule. The plan had been to meet up for regular sessions every other Saturday. But, due to other people’s schedules and last minute situations we’ve never been able to really keep to that schedule. I’ve never liked it. I feel it ruins the immersion of the story for me because of the poor pacing. I also hate that the thing I really enjoy doing can’t be done with any consistency because others don’t have the same commitment level as I do. But most of all, I dislike the obligation it puts on me as the host. Our friends either have roommates or live with their parents, so there isn’t really another person’s place we can go to play. I feel like it puts me in the position to either put up with the inconsistency so I can do the this one thing I enjoy, or schedule myself to hang out with other people and do other things and never get to play.  \n\nI have voiced how I feel to the group several times over the length of the campaign but it always comes as though its not really a big deal and that I should be more patient with everyone and so far I’ve tried to. However, I’ve recently gotten an invite to another friend’s (Mike) game. Mike invited me and stated that they play with their group every week consistently. I turned down their invite this past weekend because my group was supposedly meeting only for it to get cancelled at the last minute. \n\nI’m going to join Mike and that group this weekend and see how it goes. If I have fun and mesh with the group there I think I’d like to join them permanently. WIBTA if after this weekend I talk to my current group and ask them to commit to a consistent schedule otherwise I wouldn’t be available to keep playing with them?",

So we goed to the very top of the hill, which was like, 10-15 feet up from the normal ground? Idk. And so my sister decided she’d sled down the hill first, and so she got into the sled, but she didn’t go. I was annoyed that she wouldn’t go. She started to try to get out of the sled, but I said something like, “Just go, you big chicken.” And then I pushed her while she was trying to get out? She ended up falling back into the sled and slid down the hill. She made her sled curve like way off the path she was supposed to go on, and then she flew right into a thorn bush. She wad super mad at me after, but it was her fault for not going in the first place. If she was too scared to go, she shouldn’t have volunteered to go first. And she made herself go into that thorn bush. I swear, she did that just so she could get mad at me, cause a sled doesn’t just like, go into a thorn bush. Anyway, I know I’m NTA, but I just want to see what you guys have to say, and show it to my bratty sister to prove she’s wrong. ",

He sends me a picture of the Fandom page for this game saying all the ranks, rewards, etc. \n\nL - Bet x rank\n\nI knew it was edited and gathered a couple different sources including the original Fandom page. I show him it and say you are good at editing but it really is z. \n\nL - (underlined too) \"YOU ARE OBJECTIVELY WRONG\"\n\nA couple of minutes pass by and L continues to casually talk about the game. I didn't bother to reply because I was mad that purposely changed info to win an argument. \n\nA different friend asked what was wrong and I explained the situation. My other friend says I should let it go since no harm was done but I feel like what L did was a red flag to our friendship. \n\nTL;DR Friend tries to lie over a game and tries to prove me wrong by editing a site. I show him sources saying otherwise and he blows up. Afterwards he pushes it off and tries to act as if nothing happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So when this first happened I was 100% sure I was in the right but in hindsight I may be at least partially responsible. \n\nSo I was riding my bus home on Valentines. A few stops down this guy gets on the bus. The bus driver had shut the back bus doors by the time he had arrived, but left the front doors open. This guy pounded on the back for several seconds before going up front. I, as well as a few others, chuckled at how pissed off this guy was. I wasnt laughing in his face but I can see how I riled him. \n\nHe took this very seriously, getting aggressive with me and implying I laughed because of my race.\n\nI did apologize, and said I thought it was funny but didnt mean anything against him. At this point a girl in the back spoke up as well in my defense. \n\nI wanted to drop the subject, but as I turned around he muttered that I was a \"coward who wouldnt do anything\". \n\nNow, I have a tendency to over-defend myself so I started talking back. \n\nI should have dropped it. But I didnt. I started telling him that I didnt mean anything by it but sure as hell wasnt a coward.\n\nNow, I am not a fighter. I talk a lot of crap so maybe I SHOULD be, but I'm not. I can take a few hits, but I'm not one to go throwing punches. But I try to avoid fights if possible. \n\nNow this conversation happened for several minutes. He didnt talk much but every time I tried to back down he would make a snide remark towards myself or the girl. He began to target her more, and I came to her defense because I didnt like where this was going. \n\nEventually we get to my bus stop. He threatens that I'm \"too much of a pussy\" to stay and not get off. \n\nNow heres where I may be wrong. \n\nI would like to say I stayed because I was worried things might escalate. But that's a lie. I stayed because I wanted to prove him wrong.\n\nI pulled out my phone and started recording. This did not help to calm him down but I thought it was for the best to have recorded evidence. He got even quieter on video. I will admit the video probably doesnt put me in the best light. There was a point I probably should have dropped it but didnt. It wasnt out of malice; I really wanted to settle things.\n\nHis stop comes up. Finally, he begins to react again. He gets out of his seat and into my face, threatening me and calling me a bitch. I tell him I'm not gonna fight him. He smacks me. My phone, which was in my hand, was sent to the floor. \n\nThe girl jumps up to my defense, kicking him off me. Another passenger firmly pushes him out the door. \n\nIt's at this point I notice my phone is no longer on the bus. I chase after him believing he stole it. \n\nEventually I lose him in an alley. The girl from the bus comes shortly after. She found my phone at the bus stop. I dont know if he tried to steal it or simply threw it out of anger. The case is cracked and theres some minor damage but it still works fine. \n\nOne thing I can say is that I never threatened this guy or tried to incite violence.\n",

      "description": "[WITA] I cut off all contact with a girl because she “just wanted to be friends” Now in this case WITA is more of a “was I the asshole” rather then would I be. I hope that’s acceptable. \n\n___\n\nSo in freshman year of college I tried my best to get out of my shell and get into things. I attended most of the WOW events (Week Of Welcome) and the wow tours and such. I have a physical disability that makes it hard for me to really walk at the same pace most people do so I ended up being separated from my wow group that was made of of fellow students from the same building. In this other wow group that kinda picked me up as I straggled behind I met this girl we very quickly hit it off and I really started to like her. Inviting her to game night that the floor was throwing and hanging out in her room. It came to the point where I was about to kiss her when I chickened out. Next time we met I asked her if She wanted to go out with me. Like the title says. She wanted to just stay friends. Now she had very valid reasons for saying so; trouble with her family, not knowing if she was going to stay st the university we were attending after the semester, etc. I accepted that answer at first. But then later decided that I was really putting a lot into this whole thing, she didn’t really click with my friends and we didn’t really share many hobbies or classes. So I decided that there was really no point to maintaining the effort so I cut all contact and moved on with my life.  WITA?",

      "description": "Hello! first of all I'm going to leave a tw for suicide mention, also you'll have to excuse me for any grammar mistake since I'm French 😔\nSo here's what happened: me (23f) and my boyfriend (24M) were supposed to attend a party with my bf's friends for new year's eve. I agreed since it would have made him happy, even though i'm not really on the same wavelenght as his friends. We already spent Christmas with them (I had to tell my mom that I couldn't spend Christmas with her for the first time in my life) because I also wanted to make him happy. Anyway, I actually suffers from depression and bpd, and he's very well aware of this. Christmas was a really rough day for me since it reminded me of a poor decision i'd made (SA) and my physical health actually suffered because of it, making me sick and dizzy the whole week. I told my doctor and therapist about it and they recommended that I spend some time relaxing with loved ones, in a safe environment. I have a group of friend I feel extremely safe with (no racism, no sexism, really trully good people i've known since college) and I told my bf that I couldn't go to his party because of my mental state and distress. He got pissed because he had \"planned everything\" and can't just \"cancel on his friend like that\". I felt hurt by that because I wanted him to consider my illness and that it was at a time where I really needed him but he just brushed it off because he didn't plan it. I still feel really bad about it, even though we talked about it afterwards, but i'm worried that I can't count on my SO if I have another breakdown... Am I an asshole for not letting it go?\n\nTLDR: had a mental breakdown during Christmas, bf refuses to drop party with friends to spend it with me",

At this time everything that was owed had been paid meaning that if I send him back his money his share would have to be split between me and my other friend.\n\nI told him that we all agreed to go on this trip together and made the plans accordingly and it isn't fair for him to drop out 1 week before hand and expect us to pay the extra money.\n\nI haven't given him any money and am not planning too ... am I wrong in this situation?",

      "description": "So this happened a while ago. A mutual friend (who we’ll call Nate) came up to visit my friend (who we’ll call Alex)  and I in college a state away. We all went to high school together so we’re all good friends. We were all supposed to sleep at Alex’s apartment as I was still living in the dorms. A few hours into the night Alex says he has to go home for a bit but will be in touch with us later. \n\nWell by the time 11:30-12 rolls around we’re trying to call Alex and knock on his apartment door with no response. It turns out he went home to have sex with his girlfriend and turned his phone off and probably fell asleep, forgetting all about Nate and I. By this time it’s too late to get Nate a dorm pass to stay with me so I frantically call everyone I can and after about an hour or so of doing this a girl I previously met was nice enough to let us stay with her for the night.\n\nThe next morning Alex calls us and is really apologetic, saying he fucked up and both he and his girlfriend say they want to take us out to lunch to make up for it.\n\nSo in out hungover state we head to the Cheesecake Factory (their choice) and I order what totals to be about $25 dollars not including tip. I didn’t wanna be a jerk and go all out just cause I wasn’t paying for it but I got what I thought was fair.\n\nWhen the check comes, Alex says he wants it split 3 ways. One for me, one for Nate, and one for him and his girlfriend. I’m immediately like “wtf” in my head, and his girlfriend goes along with it for a bit, until she says, “Alex, you should really pay for Nate, you said you would.” So Alex kind of grunts and covers his check, but not me, not even a thought of it. I end up paying for myself and still thinking wtf.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting after my friend ditched us and said “we want to take you out to lunch” that he would pay for it? Or am I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "TX raise up. Throwaway obviously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I am pretty certain I'm not but am feeling guilt  from my SO is complaining that I am being mean and selfish. This summer SO wants us to go for  a family vacation with the in-laws, this would be the second time we do so. The trip would include her siblings, her parents and all the kids so it's a big deal as we don't do that often. Problem is, her father violated her when she was a teenager and I cannot stand the man, nor my SO's mother as she blamed her child for what happened. He is a terrible person, has done a terrible  thing and I cannot stomach his presence or the asshat he calls his wife.\n\nMe and the SO have had our troubles the last two years because I stupidly  agreed to move to an area where her parents live. We used to fight daily  about family breakfasts that I didn't want to go to, easter breaks or trips to Macey's with them that I just thought was wrong, totally out of order etc but acquiesced because she insisted and fought to make it happen. SO has been to a psychologist for her issues stemming from the incident with her father, later a psychiatrist to work through  her things - this is an ongoing process and a lot of her trauma has resulted in some difficult relationship dynamics at times. Her mother is the evil queen in my life, who blamed her daughter for the incident, accusing her of trying to  take her man, checking if she was pregnant all the time, physically punishing her for the incident without talking about it in any sensible way - the whole nasty schpiel - you can imagine the fallout for my wife when she was a teenager (the shame, the stress, the silence).\n\nMy  SO wants to be close to her family despite said issues, this makes me sad but I cannot force her away from her family - that is her choice. But my child and just as importantly myself should be kept out of that sick constellation of fear, shame, pretense and anger that I feel can erupt at any moment. She is arguing that she also wants to give our boy a nice family vacation with her family because \"everybody else is going and he would love to be with his cousins\" and she wants to go with her siblings. I agree that a vacation with her siblings would be nice, but on  principle I can no longer condone doing activities like this with her fathar and mother present despite her wishes to do so.\n\nAITA  for not wanting to travel with this her family and effectively blocking our participation the big family vacation because of my principles, even if there is no risk the father posing any danger of repeat incidents?",

      "description": "We've been together for two years. We don't live together, but we sleep together almost every night. She is about to graduate college and relocate for a job. I am also looking to relocate. We are going to do the long distance relationship thing if needed for no longer than a year at which point we will break up or one of us will relocate so we can live together. Its likely one of us will relocate again. Things are going well for us.\n\nI leave tomorrow at 6 am for a job interview across the country, and will be gone for 9 days. I'm 99% positive I will get the job and will use this time to try and find somewhere to live. My girlfriend has been out of town since Thursday celebrating her fathers retirement. She just got back into town and is with her best friend and her best friends sister. They are working on wedding plans for her best friend. \n\nI asked her to spend the night with me and drop me off at the airport tomorrow. She says that she can take me to the airport, but that she can't stay the night, or see me today. It really does not make sense logistically for her to drive to my place tomorrow morning, then to the airport. So I am not going to rely on her for a ride to the airport if she does not want to stay the night too. However, I really want her to stay the night with because I love her and I want her to see me off. So I'm pretty hurt and salty about this in general.\n\nThe reason she has given for not being able to stay with me is that she is wedding planning with her two friends and that she is worried she will get too drunk and not make to my place tonight. The wedding is in late August. There is no reason that they cannot do wedding planning tomorrow, or at any other time. Its not like they have appointments or anything. Also, in my view, \"I can't help you because I am getting drunk\" is a pretty lame excuse.\n\nAnyways, AITA for being pissed about this? It it unreasonable of me to be upset about this?",

      "description": "I’ve been friends with this guy (let’s call him Q) for a couple years. There has always been times where we have gotten in arguments and it seems like the friendship is over but we end up pretending it never happened. Which I’m not sure if that’s healthy.\n\nI’ll be fair, it feels like I might be overreacting but that’s why I’m asking. But It feels like he is trying to one up me in everything. For example, we both were looking for jobs. I got an interview and never got a call back. So he decides to go for the same job,  then gets it. Then he would just never shut up about said job and how great it is. \n\nThen he tells me his plans to graduate and I told him I was planning on joining collegiate. I take my tests and pass and submit it in the lottery(it’s random if you make it or not). He saw that I passed it then he goes to take the test the next day and also passes. \n\nWell everyone  who submitted their scores have been emailed about if they made it or not. I didn’t make it, but he did. He has since made a joke about how he has taken my spot,  And my job.\n\nHe also saw that I bought this jacket from Dicks, then he invites me to church the next week and I get into his car and he has the exact same jacket on. He said “I thought I’ve seen it before. I liked it so I got it”.  And now one of our friends in our friend group bought a new pair of shoes, and Q is trying to buy them. He doesn’t realize how it is rude to buy the same shoes his friend just bought.\n\nFinally, at times Q would be hanging with me and some other friends in the group, and he would get texts or calls from our other friends, and I’ve noticed Q always has something bad to say about one of our friends. It’s almost like he tries to belittle one friend, in front of everyone else except said friend he is talking about, to make himself look better.\n\nIt only makes me wonder what he says behind my back? WIBTA if I approached him about it or am I overreacting? \n\nI don’t doubt that I could be a bad friend at times, but this seems worse than a couple mistakes.",

      "description": "I (26/m) met Amanda (19/f) about a week and a half ago. While speaking with Amanda, she reveals that she is unhappy with her boyfriend (27/m) and has been for 6 of the 8 months they have been together. I told her that's ridiculous and if she has been unhappy for so long she should end it. She asks for my snapchat and we continued talking there.\n\nWe continued speaking via snapchat the entire weekend and it becomes increasingly more flirty. we discuss the dynamic of a dom/sub relationship and what turns us on about bondage and s&amp;m.\n\nshe made plans to come to my house, I'd help her with her homework, she'd be my rope bunny, and she wanted to \"wrestle\". I asked what BF thought and she said he doesn't care.\n\nShe was my rope bunny and then she suggested that we wrestle, but really she meant she wanted me to dom her brat. I spanked the shit out of her and she loved it. I asked her \"what will you tell BF about the welts on your ass?\" She said \"I'll think of something.\" \n\nI say wrestling made me want to kiss. She said she did not want that. \n\nAfter geology homework, she prods me to wrestle more. I wasnt up for it.  she took a dog collar and tried to cuff me. I told her, \"if you close the buckle, I will kiss you.\" She got really close to closing it and paused. after a few seconds I pulled them off. We cuddled on the couch but she had to go home. \n\nNext day after work she asks me what to do. I invite her over but do not suggest an activity.\n\nShe arrives, we hang out with my dog for a min before she suggests we head upstairs. she suggests I rig her in a pentagram chest harness.\n\nWe wrestled more but I became aroused and wished to take a break. \n\nShe tried to cuff me and I say \"if you do that, something bad will happen\" She asked \"you're not going to sexually assault me are you?\" I say \"spanking people will get you in trouble with HR. What's sexual assault defined as?\"\n\nShe said \"spanking me isn't assault, I drove all the way out here.\"\n\nShe then hit me with the end of her lead trying to get a rise out of me. I said stop, she kept on doing it. even demanded that I count them out loud. \n\nI said \"I'll count them in my head, and if I get to ten, You will not like it.\" When she got to 9, I reminded her. She says she needs to go home, it's getting late. just before we started to get up she hit me with the lead again and got to 10.\n\nI pinned her down and gave her a peck on the lips. She pulled away, but I telegraphed it and thought it was part of the game we'd been playing for the past 2 days. She didn't use the safeword. \n\nWe walked to her car and hugged goodbye. She texted me until she fell asleep. \n\nToday she told me she doesn't want to hang out one on one again for now. I asked her what she thought would happen and she said \"idk, not that\". I told her I'm happy to be friends but no more wrestling or ropes until she dumps BF. \n\nTl;dr girl with boyfriend sends severely mixed signals and is surprised when I kiss her. AITA?",

      "description": "My sister has a very close friend who comes over to stay at our house for sleep overs, I am my sister's legal guardian and I think of her friend as a niece in a way. I often take them to places such as the mall or the movies. Every time I do she go up to at least one man, at least my age, which is 24 and asks them for his snapchat. I never say anything to her about it since she technically is not my kid. However, I'll overhear that after she adds one of these new people she says things along the lines of talking to him for awhile before just stopping because she felt like this.  \n\n\n  \nI for one, think this is very dangerous, she's going up to strangers far older than her, I'm assuming because she thinks they are attractive, and get's their snapchat only to cut them off only days later. She has no idea what these people are like, or if one of the guys genuinely get pissed enough and come after her? Yesterday, when she was over at my house visiting my sister talking about doing the same thing again, is when I finally told her that she shouldn't be talking to people in that age group. She got terribly offended as did my Sister.  \n\n\n  \nAm I in the wrong for thinking this? Am I being too protective over somebody who is not my child?",

He kind of lost it, sending me multiple messages saying I was attacking him, being negative and putting him down. \n\nWhat I meant by it is “if it doesn’t work, make changes and we can adjust”. Apparently I should have just said that. \n\nAnother time I can think of would be when we would be having a conversation about government and society and he just gets so defensive and upset if you won’t agree with him. \n\n\nI always feel like I have to walk on egg shells around him because I don’t know how he will take something. He’s always claiming people are negative but he’s constantly complaining about society and the government. I’ve heard him argue with his friends because they are being “assholes” when according to them they were joking with him. \n\nEveryone else especially at work always talks about how positive, helpful and friendly I am.

The biggest example of this is when the entire class had an debate on how to pronounce my name and no one listened to me pronounce my name. So flash forward to Friday December 7th. My birthday is on Saturday December 8th. So during the last five minutes of class my teacher reminded us about my birthday. So the entire class attempted to sing happy birthday. I finally had enough when I heard the many ways people attempted to pronounce my name. I grabbed my things and walked out of the classroom.  I know I should have asked to use my pressure pass but I was just thinking in the heat of the moment. The entire song felt like nobody was being genuine and just wanted to get through the day. In fact that was the only time anyone mentioned my birthday for the rest of the day. I still wonder if my actions were valid at the time or should I apologize to everyone for walking out.",

      "description": "Hiya. LTL, FTC. On mobile blah blah blah. \n\nAbout a week ago, I sustained a severe concussion and brain contusion at work from hitting my head on marble. It's been very hard for me to be \"normal\"; everything is slow, especially my speech. Everyone has been helpful- my roommates, work, my parents and friends. Everyone except my boyfriend of 15 months. He refuses to take off any time from work to help, stating that I already have so many people willing. The first time he saw me (four days after I hit my head) \"Are you always going to talk like this?\" He apologized a few minutes later for his mean question, but didnt retract it. He does ask how I'm doing-when I call him to check in. We went to get me groceries for the two weeks I'm housebound (and to give my awesome roommates a break from babysitting me) and he kept leaving me alone in the store for 15-20 minutes at a time.  Through out this entire week, he's been acting like coming to see me is a big chore he has to fit into his busy schedule of work, family events, and ju-jitsu class. To be fair to him, it is 1 hour each way, but I know if the roles were reversed I wouldn't hesitate to take time off to care for him. We've had a really great relationship before, to the point where we both feel like we want to spend our lives together.  I asked him if this was just a reaction to seeing me change and he just said \"no, I'm just tired.\" Things have been awkward because I feel so disappointed in his refusal to step up while everyone else is scrambling to help. AITA? \n\n\nTL;DR: sustained bad head injury at work. Everyone else in my life is stepping up to help but my boyfriend. ",

      "description": "pardon the terrible formatting. much dreaded mobile user.\n\na bit of background. trying to be vague while presenting as much information as possible here. i’m a teen. my great grandmother moved in with my family (mother, father, and i) when i was three. There was initial agreements set in place between my parents &amp; her. despite being family, she would still have to pay rent. They gave her a specific number and agreed, and on those terms she moved in. After a while, rent goes completely unpaid (like, six months.) despite both of my parents taking care of the payments she had on her old home.\n\nNow, it’s about a half a year in. Of course older people are extremely set in their ways and want everything their way. Though, this is/was our home and she took complete advantage even early on. She openly ridiculed my father &amp; mother for ‘not raising me right’ and caused arguments between them that were really hard for me to understand as a young child. She basically does everything her way. If it’s not her way, there’s a complaint.\n\nI wish i could format a total timeline, but i don’t know where i would actually begin. in short, she’s incredibly manipulative and have my parents wrapped around her finger. She acts like i’m a total brat and disrespect my parents despite standing up for them when she completely ridicules them. She takes control of everything when we have stated over ten plus years we want the household decisions to go through the ‘actual’ family first. She does not listen. Each time you ask her politely to hold back from a certain thing, she cries, and claims we are the reason she hates being old, how she’s such a burden, and how we wish she would just drop dead. \n\nHere’s the issue. My parents believe it’s absolutely insensitive for me to think that she should be put into a home, despite being the reason my mom quit her job and is unemployed, and being the reason why i want to leave the house as soon as possible. She claims she doesn’t have money, though she spends her social security on gambling. (she is very active for a 93 year old, i commend her for that at least.) My less immediate family have not done anything at all. They don’t contribute at all, and call us (mom, dad, i) all lazy and inconsiderate for asking for help from time to time. It seems like a huge guilt trip to me that each of my parents have fallen for.\n\nTherefore this post. My parents have argued with me to large extents despite me being driven to multiple inconsolable panic attacks due to this woman in my own home, stating it is still morally incorrect to want her out. she was the reason my first dog passed. (overfeed him. his legs gave out. my parents say it somehow was not her fault, though evidence proves otherwise.) I was wondering if i truly am the asshole for wanting her to be gone, and frankly not caring exactly where she goes? they think she needs to be put in a top of the line home, but she didn’t budget properly and i don’t see that as our problem, or one that should cause me so much emotional strain. \n\nAm I the Asshole here? \n\nTLDR: 93 year old grandma causes me severe anxiety. has for 10+ years. i suggest i want her out of our home, and my parents get defensive. She is the main contributor to my dogs death, which holds really close to my reason for wanting her out. AITA for not caring where she is and if it’s a nice place if she moves out sometime?",

      "description": "I (M39) have been dating someone (F25) for a few weeks now. She has recently started her period and has been in a lot of discomfort as a result. I have been trying to do everything I can to ease her pain, but through it all, she has been pretty mean to me. For instance, she was at work and complaining of cramps. I offered to bring her lunch and anything to make her feel better, which she agreed too. As I had class to attend, I told her that it wouldn’t be until 1PM when I got there. Her response (knowing full well from the start that I had class and an exam that day that I couldn’t skip) was to claim I didn’t really care and should not even bother comforting her if I was going to half ass it. Over the past 4 or 5 days, this has been pretty consistent, where she is pretty mean to me, regardless of how hard I try to make her feel better. I absolutely understand she is in pain and can sympathize with her, but at what point is it not justified. At what point should I look at the future and realize this will be a month occurrence for as long as I’m with her. When I asked if she always has periods as difficult as this, she said that she did and if I couldn’t handle her like this, I’m not a real man. WIBTA to break up with her over this?",

There are some rumors and even talk of people just going missing, but I have no idea how much is just small town talk to be fair.  \n\n\nWhat I do know about him is that he’s a sex offender.  Many, many fights break out at his house.  He will give you really hard drugs to try out.  \n\nHe’s just not safe for a young woman to be around.  I’ve tried talking to her about it, but she told me to basically butt out.  I’m really conflicted.  If I tell our mother about all this it will really damage my relationship with her.  If I don’t and anything ever happened I would never forgive myself.  I’ve never felt “old” before, but I’m starting to with this situation.  I want to kill the party.  The flip side is that I am being a hypocrite and her life is hers to do with what she wants.  She’s an adult even though she lives with our mom.  ",

So far, pretty much everyone (out of maybe 20) has accepted the requests.\n\nThe other day, I sent a request to someone I've had a couple classes with. I had already been following them on Instagram. That night, they posted a rant on their IG story that could not have been more obviously aimed at me. Excerpts include, \"I ONLY use FB for family and close friends,\" \"don't bother with me if I don't follow you back\" (they don't), \"y'all creepy as fuck,\" and a conclusion along the lines of, \"I'm fucking deactivating this account and moving to my alternate one, DON'T FUCKING REQUEST TO FOLLOW IF YOU AREN'T A CLOSE FRIEND!\"\n\nI know Facebook doesn't have those little account descriptions like IG does, so there was no way for me to know that this person wouldn't appreciate my request.

I still enjoyed the date and he paid our tab, after that we were speaking and he mentioned we should go to this cool other bar next time. And I just said I wasn't feeling anything between us, he was kinda bummed but said any particular reason? So I just told him I don't really like shorter guys, and he surprisingly took it very well. He said no problem I get it, thanks for the honesty and we hugged and went on our on ways. \n\nI told one of my friends this who's a guy and not short he's like avg height and he said that was super vain and shallow as the way I was describing him he was a nice guy and he can't control his height.

      "description": "Sorry if formatting is weird, on mobile. \n\nSo for some background my mother's side of the family is pretty big, each of her siblings had two kids and were spread pretty evenly apart. My brother (Alex) and I ended up growing up pretty close, proximity wise, to two cousins: Brian and James. This is for many reasons the primary ones being that our fathers were friends in highschool and being the closes pairs of cousins in age to each other. \n\nIn particular Alex and Brian would often hang out and myself and James would hang out as there was only a year between each of us. (Me being the oldest.) As time went on these pairings became less and less willing on my part. \n\nThe reason for this is James. He had very little respect for others or their belongings. When I was about 14 I lent a book out to him and got it back with the front cover in tatters. He claims I gave it to him like that despite the fact I keep my books in very good, if a little read, condition. Just one example of many.\n\nHe is notorious for not paying money back (personal experience), and for gift money he receives from his family, meant for rent or utilities, to disappear, with James claiming he's not sure where it went. \n\nAnyways I took a few extra years off after highschool to build up money and to wait until I felt like I was ready for school again, especially since I knew I'd have to leave my hometown  for my program. The same year I left so did James, for the same university. \n\nI made it clear I would not entertain rooming with him and since then have more or less cut him out of my life. I told my parents that I'd be cordial at family gatherings but that if given the option I'd rather not engage and that I expected that choice to be respected. James has also made his distaste for my fiancee very clear, which doesn't really bother either of us.\n\nHere's where the problem comes in, my fiancee and I are in the very early planning stages of our wedding, as it's still some years off, and I'm unsure how to handle the guest list in regards to James. \n\nAlex and I have a great relationship and through him I've reconnected with Brian and would love to invite him, I'm also not adverse to inviting my Aunt and Uncle but would really rather not have James at my wedding. \n\nWIBTA for not inviting a cousin I have a bad history with to my wedding while inviting his family?

We are not a lot in the class, and there is this one kid whom I'd love to have a written document of everything he ever said because I could have one of the best /r/iamverysmart posts ever, frontpage material. Talks about how he's gonna do (our coutry's version of) SAT of physics this summer (which is a year and a half early), tries to speak about Fermat's last theorem.. you get it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou may have guessed it by now, but this kid might be the smartest in a regular classroom, but he's really bad here. Can say all the smartest shit in the lesson, but never got more than 70 after 8 tests we've had, and even tries to keep a \"smart\" persona I think is how I should describe it? for example, we've had a test two months ago and he left after an hour and a half (the test was three hours long), for absolutely no reason- he went home after that. He got 68 and had to go to a second term (I'm not sure how it's called in English). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, we have homework every week that we have to submit. It's graded, and is weighed 15% of our final grade. So it could definitely help someone who's just a little above failing. We have a group chat, in which he asks for help in homework every single week. So do others. I usually try to help people who ask for help, like sending the page I submitted, because luckily I'm doing well here (tests always above 90, homework consistently submitted and usually well done), but with him I always send short and not-so-useful answers. Lately I've been thinking about ignoring his requests completely, and sending the pages privately and not in the group with him, in addition to ignoring his requests. He'll probably realise what is happening and that I am \"ghosting\" him, but sometimes his comments in lessons sometimes make my blood boil. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, reddit, AITA and WIBTA?",

That I should be \"grateful\", it's not like she \"needs me, I need her\". \n\nNow, K has remained in the same genre her whole career, and my feedback was helping produce an entirely new sound. She was really showing this had potential. \n\nI apologized the next day profusely, but she said she didn't want to do music together ever again. I respected her wishes. We continued our friendship. \n\nFast forward to last month. \n\nOne night, she sends me a message on Snapchat, a kind of vague, \"Hey, I'm recording some new material with C, could I use a few of the lines?\" and then typed the ones she wanted to use out. \n\nC is a well known local artist.\n\nI had a bad feeling immediately, so I screenshotted the request. My response was straight forward: Yes, as long as I get some song writing credit. I then screenshotted that.\n\nWell, she freaks out. Begins ranting about how she has had to stick up for me so much (I'm socially awkward, apparently) and has done so much for me, swearing, saying she couldn't believe I would think she would ever steal music, how rude I am, etc. \n\nShe then said \"I need a break from this friendship\" and blocked me on everything. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Some background. My roommate and I are good friends and have been since before high school. We are both 25 now. \n\nThis is obviously not the biggest deal in the world but it is irritating. What happens is that any time I’m in the living room watching TV he comes in and starts watching YouTube videos loudly on his phone. He watches YouTube videos for I’d guess around 8 hours a day. More on the weekends. No matter what he does, even if he has headphones on he also has YouTube playing on his phone. I only care when he watches them when I’m watching TV and he comes and sits next to me. \n\nI can hear him watching them from his room. And even between floors in the townhouse but I can always close a door in those circumstances. But it has been driving me mad nonetheless. I asked him to stop watching them when I’m watching TV in the living room and he said I can’t tell him what to do. \n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "I need help. Or maybe someone to vent to. I don't know. I just got my ass chewed out for no reason.\nLittle context before I begin. My hubby applied for a driving position at night that will bring in good money that we desperately need . Just got his permit and are waiting to hear back with a hopeful \"You're hired!\"\nHe's been trying to transition his sleep schedule so that when he starts it wont be as bad for him. \nSo the first night he was trying to stay up, didn't tell me at all. Just assumed I would know. Was watching TV in our room at 11pm and the brightness woke me up and scared the living crap out of me. I get upset because i feel as though he's being inconsiderate by watching TV that late. He informs me, after a heated argument, that he's transitioning his sleep schedule. Great, got it. So I apologized for freaking out and we hug and go to bed. In lieu of that we moved the TV into the other room to make it easier for him. We don't have a couch but we do have a rocking chair and a comfy office chair. This was Thursday or Friday of last week.\nI don't say anything again until tonight. I was woken up at 2am by our baby and I hear snoring from the other room. So I put my daughter back to bed and went in and tapped his arm and said \"Hey you should come to bed.\" He shook his head and said \"Nah I'm ok.\" I shrug and go to the bathroom. When I come out 10 min later he's passed out in the chair. So, me not wanting his back to hurt tomorrow and telling him that as well, I gently wake him up and say come to bed, then went back to bed myself. I don't think anything of it because he has told me in the past to wake him up if he falls asleep in the chair. He comes into the bedroom and doesn't show that he's angry. Crawls into bed and starts whispering angrily at me that he was transitioning his sleep schedule and how dare I tell him to come to bed. Accused me of doing it 3 other times, said I was an asshole for coming out and telling him that. Then started saying how I should have just let him stay in the chair and sleep. Really wish I should have now, at the time I didn't want to get yelled at for not doing it in the am. I wouldn't have woken him had I known he was going to yell at me.\nAt this point I'm speechless because I know I didn't do anything wrong and this came out of no where. He even said he thinks he imagined one of the times but I totally did it regardless. I then compare what he's doing to a woman having a dream her boyfriend cheats on her then waking up and being livid at him for  cheating in her dream when he didn't do anything wrong, and I pointed out that it was just as illogical as what he is doing. Then that sparks at him again. I'm laying there like wtf are you kidding me. He starts saying \"Well you had a dream a month ago that I did and got pissed off at me and accused me!\" To which I corrected him and told him that no, I didn't accuse him, I thought for a split second because it was so realistic and had to wake up fully before I could do anything. Theres a difference. He swears up and down that I'm wrong. His memory is terrible and I'm already fed up with his crap at that point. I then lose any patience I had with him and told him to f' off and leave me alone, called him a dick and said to just go to sleep. He, of course, passes out instantly. \nI can't go back to sleep now because he made me feel like dirt under his boot and I don't know what  to think at this point.\n\n\n\n",

I would have been fine with this, but I miss an Accounting class and I have to cram homework on the ride to Disney. I also have a work-study that I could start this week, my first ever job that I have to put on hold. Missing class when I'm able to go gives me great anxiety and makes me very uneasy, and it's even worse that it's approaching the end of the semester. My mom keeps saying this is a great experience for me and I might not do it again. She mostly emphasized that it's a trip with her since I'm transferring colleges soon. I would rather go somewhere closer than spend 10 hours in a car to go to a crowded amusement park with overpriced food for a couple days then come right back to 10 more hours of riding. I asked why we couldn't have a trip somewhere closer? The last time I've been to Disney was when I couldn't remember anything, she says I have to truly experience it. I express that I don't want to go and my family members are shocked that I do not want to go. They say they want to take my place and I encouraged it, but my mom says it has to be me that comes. I forgot to mention it's all expenses paid, and they just have to pay for parking. Am I the asshole for not wanting to go on this trip with them?",

She told me that I don't commit to anything and that its the same with my dad and I and how I told him I would go to him to the gym when I really didn't and only said yes because I didn't want to disappoint him. She told me that I need to restart and do 24 weeks of it (once a week) and if I didn't like it still then I could stop.

He is the one i want to spend the future with and we have speak about this regularly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months ago i got a DM on Instagram from this user called \"Henry\" and he basically just said hello at first. I ignored him because i just don,t see the need to talk to him or any other guy. Eventually \"Henry\" sends a bunch of messages basically saying he wants to send nudes. I blocked him (this is important for later).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo back to more recent. My boyfriend and i made a promise not to keep secrets a while ago and i was following this along perfectly (but now and then i would only tell him something a bit later as to not ruin a good mood or to make a bad mood worse). Recently he showed me a post on Instagram, my instinct is to always look at the profile photo and I'm not sure why. I see its not his but it seems familiar and get kinda mad at him for not telling me about this extra account because i told him about all mine and he still wouldn't tell me about his. I get mad but soon get over it and apologize for getting angry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon he starts getting really secretive when on his phone, mainly Instagram. This is odd to me as he always used to show me what he is looking at. I've been cheated on in almost all of my passed relationships so i obviously start to worry but i don't tell him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day I was not feeling too good and he was being super secretive on his phone again, not showing me whats going on ect.. He knows im upset and he just reassures me everything is fine. Later that night before going to bed i need to use the bathroom to brush my teeth. I go in and i see he left his phone there. After im done he gets a message from a friend that seems important so i wanted to open it and show him what it said immediately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBig mistake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI unlock his phone and the first thing that's still open is Instagram. It's open in the profile page and I'm upset. It's \"Henry.\" I know something is up and my brain immediately goes to cheating. I don't look through anything else, i just close Instagram. I go back to his room when I'm done and just show him the message from his friend and break down crying. He comforts me and also starts crying because I refuse to tell him whats wrong and he hates seeing me upset. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe fall asleep and wake up in the morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still upset obviously and having my doubts that he is using that account to cheat on me. We have to go to his work for the day and I just leave a note saying that I know he is \"Henry\" and asking him why he would do that. We head off and he only sees the note when he gets home much later that day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe tells me that he made the account to see if I would cheat or flirt with anyone else and also to see if i would snoop through his phone. I feel destroyed. I feel like I've broken his trust by snooping and that I am such an asshole for snooping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\nMy boyfriend was being secretive. I opened his phone to show him a friends message and Instagram was open showing he owned an account that harassed me. I got upset. I broke his trust of me snooping but at the same time he was using to to see if i could cheat. Am I the ass? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love him and don't blame him as he also got cheated on.",

      "description": "I come from a family of 5 and my little brother (the one who got picked on) is 4 years younger than me. While I must say I love my little brother deeply, I have a problem with him being way too soft. I notice it every time, every time someone makes a joke out of him or bugs him, he sits there quietly and even cries to our mom at times. Being his older brother, I believed that my parents are just not preparing him for the real life and are just spoiling him in general. I try to teach my brother to fight back but he just ignores me and complains saying that fighting is bad and wouldn't do anything about my light punches that I'm throwing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this is when things start getting interesting, my parents signs me and my little brother up to this all age sports camp where you go to this gym inside this school and play sports from like 10-3 every Saturdays, in general me and my brother had lots of fun and we met a lot of nice people. However, there was this little shit (who was around the same age as my brother) who would cry if things never went his way and would often cuss out the people running the camp. One day for some reason, he came up to my brother and started trash talking him, calling him weak and slow and other mean things in general. I took notice to this and while yes, any brother seeing that would've jumped right in and stand up for their little sibling, I wanted my little brother to stand up for himself. And that was probably big mistake, as now the kid started shoving my brother and my brother was on the verge of crying. After that the supervisors took notice, kid got in trouble and my brother was tearing up, yada yada yada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother left camp early that day for some reason and when I returned home (I stayed an hour after the camp was over and took the bus back so my parents didn't pick me up), my parents were furious at me for not standing up for my little brother. I tried explaining to them that I wanted my brother to stand up to himself as he can't always rely on me to be there for him. My dad says that he doesn't care and that brothers should always look after each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to teach him that violence is the solution to all your problems but instead to stand up for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for not standing up for my brother when he was getting picked on?",

      "description": "I was engaged to my amazing GF last year and she recently moved to the US via the K1 Fiance Visa.  For context, the K1 Fiance Visa approval timeline can vary greatly and once approved you must get legally get married within 90 days of your Fiance moving to the US. As you can imagine, it is nearly impossible to organize a proper wedding where many friends and family must fly internationally within a short 90 day period, which is the case with us as many friends and family members would not be able to attend (including her parents) as they need time to schedule time off, book tickets, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitially, we were hoping to just do an initial 'paper wedding' and the ceremony one year down the road, however our state requires that we not only get a marriage certificate, but that we also have a ceremony at the courthouse in front of a judge and have a couple witnesses.  I discussed this with the Fiance and we both decided that we didn't want to only have my parents attend the courthouse wedding (they are local) without hers present as we want to share our 'wedding moment' at the same time with both families.  So, we instead invited a few close friends to act as witnesses.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI explained this to my parents and they were not thrilled, however I made our decision / wishes clear and the reasons why (plus reiterated we are planning a big wedding in a year and that they were front and central in that wedding) .  Several weeks later, prior to our courthouse wedding, when I was visiting the parents with my Fiance my mother decided to tell my fiance while I was in a separate room that the courthouse wedding is the \"real\" wedding and that the wedding down the road isn't real (it's obvious my mom purposely decided to do this when I wasn't present and when I confronted my parents after hearing this from my fiance they said that 'they thought my fiance didn't understand the courthouse wedding was a legal wedding').  I feel that they are being unreasonable with not accepting our wishes (I'm not asking them to be 'happy' about it) and I feel they crossed a line going behind my back to my fiance and trying to guilt trip her (the fiance said afterwards 'i'm sorry that I'm not American as then both parents could attend and this wouldn't be an issue' - that broke my heart) which makes me less inclined to be open with my parents about our life or have my fiance hang out with them without me being present...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Am I the asshole for not inviting my parents to a mandatory courthouse wedding and asking them to wait until we can have a proper wedding when my fiance's overseas parents can attend so that we can share our wedding moment with both parents at the same time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Reading a lot of these AITA's for relationships has brought up some old memories and I would like peoples opinion on this. Sorry if its long. TLDR at bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time of this incident, I was about 23(m) and she was about 21. Lets call her Sarah. We worked together and she was dating another guy at the office, whom we shall call Tom. We became fast friends. She was into all the nerdy stuff I was into and we got along great. I was attracted to her, but because she had a BF I kept things purely platonic. Eventually she started some flirting. I felt uncomfortable because I knew her boyfriend and he was a really nice guy, and I didn't want to break up any relationship. But I play along in a joking way and try to keep it as friendly as possible.\n\nAfter a while she started to complain about issues with Tom. He was getting a bit jealous, and in her words ,'controlling'. I let her vent and tried to be as diplomatic as possible. I even defended him at times, saying that while some of the things she was doing may seem innocent to her, they might not seem that way to him. I told her to try and see things from his perspective, and just try to communicate better. She thanked me for being honest, and started saying things like \"you're such good listener\" and \"I wish I had a guy like you\". Fast forward a month and she calls me to say they broke up.  She comes over and cries on my shoulder. Now, I would be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me that was happy that they broke up. But again, Tom is a great guy and I do feel bad about the situation. Because of this, I make any moves. \n\nOver the next couple weeks, the flirting ramps up at work. We do hang out a couple of times, but I haven't made a move yet. There are two reasons for this. Being a nerd, at the time I was very inexperienced with this sort of thing and was nervous. Secondly, my Dad was suffering with cancer, so a lot of my time and thoughts were devoted to helping him and the family. About a week later, my Dad takes a turn for the worst and we rush him to the hospital. He eventually passes away that night. Over the next week, Sarah was now my shoulder to cry on. She even helps out with a couple things for the funeral, which was great. \n\nThe last few weeks been very clandestine at work. Not hiding all the flirting, but not advertising it either. But now a lot of my friends saw us together at the funnel. I later get warnings from a few people that she and Tom broke up because he thought she was cheating on him. Tom even came to me and told me his side of things. Tom is from a very traditional and conservative family, which also contributed to a lot of their issues. I do get a little suspicious, but having now heard both sides of things, I decide that he may just have been overly jealous after all. I spoke with him at length and he gave me his blessing about pursuing things with Sarah, as he was done with her. \n\nNext time Sarah and I hang out I thank her for everything, I end up making a move and I get shut down. She tells me that she has been seeing someone for a couple of weeks and she they are now official. WTF? All that flirting and she was seeing this other guy while being with me a my Dads funeral? I am obviously upset, but its not like we were together, so I don't get mad or anything. I do feel a little like a fish on a catch a release, but whatever. I don't see her for a few weeks. I wasn't ghosting her, just taking time off to help my Mom get my Dads affairs in order. After that we remain friends, and even start a small band together (it didn't go anywhere, but that had nothing to do with this).  \n\nOver the next six months she breaks up with this guy and starts dating another guy. We all have our suspicions that this new guy started during the last guy. Whatever, not my business. She is still a little flirty sometimes, which I find weird. But I just joke around, ignore anything too flirty and just change the subject. I then start to feel like she is taking advantage of me a little. Always asking for rides, watching her cat for her all the time when she goes out of town to visit family, I even lent her a little money (she did pay me back). But whenever we planned to do things as friends she ends up cancelling because she is too busy. But she still msgs me sometimes and ends up trying to flirt again. At this point I am pretty much done. I don't hate her or anything, just realise that the warnings my friends gave me about her were right and decide to just let the friendship die on its own.\n\nI then find out through the grapevine that she is banging one of my colleagues at work, who is over twice her age, and they have even done it in the office! I didn't believe it at first but one our mutual friends (that Sarah had a falling out with), showed me the messages to her from Sarah, talking about the whole thing. I debate telling her current BF, who I have only met a couple times. But I decide its not my business and leave it be.\n\nA few days later I get a message from her being a flirty again. I snapped. I didn't swear or call her a whore or anything, at least not directly. I just bluntly called her out on all the above shit. How I thought she was a terrible person for leading my on while I was dealing with my Dad passing, screwing over her last three boyfriends, and how it was gross to be having sex with a guy twice her age, in the office. I finished it all by saying that she doesn't owe me an explanation, I'm not her boyfriend, but I just don't want to be associated with her anymore. \n\nAfter that, she obviously avoided me at work. I got a new job a few months later, and that was that. She has attempted to make contact on facebook a couple times in the years since, but I have ghosted all her attempts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do sometimes feel bad about it. I mean, she did deserve it, but I heard from others that she was REALLY upset about it. I sometimes think I may have been too harsh. What do you guys think? Was I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; AITA for rather viciously for calling a friend out on being a massive slut?",

      "description": "Just a bit of a background, I own two lovely cats. Very sweet. When my boyfriend and I started dating I made it clear that me and my cats are a packaged deal. He said he understood. He likes my cats a lot but he really doesn't like dealing with cat fur.\n\nWe talked about the future and if we'd ever be able to move in together because he hates cat fur so much. In the beginning of the relationship he said it's possible to deal with but then the other night he said it was impossible and he just can't do it. I told him I was disappointed but I guess that's just how things are.\n\nSince he clearly doesn't like cat fur, I just wanted to tease him a little. I remembered seeing things people made from their cat's fur (like a mini cats and some crazy accessories) and I jokingly asked him how he'd feel if I got him something like that. He got really upset and said he hates jokes like that and it's rude.\n\nI told him of course I wouldn't get him anything like that, I was just joking. I had no idea why he got so upset because we've teased each other plenty of times before. I got annoyed because he's done similar jokes with me and asked him where'd his sense of humor go? He then snapped saying he's the type of guy who doesn't have one and hung up the phone and he hasn't talked to me in 24 hours. I have no idea what's going on with him and honestly the entire call felt like such a mess. I know there are situations where jokes can cross the line, but I sincerely felt like I didn't. What do you guys think?",

      "description": "I have a friend who is schizoaffective. We’ve had a long friendship for years where an issue I’ve had is that she will talk for long periods of time about paranoia and delusions about people I literally know nothing about.\n\nIt gets to the point where I can read a book as we talk on the phone and she won’t even notice. I’ve timed her rants and up to ten minutes of pure talking will go by where I don’t utter a single word. I get frustrated when this happens because I feel that I’m just a sounding board. Frankly, the conversations are boring because she is ranting about people I don’t know or care about, people that she herself hasn’t seen for years, that they’re all out to get her. I feel used and sometimes inwardly groan when I see her calls.\n\nAnyway, it happened again and I told her straight up that conversations like this bother me. In the past when I raise this issue, she has gotten very defensive. This time, she tried to take the complaint but launched into further ranting about how the schizoaffective disorder affects her life. It was like she literally could not help it.\n\nI stayed on the phone because I didn’t want to hang up when she was in turmoil but after it seemed to clear up, got off right away. I could tell she was upset and still wanted to talk more.\n\nI feel like an asshole for not wanting to be there for her but really don’t know what I can do. At this point, I feel like I’m enabling her paranoia by listening more than anything. I have my own life that she never asks about and she’s often negative about people we both know, so I never bring them up. She gets jealous when I hang out with other people so I don’t bring that up either. Everyone else we know has separated from her so I am one of her last friends.\n\nWould appreciate tips from people with loved ones with schizoaffective disorder or other mental illness for how to not be an asshole but not getting sucked into her logic when this happens again. Because I know that it will. I don’t want to be an asshole to her and care about her, but I can’t simply be the passive listener who listens for two hours every night because it’s making me very angry at her. ",

      "description": "For a bit of context, I take a daily walk around my neighborhood, and in order to get out of my apartment complex I have to go across a narrow and busy street.  Visibility isn't great because the street is narrow and takes a lot of twists and turns - it's often difficult to see what's around the bend.  Even using a lot of caution I have had a few close calls with drivers either not seeing me or not paying attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn my way home from one of my walks, just as I'm about to cross at this crosswalk, a man pulls up directly into it, on the side of the road, and parks there.  As he exits the vehicle, I tell him that he's parked in a crosswalk.  I use the calmest tone possible as I know mistakes are easy to make; he could have just not been aware.  He tells me \"I've just been in an accident, go around\".  I look at the car, and at him, and I see no damage to the car or the man or anything serious going on.  I understand that being in an accident is still incredibly stressful and he could have had injuries that I just didn't see, even if he didn't appear to be injured.  The fact that he told me he was just in an accident is what makes me question whether I'm the asshole.  Still keeping my calm tone, I said \"Yes, but you're parked directly in a crosswalk, could you kindly pull your car forward a little bit.\"  There's a large driveway that could easily fit his car about fifteen feet ahead of him.  He continues to refuse.  I get stubborn about it because I think that it compromises my safety and the safety of others if they want to cross.  It seems trivial, but being hit by a car is definitely not trivial, and having to walk out from behind a car parked in a crosswalk, to me, definitely makes crossing in an already dangerous spot all the more dangerous.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI take a step back so that I don't seem like I'm trying to start a confrontation with the driver and think it over.  I see a fireman who's come to assess the accident not far away, who doesn't seem to be busy.  I walk up to him and ask him if he could please ask this man to pull his car forward out of the crosswalk.  He seems hesitant, and tells me I could ask him.  I explain what just happened.  After this, he asks the gentleman to pull his car forward.  He says \"Oh, you'd like me to move forward?\" and quickly does so.  I cross and go home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt might seem silly but the whole interaction had me anxious to the point of shaking.  I've been cycling through whether or not I did the right thing, or I harassed a man who had just gotten into an accident unnecessarily.   So what do you guys think?  AITA?",

I told my mum we can go see a film another day and get some lunch or something and just spend time together that way. She wanted my step sister to come (who I already made a post about - I don’t get on with her that well, she always makes fun of my boyfriends stutter so she just angers me anyway lmao. I try to avoid her if I can.) so she says we’ll do 11am.\nShe texts me at 9am saying I have to come pick you up at 9:30am or your step sister can’t come with us, me, obviously not being awake, didn’t see this until literal 9:20am. I told her I don’t have enough time to get ready and that there’s no point now. I made this plan initially with my mum for me and her to go alone. She spent her birthday with her fiancé and my step sister so I wanted to spend my own time with her. It might sound selfish but it’s so frustrating, \n\nShe’s now trying to make me feel bad as my step sister has plans later today and I told her we already had this plan to go to the cinema and that as we already planned it, if my step sister wanted to come she should have worked around us, not us around her and not last minute because now it’s just resulted in me not being there. I am 19, step sister is 25 but acts 12. If that helps in any way. \n\nAITA for not trying to work around my step sister? And for not trying to go to the cinema at 10am? ",

      "description": "So some back story, my sister moved to Vegas a few years ago to be with her fiancé. They weren’t supposed to be getting married until 2020 or later, but they just recently moved the wedding to February of 2019. I don’t have a “real” job at the moment, and my sister has offered to buy me a ticket to come to her wedding.  I’ve told her that I can buy my ticket because I do different kinds of work like baby sitting, house cleaning, construction. Side work and things like that. Tonight she texts me and tells me that she’s going to buy two one way tickets (is it cheaper that way?) so I’ll have to stay for a few weeks. Simply speaking, I do not want to be there for weeks. My anxiety and depression are awful right now, my health isn’t that great (i’m chronically ill) and being away from home for so long just wouldn’t be good for me. I guess it’s also worth mentioning I actually lived there with her for a while, and she’s always tried pushing me to move back, and to be honest I really don’t want to deal with that right now. I don’t feel like I owe anyone an explanation, but it’s just not something I want to do. I’ve told her I really appreciate it, but I’ll buy my own round  trip ticket so I won’t have to stay as long. She just seems to be getting annoyed with me and keeps pushing the one way ticket thing. it’s not that I’m NOT going to the wedding, I just don’t want to be there for so long and I really don’t see a problem with that.  I would not miss this wedding for anything, but I also need to think of my mental health and I don’t see how not staying for longer than I need to is an issue. :(",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to remain friends the the man she cheated on her ex with?",
      "description": "My girlfriend and I have an absolutely incredible relationship. We have been together for a year and a half, this girl is THE one, and I have every intention of asking her to marry me one day. She is definitely a \"one of the guys\" kind of girl, and as such she has a lot of male friendships, some of whom she has previous sexual history with, some of whom have been strictly platonic. In the beginning, I was slightly bothered by this; I have my own issues of trust and insecurities from having been cheated on in past relationships. I've tried really hard to work on these issues with her, and we are in a really good place as far as all of that goes. That being said, there is one guy whom she maintains a relationship with that really bothers me, and I am becoming increasingly frustrated that she doesn't seem to care.\n\nTo give a bit of background, my GF's previous relationship devolved in to a dead bedroom/roommate situation in the last year or so. They remain good friends (which I'm cool with) but eventually realized they were far better suited as that rather than partners. Her and her BF did not have any sort of sexual contact for the last 10 months of their relationship. My GF is a very sexual person, and the idea of her going that long without sex certainly hammers home how bad things must have been, and eventually she slept with someone else. Now I certainly don't condone that behaviour, but I guess I can understand why someone could be pushed to do so under such dire circumstances. It also made her realize that the relationship was officially dead and ended it immediately after. She had been fully open and transparent with me in the beginning about the fact that she had done this, but hadn't been super forthcoming with the details other than that it had been with a coworker.\n\nEventually over time I was able to piece together that this coworker was her friend Jimmy. Jimmy was one of her friends whom she had mentioned having slept with in the past. As he had since moved to a different city, she had also mentioned how whenever she would go and visit her friends there, they would hook up. She had also mentioned that right before I came in to the picture, they were planning on taking a trip to Cuba together, \"as friends\". They texted each other frequently, and even hung out when he would come home to visit. Something about him bothered me more than any of her other friendships, and when I eventually clued in I asked her if Jimmy had been the coworker that she had cheated on her ex with, to which she said yes. She explained how he had fully taken advantage of the situation and manipulated her in to sleeping with him. Sounds like a cop out, but I believe her. I made it pretty clear that I was not comfortable with how close she still was with this guy, but she maintained that they were just friends who barely even talked anymore, and, while trying not to let my old insecurities get the better of me, left it at that.\n\nThat was pretty much the end of it until a couple of weeks ago, when she told me that Jimmy had recommended her for a job with connections he had out here. Annoying, but okay, it's a job she'd be great at so I can let it slide. We have been talking for a while about moving to the city that Jimmy lives in as it's a much cheaper city to live in, and one day while talking about this job interview she just slips in how Jimmy has said he would hire her to work at his company if we moved which I just could not believe she would actually consider given how aware she was regarding feelings about the guy.\n\nThis led to an argument as to why the hell you would still want someone like this in your life? Her answer was because they were still friends, even though whenever he came up before she constantly said how he was a man-child loser with basically no redeeming qualities. She seemed completely baffled by me being uncomfortable with her not only maintaining a relationship, but WORKING SIDE BY SIDE ON A DAILY BASIS with someone who A) She cheated on her previous boyfriend with B) Knew full well that she was in a relationship and clearly didn't give a shit C) Manipulated her in to sleeping with them D) She continued a sexual relationship with well after the cheating incident, even going so far as to talk about going on a trip together?? Her ultimate response was that I have nothing to worry about, that they are just friends, and that the only reason they still talk at all is because he can be a professional connection. \n\nI just cannot understand why she can't comprehend why I don't want this guy in her life. Is she keeping him as a backup in case things don't work out between us? Does she just crave male attention that much? Can someone honestly just be this oblivious to how a situation like this might look? Am I just completely in the wrong here for trying to control their relationship?\n\nTL;DR GF maintains a long distance friendship that she claims is strictly professional with the man she cheated on her ex with and continued a sexual relationship with right before she met me and can't understand why I have a problem with this.",

      "description": "So basically, I'm an only child and I'm very close to my parents. I was living far away from home and working for a while but I ended up getting very depressed after some years and quit my job. I moved back home to live my parents for a while until I find a new job.   \n\n\nMy mom is pretty much the breadwinner of the family and runs a business and my dad helps her with the documents and stuff like that. She grew her business from practically nothing and now she's doing really well – in fact, her efforts and her business are the only reason I was even able to go to college (she paid for everything). I really am very proud of her because she made it big and that's hard for a woman to do because the country/ community I live in is super patriarchal and male chauvinistic.   \n\n\nAnyway now she sees me – a jobless 24 year old/ with no direction in life/ looking for a new job and she starts hinting that I should join her business and take over the company. I totally understand why she would want me to continue her legacy but I honestly have no interest/ aptitude for the kind of business she's in. I think I would be really unhappy working with her/ for her. She is a great mom and we love each other, but she is super controlling and dominating and I know we would fight all the time if we worked together. But still, she insists that I'd be great at the business....   \n\n\nI'm a digital designer so I try to help out in whatever way I can, like I'm building a website for her company. But I just don't see myself actually joining the business and dealing with all her stuck up clients. And today she asked me to come to this big company event and I was definitely going to be there but then we ended up fighting over a stupid thing (which was my fault) and then she starts yelling at me about how I don't do anything for her and how I'm useless. Later in the day, I text her saying I'm not coming. That was shitty of me because I know she wanted me to be there. And then she texts me back saying she never expects anything from me because I'm a disappointment.  \n\n\nANYWAY. I guess I'd just really like to know whether I'm an asshole for not helping her with work/ continuing her legacy/ and just generally not being there for her after she has done so much for me.",

      "description": "So this is going to be vague because it's a very specific situation. Also FTP, on mobile, all that jazz.\n\nI found my (ex) boyfriend on a dating app a little bit ago. I wasnt snooping, I just moved his phone and it lit up with a bunch of notifications on his lock screen. I felt sick to my stomach and didn't look any further. \n\nI immediately asked him what the fuck it was and he said \"I'm looking to see who else is out there\" so I broke up with him and left for work. By the time I got home he had already left and didnt want to talk to me, so I went out drinking with friends and one thing led to another and I hooked up with one. He's an old FWB that's also a friend of my EXboyfriend, and I felt pretty guilty. \n\nI talked to my EX the next day and he didnt want to fix anything and wants us to be over for good, so I went out with this guy again. Right now it's being kept a secret from the rest of our friends and I'm not sure if I should tell them. I tested the waters to see how they'd react to me going on a tinder date and they were EXTREMELY against it, saying I should wait longer before moving on. \n\nThe reason everyone is so all up in everyone else's business is because the four of us live together. The FWB lives elsewhere and we've been just going over to his place. AITA for moving on so fast from my cheating boyfriend and keeping it a secret from my friends?",

      "description": "Let me start by saying that I don't hate kids. I actually like those little tykes running around and doing their fortnite dances and having fun. I think it's really heartwarming to watch them grow up while having tons of fun along the way. That's why my current situation has me practically at my wit's end. \n\nMy family has a habit of meeting up every other weekend for dinners or lunches. It's usually just a laid back gathering of uncles, aunts and cousins to chat and catch up with one another. And during every gathering, our littlest cousin is placed under our care while the adults crack open a cold one and chat. \n\nThe thing is, us cousins are around the age group of early to late twenties (with me being the youngest at 21), and we have a huge problem keeping up with her energy - we've gotten to a point where we really just want to sit around and talk (since it can get pretty hard for everyone to meet up consistently, and we're a very tight knit family that likes to be up to date with everyone's lives) instead of running around, too.\n\nBut the main problem isn't my youngest cousin's (YC) energy - it's her ridiculously entitled attitude. YC thinks it's perfectly ok to yell incoherently in the middle of our conversations to get us to pay attention to her or tackle and hit us in areas we've specifically told her not to (eg. faces/eyes, one time even the groin). Even worse, when we don't give her the attention she wants, she starts throwing a tantrum by sitting down wherever (eg. in the middle of the living room where everyone is) and crying at the top of her lungs. When we fuss over her then, she only cries and screams louder until her mother comes.\n\nAnd it somehow gets worse when we *do* pay her attention. If we play games with YC, she starts sulking immediately if she loses. At times, she might even begin to throw a tantrum again, and cry/scream until we let her win. She also attempts to cheat all the time, but becomes absolutely furious if we even try to playfully cheat back. It's gotten to the point where when we do play, we have to let her win all the time, which is truthfully very tiring and leaves us all feeling disgruntled, as we're letting her win out of fear of her losing, rather than to see her joy of winning. And if we even dare try to stop playing and return to chatting even as a break, she'll just keep bothering us by interrupting our conversations by bodily throwing herself in the middle of our circle and whining, or constantly asking rudely every five minutes if we can play. \n\nMe, and all of my other cousins, have tried our best to teach her how to behave better, like not yelling/crying whenever things don't go her way, to respect it when people say 'no'/'stop', or to ask nicely for things instead . We've tried being patient and going along with her, and we've even tried lecturing her (as gently as we can, as she's still a child), but nothing seems to work! \n\nHer attitude even seems to grow worse by the day, and her parents are a complete joke. Her mother thinks YC is fine as long as she's fed and clothed (aka why she has no qualms tossing her kid to us clueless young adults and only stepping in when YC begins to bawl), while her dad is prime absentee parent unless it comes to disciplining/scolding her. \n\nBecause we've been forbidden from disciplining YC/making her cry, and every interaction with YC grows more exhausting by the day, we've taken to ignoring her tantrums/interruptions to our conversations. We still answer and mildly play with her, but no longer break out the games/full on entertainment. We're also well aware that her tantrums and tears are something she uses on command just to get attention (eg. she'll begin to cry/scream at the top of her lungs saying we hit her leg and how much it *hurts* when we barely bump into her), so we've taken to ignoring those as well, even if she cries right beside us. Also, although we used to hold our tongue when she hit us, we've become quicker to say a stern 'no' to her hitting us or misbehaving.\n\nBut I understand that her behaviour is a product of her environment, so I do feel bad giving her the silent treatment or being firm with her sometimes, since she's still so young. I guess I just want to know if we're assholes for behaving this way :/",

We are both 20 with full time jobs but she doesn't have her drivers license yet. For a while now she's made a habit of going up to her grandmother's house in a city that is a little more than half an hour away to see her and her mom.  I have tried putting my self in her shoes but I just can't understand this. She says it's so she can practice driving but I know she only does that for a couple hours at most. There used to be a time where the normal weekend for me would be her mom picking her up from work on friday and then her staying the ENTIRE weekend until I have to pick her up monday night from work. It's taken a serious toll on me as we both work a lot so we don't get to spend a whole lot of time together during the weekdays. I told her how this makes me feel and she's stopped going for that long a while ago, but now this weekend she wants to leave to go to her 6 y.o cousin's bday party today (saturday) and then stay all the way thru sunday night and have me pick her up again on monday. I'm really trying not to be a controlling boyfriend and try to understand her POV but it is just infuriating to me that she always does this. We have a home. We have a place to live. You do not need to be going over there to spend the nights like you're an adult not a little kid. AITA?",

Sometimes he’s in a great mood, is affectionate and nice but others he is very cold, distant, and moody. He often rants on text message about things that are annoying him or stressing him out and I’ve always listened and given him space to vent. \n\nFriday night we went out for dinner and as soon as I arrived at the restaurant I could tell he was in a bad mood. He grunted hello, was giving me one word answers and didn’t seem to want to speak to me. I complimented him on his outfit and told him he looked nice to which he said: “I was going to say the same to you but I can’t be bothered.” He very rarely pays me compliments and it hurt to hear him say this especially as id really made an effort to look good. \n\nId been excited about going out with him and had been looking forward to dinner but his coldness completely threw me. I asked him if he was ok and he just replied that he was in a bad mood. I asked why and he said ‘I don’t know, I just am. I don’t need to have a reason, deal with it.’ I know he’s stressed with work at the moment but I felt so uncomfortable with how he was behaving that I said instead of sitting in silence and having an awkward dinner I’d rather go home. To clarify, this was the third time he had behaved like this towards me but the previous two times I hadn’t said anything. \n\nHe blew up at me at this point and said I was over reacting and that it was his right to be in a bad mood if he wanted to.

      "description": "So tonight I went to see Ralph Breaks the Internet with my cousins. I have a lot of cousins so there was about 12 of us going to see the movie.\n\nWe watched the movie and I looked up to see if there were any post-credit scenes and there were so we decided to wait to see them. So while the credits were going (it was just text not any dialogue going on) we start talking to each other. We’re all in the same row so we kind of have to speak up a bit to talk to someone a few people down. I was joking around with my cousin that was 4-5 people down about “Shrek it Ralph” the sequel to Ralph Breaks the Internet that’s a crossover with Shrek.\n\nI also didn’t really have my voice because we had Thanksgiving before we saw the movie so I was a bit hoarse. I talked a little louder because I felt like he wouldn’t be able to hear me and the guy a few seats to the left of me and in the row in front of us just looks up at me and says “SHUT THE FUCK UP”. So I thought that was pretty aggressive since we were just talking during the credits waiting for the post-credit scene. \n\nAfter the lights in the theater came up and we were leaving, a different cousin was telling me how it was kinda weird some guy told me to stfu during the credits and the guy yells at us from the bottom of the stairs “shut the fuck up. I’m still here” and I replied with “sorry I ruined the Wreck it Ralph credits for you”. \n\nSo was I being the asshole or did it make sense for the guy to tell me to stfu?",

      "description": "I’m a stay at home mom, so my son is home with me always.  He stays with my Mom maybe once a week for 2-3 hours. He has toys there and plenty to play with for the short amount of time that he’s there. \n\nFor the past two years every Christmas and birthday she wants to buy him toys or even clothing items to keep at her house. \n\nExample. \nHis first birthday she bought him a Cozy Coupe car, he didn’t have one. She brought it to our house for him on his birthday and when she went to leave she was going to take it with her. He cried wanting it and I asked “Is that not a gift for him?” And she (grudgingly) left it. \n\nLast Christmas she bought him a power wheels 3-wheeler for Christmas and informed us that it was to stay at her house, along with a few other gifts. We just let it go because he didn’t ask to take it home. \n\nNow this year she wants to buy him a whole swing set for her house. He doesn’t even have one at home! It will be most of his Christmas, plus a few other toys that he doesn’t have that she says are for her house.  \n\nThis really seriously bothers me. They’re supposed to be his gifts! It would be like me buying her a new Keurig or something and saying “Oh, this is only for you to use at my house.”\n\nI mean it kinda makes me mad, and my husband says to let it go because I sound ungrateful. \nI’m not ungrateful for the gifts, just that everything she buys him he only gets to play with maybe once a week and only at HER house. \n\nI want to tell her, but husband says I would be an ass hole. \n\nSo...AITA for wanting my kid to have his gifts actually given to him? \n\n\n(On mobile.

She prefers more of a ‘spiritual’ approach which evidently is not working and tbh some of the things she does to heal are in my opinion ridiculous and are just gimmicks aimed at people who are vulnerable and have money to waste so it’s difficult for me to have as much sympathy as I should when it seems like she’s not really trying.\n\nLast time we spoke she told me she wants a job as a gardener which I said seems like a great job (I’m obsessed with plants so this was genuine) but it’s not the season for it as it was mid November when she decided to look for the job.... now she’s telling our mutual friends that I’m a negative person and she can’t bare to be around me and that she doesn’t want them to invite me when we all hang out. The gardening thing is the only issue she can think of when questioned about my negativity and part of her mental health issues are supposedly not knowing the difference between real life and dreams/imagination so I’m not sure if that comes into play here. \n\nAITA for telling her November isn’t the best time to look for a job as a private gardener?

      "description": "I watched my little cousins for a few weeks late last year while their parents were out of the country for a loss in the family. The older one was a teenage girl so she was mostly uninterested in whatever I was doing unless it involved food. The younger one was a 9 y/o boy and was finding it more difficult to stay away from his parents.\n\nTo keep him distracted and entertained, I used to spend a lot of time with him and bent the rules their parents left. We would stay up late eating cookies and I would watch him play fortnite while browsing reddit. We really bonded over that time and leaving was hard because he wouldn’t stop crying.\n\nAs soon as I was back home, I started getting calls from him everyday. At first it was nice and we would talk sometimes for 30 minutes about our day, video games, and other random things. After a few weeks of that, though, the calls became monotonous and repetitive; as you can imagine a 9 y/o’s life isn’t excessively interesting nor can I share much about my college life with him.\n\nNowadays, I make excuses for missed calls or say that I have something to do to cut calls short. I’ll lie saying I have homework to do, I’m out with friends, I’m driving, or I didn’t have my phone when he called. What used to be a daily thing for at least 20 minutes is now every few days for about 5. Now, I know the kid loves me and I love him too but I just don’t have the patience to spend time everyday talking about the same things. Also, I’d much much rather lie about what I’m doing than tell him to stop calling me everyday. \n\nAITA for not giving this time to my cousin who is so attached to me? ",

      "description": "SO and I are both atheists and have Saturday through Tuesday off for the holidays. His parents tends to go a little too hard for the Christian holidays and have four separate events (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) lined up between lunch on Monday and dinner on Tuesday. The events include him, his parents, and x family member (maternal grandparents, paternal grandparents, family friends, etc). \n\nI was not raised to celebrate Christmas, so I don't and his parents know this. I haven't attended any of their religious holiday celebrations before, but they specifically asked for me this time (text: \"Make sure you \\[SO\\] and Creative\\_Accident123 are on time!\")\n\nSO says I don't need to go. He's only going to avoid drama by skipping out on a major, religious holiday, but I have no obligation to his family. In addition, his extended family is weird about people of color and I don't want to put myself in that position again (the first and last family meeting was not favorable). \n\nI'm leaving to visit my own family Saturday/Sunday, then driving back Monday morning. I was planning on relaxing before going back to a hectic three day workweek playing catch up at end-of-month (generally hectic in my field). Turning around and going to spend the next 48 hours with HIS family just sounds exhausting. \n\nI mentioned to a co-worker that I was spending Christmas Eve/Christmas Day at home, alone, relaxing with my animals instead of with his family. She caused a stir about how disrespectful I'm being regarding the situation (she knows I'm in a LTR w/ SO) and how I should be celebrating with them. I was confused, so I reached out to a few friends for their opinions. All but one agreed that I should go to at least one event and keep up appearances, even if I don't like them and it will be tiring. \n\nAITA for not going at all? I sent cards to his parents and grandparents. I chipped in for the presents he got them. I just don't feel the need to start pretend celebrating a holiday just for these people. There's not a sign in our home that we acknowledge Christmas. The only presents being wrapped this month are going directly to his family. \n\nIf it was just drinks and laughs, I'd go. It's serious, somber, lots of praying and being thankful for Jesus/Christ/God/Bible/religion basically.",

      "description": "Disclaimer: Ive experienced depression, I was in a situation which most people I know haven't had to deal with, that caused me a great deal of hopelessness and stress at home. So I can empathesize strongly with people who have issues like I did, and because of this I tend to take care of people, to want to help them as much as I can, to give advice, to go out of my way. And I'm starting to feel like it's not my problem anymore. \n\nI'm a kind person and I know this. However I feel like a dick for wanting to distance myself. I am generally the person who friends vent to which is good. But I also seem to attract problematic people who only vent and are literally doing nothing to change their situations except complaining. \n\nFor example, I stopped talking to this girl because every day we'd text and she would discuss how depressed she is about her ex, how no one wants her, how shes not good at anything, and how that day she was going to kill herself. I'd talk her off the ledge every day. \n\nAnother guy(who I really like as a person) wont stop talking about his ex either, who wants no contact with him and who HE broke up with 3 months ago. Says shes so perfect, shes basically a goddess and he feels like a scummy idiot, talks about her like she is a saint. I dont just talk, I make offers, I'll send memes or play games with you or hang out, I dont give unsolicited advice to anybody, I share my own stories. He has me as his friend but always says he's so alone, has nobody. \n\nIt feels like to people who are that depressed there is absolutely nothing you can say or do and I would rather stay away if I cant help at least with my friendship as it will just cause me stress and make me feel bad for them.\n\n If they keep talking about it I feel irritated at this point and I dont have time for it anymore. I feel bad and like I'm obligated to talk but in each situation, these people have family, other friends, money. So why is it my job? I think my boundary now is that if our conversations primarily consist of me being a therapist, then I dont want to talk. I'm drained, there are like 3 others rn",

      "description": "Sorry about the rambling post.\n\n\n\nSo, about 11 weeks ago my girlfriend (22) and I (23) found out that she is pregant! Super excited. Skip to last weekend where we showed our siblings the ultrasound. We also showed my mom's side of my family because they are there for us all the time and we see them at least twice a month. Later that day we made a Facebook post showing the ultrasound. Skip to this afternoon. My dad asks me if I've told his father yet. He asked if I would before my aunt tell him. Here's my issue. I hardly contact that side of the family if once a year some times not even. I usually get an obligatory birthday call a few days late from my grandfather. So I guess I really don't care how my grandfather finds out. It's more that he hasn't been a presence in my life the last 15 years. I don't feel the need to communicate about my life with him. \n\nAITA?",

My fiance and I are both predominantly white, his family does have some Native American but they are not particularly connected with that culture. This all started when I was looking for nonreligious readings to use at the end of our ceremony. I found an Apache blessing that was typically used in place of wedding vows and really connected with it. It is far more about the connection of the two people getting married than anything else. I want to have this blessing read to close out our ceremony, and do intend to have it introduced as a traditional Native American blessing. My sister is now telling me that this is cultural appropriation and I am an A-hole for wanting to use it. On the other hand, when searching for nonreligious readings this blessing has shown up on every site that I have looked at. So AITA for wanting to use something that isn't my culture but really resonated with me? ",

      "description": "So for context, I love my mother-in-law, Marie, but she is at that age where she is just terrible with computers. As my day job is in IT I always die a little inside when I boot up her computer. Trying to make heads or tails of everything on her computer is enough to cause an aneurysm.\n\nIt's not just messy either. She gets hit by Spyware, Malware, and Ransomware almost weekly now. I've gotten countless phone calls from other family members or her saying that her files are all locked and she can't use the computer. Luckily I have a disk image I can restore to but it's still a process to go to her house and do it. The boiling point is when she bought $500 in prepaid credit cards to pay off a ransomware attack.\n\nTalking to my wife, I suggested that we lock her computer down. Many schools do this with lab computers and it's admittingly not the greatest, but if it means someone who's not computer literate isn't exposed to these things. My wife loves the idea. So the next time we're over I tell her I'll help protect the computer and even tell her I'm going to limit access to things so she may notice some things won't open or run like they did before. She was hesitant but after working with her on it we agreed on a system that works for her.\n\nI load up every tool I can think of to protect the machine (AdGuard, Veracrypt, Rollback Rx, Malwarebytes, etc) and incorporate a lot of group policies to lock down the machine. We're set!\n\nFor a month, nothing. I could finally relax and enjoy my life. Well last week I get a particularly nasty email from my wife's siblings and their SO's. Saying how I violated their moms privacy and are treating her like a child (which admittedly is kinda true but not in a mean way). I explain that none of them are helping her with these issues, and that it works for her. They start telling me that everyone has to do their part, which I agree with, but tell them if I can do this particular job more efficiently, then I will; and that if she has any issues getting basic functions done (i.e. going to facebook, paying bills, checking emails) then I can adjust the configuration but she's having no issues and is actually happier now as she doesn't have an out of service computer for days on end.\n\nStill, the family insists that I'm the asshole and even went as far as to say I wasn't invited to a few upcoming events. So I guess the question is: Am I the asshole?",

To get some experiences and have something to do, it was planned to start an internship (no money, just a favour) next monday at the company XY my FIL works, who got me the interview for the internship. Last thursday i got a call from an old boss from a job i worked at in school and university, who has someone (company AB) that is interested in hiring me for 1 or 2 month. So i call them and they wanted to see me resumee and would call back. There was no word, when it would start, but the person made it very clear that they would need me asap. After waiting for the call back on friday, i decided i call company XY and ask if we could delay the internship for one day, so that i could call company AB, ask if they want me and when to start and schedule everything, that both jobs don´t overlap. They agreed and i thought it was fine. \n\nFriday evening my FIL called and talked to my wife, saying that the guy i talked to, complaint to him, that i make them feel like the second best and it was just a favour for my FIL, that i can have an internship there and they were setting up a workplace for me and have made plans for work i can do there (it is a b2b tech company and i make the internship in communication/social media, which they have one person for, that does it by the way). My wife then told me this and gave me some shit about it. She also got in talk with her parents that i don´t have that good communication skills, might have express myself wrong and this could also be a problem in my job hunt. \n\n",

      "description": "For some background, the girl I got into a semi-fight with is not by any means someone I like, but I respect her, because everyone deserves that. She actually says things quite frequently, that make me question her grasp of common sense.\n\nYesterday, during biology class, my teacher brought up being transgender. I am part of the lgbtq+ community, but I'm cis. Regardless, everyone in my class knows that I will stand up for lgbtq+ rights, and that I don't care if a teacher is present, I will not let bigotry pass.\n\nShe asked a question, that I didn't really think was a good one, but then again, I can't expect that everyone is educated on everything, so I eventually offered to answer her question, because our teacher didn't know the answer. I can't remember the actual question, but while asking, she said \"transgender is, for example, a woman who wants to be a man\".\n\nMany of you will likely understand why the phrasing bugged me. I have called her out on this kind of thing multiple times, so I don't really have a problem with doing so again.\nAfter answering her question, I explained why being transgender isn't a choice, and how saying it is, is harmful. Before I could finish, she cut me off to tell me, I didn't understand what she said.\n\nI was getting mad at this point, and my friend tried to calm me down. Apparently, everyone but her understood what I was trying to say. After multiple attempts of me beginning to talk, and her cutting me off, I just told her, that I had no interest in being interrupted while trying to explain something that was important to me, and that she was just being disrespectful. That shocked her, and she began borderline-cursing at me. At that point my biology teacher cut in, and told her to let me talk and explain.\n\nEventually, I was able to explain what being transgender was and that it's not a choice. Also, I very much understood what she said, that's why I was trying to explain that she made a very common mistake.\nAfter that, I refused to discuss the matter with her, because she never let me explain my arguments and dismissed scientific facts.\n\nNow, I do acknowledge that she likely didn't have bad intentions, and that I could have been nicer about it, and not pointed it out. I'm just so tired of transphobia, and I genuinely just tried to educate her, and stayed calm throughout the entire exchange.\n\nAm I the asshole for calling her out and then refusing to put up with her actions?

      "description": "A lot of things led up to the argument that just now ended a 10 year long friendship.\n\nI met my friend, we'll call Becca in 7th grade and her, I and a third friend we'll call Susie became besties. Me and Becca have a falling out after moving apart after 9th grade and we didn't talk for a year. This falling out taught me to never criticize her or she'd block me.\n\nAfter a year we start to pick things up and we end up moving closer to each other again and going to the same school again. For the 2 years the school lasted everything is great, back to normal.\nI had to move to get my education and so did she, but not to the same city. \n\nNow we've lived apart for 4 years, only seeing each other once or twice a year. I've gotten my education, live in an apartment and I'm engaged. Becca ended up moving back home to her parents, dropped out of school and has never recovered. \n\nThrough all of this we have both battled depression and anxiety. Only problem is, I beat mine and she didn't. \n\nI try to support her, sure it's her mom's fault she has anxiety and depression. No she doesn't need to find a new psychologist, it's fine. \n\nBut now the friendship has become one-sided cause I'm not depressed anymore so she can't help me with that, and I can't help her because I'm not allowed to critique her. \nShe has so much anxiety that I have to plan every time we meet, which already isn't often. And she almost always cancels.\n\nI'm already at my limit of what I'll accept from a friend, and all she does is whine about every aspect of her life. And then yesterday happened.\n\nMy dad's had a heart attack and I write to her and Susie. Susie is worried, asks questions, is googling things for me and tried to be Goofy and cheer me up. What does Becca do? \"Read\", she left me on fucking \"read\" when my dad has a heart attack. That hurt.\n\nToday she gives me some bullshit excuse \"I was emotionally exhausted so I put it aside\". And I just snap. I tell her how I thought the friendship had become one-sided, that I didn't think she actually cared about me just the validation I could give her. She kept deflecting everything I said and I think she tried to gaslight me if I'm honest. \n\nIt ended with her now blocking me on Facebook and probably everything else. \n\nAm I the asshole for not keeping my thoughts to my self? Is her excuse valid in that context?\n\nTldr: My best friend for 10 years left me on read when my dad had a heart attack and I snapped told her my truth and now we're not friends anymore.\n",

      "description": "**Background**: Let's call her Susie. At the time, Susie \\[F17\\] and I \\[F17\\] met through mutual friends and she made it a point to become my friend. (Her words later, not mine). She constantly texted me after the time we met, telling me about how we should hang out. Cool enough. We become friends this way, hanging out and going shopping, sleeping over, etc.\n\n**Issue**: Susie, outside of us physically hanging out, only texted me to talk about herself, ask for advice, talk about boys she liked, and rant about her shitty friends. Half the time, I wasn't even sure I agreed with her assessment of the actions of her \"friends,\" but I did my best to play mediator and console her when necessary. At this time, I had been applying for colleges and had my own busy schedule, so I told her several times that I really was busy and wasn't going to be very responsive. She said it was fine, but gradually started getting on my case about when we were going to Facetime. (This sequence of events repeats itself in various ways throughout the school year. Note: I rejected Facetiming with her often because it would take several hours since she would then share consecutive stories/rants/etc. instead of just a few). Eventually Susie sends me a long text message about how I'm not a good friend since I'm not there for her, and that she's always the one starting conversations, stuff like this.\n\n**The part where I'm thinking I was an asshole**: I didn't honestly express that I felt the friendship was one sided at any point throughout this. At times, I did try to shift the conversation and update her on how I was doing, but it always seemed like it would pale in comparison to whatever issue she was facing at the time, plus she tended to go back to talking about herself. But that's the closest I got to openly communicating issues with her.\n\nAfter she sent me this long text message, I was frustrated, and quite honestly a little relieved because it looked like she was giving me a way out, and I took it. I said that I disagreed that I was being a bad friend, but understood that I'm not responsive, and that in that case, we shouldn't be friends anymore. She said \"lol ok\" and a few months later texted me telling me she missed me, but I didn't respond, also working a summer job at that point. Looking back I realize me cutting her off seemed warranted and not out of the blue to my stressed teenage self, but I do see now where she would think I was being harsh and abrupt. AITA?",

      "description": "A family friend of about four years asked me to be a live in nanny for a week for her two kids aged 8 &amp; 10 whilst she went on a business trip out of state; and although in order to do this for her I had to request time off from my job, I agreed. The gig was from Sunday to Friday and she agreed to pay me $1,000.\n\nI’m sorry this is a pretty long story but, my car had to be fixed so I was driving a rental for a few days. the Friday their mother was set to return, I picked the kids up from school, took them out to dinner, and went back to their house. As soon as we got in, i received a call saying my car was ready to be picked up so we got back out to return the rental car &amp; pick my car up. When we got back to their house with my car, I realized I had left my backpack which contained my MacBook in the rental car. \n\nI told the kids we had to get back out and they both started groaning, which was understandable bc the boy was on his ps4 and the girl was on YouTube. I said more firmly “okay let’s go” because the place closed soon. The girl said she didn’t want to go. We went back and forth with me asking them to get in the car and them saying no. Finally the boy said we can just stay here. To which I replied “are you sure?” They both said yes. I said “you won’t be scared?” They both said no. Before I decided to leave them I looked how far away the place was from their house. I had intentionally chosen somewhere near them so I looked on google maps and it said the place was 2.5 miles from their house (about 7 minutes away). I told them where I was going &amp; about how long I’d be gone. I checked to make sure the boy had his cellphone. I asked him if he had my mobile number, he said yes that his mom had emailed it to him before she left. They had another cellphone and I gave it to the girl &amp; told her my number is programmed in if needed. Then I asked them a final time to get in the car, the boy said “no, we’re fine”.\n\nI was gone 10 minutes. The one road from their house to the rental center has a single light which gets pretty heavy traffic &amp; it was green and then coming back it was a right turn so I had no waiting at that particular light. I get back &amp; ask them how they were while I was gone. The girl says fine. Mom comes back around 5:30pm. She pays me $500 cash then writes me a $500 check.\n\nThe next morning she sends me several texts that read “kids told me you left them alone yesterday is this true? You can never them alone. You should always take them with you. It’s against the law you can’t leave kids under 12 alone. Ever.” \nI promptly sent a text saying yes I did leave them &amp; I apologized twice. I sent her the address of the place, told her I asked them several times to get in the car and they refused. \n\nShe then started saying I would end up in jail bc it’s neglect, etc. etc. She also claims that I never interacted with her kids &amp; i didn’t comb her daughters hair. These claims are just blatantly false. I didn’t reply to her future texts bc I felt they were disrespectful and there was nothing I could do but offer my apologies which I had already done. She ended up cancelling the check, causing the particular account I had deposited it into to go into the negative &amp; I was charged a $12 return check fee from my bank. I sent a very blunt text telling her that ultimately my services were rendered &amp; I expect my money by the end of the week or I will file a small claims lawsuit.\n\nI might feel differently if her kids hadn’t been the most difficult children I had ever worked with. Every night the 8yo girl would scream and holler like someone was physically harming her when I told her it was time to get in the bed. Bedtime being 8:30pm. She would stop crying immediately when she would get out of bed to play with the dog. I would tell her to get in bed and screaming would resume. It was so bad the first night that at midnight I called the mom &amp; asked her how to get the girl to stop screaming. She said “she does this to me every night. I was hoping she wouldn’t do this to you” then told me to give her Benadryl tablet. I was not warned she would do this AT ALL. this went on every night I was there.\n\nThe kids and the mom all sleep in the same bed in the moms room, even though the kids each have their own room &amp; beds. So the 10yo old boy would become so angry with the girl for crying while he was trying to sleep, he would hit her and call her fat and stupid and other names. When I suggested the boy go to his room he called me stupid.  The boy finally went to his room, the girl still screaming I decided to again call the mom. She told me an adult woman to go sleep in the same bed as her minor child. This felt like an inappropriate request to me. I just stayed on the floor then returned downstairs to the couch when she finally went to bed.\n\nThe girl locked me out of the house one morning, so that when I finished dropping them off at school I couldn’t get back inside (mom did not leave me a set of keys) for almost 6 hours in freezing weather waiting on a locksmith. I mean I went to a coffee shop nearby to wait after an hour, but still.\n\nTo clarify, we live in Texas, there’s no law against leaving kids of any age alone. I have 10+ years of experience babysitting children from different families &amp; have never had a single complaint &amp; I have also been asked continually to keep kids even though it’s not my profession. I also have experience with special needs kids. \n\nIn a cardi b way, I have demanded the rest of my money. AITA?\n",

      "description": "I had this friend, let’s call her Katie. We met through my husband (they went to hs together) and had become close over the last two or so years. Katie has a daughter who is almost two and I recently found out she planned the pregnancy with her bf of only two months at the time. For almost two years, it’s been her complaining about her boyfriend all day everyday. Some examples: he doesn’t want to help with the child, wants to spend money on himself instead of their family or their child, he leaves the house for days at a time when they argue, chooses his family over her, I could go on and on. There were also many instances she told me about that it was clear that he was verbally abusive to her. They were fighting literally everyday. I encouraged her to talk to him about it, she did and nothing changed. I asked if she wanted to go to counseling, she did but he refused. I finally just told her “I don’t understand why you would want to be with someone who isn’t interested in his own child and doesn’t put any effort into fixing your relationship.” She LOST IT on me saying I don’t understand because I don’t have kids, etc. Here’s the kicker: whenever I would complain about something in passing (for instance, several things going wrong at once in relation to school, the house, my family), she would simply say “you’ll get over it” or “why is that such a big deal?”. I finally just lost it on her and told her I was done being friends with someone always complained about her life, but never did anything to change things and blow up on me. She ended our conversation with “I can’t wait until you have kids and I hope it screws up your relationship like you want it to screw up mine”. AITA for cutting her off\nAnd blocking her on social media? ",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little background info: My classmate who we will call Daniel is to put it lightly, not liked by most pupils and teachers alike. To present a palatable example: At the end of an assembly the head of year asked whether there where any further questions Daniel raised his had and before even announcing his question 250 pairs of eyeballs could be heard grinding inside their sockets as the entire auditorium rolled their eyes, (FYI the assembly was about oceanic pollution caused by plastic and what the school would be doing to reduce its impact on the environment) Daniel asked whether the change in environmental policy would affect the schools ability to serve lasagna on Thursdays (He was not joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStudents like to joke that he has some form of autism, OCD or ADHD. Whilst I have yet to complete (or start) my major in Clinical Psychology (so please take this psychic assessment with a grain of salt). I believe that if anything Daniel has ADHD. It should be noted that Daniel receives learning support. And that I share two classes with him, Economics and Drama to be exact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sympathize with Daniel since I myself have gone through phases at different schools where I had no friends to turn to. \n\nWhenever I see him I make sure to slip in a little small talk e.g ask how he's been holding up (knowing from experience that this can do a lot to help lift a person who might be having a bad day or week). It is just that sometimes in my lessons with him he can say or do the most outrageous things. For example just today in drama at the start of the lesson he pinned his legs under his arms whilst loudly exclaiming (and I quote) \"Fist Me! , Fist Me!\" (no teacher was present) Only to thereafter ask my classmate whether she had a \"Penis\". It is at this point that I always just shrug and tell myself that all drama classes no matter the school will have that one kid. But it has come to points in time where I completely lose it with Daniel since at the end of the day I attend my classes to learn something and not to be pulled aside by Daniel to be asked what my thoughts are on this 'Funny' dank meme compilation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, it is the little things that get to me the most, such as him seeing me spinning my pen in my hand only for him to attempt the same trick for half an hour. Only for him to fail miserably and on every 5th try the pen clatters onto the floor. Only to then have him push the chair away from his desk whilst it painfully scrapes across the floor, so that he may revive his pen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(sorry for the long text but I just wanted to quickly clarify that I try to distance myself from his antics unless they directly involve me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this is the point where I ask you fellow redditors, AMITA e.g Having a normal convo with him in the morning but in a sense ghosting him entirely by the afternoon because he did something that made me boil over internally.",

(We where roommates.) \n\nSo he moved in, and he was doing quite well. Paying bills, grocery shopping, doing chores, and all that. Then, he gradually stopped paying bills. Giving less and less to the money that me and my friend scraped together. \n\nAfter a while, he straight up stopped paying. Giving really stupid excuses like, “oh I got payed less than I used to” or, “sorry I spent it on groceries.” (I had already bought groceries so this was a really dumb excuse.)\n\nAfter about 3 months or so of this, I got mad. I called him a lazy slob, that spent all his money on his Xbox. He got deeply offended, and talked to my friend about it. I didn’t hear any of it, until about 2 months later when I brought it up again. I asked where the money was, and after he started his excuse, I snapped. I screamed at him and told him that he was under our roof, getting our food, while he did nothing. I called him countless names, and he ran to his room. \n\nThe next day, I didn’t see him. I asked my roommate, and she said she broke up with him.\n\nI feel really really bad about ruining a good relationship because he wouldn’t do something. \n\nShort version: AITA for making my roommate break up with her BF because he wouldn’t pay bills?",

While on Christmas break in our hometown, Karen told me that she was talking with Tyler and trying to smooth things over, since their breakup had been particularly rocky and mutual friends were trying to work around their issues and avoidance of each other. Karen then said that while she was in Tyler's truck, he made a pass at her and started kissing/pulling at her until she told him to stop, and he drove her back to her house. This was about a month before Tyler and Tiffany's wedding.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I talked to my parents about the Karen/Tyler incident, they told me not to say anything to Tiffany. I decided not to because Karen loves drama (we have since stopped being friends because of that trait) and I wasn't sure if she exaggerated things, or tried to seduce Tyler herself, and I wasn't there when this happened (if it happened at all). But I'm open to the possibility that IATA. ",

I want to take it and throw it in the trash when she isn't looking, but she sleeps with it and takes it to school. She is attached to this thing. I can never pry her from that damn toy.",

      "description": " \n\nThis happened in my second semester in university, Majoring in chemical engineering. I had a chemistry lecture with assigned seats (this will be important later).\n\nMe being the lazy dipshit I am I overslept and running late to my lecture, managed to get in there only 5 minutes late and luckily my seat is right next to the door so I didn't have to disrupt the class in a middle of a lecture. I see three of my classmates sitting in their assigned seat and greet me quietly as usual. I say hello back, and as I go to my seat I notice someone else's bag and laptop on my seat. I know this is one of the assistant teacher's belongings as I asked her questions sometimes mid-lecture.\n\nI did not want to touch her stuff at first, I waited patiently until she can come back and pick up her stuff so I can sit down in my assigned seat. I was standing in a passageway where the assistant teachers can go and help the students in the rows further back. I was being a nuisance and one of the assistant teachers sitting at a desk in front of me noticed. She calls me over to tell me to sit in my assigned seat, I explained the situation and she told me to move the stuff to her then. I was hesitant and told her I don't want to touch other people's stuff as it could be rude. She tells me she's a friend so she wouldn't mind if I have her permission.\n\nSo I go back to my seat pick up the stuff carefully and place it in the desk in front of me where the other assistant teacher was seated. Went back to my seat and continued jotting down notes and asking questions per usual. Only 3 minutes go by and the owner of the bags and laptop sits directly behind me (That seat was is also taken, the student was probably at a restroom break or something or else I would've just sat there). And she leans over uncomfortably close to my ear and says along the lines of \"Don't you dare touch my fucking shit again without my permission\"\n\nI went full PANIC MODE, I was stuttering my apology and tried to explain the situation as fast as possible before she freaking yells at me or something. I almost shat my pants at that point, I'm not a really confrontational guy also really shy. This puts me in a really bad spot. She walks off still visibly pissed, and my classmates were shocked too saying she was overreacting.\n\nI wanted to give her a proper apology later on, but I couldn't. Whenever I try to go up to her and apologize for what happened that day I again go full panic mode and just quickly walk off before she sees me.\n\nAm I the asshole though? Should I have waited?",

We used to meet almost everyday until last Sunday when I told her that we would no longer meet because we were spending almost 3 hours walking/chatting/making out everyday, and a super important test is only a couple weeks away.\n\nShe was upset, but understood. Today, she learned that I was passing by close to where she stays, so she asked me to come hang out with her for a while. I refused. Firmly. She was upset, and promised that she'd not stay for longer than 10 minutes. I refused again, and told her that it is super important for me to respect resolutions.\n\nShe then gave me some bullshit about how one should bend rules for someone they love, and I got a little pissed. This is how the text conversation went, I am copy-pasting so this is an exact:\n\nHER:\n\nWhat makes us special is when we take out time to do something we know we shouldn't.\n\nME: \n\nThat sounds like something a 16 year old who spends too much time on Instagram would say. When I say something I mean it, and so should you. This is important for my career, and yours too.\n\nHER: \n\nLife isn't just career. You'll lose everything and be left with nothing but a career.\n\nME: *laugh emoji*\n\nHER: \n\nKeep laughing. Laugh as much as you want. You're too good at that.\n\nGo study. That's all you should be doing.\n\nDon't waste your time texting me either.\n\nME: \n\nPlease try to understand my POV instead of getting annoyed at an emoji.\n\nHER: \n\nDon't want to drag this any further. I have no time to make you understand anything. It wastes my time too.\n\nME: \n\nYou're like a child. \n\nYou get angry when you're told to study for an upcoming exam.\n\n*laugh emoji*\n\nHER: \n\nNo, you're just too old. Too old to be in a relationship. Too old to break rules. Too old to understand that life can't be measured. I'm deleting [the messenger app], don't waste your time anymore.\n\nME: \n\nNow you're doing something totally unnecessary.\n\n------------------------\nThat was it. No response. We spoke later in the evening, and she told me that she is upset at the 16 year Instagram comment, and the laugh emojis. She took it further, saying that she isn't happy in the relationship, and needs to re-consider it. This is an overreaction IMO. I just want the best for the both of us. Why won't she understand?",

I’ll refer to my friends as friends but will refer to the others as “friends”\n\nSo they’re all below average when it comes to grades (D’s and C’s) whereas I’m a B’s and low A type of student. One of the “friends”  is around 0.50% off from failing an English class which I also have (the rest have another teacher). I used to help most of them out when we were actually friends but now I don’t considering how stuff they do to me and other people.

They don’t live together but nearby.  They go on holidays in the caravan and hang out a bit I guess when they’re at home.\n\nJack is an arsehole, he is incredibly rude, talks down to everyone and completely ungrateful for anything. He is constantly in a bad mood,  he’ll arrive at Mums in a mood then sulk around like a child until he cracks it and goes home. He throws tantrums if he doesn’t get his way, and blows up, a lot of the time very publicly, over the pettiest of things. He has a habit of just ruining the day. He was always a wanker but has grown to become quite abusive (verbally) and controlling and someone I despise. He also has terminal cancer.\n\nMy Mum admits he’s far from perfect, my siblings cant stand him, my uncle has said he’s not welcome back in their house, he has no friends or family who he’s still in contact with, he’s from overseas originally, he walked out on his wife and kids only trying to connect with them 20-30 years later (it went pear shaped of course).\n\nThey headed off yesterday morning in the caravan, only after he berated my Mum to tears for not having her phone synced to the car.\n\nI only want what’s best for my Mum, I get that she doesn’t want to be alone but I think this guy is so unhealthy for her and a drag for everyone else.  But my Mum is such a beautiful and caring person that I don’t think she would leave him, especially now he’s sick.\n\nHis health recently went downhill and we thought he was close to the end but he has since bounced back.\n\nAm I the arsehole for wanting this guy to fall off the perch?\n",

      "title": "AITA for quitting this job on the spot?",
      "description": "I want to know what the internet thinks about this. I (21) was working your typical fast food grind, they had just fired a manager and shift supervisor Casey (22) was picking up the slack. I never had a problem with Casey, she was good at her job and until this whole thing went down I thought we were cool.\n\nSo one night I’m working the late shift and Casey (who's off) comes in drunk. She immediately starts laying into this new dude, at first just clowning on him but even after he asked her nicely to stop she doubled down and got more insulting. New guy gets pissed and tells her to stop more forcefully. She freaks out. She’s playing the supervisor card, he can’t talk to her that way and she’s gonna either fire him or make his shifts with her hell. I felt really bad for new guy and no one was sticking up for him so I said, “Hey, you’re both pretty fucked up (new guy had smoked a blunt before shift) don’t you think it’s better to have this conversation when you’re in your right minds?” Then Casey immediately turns on me and starts screaming. Telling me I’m “fucking replaceable. You’re nothing. You don’t get to tell me shit about how I can act.” I was getting pissed but I kept my cool and stepped back. Eventually after she ranted for a while she went home. So the shift supervisor on duty told us not to feel bad and that she’s just like that. Then she says that new guy can probably expect an apology but there’s no way she’ll apologize to me because she has this thing with other women. Then the shift supervisor said that Casey’s probably gonna make our shifts together hell because I’ve crossed her. \n\nSo knowing that I was like yeah, no. I texted the general manager detailing what had gone down and at first just asked if I could get taken off Casey’s shifts. Then I realized how unreasonable this was. Casey was working something like 50 hours a week, only shifts without her wasn’t possible. But I knew for a fact she was gonna do everything she can to make me miserable now and I wasn’t about to deal with that. I told GM that I was sorry, but I was gonna have to quit. He assumes I’m putting in my two weeks. I say I’m not comfortable working shifts with Casey and if I have to work with her in the two weeks then I’m quitting on the spot. He says that’s unfortunate because personally he thinks we can work it out. I reiterate no, I’m not comfortable. And that was it, I didn’t show up after that. It was clear GM wasn’t gonna have my back and I was expected to suck it up and deal with her like everybody else. It pissed me off at the time because this was a pattern of behavior that always got overlooked because she’s a hard worker. Until this happened I always disliked people who quit without putting notice, but I didn’t see any other way out. Wanted to know if anyone thought I could have handled it better. ",

      "description": "This require some backstory so hear me up: \nEver since I (21F) got in the University I made a pretty solid group of friends (3 guys, another girl and I, all about the same age). We were very close and all was rainbows and unicorns and so on. \nIn the fall of 2017 I went to an international exchange and, while I was there, another dude joined the squad. Nothing big happened, he was in the group chat and talked very little there, bit now I'm back to Uni with them and things have changed.\nI have terrible anxiety and mild depression and, even though I am medicated and in therapy, I know my limitations and triggers, I have to be hyper vigilant so I don't fall into a bad, harmful state again. I've been okay for 2 years now, my brain is behaving nicely and all, but this new dude is raising all kinds of red flags.\nHe is depressed and hasn't yet found the right combination of meds to keep it under control. He talks a lot about negative behaviors and how sad and numb he feels (as jokes, subtext and smug comments), and I totally understand him, being in this place is horrible and maybe he is using this \"humorous\" tone to cope with it; but this negative talk has been putting me down whenever the squad hangs out.\nI love my other friends, but every time we go out and meet somewhere he is there too and it makes me soooo uncomfortable and anxious.\nWould I be the asshole if I distance myself from the sqad?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I started dating long-distance about a month and a half after she broke up with her previous boyfriend of 2 years. Since it was pretty soon after that, she understandably wanted to keep things off social media for a few months to give him time. In our initial conversation, we had agreed that things would/could change around January or February. In our most recent conversations however, it seems that she wants to keep our relationship entirely off social media.\n\nShe feels that lots of people knew more about her last relationship than she necessarily wanted. She also greatly values her friendships with people (including her ex, though they haven't talked in months now) and doesn't want to jeopardize her relationship with him by hurting him. Thus, she wants to have a relationship where only our close friends really know what's going on. Also, I guess in her last relationship they would each post pictures for different (not necessarily good) reasons.\n\nThis bothers me because she will sometimes fly to visit for a wedding and post lots of pictures with people she hasn't seen in weeks. We take pictures together, but I never make any appearances on her social media unless it's as part of a group picture. I feel like she is either 1) embarrassed about being with me or 2) catering to her last boyfriend because she doesn't want him to feel hurt because she has moved on. Either way, it hurts me because I feel entirely left out and she posts regularly. I don't want over the top, mushy social media posting. However, I would at least like to post pictures of us in nice clothes from a wedding, for instance. \n\nAITA for wanting to be more public about our time together?",

      "description": "I told my friend that I'm interested in her a month after meeting her. I no longer remember how she responded to this. I do remember that after a month of telling her that, I decided to tell her that I want to date her, yet she responded that she doesn't want to date as of the moment. After a week, we were able to meet each other, resulting in a serious talk about how she's not allowed to date without finishing her education, or at the very least, without being halfway through her education.\n\nA few months pass by, and I ask her if she wants to hang out; she accepted, and by chance, it was only the both of us in her place. Nothing notable happens, but when I asked her on the phone how it was, she told me that \"It got me excited, because you're a guy after all.\" This prompted her and I to be more sexual to each other, to the point that we've shared a lot of risque photos to each other over the course of a few months.\n\nDuring the course of the few months, I asked her to promise to date me in a year, to which she promised, but revoked the week after. Around the same time, I find out that a few other guys have actually been asking her out, and at the same time, rejecting them by telling them that \"she can't decide if it's a yes or a no.\" -- she also rejected me in the same way. One time, while hanging out with her, one of the other guys chatted her and she replied. This made me upset, as one of her reasons for not replying to me at times is \"I was hanging out with friends.\"\n\nA lot of nothing happened for the next few months, and finally, university made her busy enough that she can no longer talk to me as often. I finally can't take it anymore, and tell her I'm done. I checked her profile every now and then, and this is most likely just confirmation bias, but she's been communicating with one of the other guys more often. I couldn't take this anymore, and told her that I can't even stay as friends with her anymore.\n\nFeel free to ask for more details in the comments.",

      "description": "My girlfriend are long distance(Kind of, ~1hour drive). We basically only see each other on weekends as we have school and work on weekdays. We try to switch houses weekends to keep things fair. \n\nThis upcoming weekend is her weekend but a school club I recently joined is having a party on Friday night. I knew this a week ago and I checked in with her to make sure it was okay for us to go and asked her if she would want to take the bus down to my house, go to the party that night, and then take the bus back up to her house for the rest of the weekend. She agreed to travel down on her weekend. Other small notes: We are also going to a friends going away party Saturday night in her hometown and I have also agreed to DJ this party and judge the competition going on that night.\n\nThen on Tuesday, her new job told her if she could work on Friday night and she agreed. Since she now works on Friday night she can't get on any buses to take her down to see me since there are no buses running that route that late at night. We are both trying to save money since we don't have that much so she doesn't want to drive her car down. I did tell her that she shouldn't go back on her word since it's a new job and she should do everything to look good towards her new bosses. \n\nNow she wants me to cancel my DJ gig and my judging that I had already committed to, to come up and spend that night with her. I agreed that I can just come up the next morning after the party but that isn't good enough for her and she wants me to come up as soon as I get out of class on Friday. She says that since it is her weekend and she wants to see me, that she gets priority and that I should cancel going to the party.\n\nI understand we don't get to see each other as much as we want to but I feel like I took every right step towards making sure it was okay to go to this party and it was her mistake to agree to working late that fucked things up. I also understand that it's her weekend but I already made my commitment to my friends to go to the party when she told me it was okay to do so. This club is also a great group of friends that I want to hang out with more. She thinks that since I want to go to the party, this means that I value the new friends more than her. So that's where things are now. Am I the asshole for wanting to go to this party when my girlfriend can't go?",

      "description": "WIBTA if I tell my friend that he is being cheated on?\n\nI'll try to keep this story straight with names, it might get a little complicated. There's me, my gf (M), my gf's roommate (A), my roommate (T), and my friend (E).\n\nBackstory: Me, E, and T all good friends two years ago, freshman year of college. We hang out all the time, life's great. A and T meet and start hanging out, one night E asks me if I wanna come to the hookah lounge with him, A and T. I accept, and I meet A for the first time. Immediately she's off-putting. Making weird comments how how muscular I am, in front of two guys that clearly have huge crushes on her, and just overall having no sense of what to say in the room, really killing any vibe, you probably know the type. Anywho, I found out around present day that A told M right before she got with T that she was going to choose E, saying that \"he's THE ONE\", which is batshit crazy seeing as they have known each other for like two weeks and are 18.\n\nA actually ends up choosing T, and they have a long and horrible relationship filled with miscommunications, fights, drama, etc. M and I are on the sidelines of this because I live with T and she lives with A. At least once a week T goes to break up with her, but for some reason A thinks it has to be agreed on, and they end up fucking and just resuming the cycle. So much drama and it's pathetic because of how idiotic they act. They have no boundaries, A has taken condoms from M and I and denied stealing them, T never does anything for anyone but himself. it makes everyone so tired of them. Anyway, over last summer T finds a girl he actually likes for reasons outside of the bedroom, and breaks it off with A for good. T enjoys his new girl, but one night A comes down to our place BLASTED drunk and hits her head, passed out. Me and a friend take her to the ER because they cant afford an ambulance, and we are good friends, and don't want to see anyone die tonight. This seemed to be a wake up call for A. she goes home and lives with her parents for a bit, eventually comes back and see,s changed.\n\nA ends up getting with E, and they start spending all their time together, despite E seeing how A and T played out. Then, 2 days ago, T and her meet up at 11pm to \"delete their messages/pictures together\" (wtf). They end up staying the night at her place, and staying together locked in her room for the entire day and the majority of yesterday. We know they had sex, since M's friend saw condoms that aren't the brand A and E use (A tried to give M some back for the ones she stole), and given their history no one is surprised.\n\nT also left a big pile of his disgusting dishes in the sink for a week, and I put them on his bed last night so they would be out of the sink, which he got mad about, so I'm pretty much done since I asked him to clean them up 3 or more times. I would not feel bad about letting my friend E know what's happened this weekend, but WIBTA?",

      "description": "Here's the thing. We're both in our 20s but I'm a few years older and was never into the party/drinking thing to begin with. I don't really get the point of getting blackout drunk. He's not super into it either, but he will on average have a gaming and drinking or bar/club night with friends or roommates maybe once a week (depending, sometimes more sometimes nothing for 2-3 weeks) \n\nMy issue is, he will almost always get REALLY drunk. The 'I'm not sure what happened last night, I woke up in my toilet, with puke in the sink , or in my bed covered in puke' level of drunk, at least half the time . This included a 'fun' night where he then later  told me he thought he kissed one of his female friends. \n\nHe goes out with people who are (some anyway) much heavier drinkers (and he's a skinny guy who sometimes forgets to eat). One of his friends recently had to be picked up by an ambulance after just lying in the street, too drunk to walk home. It's a group of 21-28 year old guys (legal drinking age is 18 btw so he's been legal to drink for years now) and I don't expect him to not drink.. But we don't live near each other (long distance) and I'll get a bunch of 'help me' 'I'm so sick' 'I don't know where I am' texts at 2 or 3am... And, for example today, its now 3:30 pm and still no word from him after texting me that last night...\n\nAITA if I try and talk to him about it or make a big deal out of it? On one hand he's an adult and I'm not his mother... And it's not a 'happens constantly' thing... But I'm tired of worrying whether or not he got home safe during/after he has a night out",

      "description": "   Okay guys I'm pretty new to reddit, so hope this story fits here. This happened about a year and a half ago.\n\n    Storytime: setting... Downtown Memphis, Music and Heritage Fest 8:30 pm. I'm at a restaurant that some of my friends newly opened. There's a table of 9 people wearing all black with tight pants looking pretentious as hell. So I'm at the bar having a bottle of sake and a beer about ten feet away from them, when one of the guys begins to complain about his service (very loudly) and being EXTREMELY rude to the bartender, who is also acting as their server. \n\n    The rude guy just keeps going on and on about things taking too long, and what terrible service he is receiving. This place has only been open for a week, so they're still figuring things out, and their staff is still getting broken in/they are short-staffed. Also- they are absolutely SLAMMED because this place is located near Beale St. right next to the music festival.\n\n   I would like to add that I had just gotten off of a long shift in a restaurant kitchen, and hear stories from server friends of mine who are constantly berated and belittled by these types of people... So I feel no mercy for these kinds of assholes. \n\n   After dude gets rude with the server, continuing on about how terrible the food is, how the guy isn't doing his job correctly etc, I make direct eye contact with him and roll my eyes in the most extreme manner possible, while scoughing at him. The bartender goes back behind the bar, looking a little down, but still very busy, and I proceed to tell him (very loudly)  to not worry about the rude customer,  because he looks like he tried out for Nickelback and got rejected.\n\n    I am not sure if the guy heard me or not, but I know for sure the table heard, because they gave me various looks of disgust.\n\n  Shortly after that, one of the women from the table came up to the bar next to me to pay for her tab, along with a couple of other people.\n\n   Me, trying to make small talk: \"So... Where are y'all from?\"\n\n   Lady: \"Oh, all over. Some from New York, some of us from California, etc. Etc.\"\n\n\"We're Smashmouth.\" \n\n   Me: \"... Oh...\"\n\n   The minute that followed seemed like the longest of my life, as I tried to keep from bursting out laughing. There were tears in my eyes and my face was turning red until finally I could not stand it anymore, and, after making eye contact with the bartender and seeing him tying not to laugh as well, I had to run around the bar to the back of the kitchen and burst out laughing. I was laughing so hard that I was honestly crying and could not breathe for a good five minutes after.\n\n   So anyways, I eventually come back to my seat at the bar where I now see this asshole standing there basically arguing with the bartender about his bill. By this point I'm just chugging the rest of my beer and trying not to laugh. \n\n   I couldn't hear most of their conversation, but at the end of it the douchebag seemed pleased and said something along the lines of \"you deserve this\" while handing the bartender a crumpled up, faded-looking five dollar bill. By this point I was tipsy and couldn't stop myself from laughing.\n\n   ",

      "description": "TL;DR: accidentally telling that our wife pastor talked to our pastor assistant being too close to my girl church mate and asking him to maybe stop being too close because he's gonna be a pastor 🤷‍♀️ (really dont know why she said that) \n\nIm born again christian and have been that way since i was younger, growing up in the church and all those stuff. I did stopped atteding for personal reason and just started being active again so im not close and not as updated to whats happening but i have twin who's a lead singer in church worship ministry and 2 more little sisters who's more active than me. \n\nAnyway yesterday was my/and my twin birthday, we celebrated it thru youth fellowship. When i saw her i gave a tiny comment about how she and our assitant pastor doing in a joking tone. Then she started asking me what i mean and i asked her what she meant lol , then she pulled me in the side and asked me whats happening bc everybody is asking the same question basically everytime we have gathering and in church then i said \"you didnt know that our pastor wife asked him(pastor assistant) to stop being too close to you?\" And then she started tearing down and pulled me far from the room and went outside.\n\nI was shocked cos i didnt know she would cry! And i dont like seeing people cry! I then apologize and tell her she can have a big bite to my cake later! but she said it wasnt my fault &gt;.&lt;.\n\nShe told me how she didnt know about that but shes more hurt that we didnt told her anything (tho in my head i thought she knew!) And she felt like an idiot being made fun whenever people asking her how her and him doing. Like everybody knew about it and its about her but she didnt. \n\n\nShe then told me that shes been crying to God (crying while praying) about this and shes asking God for why he suddenly just plainly ignore her even in church and stopped texting too. I couldnt say anything more bc i literally have no idea what to say and i just knew about it cos my sisters was talking about it. After that she asked to leave her for a moment so i did. \n\n\nI asked assistant pastor if he was mad at me he said he's scared that maybe she'll stop going to church bc of what happen. But she did mention that she felt like  nobody cares about her feeling and nobody come forward to say anything.\n\n\nI really dont know what to feel. Btw the guy was the one who approach the girl and started everything just bc he knew that the girl had a crush to him so i feel so disappointed how he handle it and ghost her.\n\nAlso to add more info, the term i used was wrong when i told her. Bc i said like \"our pastor wife ask him to stop talking to her\" but it should be like \"pastor wife said that he maybe should date someone who have same faith as him\" \n\nHonestly.. i dont think im an asshole but tell me what u think?\n",

      "description": "A few marginal things. The cards I mentioned is the Match Attax cards. The cards that represent soccer players. I'm a big fan of this thing and I have a huge collection of it. \n\nSo I got to know a MA card seller through a facebook group. I asked to buy 20 cards from his collection. He told me they would cost me 50$. I agreed with the deal and he asked me to meet him at a location near his house. \n\nThe yesterday evening, I went to the location and met the seller. He gave me the cards and after 3 or 4 times counting. I realised that there were only 19 cards. The seller told me that he would go and get me the last card (with my money) that was missing out and asked me to go to the location again to retrieve the last card later and I agreed. \n\nBut shit happened this morning, when he sent me a text massage:\n\nSeller : \"Hey man, can you get the card later?\"\n\nMe : \"Did anything come up?\"\n\nSeller : \"Yes, I lost my wallet a little while ago\"\n\nMe : \"Oh, I'm very sorry, so yes lets meet later\"\n\nSeller : \"Also can you bring 5$ more, cause I need money to get the card, but now I lost all my money\"\n\nMe : \"No... My man we totally agreed on the 50$ - 20 cards deal, now you didnt give me enough of them, so I will just meet you and get the last card, no additional cash\"\n\nSeller : \"But I'm currently dont have any money so I cannot get you the card\"\n\nMe : \"I gave you time to do it, so stop asking for more\"\n\nSeller : \"alright so you are just a parsimonious asshole hah?\" \n\nI did not reply to his massage.\n\nAITA?

      "description": " \n\nSo a bit of backstory. I (20M) developed a \"friendly\" relationship with my gay manager (57M), let's call him GM. We met 2 years ago when I was struggling to find a part-time job during HS. I applied at his store (sportswear retail) and got in. I feel like GM always wanted me either as a love interest or just as a fuck-buddy...\n\nGM's parents died long ago, he only has 1 brother who neglected him up to recently because of his sexuality, never married or had any long-term relationships and is currently fighting a legal battle with his dead father's ex-wife who mind you is just a gold digging whore trying to take away half of his inheritance because she married him. However this this bitch is only 58 and married GM's father when he was 82 pretty much laying on his deathbed.\n\nAnyway, so I know GM has a somewhat tough life. He got into my personal space when his car had broken down and he had nobody willing to drop him off. He lived underway my route home, so I didn't mind dropping him off. I had been dropping him off for about 2 weeks until his mechanical problems got solved. In the meantime GM tried everything to steer conversations to personal things and break down barriers to get me into his personal life. I feel like he got attached to me and now that he knew me a bit more personally and wanted more than me being his acquaintance.\n\nEventually he was inviting me over for fancy dinners, giving me gifts, offering help to get me a better job (which he did, I got into a bank due to his contacts). I took them but didn't know how to feel, but took them anyway. I never gave it much thought, now I know whatever people do for you they most likely have ulterior motives.\n\nFast forward to today, I moved away for college and GM got an even better job at the government, this job however is very demanding and stressful. I'm back in town for a few weeks and GM found out so he tried reaching out to me. This time he invited me to dinner at his house and told me how everything was going for him in his life. His brother finally accepted him, however he just took his retirement, sold his house and is moving to Ecuador. 4 of his family members died during the holidays one after the other and he's still disputing the gold digging whore in court to keep his mother's house. I feel bad for GM because he's literally a lonely guy who's got a lot on his plate, but he's an adult, he should figure it out. GM Later mentions that he'd like to go to the beach on Saturday and would like me to accompany him. I'm currently on vacation and have nothing better to do and oblige to being of his company.\n\nToday GM calls and tells me, he's had a very rough week and wants to release himself, whatever that means. GM told me he wanted a man to take care of him and wants to go out for drinks, go to one of those uppity night clubs and just go all out for a night. \" Just look after me and if I act stupid or try taking anybody home, stop me, and be on the lookout for if I have too many drinks.\" I politely declined because I don't want to babysit this 57 year old gay man who will potentially get drunk out of his mind and wants me to take care of him for the night. Besides, I was already going to be spending most of my Saturday with this guy at the beach. GM didn't care, GM wanted, let me rephrase, expected me to be there and babysit him for a night out. He then tells me I'd never have gotten any of the opportunities I got in life if it wasn't because of him. Mentioning how he got me my one of my first jobs and lobbying hard enough to get me working in a bank. I told him I'm not interested, would rather stay home and just don't want to be fucking babysitting him. GM tried to coerce me, saying that turning him down would mean I'll be off his book and not going to see him anymore and that he will no longer be doing \"nice things\" for me. I don't even care if he wants me to see him, I don't care if I see him or don't, I was only there out of pity and now I couldn't care less about whatever happens to him.\n\n\\*Note:\\* I'm straight. I never went up to him asking for help. He offered himself all of the time. Now I know he's always been expecting something in return.\n\nTL/DR a 55 year old gay man gave me my first job when I was 18 and he did all he could to get me involved in his personal life. I sometimes hangout with him because he has a lot on his plate and I pity him. He wants me to go out with him for drinks and babysit him if he goes overboard with the booze. I told him I didn't want to and now he's claiming I never do anything for him and that he's done everything in his power to help me. If I don't oblige to babysitting him he will never again try to help me with anything in life and will push me out of his life.\n\nAm I The Asshole?",

I don’t think my roommates believe this, but it’s true. NONE of the mess in the kitchen is mine. \n\n\nnow, some of my roommates can’t stand having a messy house. one of them said that she gets anxiety because of how dirty it is, and she can’t cook because the mess stresses her out too much. there are a few of them that are always freaking out and “scolding” the rest of us for not keeping the kitchen clean. \n\n\nyesterday, one of them decided that we are all going to get together sometime today to clean the kitchen and the bathroom. I feel for them that they hate the house being dirty, and it’s not fair for them to have to deal with it or clean it themselves. on the other hand, it’s not fair for me to clean it up either, especially if the mess doesn’t even bother me. I don’t feel like I have any obligation to clean other people’s messes. and, they all talk badly about me to each other and in general treat me like shit, so that doesn’t give me much of an incentive to do it out of the goodness of my heart. \n\n\nso, AITA for refusing to clean the kitchen, if none of it is my mess? I would probably be the only one out of the 8 of us that doesn’t help out ",

      "description": "So I (21F) normally have a pretty good relationship with my mother (59). I moved two states away for college but we continue to talk on the phone weekly and text back and forth daily. She’s really into taking photos of her daily life and either posting them on social media or putting them in scrapbooks. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve hated being in photos. I’m a very private person, and I like to have a say in which images of me get immortalized forever/shown to a wide circle of people. I’ll admit that I’m a bit of a control freak, and I know it’s a major flaw. \n\nI’m currently home on spring break and tonight we made dinner with our close family friends. It was a fun gathering, and pictures were obviously taken. I told my mom that I didn’t want any of them posted on Facebook, and she agreed. Later on I noticed that she’d tagged me in a couple pictures that she had posted. I pulled her aside and reminded her that I don’t like my photo being posted without my consent and asked her to take down the pictures with me in them. Things never got heated, but she seemed pretty upset at my request and said I was being unreasonable. I don’t think i was being unreasonable, but I’m not exactly the most objective judge of that.

      "description": "She and I (19F) are not super close, however we’re all three heavily involved in our college’s theatre department so we all see each other often. The two of them started dating sometime around April of this year and were very much in love. \n\nThis brings us to about two or three weeks ago. They broke up, but I’m not entirely certain why or what happened. I don’t want to be nosy and pry so I’ve just left it be. What I do know is that my friend (we’ll call her Tiffany) took it very hard. She has a very severe anxiety disorder and ended up admitting herself due to the breakdown she had (I didn’t find this out until after the deed was done). Not long after I run into the ex (we’ll call him Tyler) on tinder and we match. Part of it was the politeness that you always swipe right on your friends, another part of it curiosity because I had heard rumors they broke up but wasn’t certain, and the last part is a very strong attraction to him. I’d felt it since I met him our freshman year, but I myself got into a relationship (we broke up some time ago) not long after meeting so that didn’t go anywhere then. \n\nTyler and I exchanged some friendly banter back and forth and realized we were both on the app purely for hookups- he was still too upset about the breakup to look for a real relationship and I’m just not in a stable enough place in my life for that. That lead to the conversation turning to the possibility of us hooking up. We acknowledged a few things that made it a bad idea- the breakup was relatively fresh, I’m friends with the both of them, and if news got around the theatre department about us hooking up people may get upset at us despite not being personally involved (they were kinda the sweethearts of the department). In the end hormones won out and we ended up hooking up that same day. We agreed this would be a one time thing because any more than that could lead into the very dangerous territory of feelings (we are both very much each others type). \n\nSince then it hasn’t been awkward between any of us and word hasn’t gotten out as far as I know, but I can’t help but feel guilty. At the time I didn’t know just how far the breakup had pushed Tiffany, and even now I’m uncertain how she’s handling it since she is on tinder herself. I could just be overthinking everything since I tend to put a lot of blame on myself, but I really think I might have been the asshole in this situation. ",

      "description": "Am I the asshole son for not calling my parents or going to family gatherings/holidays?\n\nI feel really uncomfortable talking to my family over the phone or at family gatherings. I have basically stopped doing either because my parents belittle me and my siblings by asking demeaning questions about when we are going to get our lives together. By together they basically mean becoming millionaires. \n\nThey talk shit about all of us to each other. This is based off of the conversations I have had with them where they make fun of my siblings, so I am fairly certain I can guess what they say about me behind my back as well. It’s sickening, because I feel like they have nothing else to talk about, so they use this gossip as a conversation topic because they think it’s funny we are all struggling. \n\nI don’t even know how to have a conversation with my dad that doesn’t end up solely about money or shit talking. I hold some of the responsibility on this, because if I had more to talk about, maybe there would be less gossip. \n\nAnyways, they both grew up middle class, but my dad ended up making mid 6 figures up to 7 figures a year, until the ‘07-08 recession. After that they got divorced and they both wasted millions of dollars by acting like r/wallsteetbets gods. By that I mean they both gambled away everything or used it to buy super luxury cars, jewelry, and travel. They expect all of us to be near the same income bracket that they were. \n\nThe problem is none of us went to college because they both said the other should have paid for college (they got divorced right before the recession) and because we couldn’t qualify for FASFA because they had too many assets. So we all ended up in near minimum wage, dead-end jobs, instead of the white collar “prestigious” careers they expected.\n\nTo be honest, I am resentful over that and this makes me less willing to listen to them make fun of my siblings when they talk to me, as well as making me feel inferior. This is where my question/post stems from. I feel like IANTA for distancing myself, but that I also could be TA for feeling entitled to go to college. ",

      "description": "About this story: I work as a police officer in a metro PD, before that I was in the Marines. I've been willfully single since my last long term girlfriend cheated on me during my second deployment. I also struggle with major depressive disorder. There you go, context.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCouple months back, a new officer, Sierra, got hired on and came to our shift for training. Sierra seemed pretty cool at the time, and she was always flirting with me and making suggestive comments. I brushed these off initially until I started hearing from my buddies on shift that she wouldn't stop talking about me to them. She and I get to talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis goes on, hot and cold for a few months, but the signs of interest are still strong and still there. One night, she shoots me a text inviting me out with some of our mutual friends from a couple shifts. Most everyone is a couple, and only she and I are single. I agree. I roll up to the spot that night and here's the big red flag that got my paranoia tingling: the married guy she said she invited (we're gonna call him Tango) is riding with her and her friends. His wife? Not there. Suddenly, Sierra's body language around me is closed and cold. Conversation is gone. This is unusual, off baseline. So I do what any red-blooded Marine would do and get wasted. That doesn't help. The night goes sideways, she's constantly wandering off with Tango and getting handsy with him, pretending I don't exist. I say fuck it, I'm out, go to close my tab out and some dude tries to start a fight with me. Tango and Sierra are at the bar, watching this unfold, doing nothing. After we get separated, they walk by and pretend to not even see me save for a snide look from Tango. I leave. Sierra calls me, is mad at me for leaving and confused why I'm upset. I eventually agree to come back, and have it out with her outside the bar. She says she told me we'd never work (she didn't) on snap and that I'm too shitfaced to remember.  I leave, get home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I come back to work at the PD on light duty, minus my gun.  Wasn't a good couple weeks for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFind out from friends Tango has been talking shit about me and my absence from work. So has Sierra. Nobody in the PD likes that he's done this, because most people know me as a generally good guy and my absence is worrying. Only my shift commander and a few command staff know the truth about why I've been gone. To make matters worse, Tango and Sierra have starting shacking up together. No big deal, except Tango is married. With three kids. Tango's wife has no clue about this. On top of that, Tango was Sierra's training officer. That's a huge violation of departmental policy, and something the PD has had issues with in the past. I'm torn. I'm a principled guy, I'd like to say, and I expected better of my LEO peers when I joined this PD. I also hate cheaters, they're scum. I want to report this relationship to IA. But I also want to be the better person.",

TLDR at the bottom.\n\nhere goes:\n\nbeen living with my roommates for over a year or so now and it's me, my 25(F) roomie with a 4 yo daughter whom i adore and cherish like a niece, my other roommates 40(F) and her husband 39(M) who have a 3 yo daughter themselves. \n\nnow, a few weeks back the household gets an email from the 39(M) husband about being careful of the language we use around the two girls. things like calling them pretty or beautiful or cute constantly, because of feminism, self-image, etc. \nvery reasonable, in fact, eye-opening and endearing because they really try their hardest to make sure they're raised to be as confident in every aspect as possible besides looks. very lucky kids.\n\ncut to a week later and we're having dinner, when the 25(F) roomie with the 4 yo turns and specifically asks me to \"stop calling her the smartest kid you know\". she goes on to explain that she feels it would put a lot of undue pressure on her to have her be told she's that smart, and she might feel like she would have to live up to it. i understood exactly where she was coming from, since i got it a lot as a kid and now i feel anxious whenever i feel like i'm not smart enough or not living up to the potential others expect. \n\nthe main difference i think is, i never really had that sort of validation from the ones that mattered the most, i.e my mother, family, etc. meanwhile teachers, peers wouldn't hesitate to tell me. so since i trusted my family's opinion of me far more than anyone (as a young kid would) i never really took it to heart or believed them. now, i understand that i always was smart, just never supported due to their narcissism.\n\nANYWAY, what i'm getting at is that i feel it's important to validate her intelligence NOW, especially from her own mother and loved ones, rather than her try to seek it elsewhere or never even feel like it exists. i admit she isn't very book smart and school makes her anxious, but she's incredibly intuitive and clever. she's emotionally mature and so great with kids younger than her. she doesn't have the greatest vocab but she makes up for it by piecing together her thoughts in a unique, intelligent way. she's just so... smart in her own way. \n\nsince that conversation i've respected her wishes and refrained from calling her smart, it's just deep inside i feel like it's almost a disservice to the kid. but who knows, maybe mother truly knows best. \n\nTLDR; my roomie thinks i shouldn't call her daughter smart because the pressure might set her up for failure in the long run, but i think the sooner she realizes she's smart in many ways, she'll be able to understand her strengths and talents instead of not recognizing them at all.\n\ni hope i've clarified everything but if not, please ask for follow-ups. but for now, reddit, AITA?

      "description": "I don't often post on reddit, so forgive me for any formatting issues.\n\nFor some basics, my family immigrated to Canada when I was 8. My parents argued a lot then and still do. My mom wasn't the type to fight back or yell (until recently) so I have  a lot of memories of him yelling at her while I sat terrified in bed. I should say that there was never anything physical, but I know my mom was and still is so tired emotionally. But it's hard to look back at the past and say who was in the wrong, just what I remember. Additionally, I'm the type of person that cries when I argue. I really can't help it, it's something I hate about myself and have tried to stop but have no idea how. It's especially bad when arguing with my dad. \n\nI was arguing with my dad about the way I said something with an attitude that pissed him off. He kept asking me to do something a certain way, and so I told him (very calmly) that this is the third time I'm telling you I want to do it this way. He said the fact I brought up it was the third time annoyed him and started arguging. The thing is, the way he argues involves a lot of raised voices which is normal for him. So cue me crying. While arguing, I asked him why he couldn't control his voice and not yell (something I've asked him to do before too) . He said he couldn't control it just like I couldn't control my crying. At this point we'd been arguing for a bit and I was getting quite emotional, and I brought up that he was an adult who has had years more of life than me, and I had been scared of his yelling since I was a child. He said something along the lines of we can go over the past however many years we want, but it wouldn't do anything. Then he said his priority right now was going to work and left.\n\nSo Reddit, is he right? AITA for not being able to control my crying, and it's the same thing as him not being able to control his voice?",

      "description": "A bit of backstory: at my high school, the juniors and seniors have a prom every spring, and are allowed to bring underclassmen and people from other towns, so long as they pay for both tickets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I are both sophomores, and I found out a few weeks ago that a mutual friend of ours, who I'll call OMF (Our Mutual Friend), asked my boyfriend to the prom. I didn't find out about it from my boyfriend, instead from our friend at lunch. However, upon commenting on it to my boyfriend, he forgot he hadn't told me, and his response was genuine. I have no reason to believe he was hiding it from me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, normally I'd be 100% chill with OMF bringing my boyfriend to prom. However, a few red flags popped up in my head. **1: OMF didn't consult with me first:** Our relationship was only a few weeks in and being kept lowkey at that point, OMF was one of the few people my boyfriend had told about us by then. Now, I am not the controlling type, but I was a little offended that she didn't ask if it was cool. I would've said yes, so maybe it doesn't matter, but that brings me to point **2: I sometimes get the feeling OMF likes my boyfriend.** I don't want to jump to conclusions, as I love OMF, but I can't help but be suspicious. Everytime the two are in the same place, OMF is usually with my boyfriend, and keeps up a constant conversation with him. For example, one time my boyfriend and I were talking, and OMF, who had been far on the other side of the room, came up to us and started talking to my boyfriend, and (whether unintentionally or not) kicked me out of the conversation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love OMF, but I don't know whether or not I'm being dramatic and reading into things. I am also going to prom, but it is with someone I consider to be like my brother, and my boyfriend knows we are like siblings, and doesn't mind. I want to be as nonchalant, but my anxiety is getting the best of me. I know that OMF won't try anything, but I can't help being really uncomfortable about the situation. I feel too awkward to bring this up with my boyfriend, but I feel that I'll have to soon, before the anxiety and annoyance builds up towards OMF. So, AItA?",

      "description": " \n\nMy friend invited my husband and me to a 40th birthday party for her husband. The party was going to be at a fairly upscale restaurant with dancing afterwards. We’ve been working on some remodeling projects, so we’ve been on a strict budget. My husband and I wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.\n\nWhen we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. When were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I asked a passing waiter if I could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. The waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.\n\nMy friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but I was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.\n\nAs the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend’s husband with the check. My friend’s husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, “I know this isn’t how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. We told you that.” I suddenly started panicking inside. I was trying to catch someone else’s eye to see if they were panicking as much as I was. One other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. I opened the check, and the total was $211. I thought I was going to throw up. I have never spent that much on a meal.\n\nI held my shit together because I didn’t want to make a scene. The couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn’t paying. They said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.\n\nI ended up messaging her and said, “Thanks so much for inviting us to \\*\\*\\*’s party. We had a great time. Just a heads up for next time, we really need to know if there if going to a party is going to cost more than $100. We are on a really tight budget, so a heads up would be appreciated. Thanks again.”\n\nMy friend said, “Sorry! Should have given you a heads up. Glad you came.” And we haven’t spoken or hung out since. I’ve tried to set up coffee dates and girl’s nights but she just bails or never responds. It’s been almost 3 months, and she doesn’t seem to want to talk to me at all.",

      "description": "First time poster and on mobile so apologies for any issues! \n\nI have a 3 year old who has a foot amputation. She wears a prosthetic leg. Because of this I am on a FB page about limb differences. Currently there is a woman losing her mind because her friends nephews son went on a date through Tinder, didn't tell the girl he was missing an arm and when she questioned it he responded by rubbing his nub all over her. Girl told boy he shouldn't have hidden the fact (apparently all photos on his profile were with his nub facing away) and she felt he had deceived her. This woman is losing it because this girl is being discriminatory towards people with a limb difference. I asked why was it different to height and weight? We expect people to be honest about that so why not about a physical disability. I don't think the guy had to shout it from the rooftop but I can imagine it was a shock getting into a car and finding your driver, and date, only had 1 arm! So now im getting ripped on this page and am curious, AITA? ",

This did not change when they got into a relationship.\n3 months ago I was talking via chat with her and she was saying how great her ass was and all that fuzz, jokingly i said: \"Hey, if your ass is so damn great, why don't you send a pic?\" which in retrospect did not sound like a joke at all. She said she would if her boyfriend and best friend of mine gave me permission. Me, being the horny monster that I am, asked the boyfriend for permission and he said: \"Yeah, I'll share anything for a brother\"\nAfter communicating that to his girl, she procceded to send the nude, to my surprise.

He had no time to go back as he needed to catch a specific train so I took his keys and got it myself. The problem then was that we don't work near each other and I would have no chance during the day to return them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called him when I got into the house and offered to hide the keys in a pile of stuff he has in the porch ready to go to a charity shop and he said no (understandable). When I was on the bus I called him again to discuss what to do, and he said I should put them in a taxi to his job. I work in the City Centre and he works out in a suburb and the total cost would be around €25-€30 so I said no. I offered three alternatives:\n\n1) I meet him during his commute home, he wouldn't even need to step off the train.\n\n2) I could take the bus out to where he works and give them to him if he's staying in the area late.\n\n3) I could go to his house when he needs to get in, then go home to my own place from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach of these options would take 2+ hours out of my evening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe refused all of these saying they were too much hassle. At this point we started to argue and fair enough, it was my mistake that I needed to go back and I did technically cause this annoyance, but I don't think it's that big of a deal or anything to fight about, especially considering  I'm offering to do all that running around. He won't be home until 6:45 at the absolute earliest yet he's still demanding I get the keys to him by 5:30. This would mean me leaving work early to bring them, or footing that taxi bill. I ended up scoffing about how big of a deal he was making this and calling him unreasonable before hanging up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was thinking about it then, and rang him back offering to compromise and pay half of the taxi fare, he could pay whatever was left when the keys arrived. He said no and hung up. I'm in work now way more upset than I should be, and unable to concentrate on my work because I'm worrying about this simple problem being a huge argument.\n\n  ",

      "description": "OK so this happened a few months ago but I still have no idea what to think so I'll ask you guys.\n\nI was in my first lecture for this class and I sat near the front. I don't usually go to the front, but I did this time for some odd reason. Anyways, about 5 minutes into the lecture, I felt a foot on my chair. An annoyance, but whatever, I just tried to ignore it.\n\nThen it got further and further into my back. Her entire foot was basically shoved right up my arse. I couldn't believe it! I didn't want to interrupt the lecture by talking so I tapped it, thinking they'd get the hint. And tapped it some more. And some more. Until finally I just grabbed it and took it off my chair. \n\nThen this woman started getting very upset and and complaining to me. I didn't turn around to acknowledge her and just watched the lecture, and my lecturer just motioned for the conversation from her to stop for now.\n\nAfter the lecture finished, she berated me and shouted at me that I had attacked her, and that I 'almost broke' her foot. She was making it out like I'd mangled it, but I grabbed it fairly lightly, and just took it off my chair. But she was making a scene, kicking and screaming. The works. She kept saying to me 'I'm a 40 year old woman. You do these things to 40 year old women?'. I don't understand what she meant really, because I didn't even see who she was when I touched her foot. I politely said to her that she should know not to put her feet on other people's seats if she's 40 years old, and she should know better. This just seemed to make her worse, and then the lecturer stepped in and put a stop to it and just sent us on our way.\n\nPeople were giving me really dirty glances as I walked away, and some guy that I later befriended told me that he thought I was just being a dick to her because he didn't have any idea what was going on and just saw her screaming at me.\n\nI do fully admit that I probably should have turned around and asked her to remove her foot from my arse, but I was really frustrated with it, and I didn't think I needed to tell a grown adult how to be a normal functioning adult. I thought the taps would be enough of a hint for someone. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole here for removing her foot from my chair? ",

      "description": "A couple of years ago my family (mom, dad, and little brother) moved out of state, about a 15 hour drive away.  Usually I call them pretty regularly, anywhere from 1-3 times per week.  The past couple of weeks I've been pretty busy and haven't had time to call them.  My mother tried calling me once in the first week but I was about to head into a movie with friend.  My father and brother both called me the second week (same day) but I had a girl over at my place and didn't want to talk with them while she was there.  By the way, I texted my mom that I was heading into a movie when she called me and texted my dad that I would call later.  \n\nThe day after my dad and brother called me, I start getting texts from other friends and even my landlord asking if I'm ok.  Apparently my parents and brother started texting everyone I know, asking if they had seen me recently and if any of them knew if I was alright.  Here's the thing though, I know they did this because they were worried about me.  When I was much younger I went through a bad depression and tried to kill myself a couple of times.  That being said, that was close to a decade ago and I really haven't been depressed since then, with the exception of a minor day or two episode here or there (which have been so minor I never bothered telling my parents).  I haven't seriously contemplated suicide since my last attempt, not even in the slightest.  Also, no one in my life with the exception of my family knew about the depression/suicide attempts.\n\nBut since my family kind of blew up my spot, I've had to have some uncomfortable discussions with some of my friends who became concerned out of my family's concern.  I did not want to discuss my mental health with my friends, especially because it was so long ago. I flipped out on my mom (she was the ring leader in all of this) and told her that I dont want her contacting any of my friends again, for any reason.  I also told her if she pulled something like this again, I wouldn't speak/call the family for double the amount of time I was not in contact with them.  For example, I didn't speak with my family for a couple of weeks before they started calling all of my friends.  If they did it again, I purposefully wouldn't speak with them for 4 weeks.  My mom cried and my dad wants me to apologize, so I want to know, AITA?",

      "description": "I have been at my place of work for about 5 months now. I work full time for a clothing company in a large shopping mall. I don’t mind the work I do, I wouldn’t say it’s particularly enjoyable but it’s definitely not the worst job I’ve had. I don’t know how to define my position in the company, I am sort of a manager, but at the same time I don’t get payed manager pay (I get a dollar and a half above min wage) and I have less responsibilities than the other managers, however, I still work full time and am in the manager group chat. Anyway, we’ve had a particularly busy period at the moment with Black Friday and Christmas coming up. My shifts are usually from about 10am - 7pm, but recently I’ve been having to stay later due to the increase in customers. I don’t mind staying 15mins or half an hour later to get some tasks done (I usually stay till about 7:30pm anyway) but a couple of the other managers have been asking me to stay 2-3 hours more each shift, and they get annoyed when I say I need to go home. I worked from 10am-10pm two days ago and I worked for an extra hour yesterday. I’m 20 years old and am the youngest “manager” on the team and I don’t really see myself perusing this job much further. I don’t really have the motivation to work for 12hrs straight each day. I’m trying to learn to code in my free time and I also make music, which is probably the thing I look forward to most when at work, but lately I have not had much time to do either of these things. One manger in particular gets on my case about having a “bad work ethic” for not staying later. She sat me down the other day and told me I needed to be doing a minimum of 44hrs a week. When I started the job I was told I would be contracted for 32hrs a week but would most likely be doing 40hrs as it is a busy store. I don’t see why I should be working more than 40 hours a week though, when I don’t get overtime pay or commission?  This is my first full time job so maybe I’m the one in the wrong, but it doesn’t seem right to me.  ",

I felt like I could give them some good advice.\n\nWe set up a 9am coffee for today. Last night, they texted me that they didn't get off work until 1am, so could we move our 9am to an afternoon?\n\nI said, no worries, afternoons are harder for me, but I can make it work, just not today. Let me know some time that works for you in the next few weeks and we'll find a good time to grab a coffee.\n\nThey then waited a few hours to text me back to say, rather than go out for a coffee (mind you, we agreed on a coffee shop a block away from their office for convenience), could I bring my own coffee to their office to meet there? Their rationale was \"it's just easier to be close to my things at all times right now\". That's a direct quote. \n\n??? \n\nI find this extremely rude as I was trying to be nice/welcoming to them in their new position with the political organization. I get that they're busy learning their new role, but I feel like them asking me to bring coffee to sit at their office so they can work in between our conversation is tasteless in a job that's all about relationship building. How can we possibly talk if she is in her office answering the phones and putting out fires at the same time?\n\nAITA If I just cancel the meeting altogether?",

      "description": "Six months ago I (24) met this girl (22) in a club who I really liked, she had a boyfriend so we just became friends all the time and I was really into her (never tried anything because I hate cheating). After about a month she broke up with her boyfriend (not because of me) after 4 years and I asked her out. She told me we can be friends with benefits but nothing more. Surely enough I slowly fell into love with her and was really sad she was sleeping with other guys, but that was the deal since the beginning and I had to accept that. I was treating her like I would treat my girlfriend and she slowly fell into love as well. Still being with others.\n\nShe was changing her mind all the time within minutes - for example: Wanting to stay with me for a weekend (as she lived in a different town 3 hours away), making plans and the next hour deciding to go home and we should end things. It was really a nightmare. After a few months, we got together, she needed help with her bachelor thesis and other stuff at her university, so I promised I would help her. I was helping her, she got sick so I took care of her and was working on her thesis. As I was working on it and taking care of her I saw her on the phone all the time texting all the time, I didn't pay too much attention to it. Then she went out drinking and I was picking her up at the club, she was hammered, we got home, went to sleep, I woke up and was working on her project again, she was still sick so I was cooking for her, taking care, while she was still texting so I was like okay, strange. She said it's the friend who got her drunk last night and that I she told me how she really likes when someone shows her attention and likes her and stuff, which kinda got me sad because I was doing everything just not texting her as she was in a different room in my apartment. She said she will stop and she is sorry she was flirting with him the other night (which I did not know). I am not really a jealous type but given the past experience with her and me always having 6-8 years older girlfriends (wy different mindset) I did not like it so I told her I would like her to stop (she knew him only for a while). She told that she will try to stop, she did not, next week it happened all over again (flirting and idk what else) and there were multiple guys involved so I decided to end it with her because I could not trust her (we were just two weeks together, in a relationship). She was like okay but will you still help me with the thesis and we can be friends, right? I refused because I do not like when people take advantage of me and even though I am friends with all my exes it takes few months to be able to be friends with someone you had feelings for. She got mad that I promised to help her and now she does not know if she will be able to finish it on time.\n\nSo AITA for not keeping my promise which I gave her before?",

      "description": "My wife and I have been married for five years. During this time she has been the breadwinner and I am a housedad at home taking care of our one year old. We purchased a small home at the beginning of our marriage together that we both paid into the down payment for, and both of us own the home. Now that our child is growing older, my dad who is fairly wealthy wants to buy a 400k+ house in his name so we can live there rent free and raise our kid, while renting out the smaller home. He also said he would leave the home to me in his will, as I am his only son. \n\n When I told my partner “my dad wants to buy a place for us to live in”, she responded by asking whether if we would be the owners of the home or would he. I was a bit taken aback and said that my dad is purchasing it so of course it would be his name on the deed. She became very angry and said that if he wants to buy us a house, then why doesn’t he buy it for us instead of buying it then having us live in it and paying for the taxes. I responded by saying that we would be living there rent free and that it would be a very gracious gesture, and that it would be really bad for me to ask my father to buy it for us outright. \n\nShe was extremely upset for about two days and said that my father is doing this to exclude her from the family, and that if he was not, he should just add our names to the deed. I said that for a 400k purchase he would probably wants to own it until he passes away, to which she responded that no, he just wants to control the house so if she and I broke up then she wouldn’t get anything. This came out of the blue for me as we have not had major problems in the marriage and I am fairly sure that my dad would not do something with that intent. \n\nAs of this morning she has cried and told me that she is tired of “doing all the work” and being the income earner while my dad is “thinking up ways to get rid of her”. I was very upset but I didn’t know what to say except to deny it, which made her even more angry. She left the house slamming the door. \n\nMy wife comes from a very poor rural family in Kentucky and has built herself up to her current job as a nurse over many years. She doesn’t talk to her family because they mistreated her in her early years. I respect her immensely and recognize her lack of communication to her family may contribute to this, but I just can’t picture myself going to my dad and asking him to buy the house in our name. \n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to do so??

      "description": "Made this account just to post this.\n\nI met a girl through online dating.  I was very into her.  Unlike most other people, she was willing to have long verbose conversations with me with before we even broached the topic of dating.  We’ve been talking for over two weeks now, usually sending about two long messages each per day(usually about three paragraphs each).  So anyway, earlier today, I asked her out.  She said yes!\n\nSo then we started working out logistics for what we were going to do tomorrow, where we would go and whether I’d pick her up or she’d meet me there.  \n\nI gave her four options, and without going into detail let’s say the options were going to a park, rock climbing, ice skating, or going to a very unique, but expensive, museum.  The museum is right up my alley and we’d discussed this kind of thing during our conversations.  She’d expressed interest in seeing it so I was happy to take her.  She chose the museum.  But she also said “Oh, I’m also bringing a friend if that’s okay.”\n\nTickets are over $50 per person(not including refreshments, as there is a unique bar there that we’d definitely want to go to as well), which is, again, fine.  I offered, and I wouldn’t expect anyone to pay that amount on a first date, so I’d be willing to foot the bill.  But paying for a friend out of nowhere is pretty weird if you ask me.\n\nOn top of that, I would have been completely fine if she would have said, when I asked her out that she didn’t feel comfortable meeting me for the first time by herself but that she wanted to meet me and if it was okay to bring a friend along.\n\nThe way she said it, I no longer really had a choice in the matter.  I can’t really say “I’m actually not okay with you bringing a friend.”  That would be weird.  I also can’t say “Well, is your friend paying for their own ticket?” which is also weird.\n\n\nSo I took a different option, which was “I’m sorry, I don’t think this will work out.  I wanted to go on a date, and if you want to bring a friend then you don’t want what I’m looking for.  Best of luck finding what you want.”  She just responded “WTF” and neither of us has texted the other beyond that.  \n\nAITA?",

I was only interested in a few casual dates, so I realized pretty quickly that I needed to get more invested or break things off. \n\nThe date comes and goes- no spark.

I agreed with her that it was a good time, and texted her that I hoped to see her on Monday. \n\nMonday falls through, I can't make it to campus. I felt like a dickhead for leading her on, so I sent her a text last night. \n\nI figured it would be fine- we only went on one date, so it's nbd if it doesn't work out, right?\n\nShe replied that she wanted to talk earlier this morning. \n\nAm I the asshole for breaking up through text/not being clear sooner?

      "description": "Throwaway.\n\nI started working for this company a few years ago and in the beginning, all seemed nice. There's this one coworker we'll call Z. After a while, Z started having some jealousy issues, became more snarky and manipulative, and yelled at me over very mundane things. Even in situations where I had to ask Z a question about something I didn't understand, Z would answer in a tone that was very condescending and belittling as if it's something I should have known already. They're pretty much one of the people you'll read about on r/iamverysmart. \n\nMy other coworkers soon told me about their issues with Z and all the mental and emotional harassment they received from them, so it wasn't just me who felt this way. There were even many times that we reported to our supervisor (SV) our problems, and it would solve things but only for a short while and Z would go back to their old ways. This was pretty much a cycle every few months because SV would always give Z the benefit of doubt even though many coworkers complained to SV about the same thing.\n\nOne of my coworkers eventually quit, and they hoped that their quitting would alleviate some of the tension with Z since they got along the least among us. Things were peaceful for a while, but again Z eventually when back to their old ways once the high of that coworker quitting was over. The harassment got even worse now that there were less people in our department.\n\nI had suffered from depression when I was younger and beat it about two years ago, but I started noticing some of the symptoms again such as insomnia, loss of appetite, lack of motivation, and just constantly feeling like shit everytime I went to work. I started having some weird chest/heart pains. I had just thought that my heart murmur was coming back too but when explaining it to my friend, they told me that it was anxiety.\n\nAfter a huge mental breakdown, I decided that enough was enough and put in my 2 weeks. I was hoping that it'd be a peaceful 2 weeks, and that I would leave quietly like my coworker, but HR saw some red flags since it was only a few months since my coworker left. HR asked me to speak to them and tell them why I decided to quit. I hate being a snitch and throwing people under the bus, but I told them why I was leaving. They pleaded with me to stay, bargaining my time, pay, etc., but I was very adamant about leaving to take care of my health. HR told me that they wanted to talk to Z about what they've done, and I requested that they talk to Z after my final day to prevent anymore issues or retaliation. They denied my request and told me they were going to speak Z that day because they wanted to make the environment as comfortable as they possibly can to change my mind. Unfortunately, that completely backfired because work has never been more uncomfortable for me.\n\nMy other coworkers and supervisor were also called to speak to HR, and because the problem was never resolved and escalated to that extent, they had gotten written up. I never expected me quitting to snowball into this large of a problem, and I feel guilty that my coworkers had gotten written up because I never wanted to involve them in this.

      "description": "**TL;DR :Friend refuses to pay me back because he didn’t ask for my convenience.**\n\nNote: Everyone’s name has been changed for privacy reasons.\n\nOctober of last year, 3 friends of mine all wanted to see a movie premiere 4 hours from the time it begins. So last minute planning, everyone was certain that the theater was gonna be packed, and no time slots would be available. Being the person glued to my phone among my friends, I suggested to them that I have an app that can buy the tickets online, and just pay me back whenever. The agreement was unanimous, so I went ahead and bought everyone a ticket, total was $52.36 (online convenience fee sucks). I got the tickets and even managed to reserve the seats.\n\nFast forward to the movie, it was packed. Nearly all seats were taken, and if I didn’t reserve them ahead of time, we’d all be separated throughout the theater. Movie turned out okay imo, but it was a good night.\n\nAfter the movie, Mike suggested that we go to B-Dubs for dinner. I made a reminder to them of the equal split of the movie tickets to pay me back and even bothered to waive the convenience online fee, so everyone would have owed me $11.44, and that you have the option to cover me at the restaurant and I’ll drop the charge for that individual.\n\nWe’re at the restaurant and Ross decided to take my offer and pay me back, but he had the added benefit of covering me and only paying $8 for my dinner. So I’m my eyes Ross has payed his debt in full. This was commonly deemed fair among our group. Allen wanted me to add it to his tab, so I did. He payed me back the tab 3 days later. \n\nMike was the last that owed me the cost for the ticket. Two weeks went by and I decided to ask him when will he pay me back (I even showed him he receipt). He argued that he didn’t ask for me to cover him despite agreeing to go to the movie with all of us and agreeing that I reserve the ticket for him so that we will not get separated. I argued that he was going to spend money for the movie ticket regardless, I just added the convenience for him so we won’t get separated in the theater. Allen is siding with me on this and Ross has no opinion, but Mike is still not convinced. This argument lasted for only a  few minutes until we all got busy because of school. I pretended to forget about it for a few months.\n\nFast forward to today, I quietly dropped the charges of $11.44 as a “late Christmas present” because I didn’t want to deal with this anymore. But me being salty, I refused to do any future financial transactions with Mike. Other than that, we’re still cool as long as he’s not part of similar financial situations.\n\nWas I being an Asshole doing all this?\n\nEdit: The movie was Halloween (2018)\n\nEdit 2: I don’t round up or down what people owe me. $11.44 is $11.44, I’ll even take them in pennies.",

He's lazy, his room smells and he is always shouting and yelling at his games. He has college 2 days a week but he'll still go on that damn pc. I've told him to shut up and my mum is out of town for the weekend so she cant shut him up. Meaning I have to suffer. Its starting to impact my work and as I work in a warehouse, its dangerous to be tired in this environment. I've tried all sorts of things. I've listened to music to drown him out but he just goes louder, I've tried ear plugs but I can't hear my alarm. I've been late 3 times because of his antics and I'm worried if it happens again, I'll get sacked. Am I being selfish or is it right for me to want him to shut up? The least he could do is go on his pc after I go to bed but it's unlikely he'll do that as he never listens to me. I just want a decent night's sleep.

      "description": "I was given a gift card for a small/medium-sized company.  The gift giver forgot to tell me the amount of $ on it, so I called their main # provided on the card.  Their # is not toll free, so there was a very minimal charge that this call cost me.  I was connected with a guy who, from the get go, had a negative attitude.  When I gave a description of my card (brand/color etc.) along with the #, he swore the company makes no cards like that, speaking to me as though I am some type of extreme idiot, in the kind of tone you’d expect him to if someone called asking if his company sells condoms or porn.  I politely made it clear to him that this was a real card and asked him to plug in the code, which he refused to do, continuing to run his mouth disrespectfully.  Eventually, he **cursed** at me and hung up the call.  I contacted my friend to find out the amount on my card ($25), but not after sending a complaint email to the company.\n\nMy email was quite professional, polite and calm, but it summed up their employee’s horrendous behavior thoroughly; and told them I had had to pay a small amount of $ to call their line.  It was a minimal amount, but I had the expectation they’d refund me a lot more, maybe $15, $20, $25+, considering how terribly I was treated.  I assumed they’d read my professional email and feel extremely lucky to have me as a customer, as most other people would just send emails along the lines of “Fuck you!” and never give them another chance.  I expected that a decent company would view me as a real gem of a customer and do whatever it took to woo me completely back, get me in the best of spirits, and work hard to build bridges with me.\n\nThe next day, I get a short email back from the manager/supervisor, containing a very basic, bare bones apology, quite minimal for the level of rudeness I experienced; and a promise that my account would be credited $2, which he stated “should more than cover whatever phone expenses you were charged for.”  I feel **extremely** insulted and patronized by this.  They expect me to jump with joy and feel completely made whole over getting **$2**?  What type of cheap bastard and pauper do they think I am?  For their knowledge, I have a quite decent job and a highly impressive level of savings for somebody my age.  \n\nI emailed back telling them that $2 is nowhere near enough considering how vilely I was treated.  I make it clear I expect a minimum of $25 (equal to the amount I already have) credited to my card, or else I will give them a one star review on Yelp (considering they don’t have a ton of Yelp reviews, this would bring their score down) and post all about the incident on Facebook, discouraging people from purchasing from them.  I have yet to hear back from them, having just sent the email fairly recently, but hope very strongly that they take me seriously.  AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to rehome my little sisters aggressive dog?",
      "description": "I'm typing this on my phone, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes. TLDR at the bottom. \n\n     So about 5 years ago, I got a dog. She is a pit mix. Superrr well behaved, and super friendly to everyone and everything. At the time, I was living at my parents house. I ended up moving away for about a year. And in that time, my parents  let my little sister get a rottweiler. My dad was super against it. Because he knew my sister would end up just not taking care of it. But my mom let her get it anyways. And of course, that's exactly what ended up happening.  She pretty much moved out a year later. All her stuff if still here, but she only stays here like one or two nights a month, and it's been that way for years. She does absolutely nothing to take cars of this dog, and never really has. My parents do.\n\n      I moved back about a year later. And at first? The dogs were fine. We also had one more little dog, a martese. As well as two cats. As time went on, my sister dog became more and more aggressive towards the other animals in the house. I said from the very beginning that if her dog starts trying to hurt all the other animals? It needs to go. Because it's not fair to all the other animals. I went on a 2 week vacation, to come home and find out that my parents rehomed MY two cats, because apparently my sisters dog had gotten violent with them, and tried to kill both of them. I was fucking livid. But there was nothing I could do about it..\n\n     About a month later? My sisters dog starts straight attacking my dog at every chance she can get. To the point where they absolutely cannot have any contact whatsoever. My sisters dog is a lot bigger , and could easily kill mine. Especially because my dog doesn't fight back. She is not aggressive at alllll. She has never been the instigator. We have to have a huge gate in the middle of our house to seperate them. And it's just a huge pain in the ass. All it will take it one person leaving the gate open, or mindlessly letting one of the dogs in the back without checking to make sure the other one is inside, to start a fight. That's either going to end in my dog dead, or a huge vet bill I will be responsible for. And ever sense my sisters dog started attacking mine, it has caused her to be so scared of other dogs. When she used to love other dogs. I can tell it's really had an effect on my dog. Any time she starts to run around and play, my sisters dog goes into instant attack mode, growling and trying to break down the gate. So now my dog is scared of playing in her own damn house. \n\n      The last stray just happened. Last week, while I was staying the night at a friends house, apperently my sisters dog attacked and KILLED our other maltese. So obviously, I told my family, that this is fucking bullshit. My sisters dog is really sweet when it comes to humans, but not animals. Obviously she is a danger to my dog. And it's not fair that my dog has to live in terror. It's not fair that both of our cats had to be ripped from their home because of her. It's not fair that our other dog just got KILLED for no fucking reason. I reccomend rehoming her to sombody who doesn't have any animals. And my sister FLIPPED the fuck out on me. Saying it's my dog that should go. And its \"not fair\" that my dog would get to stay.  My parents don't really have much to say about it. They try to avoid confrontation. But now my sister is super mad at me. Am I the asshole? \n\n\nTLDR- I got a dog, &amp; moved out of my parents house. When I moved back a yr later my sister had got a dog. She doesn't take care of the dog. She doesn't even live at home anymore w/ the dog. The dog is VERY aggressive to my dog. To the point of them needing to be separated at all times. My parents got rid of my 2 cats because her dog tried to kill them, instead of getting rid of her dog. Then her dog killed our maltese. I said we should re home her dog to sombody who dosent have any other animals. And my sister flipped out on me. AITA?\n",

We've been dating for ever a year and I plan to visit him eventually but it makes him sad I'll have to go back home after. We do wanna live together eventually, especially because the free healthcare will help legit save my life.\n\nBut i don't want to just leave my life in the US full stop and head to the UK. I need to visit first and hes okay with it but it makes him sad when I joke about \"lol hate this place. Omw to the UK\" yknow. Stuff like that.\n\nHe just wants me to move in soon and I get it and if he lived in the US i honestly would. But its a completely different country and I need to visit so I know we'll be good irl and I can get a taste of how England is. Cause lets face it the US isnt great at telling us what other countries are like and I'll miss a ton of things I do like about the US. Mostly food items... Cause a lot of English candies and food taste gross to me. Don't @ me on that sorry I'm use to sugar filled garbage but its my garbage.\n\nI'm trying to be understanding but he keeps getting so sad its gonna take years and even though hes fine and gets WHY i need to visit first he still gets huffy.. I love him and want to spend my life with the goof but Idk how to make him chill.\n\nFor some background he also has aspergers and bipolar disorder so I'm sure a lot of this is his brain thinking i dont like him or the wait being 10x longer than it'll actually be. \n\nTLDR; English BF wants me to move in with him right away vs visiting and I just need to visit before I do that.",

For the past month, each time we went shopping for groceries and other necessity, we paid with my brother's card. Recently, he bought a video game and was now low on cash. \n\nNow on Friday, we were out of food and needed to do grocery shopping again. I wasn't feeling up to going out so my brother said he'd do the shopping on his own, but he'll need my card since he was running low on cash, to which I declined. I had planned to visit my gf in Birmingham during the weekend (I told him about this prior), I didn't want to risk the chance that I might not have enough cash for all stuff I might end up doing there. I then bring up the fact that if he hadn't gone and bought that video game he could have funded groceries. He didn't argue about it and just let it be, but I could tell he was upset about it.

      "description": "So I'm a senior in high school, currently in the stressful process of college applications. For one of my schools, I need a peer recommendation (a letter written by a friend/classmate/sibling/etc.), and because I'm shy and don't have any close friends at school, I wanted to ask my brother to write it for me. The thing is, I have two brothers, and I am definitely closer to one of them--I'll refer to him as B1. B1 and I have similar interests in science and similar personalities, so we get along pretty well. B2 is more of a social butterfly, and we are not as close.\n\nI decided to send B1 a message asking him to write the rec letter, and he agreed. The reason I chose him instead of B2 is because 1) we are closer as I mentioned and 2) I felt like he would be able to write a more genuine account of myself as a person, whereas B2 is a business major and I was scared he would kind of lie about who I am...idk. Obviously I didn't want B2 to find out that I asked B1 because I didn't want to hurt his feelings. But then my mom came along. My mom found out that I could ask a sibling to write the letter and immediately told B2 to write it, without even discussing with me beforehand. She came upstairs to tell me, and I told her quietly that I already asked B1. Mom says oh, she didn't know, which is fair. But then she goes back downstairs and TELLS B2 that I asked B1, which I didn't want to happen. And she STILL ASKS B2 to write his own letter, because she thinks B2 can write it better as a business major. (I could hear her say this from upstairs.) I'm just really upset because I feel like my mom is just taking matters into her own hands without considering how I feel. And this is MY college application, after all.\n\nI know I should be appreciative of B2 for even agreeing to write the letter, an especially so after finding out I already asked B1. But it just isn't what I had in mind. As of now both brothers are going to write a letter and I will choose which one to submit. Not that I will even be allowed to read them, so wth. Honestly I'm already set on B1's letter and I'm just letting B2 write his because I can't just say that I don't care for his efforts. I know it's mean and causing B2 to go through unnecessary trouble for writing a letter but B2 and I disagree on a lot of things and I just feel like he secretly hates me because he's the middle child and I took all the attention away from him as a baby. So yeah there's some deep issues buried in our family and I know B2 still feels angry about it. Which is another reason why I don't want him to write my letter, not that I think he would try to sabotage my application but that he wouldn't write it from his heart. AITA for favoring B1?",

Also, I’m on mobile so sorry if there’s any formatting issues.\n\nI (15M) am a part of an online friend group and have been for around two or three years, with a few of my buddies that live around me, and others that are scattered across the country. The online people had met with us over Xbox and it pretty much went on from there. G (14F) is a generally timid person, but has been made very uncomfortable by Q (19M) on numerous occasions. J (19M) lives near Q and they are very good friends.\n\nQ was always a sketchy guy. The fact that he talks to us at all is strange considering his age, but that is the least of his issues. Q was always especially affectionate and kind whenever G was around, and it was just creepy, but we had not realized it before when we were younger. When G was 12 years old and Q was 17, Q had even asked her if “she trusted him with her nudes” and had mentioned that he “trusted her with his”. G was very uncomfortable and had obviously answered no. She only informed me and one other of my buddies of this a few months ago, and we have been much colder with Q since then.\n\nQ has also talked to us a lot about his adult issues and even his sex life, and even if we told him to stop, he would simply talk about it another day. He is simply not welcome with us anymore. However, J is a different guy. He is far kinder, and cares about pretty much everyone in our group equally. It is still a little strange because he is an adult too, but he isn’t a predator, I hope. He is very, very depressed and struggles with it every day. We fear that if we were to kick Q out of all of our lives, it would hurt him. Q is pretty much his only real friend. \n\nWIBTA if I, and everyone else in that group, blocked Q from every aspect of our lives, possibly hurting J too?",

      "description": "Sorry for any bad formatting I'm on mobile. This is a long story so TL;DR at bottom. \n\nSo my ex and I were together for about two years before I got pregnant and shortly after I had our daughter things went downhill and we ended up breaking up. We didn't have a court custody agreement. We had agreed I would have our daughter on the week and he would have on the weekends. And for about 3 years of her life we did that. When our daughter turned about 3 1/2 we had changed our agreement so he would have her during the week and I had her on the weekends. Because I was moving and in between jobs we felt like it would be easier. This lasted about 6 months. During those six months I would call her throughout the week and try to see her to go to the park and stuff during the week day if I could. Once I moved and got my job we went back to our old set up with me having her full time. And for a few weeks that was great but after awhile my ex would stop calling to talk to her. My daughter who was four at the time would get upset so I told him he should try talking to her more and being a little more involved and he agreed. Fast forward a year she is now five and he hasn't called in more than 2 weeks and hasn't seen her for over a month. When I let him know his daughter is upset and he should be more involved he seemed irritated and said something to the effect of I don't ever ask him if he wants to call or see her so how would he know its okay. I was shocked by this as I have never once told him he couldn't call her or see her. I told him if he wanted to be involved he would make the time and I shouldn't remind him to be a dad. \n\nTL;DR my ex is angry that I don't tell him to call his daughter when I have her full time.\n\nAITA for not reaching out to my ex to tell him to call his daughter?",

We'd set a time that already had good buffing built In as bf was coming from work (about an hour away from where we live). \nWhen he hadn't messaged about 45 minutes before the movie start time I texted him to check what his timeline looked like expecting he'd gotten held up at work (which is completely understandable and would not have bothered me in the slightest) turns out he'd spent the last half an hour working out at the calisthenics rig near his work. \n\nHe can't seem to understand why I'd be upset/disappointed (I'm not shouting or anything just a bit annoyed and hurt that he didn't even think to say and I've been waiting and really excited). \nNow I kind of don't want to go see the movie because I don't want the fact that I'm in a bad mood to colour it shitty too. \n\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have different ideas of what making up and apologizing should look like.\n\nIf I'm upset, I want to talk things through, and come to an understanding or conclusion. He wants to stay silent, hug it out or make jokes until things are better. I usually reject his hugs if I've just explained something that he did or does that really hurts me. Usually I'm pretty upset, and he stays silent, and just goes in for a hug. This hurts his feelings.\n\nWhen it comes to apologizing, he often apologizes after a while if I'm upset over something and I won't let it go with a hug. I'll push and push for us to have a conversation, and he'll give me sad eyes and say he's sorry. But I want to talk things through, and for us to understand each other. Whenever we get to that point, a conversation after he's apologized, it comes out that he didn't think he did anything wrong, he thinks I'm overreacting and completely in the wrong, he's just apologizing because I am upset. Almost every time.\n\nTo me, if I don't think I'm in the wrong, I don't apologize. When I apologize I mean that I can now see how my actions were harmful, that I understand why he was upset, rightfully so, and that it's something that I need to work on to not do again.\n\nHe thinks this is a dumb criteria for an apology. He says a lot of the things that happen are just \"subjectively\" bad so if I get hurt it's just a subjectively hurt feeling based on who I am, but that what he does isn't objectively bad.\n\nI mean it varies who's in the wrong obviously, but when I don't think I'm in the wrong, I don't apologize. I'll talk things through and try not to do them again, try to see his perspective and talk until we're on the same page, but I don't just apologize and stay silent apart from the apology. I feel like that should be reserved for cases when you acknowledge wrongdoing.\n\ntl;dr: am I the asshole for not accepting my boyfriend's apologizing just because I'm upset, and not acknowledging wrongdoing on his part, thinking it's subjective?",

It was very expensive considering how much I make. I ordered the TV from Best Buy and it came in yesterday while my mom was home. She installed it into HER ROOM while I was at school. When I came back I noticed the box and thought she put it up in my room to surprise me. I walked into my room and there it was. My 30” TV from 4 years ago right where I left it.   I talked to my mom and she said it’s not my TV. She said it’s the family TV. Even though I bought it and it’s in her room she still said it’s for the family. I was PISSED and was almost in tears. When she was away I uninstalled it and put it in my room and locked it down with a lock so it would not move. Well while I was at work today she found my key to the lock and took the TV AGAIN. I was so fucking pissed I screamed and cussed at her with ALL my power. She was crying after all was done. \n\nI know that I overreacted in the end but it took several months to get that TV. She’s done things like this before with my car, but it was in my name so I threatened to bring her to court and she backed down.  \n\nAITA",

      "description": "Throwaway account because I just don't want this on my actual account. This happened maybe 30 minutes ago too. \n\nI was texting my boyfriend during our usual evening/goodnight conversations. He's into anime and follows a lot of cosplay accounts on instagram and sent me a post from one of those accounts. It wasn't provocative, just a guy with a wig and mask holding a cat. I said the cat was cute and mentioned that sometimes cosplay pages weird me out. This is essentially what the convo looked like:\n\nHim: \\*photo of cosplay guy holding a cat\\*\n\nMe: lol cosplay pages weird me out sometimes, that kitty is cute tho\n\nHim: Lol that's the point\n\nMe: to weird people out? lol cosplay itself doesn't weird me out, just slutty cosplays\n\nHe read the message but didn't respond after that, which he usually doesn't just leave me on read. I'm not really familiar with cosplay or anime in general apart from a few shows I watched in childhood, so I'm unfamiliar with the community (I have one schoolgirl-ish cosplay outfit that I bought totally on a whim) while he's very into it and goes to cons regularly. I also know that cosplay is a kink for him, so I'm really worried I offended him with my comment when that definitely wasn't my intention. \n\nI asked one of my friends about it, and he said that I was harsh, and \"I'm not into that stuff but even I felt a little bit attacked\"\n\nIt really wasn't my intention to hurt or offend my boyfriend about what he likes, I was just saying it was weird to me. To me it just seems like a way to show off asses and tits and not cosplay because they're barely wearing costumes anyway, but again I don't know the community so I may just be missing something. \n\nSo AITA for saying that slutty cosplay is weird while knowing my bf was into it?",

She takes us to a fancy place, pleads us to order food and drinks up to our satisfaction. When the bill was placed in front of her, she just glanced at it and placed it back in the folder. After 10 seconds, we realised she wasn't gonna pay and that's when we split it equally. It has been a well and I haven't talked or looked at her. Not that I'm broke or anything, but it's almost the end of the month and I could have easily had at least 8 meals in that amount.\n\nTL;DR Friend invites me to bday party, realised the bill is too high, we split the bill",

      "description": "Posting from mobile, sorry for any formatting errors.\n\nSo today after work i got home and decided to get my dog (Koda) some exercise. I usually just ride my bike around the neighborhood with her a couple times. She is very good about staying close to me, but occasionally she will see a dog, run over and say hi, then continue following me. So today i was riding my bike on the sidewalk with Koda following me and a man and his two dogs come around a blind corner. I wasn’t anywhere near hitting the man or his dogs, but Koda decided to stop and say hi to the dogs. When i went to call Koda back over, the man was visibly pissed. He started yelling to me saying “riding your bike on the sidewalk?? With your dog off leash??” Now Koda is the sweetest dog i know, and I’m not just saying that. I have never worried about having her off leash and have never had any problems with other dogs. The two other dogs began getting very aggressive towards Koda, while the guy continued yelling at me to “get a fucking clue”. I told him it wasn’t a big deal and if anything he should be worried about his dogs being aggressive towards my dog. After i grabbed Koda by the collar and waited for the man to walk away, he just stood there and stared at me. I told him it was okay for him to leave and he continued staring at me. I was getting pretty pissed with him so i just told him to fuck off. He began walking away but every 5 steps or so would turn around and yell something at me. I told him to fuck off and get a life. \n\nIs it common knowledge to not ride your bike on the sidewalk? Is it illegal to have my dog off leash?\n\nAITA here? ",

The club mission is to get people to expand their horizons and move past the popular stuff like BNHA.\n\nLast year there was little to no democracy; we would suggest, and they would choose something on their own. This year, i tried to make an effort for democracy, by putting their suggestions on a poll and allowing to vote from that pool of suggestions.\n\nThat's backfired. There's a lolicon denomination in our club who spends the entire duration being loud and playing Fate/Grand Order instead of actually watching the anime, yet they're the biggest group in the club that actively participates in voting, so they basically vote for what they've seen, and then don't even watch it. \n\nThis week they were campaigning hard for Gochiusa; knowing how they've behaved the past like, 4 months, they aren't going to watch it.\n\nSo i basically pulled a dictatorship move and declared we're watching Mob Psycho 100 II. Of course, they bitch about it. AITA for removing the democracy of the club since it's not aligning with the club's mission?\n",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to participate in the interactions of a \"Roast Comic\"?",
      "description": "We went to see a comedy show about a year ago and my friend insisted on being in the front row of a relatively small club.  The comic was trying to do crowd work and started asking people questions.  One was \"have you ever been with a black woman?\".  FYI There are not a lot of black people where we live, but I come from a city where there are (I'm white).  Anyway a bunch of us raised our hands (I did, but kind of reluctantly) and he started asking everyone more questions and eventually he got to me.  He asked me what I did and I gave him a vague response.  I work with a really large employer and can almost guarantee there were some employees in the audience so I was little paranoid about talking about it.  I guess he didn't pick up on the fact I didn't want to participate.  He proceeded to ask me \"what's the difference between black pussy and white pussy?\"  I was a little put off by this question and honestly it just felt like no matter what I said he was going to twist it into something weird.  He held the mic in front of my face and I say \"I don't know if I want to answer that question..\" \"Why not?\"  \"Well it seems kind of racist\". He freaked out \"what are you talking about?\"  I turned around to the audience and ask \"don't you think that's a racist question?\" and about 7 people said \"yes\".  A few said \"no\".  He started screaming at me \"what are you a fucking idiot?!\" I shook my head at him and said \"no\" and he continued to scream at me.  Not jokes, not saying anything funny, just screaming at me calling me an idiot and yelling \"racism comes from hate, that's not racism\"  which personally I disagree with.  The audience of course joined in all yelling at me, booing me etc.  I wasn't going to argue with him, he has the mic and he was trying to put on a show so I just kept quiet while he told his shitty joke.  Throughout the show he kept getting audience members to boo and yell at me.  I just tuned him out.  It got to the point where I was thinking about all my options.  Walk out, leave my friend there and let people boo and jeer at me as I left, jump on stage and do something or just sit there, ignore him and leave with my friend.  I chose the latter.  At one point he did reach out to try and shake my hand and I just said \"no way, you're a fucking asshole!\" and a lot of people heard.  More booing.  He finishes his set while continuing to get the audience to boo and yell at me.  As I'm leaving people are yelling out my name taunting me.  I didn't respond or react, I just walked back to my car with my friend.  I was pretty fucking depressed for about 4 days.  Never had an entire club of people booing me, calling me names etc.  I should say I've seen a lot of comics including insult comics.  Usually there's an element of humor or creativity to it.  This guy was just straight up insulting.  ",

I guess he was in trouble and was told to go outside. Anyways, I got really nervous and tried to make up excuses to stop filming. My friend didn't really see the problem and I had to (wo)man up and just talk in the video. The guy came closer to us, even sitting down next to us to watch us film. He was sitting right next to me, less than 50 cm away. I began to forget my lines and my friend complained, 'We're almost out of time!' and the guy asked what time it was, as if he was part of the conversation.

One time she noticed I looked a bit uncomfortable when they were all speaking Russian (I was sort of sitting there looking around, I didn’t understand anything, so I couldn’t add to the conversation). She turned to me and said “I think this would be a lot easier if you spoke Russian.” \n\nNow, I 100% understand why they speak Russian, it’s their culture. But telling me it’d be easier if I learned a new language? Easy for who??\n\nAnyways, after that she started getting more and more cold to me. She gives me dirty looks sometimes, it’s just clear she doesn’t like me. One time she even told my boyfriend to his face that she thinks I’m “fake” because she can tell I dislike her, but I’m still nice to her. I do this out of respect, I’m not going to be rude to her when she allows me to go over to her house. \n\nI’m at a loss, I wanted to be close with her, I’ve always been very close with my boyfriends parents, but I’ve just stopped trying. AITA for no longer putting in effort &amp; for totally resenting her?\n\nADDITIONAL INFO: I’m my boyfriends first girlfriend. At first my boyfriend thought she was being protective, but we’ve been together for about 13 months now. My boyfriend now thinks maybe she resents me because of arguments she’s overheard between us in the past, but we haven’t really had a rough spot for 6 months, and she made the Russian comment to me long before we ever even got into an argument. So I don’t think this is actually why she dislikes me. ",

      "description": "Asking about a friend. I know how I feel, but another friend is adamant to the contrary, so I'm bringing it here.\n\nMy friend's been in a relatively loveless marriage with this guy, let's call him B, for several years, &amp; they have 2 young children together.\n\nI met them both a few years ago, early into the marriage, &amp; have always been cordial with B. They've always seemed like a bad fit for one another. Conflicting personality types, different hobbies, even different tastes in food. But they're married, I always figured they had some deeper connection. Also, I didn't feel I knew her well enough to say anything.\n\nOver the years though, the conflicts between them have escalated, and a few months ago I felt so uncomfortable by a fight they had in front of me that I had to say something to her. I told her it often seemed like they were a bad match for each other, because of their many differences. I also felt he was being mean &amp; dismissive to her.\n\nAt that point, she told me a lot that I didn't know. For one thing, the meanness--which she describes as \"contempt\"--is apparently a personality trait that she's been trying to parse for years. He seems to genuinely want to understand why she is upset in a given situation, but despite his sincerest efforts, he can't seem to put himself in her position mentally. \"He lacks empathy,\" is what she told me. \"He doesn't mean to, and he doesn't think he does, but he can't understand other ppl's feelings.\" And then, she says, he gets mad.\n\nTBH I was a little dismissive of this cuz I thought that was kind of a cop-out way to avoid to the real issue of being poorly matched for one another. I asked if she'd ever brought it up to him, she said yes, but he got so offended &amp; angry that she never wanted to bring it up again.\n\nSo fast forward to yesterday. My friend told me that they'd been going to see a marriage counselor for a few months. She specifically found a marriage counselor who specializes in spectrum disorders, but not in a conspicuous way, so as to keep the information from B. After several long meetings, the counselor agreed with my friend that yes, B is on the spectrum, and yes, he appears to be unable to empathize w/ other ppl.\n\nMy friend feels relieved to have some answers, though of course the challenge now is B doesn't have a clue. I'm sure he'll think she's an asshole, but that's to be expected. I guess what I'm asking, IS my friend TA for getting him tested behind his back?",

      "description": "My friend and I like to play video games together and we'll play in a high-spirited way (read: loud) whether we're laughing at something that happened or cursing our luck. I won't play with him too late at night if people are going to sleep, and I won't even play games that require verbal communication (CS:GO, Overwatch, etc.). \n\nI started a new job recently and in addition to working basically all day every weekday (read: no free time), it has me waking up earlier which has adjusted my sleep schedule (woke up at 8:30 this morning). I texted my friend at 9:10, got a response at 9:35, and we started at 9:57. We chatted, laughed, cursed, and had a fun time for several hours.\n\nCut to later this afternoon. Girlfriend gets home and a bit later she comes up to me at my computer and says that I was being too loud at my computer this morning and I woke up her sister (18, goes to college). I was under the impression that my friend and I had started fairly late in the morning so I looked at text timestamps in my phone and looked at GF incredulously and said \"at TEN AM???\" According to GF that is too early to start making noise and \"Saturday is the only day that [sister] doesn't have class and she deserves to sleep in.\" I attempted to argue that ten is not an unreasonable hour but GF wasn't having it. I then mentioned the fact that I could hear [sister] having sex when I got home around 1 AM last night and if she needs sleep she should be going to bed earlier. That didn't work either and GF said that it's none of my business what she does and I'm being extremely inconsiderate. \"Conversation\" ended at that and we haven't really talked since except for her saying that dinner is ready and her responding to my question \"the dishes in the dishwasher are clean?\" (I empty the dishwasher since she always cooks) with \"yes, which you would know if you had looked inside the dishwasher.\"\n\nObviously all of this is from my perspective, but I don't believe I'm leaving anything of importance out.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: she had already checked out of the relationship by this point. I am now a single man.",

      "description": " \n\nA couple years ago I (21F) was dating a man (32 M) who had multiple marriages and multiple children. I’ll call him L. At the time we met, I was really lonely and seeking the kind of attention he gave me. I want to say it was around date 4 that he disclosed to me his history, so I was going into this relationship eyes open. I understand, I put myself in a horrible situation for a 21 year old female in college, so hold your judgement.\n\nAnyways, it all came crashing down when my parents met him. My father, who is pretty traditional, confronted him about his kids and previous marriages, which is fair. I can understand that he wanted to know more about the almost 12 year older man dating his daughter, but it wasn’t an inquisitive line of questioning. It was hostile. L was calm and cool while defending his position while my father tried to physically escalate. I stepped in between them and told L to get in the car, because we were leaving. It was a 12 hour drive back to my state from my parents place. During this drive my parents unleashed something I had never seen before.\n\nMy father told me to not come home, because I was no longer his daughter. My mother warned me that I was about to be cut out of their health insurance plan. They even called the police to search my home for drugs (I only smoked weed occasionally at the time), because they would rather have me in jail than with this man. I wasn’t going to be able to afford the next semester on my own, and my anxiety felt unbearable, so I ended up dropping that semester to gather myself and figure out what my next step would be as a fully independent adult.\n\nEventually I was allowed back into the family and my parents offered to continue to pay my college tuition, but no other internal resolutions were ever reached. L and I broke up a couple months later due to a job opportunity for him, and I was single again.\n\nNow when I go back to see my family, my father and mother will bring up the L situation and comment on my poor behavior and decisions. I respond by pointing out how heinous and ugly their actions were. They become defensive about their actions, and say their bad behavior is outweighed by everything else they have given me.\n\nI understand I am INCREDIBLY lucky that I got a debt free college education, but I can’t just forget about what they did. Am I the asshole to continually respond to their comments with my true feelings?\n\nTL; DR- My parents disowned me because of some stupid shit I did earlier in life. When I try to point it out, they say their behavior doesn’t matter because they paid for me college tuition.",

      "title": "AITA for inviting my brother-in-law's ex to my wedding, meaning he refuses to come?",
      "description": "Some context:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy soon-to-be-wife's brother, Bill, and his ex-partner, Terri, had twin daughters at 19, followed by a messy break-up. They were living with my fiancee's parents at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBill left with the woman he was cheating on Terri with, and more-or-less only sees the family at Christmas. He doesn't attend his daughters' birthdays, nor has he paid child support for the last 10 years, to the best of my knowledge (it is almost never discussed). He sees them maybe three times a year, and they dote on him completely, I guess because of the rarity of it. Suffice it to say, I have a low opinion of Bill. He can be charming and charismatic, but he is also the only person I have ever physically fought off (due to attempting to hit my partner, his sister).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTerri, meanwhile, stayed with my partner's parents--her in-laws. Her own family effectively cut ties with her. My wife's family have been incredibly supportive, and Terri now has a part time job while Nan and Granddad watch the girls during the week and work at weekends. Hardly ideal, but it's worked relatively peacefully except when Bill rears his head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my dilemma. We have invited them both to the wedding next year. Bill cannot stand Terri. Conversely, she is willing to be civil to him, but he has responded to our wedding invitation by saying that if she goes, he doesn't. Despite everything he has done, my partner still loves him and wants him to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said to my wife that we've sent the invitations now, so if he doesn't come, it's his fault. I am not rescinding Terri's invitation, full stop. I was 100% confidant I had made the right call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, my wife's parents spoke to us and rather angrily stated that we HAVE to uninvite Terri. Bill is blood family, and therefore has more of a right to come. I made the counterpoint that he DOES have the right to come--it's his choice whether he makes that call or not. They said that by inviting Terri, we are effectively banning him from the wedding. I disagreed--he has an invite, so in what universe is that a ban? He needs to fucking grow up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was 100% certain of my decision but now I'm at 95%. My wife's parents are lovely people, have helped us out greatly and I have immense respect for them. In my opinion they usually make wise decisions and this anger seems a little out-of-character. They have always had a soft spot for Bill despite the damage he has caused, so I'm attributing it to that. But I have also asked around with family, friends and colleagues. Where I thought I was totally justified, a surprising number of people are coming back to me saying that blood always takes priority. Even my partner wants us the rescind Terri's invitation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

Right now she parks her old car underneath broad daylight but she doesn't want to do this for the new one. \nThere is a shed in the front yard that is a good size for the car however it hasn't been used in decades (old house) and there's now vines and bushes all around it making it inaccessible.\nSo she wants me to help her do the landscaping over several weekends as well as paint and tidy up the shed to use as a garage for her new car. I've refused to help on this DIY project because: \na) money is already tight around and she has to take out loans for something that has no practical value so I disagree with her buying the car in the first place. Ultimately it's her money and I have no say\nb) I'm in my final year of high school and I'm really focusing on my grades to get into a good university (which she agrees). if I have to help her with this it would make me even more angry at her during those weekends and when I'm emotionally stressed it is impossible for me to do anything productive in the time I have left.\nc) if this were an actual chore (eg. Mowing the lawn, clearing out the gutter...) I would have no complaints however this is something purely for her personal gains and I don't feel it's fair for me to sacrifice my chance of getting into a good university for something so pointlessly materialistic.\nI've had a discussion with her that turned into a fight where she called my lazy, selfish and entitled. I guess that i still do live under her roof and she still provides for me and I have an obligation to help out...So AITA?",

      "description": "This post is actually more of an AWTA(Are We The Assholes). \n\nI'm an 18 year old male and my girlfriend is 19. We are both in college at the moment, and we often hang out at her flat. She lives with a roommate (F19, we'll call her Suzie). We've been together for around 3 months, and since this is a first real relationship for the both of us, we're very vanilla sexually.\n\nWe've decided to take it slow and we've not had sex yet, but we got as close as you can get (in baseball terms, third base). \n\nNow, the problem is that we'd often get as close as you can get while Suzie was home. Now obviously, we'd be in a different room and we'd lock the door. We'd also actively try to be as quiet as possible. \n\nThis lasted for about a month and a half and we were both certain that everything was alright.\n\nBut yesterday, the horror happened. I was at my girlfriend's place in the morning and we got as close as you can get. About an hour after I left to go to college, I got a lot of dramatic fb messages from my GF.\n\nApparently, we weren't that quiet actually, and Suzie was able to hear us. And not just yesterday but many times before. Ftom what I undetstand, it's been going on for a month and a half. And she even told her mom about the situation.\n\n Obviously it's an unpleasant situation for everyone involved and me and my GF look like absolute assholes and we are both feeling ashamed and I feel very sorry for Suzie. \n\nOn the other hand, if she'd told my GF something about it the first time it happened instead of not saying anything for *over a month*, we'd have just stopped doing it with her around. \n\nNow the situation is a bit sticky and we try to avoid Suzie until the dust settles. \n",

      "description": "TLDR - A friend who has a history of not paying back borrowed money, asks for money to pay for her tuition fee.\n\n\nSo, we've been friends for 6 years -- since high school. She has a bit of a troubled family life. She's juggled between living with her dad &amp; stepmom (who has a short fuse when it comes to her), and with an aunt who should be paying for her school fees.\n\nShe approached me a few days ago and asked for some money to pay for her tuition fee. She told me that her aunt's been having extra expenses because of her dental supplies (she's taking Dentistry), and her sister who's representing her school in another country and has to fly there, so she can't afford a portion of her tuition. I said no. Well, I didn't directly say no; I told her that she should talk to her aunt for the extra, which is relatively small (around ~$250), and that her aunt shouldn't abandon her responsibility of paying for her school fees.\n\nI mean, what I said's true, right? Her situation would've been completely understandable, if only I believed it.\n\nI've been friends with this person for 6 years. She has a debt to me that's about $200 because she wanted to buy some damn shoes for her (now ex) girlfriend. I only revealed this when the said ex-girlfriend asked me about it after their break up. I also know of a time that she's spent a portion of the money given to her for her tuition fee to buy something for the same ex-girlfriend (I think it was a vape lmao). So yeah, I'm skeptical. She's irresponsible with money, and has lied to me a few times for some cash.\n\nAt the same time I feel bad -- cripplingly bad, even, because this is her education, right? And she approached me with a \"You're the only person I trust &amp; know who would understand me\" line. And maybe I am the only person who'd understand, and I turned her down when she needed me.\n\nIn the end my skepticism won over me. I only asked one other friend and she told me I did the right thing, but when I start to really thinking about, I also start feeling bad. So, AITA? Should I just suck it up and lend her the money?",

      "description": "Disclaimer:English is not my first language.\n\nTwo years ago(September 2017) I(15M) started going to a different class in the same school, for reasons irrelevant to this story, which meant that I would see my previous classmates a lot less, including my then best friend P. When I switched classes other students were added there, including a girl L. A few months P got a crush on L, who at the time I hadn't met. L friendzoned him, but he stopped\n\nIn May, through a series of coincidents, me and L became friends. Around the same time my friendship with P started fading, because we had different hobbies. P was(and still is) crushing L and didn't like that we hung out. We decided to just not tell him, because he wasn't in a relationship with L and it wasn't his business. At first I thought nothing of that.\n\nFastforward to January, P started texting me random questions that eventually lead to L. He asked me if I had a crush on her and etc etc. I answered no, which is how i feel. P didn't stop asking questions about her and I answered, thinking he would eventually stop, but I was wrong.\n\nNot only were there more questions, but they became weird. E.g do i want to sleep with L,what position, have I ever felt a desire to touch her, what does she smell like etc. I started avoiding answering because I felt uncomfortable. From that he started thinking that I had a crush on L, which I don't. The questions culminated in asking if I would help him take advantage of her, following which I blocked him, because I didn't know how to react and get a bit of peace from the questions. We talked that one out and forgpt about it.\n\nAfter that he still asked the questions and I still avoided answering. Since he thought I had crush on L, he texted her that I supposedly don't want to talk to her(not true), which she believed and stopped texting me. I was upset, but after three or four days I told L that he lied and confronted P, who said it wouldn't happen again.\n\nIt did. In the following weeks he became increasingly jealous and started telling me that I had to stop talking to L because he said so and when I didn't he told her how I supposedly crushed somebody else for some reason. That really angered me, not because I like L, but because he had the audacity to spread lies about me. I confronted him about it and told him that I was angry at him,didn't trust him and wasn't going to answer his questions. He told me he was  sorry and thar he doesn't want to lose our close friendship.\n\nAnd then he did it again. I don't know exactly, but he texted me that he thought that his plan to make L to stop talking to me was working, because I told him that I hadn't talked to L in a week. After that I decided to completely cut him off.\n\nNow i'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, I don't want to be friends with someone who manipulates and lies for a girl, who has repetadly turned him down. But on the other, I'm just cutting off someone, who considers me one of his best friends",

      "description": "ok so i am a 45 yrs old male, she is 37 females. i came home from job. wife came home from a appointment with the doc. says twins. this was news to me.  we had not considered the possibilly of twins. my wife was a bit nervous i can tell but excited by the surprise anyways. i start to feel like a raccoon in a room filled with rocking chairs, not sure if abortion is an option where i am. so i start doing research, we live in Alabama and my wife is a bit over 6 weeks pregnant. in Alabama abortion is legal until about 21 weeks. ok good, so, we have plenty of time to think. im a intellectual minded kind of person, talking things over helps me personally, even if she made up her mind on keeping the twins. its ok. i just want to talk about our options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nme: ok i want you to abort one of the twins as i am concerned about our fiscal wellbeing of having twins, how long you are going to be pregnant, the safety of the twins once born, our time spent into taking care of both twins, lots of potential fighting between twins, unwanted attention from strangers, double time spent if both twins get sick, never alone time with one child. it would seem logical to abort 1 of the twins. it is either that or we need to prepare for the outcome of twins. (these are all my points, backed up with strong arguments when i spoke to her).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nher: agrees with financial point says we can talk about that, but rest of my reasons are stupid. says i am an idiot. (???)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nme: i explain points again. if 1 twin sick, the other will 100% as they spend all their time together. first time parents, having 2 right away increases chances 1 gets hurt, twin proofing the house, and i go on with more back up arguments. it is all genuine concerns. we have a bit more back and forth, she is trying to shove my concerns, but all i want is a civil discussion, not to be verbally shoved and called stupid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nher: she starts crying. says im the biggest idiot on the planet. she says she knew something wasnt right. stuff like that. she starts shoving things in her purse and gets out of the house. goes to her mothers. all every dramatic and i am flabbergasted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwe had a very long discussion before pregnancy, but now that she is pregnant with unexpected twins i am not allowed to put anything in the tip jar? i reckon shell be back when she is hopefully is willin to talk. i am fretting over options going. we have lived our hole lifes in Alabama so we dont have any residence outside of here so if we need to leave the state for an abortion past 21 weeks, may not be allowed... i am fine with no abortion (honestly i prefer it, dont want her going through struggle of abortion) but this discussion must happen. i am all about open dialogue and sharing smart ideas. even if she has her mind set on having twins. am i the ahole in the context that i should not speak about abortion to a women who is pregnant? i want to chat while we still have our options on the stump...not fair for her to call me stupid for fretting over surprise twins.",

      "description": "Hi guys, I would like your genuine and honest opinion please. I can't ask my friends or family because I know they'll side with me. \n\nToday was going to be my first day seeing a therapist. I am originally from an Asian country where mental health isn't taken very seriously. When I was living with my parents, I told them about my problems and they told me to \"just get over it\" since I've recognized my issues. I have anger issues and waves of depression. Now that I'm living on my own, I would like to speak with someone asap.\n\nI found her contact through /r/asksf, but she apparently \"forgot\" our appointment and her reasoning is that she didn't write our appointment down in her diary. Now to be fair, she did call me, leave a voicemail and sent a text message apologizing (in that order) and I know I'm petty as fuck. But i've decided to find someone else. I did not respond to her messages. \n\nI felt she was unprofessional and I felt really angry this morning (i'm feeling okay now). I wanted to leave a bad review on Yelp and Google Reviews but I've decided it's not worth holding onto the anger and my boss told me people genuinely make mistakes.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "I am an African American and my significant other is a white man. I will call him SO. He has a friend we’ll call Varg (also white). SO has known Varg for many years but they aren’t like talking every day or even every week kind of friends. \nIn a public setting, when I was present and SO was not, Varg made it clear that he supports nazi black metal bands and said that anyone who disagreed was a stupid snowflake. \n\nSO and I live together. I told him I did not want Varg anywhere near me or our home under any circumstances. My home is a Nazi free zone. SO became upset saying that Varg was a good guy and this was just an ignorant lapse of judgment on Varg’s part and I should talk to him. I said Varg already made it very clear what he thought of me and I am not interested in wasting time trying rehabilitate racist asshats. I don’t get paid for it and Varg has no uniquely redeeming qualities to make me want to try. \n\nSO insists that he has never seen this side of Varg before and says that he will talk to him. I say that I don’t care. SO argues that Varg is really a good person and that if we don’t take the time to educate him, Varg will turn into just another Nazi. I say that Varg is just another Nazi and him being an old friend doesn’t absolve him of that. I end the conversation and go about business as usual. \n\nThe next day SO says he has talked to Varg and Varg is supposedly sorry and allegedly didn’t understand how supporting literal nazis negatively affected black people. I said ok, but that I still didn’t want him anywhere near me or my home. SO gets upset and I tell him that Varg pretending to suddenly give a shit about black people after another white man told him to is not what I consider progress.Varg just doesn’t want to lose all his non-racist friends and his reputation as a good guy. \n\nMy SO said that I can’t complain about racism if I’m not willing to do anything to fix it. I got super mad at him for saying that. I said I’m not Varg’s mother and I’m not responsible for his choices or for making him into a good person. \n\nWe had a huge fight. I felt angry and betrayed that someone I trust so much would try to make me responsible for the failings of a racist idiot. After talking about it carefully and calmly over the next few days we basically made up. SO conceded that Varg’s idiocy is not my personal responsibility but he still thinks I have some kind of moral obligation to give Varg a second chance because he apologized. \n\nI understand that people are capable of changing but I sincerely do not see signs of that in this particular case. I’m just a girl not fucking Osiris or St. Peter whoever. I don’t want to judge people’s hearts and souls but I also really don’t want racists in my life. I feel really strongly about this but I want to be the kind of person that my dog thinks I am. Am I the asshole for not giving Varg a second chance or is SO the asshole for trying to get me to educate the racism out of his friend? ",

I mean I can \\_clearly\\_ hear the dialogue of whatever show she is watching. Theme songs, \"in a criminal justice system, sexually based offenses...\", the new anti-depressant commercial. All of it.\n\nI know that she is deaf and probably needs the TV that loud. And I would hate to offend her or make her feel like she cannot be herself in her own home, but I need to sleep.

Against our better judgement we decide to stay late into the night and drink a bit since we dont get out much.\n\nA drunk man who we've never met approaches us and leers at my wife, right in front of us. Just casually checking her out and I could see she was uncomfortable. I ask the guy if he has a problem and he laughs at me, saying theres no problem here.\n\nMy wife pulls me away from the situation but it does not stop there. He starts pointing at my wife and me across the plaza, making gestures with his hand. At this point I am livid but my wife tells me to ignore it.\n\nLater me and her separate as she has to go to the bathroom. As shes coming back this scumfuck grabs her arm and sort of twirls her, like in a dance. I rush over, fuming. He says he wanted to show me how a real man dances with a woman.\n\nEnraged, I slap his drink on the ground and tell him that I would cut his hand off if he touches my wife again. I dont actually make physical contact with him as this creates a spectacle . The music stops and my neighbors are between me and him. I was very angry. He says sorry repeatedly but i think he didnt really mean it.\n\nHis friends apologize to me as well. Well now its been several weeks and i have a letter from the complex chastising me for my behavior that night. Apparently either the drunk or someone else complained that i was threatening people. My wife is shocked as well and says we should dispute the accusations. \n\nAITA For making the scene?",

      "description": "I work at a gift shop where we sell little trinkets made in China, and we have a penny smasher. It's the bane of my existence. People are constantly turning the lever and making the *clink clink clink* noise all day, every day. Well, I was closing up the store last night when a family came in. I said \"Hey guys, welcome in. Just so you know, we're going to be closing in about ten minutes, but take your time\" (as you're supposed to say when you work in customer service). There were three adults and about five children all under 10 years old. At 8pm I locked the doors, turned off the music, and brought in our sign that we have outside. At this point I hoped they would've gotten the point and left, but they continued to let their children run rampant through my store that I had just cleaned and organized for the next day (which I had to do over again when they left). \n\nThey pay for their little trinkets and the children all look at the penny smasher and begged to do it. At this point its 10 minutes past closing, so I look at the father and say \"I'm sorry but the store is closed now\". He says \"Can they just smash a few pennies real quick? It's their favorite\". I say very nicely \"I'm really sorry but it's well past closing and I have somewhere I need to be\", which wasn't entirely true, I was just tired from working all day and I wanted to go home. The children all looked very upset, and one started crying, but the father lead them all out and I said \"Thank you for stopping in, have a good night\". The father ignores me and tries to comfort his crying child. \n\nSo AITA? ",

      "description": "Backstory: we have two kids, just into their double digits years, and my ex and I have a 50/50 custody schedule since the separation. 1 week with me, 1 with him.\n\nHis friends are partiers/drinkers. Always have been, but he didn't go out with them much when we were together because they lived out of town. \n\nSince our separation, his two closest friends have moved back to our town again. So my ex is back to partying and drinking with them again.\n\nToday my ex asked that I have the kids this Friday because another friend is coming into town and the guys are all going out drinking. My response was that I'd like to keep our weekend's with the kids consistent. So, I didn't tell him no, but honestly I think he shouldn't ask me to have the kids so he can go out drinking with his buddies. It's his week with the kids, after all. Anyway, his response made it clear that he's mad that I didn't agree. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "Edited because I realized this mostly is about friend A and not the others. Originally wrote about 3 friends total, so if the formatting seems weird, that's why.\n\nI have 4 friends from HS that I've more or less kept constant contact with for the past decade. There were periods of times we saw less of each other, but I'd say we'd meet up at least 5 times a  year regardless of whether we were living in different cities or not. As of 2 years ago we all live in the same city within 15 minutes of each other.\n\nEvery other week o  so, I'd text the group asking if they'd want to meet up. If they were available, we'd either hit the local bar and hang out a bit or if we had time, go out to some other place and hang out. So now we're seeing each other maybe 12-24 times a year, with myself or one other friend initiating for the most part.\n\nNow I have my own \"issues\", using that term lightly because no one in perfect, with this friend. \n\n* Friend A is childish. Doesn't offer to drive, activities are limited because she doesn't want to stay out late or something. A few times I told her that I'd be willing to pick her up and take her to a destination, but she'd have to arrange her own ride back if she wanted to go home early and she just assumed I'd leave early to drop her off. Sometimes expects me to order for her at restaurants, leaves the logistics to getting and going to places to me, etc. \n\nRecently I went on a trip with Friend and it ended on a bit of a bad note. Nothing too dramatic, but mostly her lack of initiative and her need to have someone do and plan everything for her was very off-putting for me. I tried to draw up an itinerary before we left so she would have ideas about what to do and where to go, but on days we weren't doing everything together she just stayed at the hotel. If it had been all her money and her planning that led to that decision, I wouldn't be bothered about it, but I feel like I put in a lot of effort and planning to make this trip enjoyable for the both of us and it was wasted because she wouldn't step out of her comfort zone. \n\nI think the major thing is that it made me aware of how much effort I put into planning and seeing my friend as opposed to how much effort they're willing to put in. It's pretty rare they'll invite me to anything that required planning beyond \"show up at x time\", and even that's rare. Whereas I put in time to plan rides, parking, possible dinner/lunch places, and then they just show up. \n\nOriginally, my plan was to take some time to cool off and then explain to friend A why I was stressed during the trip (I never told her I was mad at her or upset, but she could tell there was something off about me by the end of it). But as time goes on, I find myself not really missing Friend A at all. I'm not mad or upset at her, but I question whether our relationship added something to my life. I do feel like it's a bit of an asshole move to just drop communication after 9 years, but at the same time she has not made any attempt to contact me either - which was a trend in our relationship up til now. \n\nNot sure what to do, tbh. On one hand, normally I'd say letting a friendship die out without a word is an asshole move. On the other, if she cared either way she would've texted me at some point, even if it was just to say happy holidays or some mundane shit. If she expects me to initiate every conversation or hang out going on forward, I don't know if this is a friendship I want to continue with? It feels too much like dragging someone along unwillingly and it makes me uncomfortable.",

      "description": "I just turned fifteen a few days ago, and my friends decided to take me out to an all you can eat buffet. I had a bit of a freak out as I was nearing my daily intake and hadn’t exercised or anything. Not wanting to spoil their fun, I go with them. They pay for my entry and I feel like shit already because I know I’m not going to eat much. I grab a plate and stock up on salad and seafood. My friends ask why I’m not ‘going for it’ and I just tell them that I’m not super hungry as I already had quite a bit to eat before we left as I had no idea they were taking me out. Friend A gives me a weird look but shrugs it off. The day goes fine, minus them getting annoyed at how ‘I’m not eating enough considering they paid for me and themselves to get in’. I felt awful.\n   Two days later friend A, B and I are sitting at the lunch table during school. They aren’t the type to skip meals, so when friend A literally pulls an apple from her bag and discards everything else of her meal, I’m a bit suspicious. She says she’s not hungry and that she had food at break (which is a lie because we sat together at break and none of us had food). I start chiding her on how it’s unhealthy to skip meals and she should eat properly. Friend A fires back and mentions how I never eat a proper meal and that I’m too skinny (I went from 125lbs to 110 within the past month, but note I didn’t start losing weight at 125lbs). I’ve never explicitly told her I was anorexic but I think she figured it out. She starts saying how she feels guilty for being so fat and that she feels bad about eating in front of me because I’m so skinny.\n  I try to explain that me being skinny isn’t healthy, she’s pretty and she needs to eat but she gets more upset at me and says how it’s unfair that I get upset when they don’t eat but brush it off whenever she or friend B points out that I don’t eat. Friend A admits to not wanting to eat around me because she’s afraid to look fat etc. \n  No matter how many times I try to tell her that the way I am isn’t healthy, she won’t listen and continues to kind of blame me for not wanting to eat? So am I the asshole for chiding her when she doesn’t eat properly?",

I did everything I could and then they told me they thought they were trans and wanted to transition. I once again asked how I could support them. However, I told them that I was unattracted the parts that they wanted to transition into. I told them that I would still love them and support them unfortunately i was not attracted to those parts and would prefer to support them as a friend rather than a SO. They got upset and started telling everyone I was transphobic. I really did not mean to be, however, despite the person it doesn’t change what parts I am attracted to. So am I in the wrong for this?

They are his dogs, he purchased them before we moved in. I do a fair amount with them because I love them, including feeding, playing, and training. \n\nMy bf has severe depression, and the last month or so it has been really bad. To help out, I've been doing 95% of the day-to-day chores like dishes and cooking etc. He currently takes out the trash now and then, and sometimes puts a few dishes in the dishwasher. He does nothing with the dogs but pet them when they are near and feed them sometimes. But I have reached my mental limit with doing everything. \n\nThe dogs need more exercise, especially the husky. They obviously want more play time than I can give them without further mental exhaustion on my part. I have tried hints and suggestions to not appear demanding, as he has told me he often feels overwhelmed and like everyone expects too much from him. But they fall on deaf ears. He thinks just being home and around them a lot counts. \n\nI want to tell him, not gently, that he is neglecting his pets, the pets he says he loves so much, and needs to do more for them?\n\nTL;DR Will I be an asshole if I tell him, sternly, he needs to take the dogs for walks and play with them in the backyard because they are his?",

My mother is a neurosurgeon and my dad does studies for the FDA (in the USA). i still do not rely on my parents for money, as i have my own job. she locked me out of the only bedroom last night and because of that i slept on the floor of a house that my family owns. she does too have a job, however still relies on her parents to pay rent and her marijuana addiction takes most of her personal money. i feel like a complete and utter asshole for asking her to pay 50% of the gas and charges that come with spring breaking in vegas. i know that my grandparents are much more well off than hers, but i feel like at the same time i am taking more out of my own pocket than she is spending- regardless of me giving her a free place for spring break (i paid for gas$ and food and alcohol). AITA? serious opinion since i am well off and personally am employed with a server job. i just feel like a dick, since she is less well off than i am, but at the same time this whole trip is being paid for with my personal money which i worked for. i know i am much more well of than most of the USA but i still feel like my money (vs. my parents) should be valued equally to hers.

      "description": "So I’ve been friends with this guy for about 3 years. It was somewhat of an off and on again friendship since I was too busy with other things. We always had interesting and meaningful conversations. But recently we started to talk everyday and became more fond of each other. I went over to his place a couple times just to hang out and shoot the shit with him. After a while I became “thirsty” and we exchanged risqué texts and photos. We talked about getting together to “Netflix and chill” and I was down. \n\nI came over to his place and I was nervous. We sat on the couch and watched Netflix for a little bit. I let him touch me and give me kisses. We were supposed to have sex but I lied and told him I had started my period just the day before. We made out a little bit but I felt nothing. I could even say that I felt uncomfortable. At that moment I realized that all of those sexual things that I said through text was a result of me being thirsty, and I no longer felt that way. I made up an excuse to leave and he begged me to stay. I got dressed and promised I’d come back another day so that he wouldn’t keep trying to get me to stay. \n\nI kind of distanced myself after that day and was texting him less than usual. Now the conversations end with him being angry at me for not giving him enough attention and me just being uncomfortable about the whole situation. I didn’t want to continue leading him on so I sent him a message saying that I didn’t want him to stop talking to me, but that I realized that I was being thirsty, and that I wish we could go back to having a strictly platonic relationship.\n\nHe read the message and never replied. It was obvious that I had upset him. But we had a wonderful friendship before all of this and it makes me feel like all he cared about was having sex with me. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for being close with my girlfriend's sister even though she hates it?",
      "description": "I (19m) and my girlfriend (21m) have been together for a year and we met through uni. She has a sister who is 19. For the sake of the story, let's call my girlfriend Katie and her sister Danni. \n\nKatie is really close to her parents, so I met them three weeks after our first date. They're really cool people and we hit it off super well, and them liking me so much sort of accelerated my relationship with Katie, and within a couple of months I was spending every weekend at her parents' house with her (she lives at uni but goes home for weekends) and I was living with my parents in the week. I also got along really well with her sister, and at the time Katie had no problem with it, she actually encouraged us. \n\nSo, when we spent the weekend at Katie's parents' house, if we went out for the day or just hung out in the house, Danni tended to be there too, and we all liked the arrangement. The problem started about four months in. We all planned to go out shopping for the day, but Katie left a couple of uni essays to the last minute and decided she was going to stay home, but she told me and Danni to go out anyway. We did, and as usual posted stuff on Snapchat and Instagram, and by this point she was more of one of my best friends than my girlfriend's sister. On that day, we posted a picture together at lunch, and Katie sent a message saying 'you look like a couple'. I thought she was joking so I just sent some laughing emojis and asked how the work was going, but she just sent a message asking me to delete the picture, so I did. I didn't think anything of it really. When we got home, she was a little bit moody but she didn't say anything, and she was fine within a couple of hours.\n\nThis started happening more often. Katie is in her last year of uni, and I'm in my first, so she has a lot more work than me to do. The occasions where we'd all plan to do something and she'd drop out last minute became more frequent, and about 3/4 times she would tell me and Danni to go out anyway, and we would, thinking nothing of it. The other 1/4 of the time we'd cancel the plans and just hang out in the house, but Katie didn't really like working with us around. \n\nAbout seven months into our relationship, I was getting short on money so I took up some shifts where Danni works and Katie used to work, at their parent's restaurant. Again, when I got the job, Katie said she was fine with it because she wanted to pick up some shifts again soon. She didn't. One night, I came home from work and she was pissed off, because her dad made a comment along the lines of 'Danni and Connor seem to get on really well, you must be happy your sister finally likes one of your boyfriends'. Katie blew up about it, and I kind of understood why it'd make her nervous, seeing her boyfriend building a close relationship with another girl, even though she knows it's platonic and neither of us would hurt her. I told her the truth, that I understand why she feels insecure about it but that she doesn't need to worry, and I'll quit the job and find another place to work as soon as I can if it'd make her feel better. She said no because that would look suspicious to her family. I got that too. She apologised for being angry about our friendship and said her dad was right, it's nice that we get along and she just worried because she's never had that before. All was forgiven and things went back to normal for a while, but Katie started coming out pretty much every time we went out. I was super happy with this.\n\nAnyway, it all came to blows in the middle of December. For the first time in a while, Katie dropped out of going out. We couldn't cancel, because we left Christmas shopping to the last minute. Danni and I went out and I was a little nervous, but Katie seemed fine all morning so I assumed it'd be different. We went back to normal, snapchatting and everything. I messaged her in the middle of the day to ask her about an eyeshadow palette that Danni mentioned a few weeks ago so I could get it for her for Christmas, and Katie send me a huge rant paragraph saying 'make up isn't something you buy for a friend, you should only buy it for your girlfriend... I can't believe you listen to everything she says but you haven't got me anything (I had, just wanted it to be a surprise)... maybe a good gift would be leaving her alone and giving her sister some attention... if you want to please her so much why don't you just fuck her', and so on. I didn't answer her for an hour or so because I was pretty mortified. And, thinking if I was wrong I could return it, I'd already bought the make up. \n\nWhen we got home, she was fine, until Danni went to her room and she freaked the hell out again. I asked her why she was so upset about me and Danni being friends, and she's basically convinced we are cheating, when I can assure you we are not. She apologised again, but comments along the lines of 'I bet you'd rather be with Danni' have popped up frequently since. There was one time we had sex, and after she said 'bet you wish I was Danni'. She laughed like it was a joke but I don't think that's something you say as a joke. She made a similar comment after the NYE kiss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to know if I'm the asshole for being close with her sister, and not wanting to end my friendship just because she's paranoid about it.

      "description": "My husband has brain lessons since he was born, which causes him to have grand mal seizures. I continuously complain about his work as a chef because you never know the hours needed to work. \n\nWell this particular issue started a few weeks back. My husband finally left his old job and got a new that pays him a decent amount. I kept asking him to call the head chef and get the hours before we make anything final. He called him and guess what, he didnt know the hours. I immediately knew this was gonna be a shit show.\n\nFound out he only works 4 days a week, weekends and tuesday and Wednesday. This was great as I'm 18 weeks pregnant and didnt want to take the bus all week, since we only had my car to drive. \n\nHis first day was suppose to be last friday but his boss called him in last minute and told him to come I'm Saturday. So he had time to rest all day friday. He went into work 8am sat, got off at 9. I was extremely pissed, seeing how he can't work over 8 hours since his seizures. His triggers are lack of sleep and lack of food. \n\nHe went I'm sunday at 4, a decent time, and he got enough sleep before hand. But didnt get home until 3 am. The next day was a day off, and we talked after I got off work at 5:30.  I informed him these hours are insane for someone work your condition. I don't think this is the job for you. I honestly don't mind him quitting and looking for a job with better hours, since I make enough on my own to support a family of 3. But he refuses to not work for even a day. \n\nYesterday he goes to work at 10am comes home at 1am. Has a seizure at 3. This was the worst one I have seen. It was so bad that I ended up sleeping on the floor for the remainder of the night to keep an eye on him, but far way enough that he can remain asleep. He was so weak after the first one, that I had to carry him to the restroom. My doctor told me its harmful for.the paper to do any heavy lifting. So at this point 2 lives are in danger instead of one. \n\nBefore he feel asleep after the second one, I told him that I cannot allow you to go into work before 12pm. He made it adamant that he was going in at 10am tomorrow. At this point it was around 5am. He was gonna sneak and go to work at 10 like he did at his old job. So I was like fuck it. I got up at 7:30am. And I hid the spare key to the apartment. I made sure his bank account was empty so he couldn't take a lyft or a bus. And I took my car to work with me. \n\nI know he just started working there, but this is one of the days he needs to call in. Just for a couple more hours of sleep. I know he will not, since he has done this in the past. I am waiting on him to wake up now. But I'm scared about the call. I don't think I can take this anymore. Its getting to the point that if he goes in, I'm filing for separation. \n\nAITA for giving for making him choose between his job or his family. I'm I the asshole for possibly getting him fired today",

      "description": "Ok so this happened a few months ago and we have since broken up (for various reasons; butted heads too much) but this still bothers me and I want to know if I’m in the wrong. So her birthday was coming up and I asked her how she wanted to spend the day; it fell on a weekend so we were both off and I’d be able to enjoy the whole day with her. She said she wanted to go to a high end strip mall about two hours away to go shopping, then meet up with some friends at a bar in the evening. She was always into designer clothes and handbags etc. I never understood the hype around that  (and I don’t have the money to be able to shop like that) but I said I was fine with it, it’s her birthday and we should do what she wants. Well a few weeks prior to that she had also hinted that she really wanted a strawberry cheesecake for her birthday. I mean really really hinted, not subtle at all. It seemed really important to her so I thought it would be nice if I made it from scratch for her rather than buying it. I’d never made a cheesecake before so I was a little nervous I would screw it up but I started doing research to prepare for it, learned how to do all the cool stuff like make the wavy details on the top with puréed strawberries and stuff. Online I read that cheesecake tastes the best when it’s prepared within 24 hours of being eaten so I figured I would stay at my place the night before and start it around 9am so I’d be ready to go leave for the strip mall at noon; I got home late the night before and didn’t have time to make it before bed. Well, I completely underestimated the time it would take me to make a cheesecake and ended up WAY behind schedule; it didn’t help that my electric mixer died halfway through and I had to run over to a neighbor’s and borrow theirs. The cake was supposed to be a surprise, but after constant texts of why I’m so late and what I’m doing I decided to tell her. I thought it would make her slightly more understanding (knowing that I was trying to make her happy instead of goofing off with friends or oversleeping) but it just got her more angry with me. She claimed that the strip mall was what she really wanted to do for her birthday and the cake meant nothing to her, I should’ve just bought one instead of delaying everything. I realized I was in the fault by not planning better, and she really hates when I’m late to things, but her reaction surprised me and hurt a bit. I ended up getting to her house around 3pm with the cake. She said we didn’t have any time to go shopping anymore and wouldn’t let me take her somewhere a little closer by. Eventually she calmed down a bit and was happy with the cake (especially when she tasted it, go me) and we were able to have a nice night out with her friends. We went to the strip mall the next weekend and got there super early so she could stay all day. I thought it was over and done with at this point and that she’d forgiven me but she would continuously bring up how I ruined her birthday when we had fights down the line. Was I in the wrong here?

      "description": "(Quick rundown) The last two months I have been friends with this girl, (We became friends, then we started dating, then she broke up with me because she liked a different dude) I cared about her a lot, I would always let her vent her problems onto me, But we broke up two weeks ago, during the breakup she was complaining about the boy she liked, saying he doesn't love me and other stuff like that, (3 fricken hours after we broke up) I was complaining to one of my friends about this for the entire time, we stopped talking for a couple of days then she came back and said how much she missed me and wanted me back, \"i'm giving you a second chance\" Her own words. So I hit her with that hard nope. 5 hours later, she says this, hey I got a boyfriend, And this is where it all went downhill.\n\nI would always listen to her problems but my friends were getting really worried about me at this point (She basically transferred her depression onto me) so one of them went to her and told her to stop talking to me. Of course, she got mad. But she continued to talk to me, but she would talk about what her and her boyfriend did that day, (Giving me obvious sadness due to me pouring a lot into this girl) So one night, she came to me to talk about her problems, and I wanted a break for this one night. I told her I wasn't in the mood for caring then went on a rant about none of her friends caring about her and then she blocked me, she treated me like I didn't exist and when I contacted her she said she hated me, I got mad and started insulting her, I was fed up at this point, She said she was fed up with my bullshit so I blocked her.\n\n(Most of my friends considered what was happening with me emotional abuse, I could go into more detail in the future, but now I don't want to get into it, short version is: She would almost daily bring up cutting herself and even once said she would kill herself, This has caused me to have many breakdowns, mainly because I couldn't do anything to help her as she lived an hour away from me and she refused any help except from me and her best friend, she broke up with me because of another dude, that left me crying because I didn't feel worthy enough. I literally broke down crying when one of my friends was comforting me, that friend cared about me more than my girlfriend ever did, but please give me honest feedback, if this post gets enough traction I may go into the entire story)",

      "description": "TLDR at bottom.\n\n\nSome background. I had moved in with some family out of state and was told everything was set. (Internet, food, power, jobs.) \n\n Surprise when I get there none of that was there. No one had a job. There was about 6 people living in a tiny trailer, 4 guys, 2 girls. Not including the people who would just drop by. For 850 a month (minus expenses). Only Me, my cousin, and my uncle were able to find work after a week or two.\nThen the main new guy \"moved in\" Maybe a month later. \n\n\n  At first me and my cousin shared a room but after a while of everyone hanging out in there I was told to \"move my bed to the kitchen so I can have some space.\" I didn't think much of it and did as I was told.\n\n \n I made a little blanket fort in the back of the kitchen so I could block out some light and get some sleep before work. I had gotten my first real job and wanted to do my best there.\n\n\n\nNow this new guy there was a worst influence then the family I moved in with.  He did some hard drugs and got my cousin back into smoking meth. Needless to say I wasn't the biggest fan of his. But he did help bring in some money  here and there, and was good friends with my cousin.  so I kept my mouth shut.\n\n\nHere's where the AITA comes in. \n\n\nAfter a month or so I got sick of this man. He was over all the time. Didn't pay rent and ate our very limited food. He would always reply with, \"once we (him and his mom, who also smoked meth) get our welfare we'll help out!\"  Even though he had a job painting doors.\n (Learned after I moved out he did get welfare and when he did he never came over again) \n\n\nAfter a night of drinking I had to sleep through for my job the next day, this man's phone alarm goes off, and no one gets up but me.  Normally I'm a nice guy, I would have woken him up but I was tired from there BS all night, had work later, and didn't really give a fuck about him at this point.\n\n\n\nAbout an hour of this 10 second loop of a metal song I Don't know plays before he finally gets up. Checking his phone he yelled, \"shit!\"  Before calling his boss.\n\n\n\nan hour late? yep, This man was fired.  \n\n\n\nI moved out a week or so later when my uncle told me that if I go back home to see my sick and dying grandpa to just move back in with my parents. So I did. \n\n Gandpap lived another 6 years :)\n\n\nTL:DR a junky who lived with us and got my cousin addicted to meth over selpt his alarm. I woke up and didn't wake him. I Pretended to be asleep so he would miss work and get fired. ",

      "description": "English isn't my first language, I apologize for any mistakes.\n\nSo I'm still in high school, yeah we're just teens. I don't like drama and I don't like bringing drama upon myself. I had a friend, let's name her Faith. She told me through chat that another friend of mine, let's call him Giant, liked her. Typical crush stuff. I found it hilarious since it was very unpredictable and I didn't expect that Faith was the sort of girl Giant would fall for. Giant's immature and childish, while Faith's the exact opposite. I wasn't aware that it was supposed to be a secret, I wasn't even aware that no one knew about this.\n\nI texted Giant saying \"Faith pala, ah 🤔\" which translates to \"So it's Faith, huh 🤔\" in English. He replied to \"Pano mo nasabi?\" which translates to \"How'd you know\" or \"How'd you say that\". Before I replied, Faith messaged me saying why I told Giant. Turns out Giant asked Faith if she told me anything about it. I was 100% honest the whole time, and said that I only asked to know if it was true (which is my actual intention)\n\nFaith got mad at me. SO MAD. I apologized twice through message and she left it on seen. I tried to talk to her the next day at school, she ignored me and continued to do her own thing. I felt like shit and I felt guilty for so many weeks. There were so many times that I said hi and tried to talk to her so I can apologize, but she just walks away.\n\nFaith and I had a couple of friends, sort of like a group. We were 5. They don't know about what happened, but she cut the ties between me and that group. I wasn't invited to the stuff they did, they didn't hang out with me, and she  made them ignore me too. I felt so bad because I offended her, and I probably deserve this shit. The thing is, if other people did that to her, I bet she wouldn't react like how she did to me.\n\nAm I the asshole for doing this?",

      "description": "So I’ve been talking to this girl for a few months now (since october). We hang out usually once or twice a week. But since before Christmas, we haven’t had time to hang out. She was out of town with family, and so I was. \n\nSince the start of the new year, we’ve only hung out once. After that one time, I’ve tried to make plans to hang out with her on multiple occasions, but due to her busy schedule, and my more lax one, she couldn’t really. \n\nWe finally agreed to hang out one night, a few days in advanced. She tells me she started to feel sick, but hoped it would pass. They day comes for us to hang out, and she cancels because she’s sick. That’s okay. I understand. Being sick sucks. \n\nShe postponed it to a Sunday afternoon/evening. I agree and the day comes. She cancels again, citing a ridiculous amount of work to do in preparation for the school week. (She’s a teacher. Again, I’m disappointed but I understand. Teachers don’t have an easy job.) \n\nWe postpone yet again to tonight when we’re both free. I texted her when I got off of work to see if were still hanging out, and she responds again saying that she has to cancel because she had a really rough day and is in an awful mood and headspace. I tell her that it’s okay, and we can rain check. She says she feels really bad that she had to cancel our plans. I just tell her that it’s just a series of unfortunate events and we’ll just raincheck again. \n\nI already have a bad history of this happening to me through past relationships and friendships, so I’m getting some ptsd from it. I want to be able to clearly talk about why this upsets me so much to her, but I wouldn’t even know how or where to start. ",

It was getting annoying for me since she keeps on complaining about how toxic he is but simply doesn’t do anything \n\nSo one day after this guy was getting pretty mad on a ps4 party chat I told him to please shut up. When I said that he told me to stop being a hypocrite because I was also complaining about him complaining. So when he started that I told him that he’s an asshole and that he’s the most hypocritical guy I’ve known. Going off ranting about how his relationship is so toxic and how he should stop abusing her. Now right after I said this we go back and forth about how I’m the toxic one instead of him\n\nHe talks about how I have a court case about a few accusations about me and brings up a girl I use to date and I had a toxic relationship too, all of these where old news as I’ve move past it and made myself a better person, I’m just wondering if I was in the wrong for me to call him out on his relationship ",

And I've never had a problem with him watching porn and masturbating while I'm not there, I mean  I do it when I'm alone so no problems there. We have each others pascodes on everything and I never feel the need to look at his socials. He occasionally goes through my Instagram when he is bored. I don't have anything to hide and I thought he didn't either so it's fine. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago while we were laying in bed talking and being on our phones, I noticed on snap that he had this girl posing and taking a video of her tattoo on her leg. You could see that she was naked and almost saw her vagina. I ask him about her and apparently she is a friend that I never heard of. According to him they had never hung out either. My boyfriend then ask me if I want her removed. I told him \"I'm not telling you to do anything, do what you feel is right\". I don't want him do stuff against his will. He then proceeds to look at the rest of the Snapchat stories(other people) and almost all of them were of naked girls or some sneak peak to get you to buy something.\n\nWe start talking about it and he says that in the last 2 or 3 months he started adding all these people who post sexy videos and slutty photos on Snapchat and Instagram. And that he likes to watch them in secret while we lie next to each other in bed. He likes the feeling of looking and trying to not get caught. He told me he was feeling a bit guilty when I found out but he just likes doing it.\n\nI haven't told him I'm uncomfortable with it because I feel like if I told him I don't like it I'm being controlling. Would I be the asshole if I told him to stop or that I don't feel comfortable with it?",

      "description": "A group of us (all girls) went out for dinner.  I sat next to a cool girl I've known for about six months who's pretty playful but with sarcastic side to her. I do enjoy her company after getting to know her better.\n\nI am a pescatarian and I ordered the prawn dish. It was huge and I invited everyone to have a piece.  She declined and continued on with her chicken plate.  She never offered me any of her plate, which I thought was weird since I offered her my plate.\n\nThis girl is tiny and I noticed she had two untouched plantains she hadn't eaten along with some rice and bits of chicken that she had partitioned into sections on her plate.  It really looked like she was done with her meal.  I announce to the table, \"Okay, I can't stand this anymore,\" and I reached over and I stabbed her plantain with my fork and shoved it into my mouth.   The entire table was silent and watching me chew and I felt so awkward right after I did it.  She looked at me with daggers in her eyes and put her fork and knife down and said, \"You know, I really hate when people eat off my plate.\"  \n\nI tried to make a joke out of it and lighten the mood by making kissy noises, but she wouldn't have any of it.  She looked disgusted with one eyebrow raised shaking her head, and made more snide comments, like she was really irritated with what I did.  While I never apologized to her, I didn't think my action warranted her strong reaction, especially since I was open to sharing my food with her.\n\nWhen it was time to leave the restaurant, she boxed up her uneaten food and the one remaining plantain in a doggy bag.  Weird.  Why wouldn't she lighten up since she wasn't eating it anyway?\n\nLater on that same evening, we all went out to get ice cream and everyone was discussing what flavors they were going to get.  She already ordered and was eating, so I was going to ask her what flavors she got, but before I could say anything, she moved away from me and said, \"Don't touch my ice cream.\"  \n\nI don't understand how a playful girl could turn so hostile toward me.  Was I an asshole in this situation?",

She guilt trips me into it a lot of the time by saying “I miss you” and she gets mad at me when I want to get off the phone and actually fucking get something done. It’s very annoying.

      "description": "I get a bit claustrophobic on flights and always book a window seat when I travel. I usually only need to take short domestic flights for work and the window shade has never been an issue. A few months ago, I was on a long haul from Europe to the US. I had a window seat in business class. Seats were in a 1-2-1 arrangement so I had the window on one side of my chair and an aisle on the other.\n\nThe flight left around 2pm local time. They served the meal fairly quickly after take off.  I still had my tray in front of me and was gazing over it out the window when the flight attendant reached over me with a tray to shut the window shade. I asked what she was doing and she said the guy across the aisle wanted to sleep. I told her I booked the window seat for a reason and wanted it open. \n\nThe guy all the way across the aisle has a sleep mask and it was the middle of the afternoon. I also had a cross-stitch with me to work on during the 12 hour flight and needed better light than just the overhead lamp. The FA made some snippy remark about us needing to compromise and \"allowed\" me to put it partially back up.\n\nAITA for keeping the shade up? The guy never talked to me before getting the flight attendant. She never talked to me before slamming it shut. The other passenger could block light with his sleep mask, pillow, and blanket since we had lie flat seats in little compartments and I paid $5K for the window seat. Why should I be forced to \"compromise\" and sit in the dark during the middle of the day? I wouldn't have thought twice about it because I've always believed the person in the window seat controls the shade but when I got up a while later to get a bottle of water, I noticed my shade was the ONLY one open on the entire plane. I started to feel like ITA but I don't sleep on planes and need to be able to look outside so I don't feel so trapped in a metal can. Before I take a similar flight, what is the protocol for this?",

      "description": "So I started this new job a month ago after it was a scramble to find a new job, as the job I was doing before Christmas told me they wouldn’t need me after the 6 week break. \n\n(INFO: I worked at a high school as a Teachers Assistant and the school holidays are 6 weeks long during the Christmas/New Year period.)\n\nAnyways I scrambled to try find a job and was luckily enough to find one as a News Reporter for a small local paper and owned and ran by 1 person. She basically hired me the day I submitted my resume. \n\nI had to wait 4 weeks before I could commenced the new role and during the time I put a feeler out to see if the primary school were looking for Teacher Assistants. As I really want to be a Teacher and I was currently in the midst of studying that would make me eligible to start a teaching degree. However I’ve had to stop my studies because the new job is so unpredictable, I never know when I’ll be called to do something and then I’m expected to drop everything I’m doing.\n\nThe News Reporter role has turned out to be a too good to be true sort of job. It’s a work from home while the boss works from another state. The boss glossed over a lot of details and really made it sound like the perfect job. (I even had to push a weeks long doctors appointment which I had been on a waitlist for, back because my boss was coming to town to ‘train’ me but proceeded to not give me one ounce of training) Besides the boss being a pain to deal with I just really don’t feel like the job is a good fit for me. If I had known and been told it was going to be like this, I would’ve passed it. If I had known my boss would be like this, I would’ve made a hard pass. \n\nLuckily the primary school have finally got back to me since school has started and they would like me to work for them. I really want to take the job, as it will help me towards my goals towards becoming a teacher, but I feel shit if I leave my current job. Like I’ve wasted not only my time but the boss’s. I guess I know I will burn a bridge regardless how I handle the situation. \n\nBut I want to know if I’d be the asshole if a quit a job I started a month ago because of a better opportunity? ",

      "description": "Don't know if this really belongs here, but I feel like an asshole and I need some outside opinions. Strap in, this is a long story.\n\nThree years ago, I met a woman online named Amanda. We quickly became close friends, she introduced me to her other friends, and I ended up falling in love with her. She had a boyfriend though, so I never told her and tried to suppress and forget my feelings.\n\nLast December, she said that even though she was in a relationship, she still fell in love with others and wanted to talk to her boyfriend about polyamory. Eventually I plucked up my courage and asked if she loved me. She said she did, so I confessed that I've loved her for awhile.\n\nFor the next few months, we flirted like lovers whenever we could. Our schedules changed so we could spend every waking moment with each other. \n\nWhen I asked if she wanted to marry me, she said she did. That she would, if there weren't so many barriers for us.\n\nOne of those barriers being that I live in Illinois, she lives in Texas. We had been planning for me to come meet her for awhile, but with this new relationship we had, I accelerated our plans.\n\nMarch 3rd, I got on a plane and went to stay with her for a week, to meet her and all our other friends. Before I left, we agreed to set aside our flirting, since she never asked her boyfriend about entering an open relationship.\n\nThe week went amazingly. The greatest week of my life. I was to leave early on the 9th, Saturday morning. On Friday, her and I were alone in her room. We were waiting for our friends to show up so we could go to the mall. \n\nI started talking about how I've had an amazing time, thank you for letting me stay and being so incredible. She did what she always does when I compliment her, which is deny it and say she's just a normal person, nothing special.\n\nI didn't really think things through. I just thought \"show her how amazing she is\" and the next thing I knew, I kissed her on the cheek. The shy smile on her face dropped as she got up and left the room. \n\nShe texted me a few minutes later saying she felt violated and disrespected. That I broke her trust. We went through with our plans when our friends arrived, but she barely even looked at me for the rest of the day.\n\nWhen we all got back late that night, her and her boyfriend talked alone on the porch for over an hour. She came in briefly and told me that they were probably breaking up and I needed to get a Lyft to the airport.\n\nIt turns out, she told him everything we had done. That she cheated on him.\n\nWhen I finally got home, I was told by a mutual friend that Amanda never wanted to speak to me again, and that they agreed with her. I've now been blocked on almost all social media by many of my former friends.\n\nMy family and what's left of my friends are trying to convince me that she is the asshole for leading me on and throwing me out. I think they have a heavy bias here, so I want an outside opinion.\n\nSo, hey Reddit. Am I the asshole here?",

SR was kind of known for being creepy back then too, despite me telling him I'm asexual multiple times he would always make sexual jokes near me,, and would increase the amount when my other ace friend asked him to stop because he didn't like her. Also he made jokes about how bc me and that girl were ace that \"I'm sure having a pussy in your face would turn you on\" and shit like that. He never made these jokes around my friend to my knowledge so I don't think she knows the extent of how uncomfortable he made us. \n\nNow I share two classes with him,  and I can't even get out of them because they're mandatory gym and health classes, one of the teachers even pairs us together because he thinks we're friends. He also won't leave me alone, when I ask him to leave or try to join a different group from him he starts cursing me out, and won't stop until I agree with him (he's like a crazy boyfriend but we're both gay) recently he has made lots of references to pedophillia and rape, he was talking about how his friend said when he was in 5th grade he had sex with an 19 year old, and when I said like \"hey that's not okay its literally statutory rape\" he was saying things like it's okay because he consented and things like that\n\nAnyways my friend talks to him, SR a guy I've been telling her makes me really uncomfortable, and has been borderline harassing me and some of my friends for months now and has recently been making sexual jokes and stories referencing child molestation, that I was being mean to her and that called her boyfriend a pedophile.\n\nHe went fucking nuts on me\n\nHe was in my face calling me a stupid Bitch, and saying those weird sympathizer things like \"is a 17 and 18 pedophillia\" or \"it's not pedophillia bc that's only prepubescent kids\" I literally had to leave bc he gave me one of the worst panic attacks I've had in weeks, I couldn't even breathe properly.\n\nWhen I got home I messaged her not to talk to me because I don't know why she would talk behind my back to SR of all people, someone I told her I really hated. \n\nI feel really bad about it now, I want to say I'm not even mad at her for dating the guy, that I'm just mad she talked to SR about it, but I can't even imagine talking to her after this.   \n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for telling my ex to get bent after she requests an apology?",
      "description": "Dated this girl for about 6 months nearly 10 years ago. We were both undergrads at the time. She was diagnosed bipolar with a history of substance abuse and risky behavior, and I was not the most stable college kid either. I didn't find out about the diagnosis until after we started dating.\n\nGiven this, I'd say the relationship went about as expected. We got together and had a blast doing all of the dumb, impulsive things that undergrads do.\n\nShe ended up cheating on me on a trip out of town one weekend. I tried to forgive her, but the relationship deteriorated quickly from there. We split up a month or so later, and she immediately slept with a few of her old friends and made sure to tell me about it. She'd then get fucked up at a party and call me to come pick her up and take her back to my place.\n\nSo, being the smart, mature dude that I was back then, I willingly participated in this shitshow for a few months. She would occasionally talk about getting back together (which I did want back then), but then would flip and shame me for staying in her life and stop talking to me for a while, only to repeatedly initiate contact. This went on for a few months after the breakup.\n\nEventually I graduated, got a job, and moved out of town. She continued to contact me with the whole I miss you and also I hope you die thing. She would occasionally tell me that I was a shitty person to her and that I should apologize. So I did apologize several times for my admittedly shitty behavior during and after our relationship. I tried to sever communication, and really went through a period of reflection and self-improvement, to ensure that the shitty actions of my youth didn't carry over into my adult life and hurt anyone else.\n\nSo I end up meeting someone, and the relationship gets pretty serious. When this news reaches my ex, she goes ballistic. Once the threat of her doing something to herself settled down, she again starts emailing me with the same stuff. I realize that I should have blocked her, but after several threats and serious attempts, I was afraid she would try something. After several years of this, I get engaged. A few nights before the wedding, she contacts me again asking me to admit to her that I hurt her. I ask her to kindly fuck off, telling her that I'm getting married and that she needs to come to terms with the fact that we'll never be together.\n\nThat was over 3 years ago. The other day, I get an email (on a new email address that I know she got from one of my \"friends\") from her asking how I'm doing and asking me if I ever realized that I was a shitty person to her, because she needed to know that I realized it.\n\nSo Am I still The Asshole? Should I continue to feel bad about something that happened almost a decade ago in University, despite repeatedly apologizing, trying to learn, grow, and be a better person because of this, and repeatedly trying to sever communication with this woman? AITA for wanting to again tell her to fuck off?",

      "description": "Throwaway account for legal/work reasons.   \n\n Background: \n- I work at a bottleshop where it is accepted culture by my boss/manager to drink at work. It is a franchise. \n- I live 5 mins drive from my casual job\n\n\nSo I've had a shit day, and I'm on a shift with my assistant manager/good friend. We usually have a beer or two at work, whilst working, and it's never an issue. \n\n\nToday I had three drinks, unfortunately those drinks were 2 standard (Australian) drinks per bottle. So I would have been over the legal limit driving home. I texted my partner, who also lives 5 mins away from my work, and asked if he could pick me up when I finished which he agreed to. This isn't an odd occurrence and sometimes he will pick me up when I have been dropped off or when I've walked to work. \n\n\nWhen he gets there and finds out that he's picking me up because I'm over the limit, he loses his shit. Now he isn't talking to me because I was drinking at work. \n\nI understand this is against his moral code (he doesn't drink) - but it is accepted behaviour at my workplace and my decision as an adult to make. Drinking is how I unwind. I've messaged him and apologised, but he won't answer me back. AITA here? ",

      "description": "So long story short, my step sister is the epitome of fucked up, had to leave West Virginia and come to her mom's in Florida. My dad, her step father, made a 16 hour round trip drive in one day to pick her up and bring her back. She's supposed to be going into a drug program, but my step mom and step brother caught her with weed last night. They're all laughing about it, but my father doesn't like that in his house, especially with a junkie. So instead of flushing it and telling him, they're letting her keep what she has till it's out, and just not mentioning a word to my father.  Who, by the way, is the only one with a job or any source of income in the house, and pulling crazy overtime to pay for the other 3 grown ass people under his roof.\n\nI enjoy a good toke every once in awhile as much as the next guy, and my father hates it, but respects its my choice. His choice is to not allow in his house, and I think that should be respected. So am I the asshole if I screen shot the conversation with my step brother about the whole thing and send it over? Or am I the one in the right with this?",

      "description": "Hello lovely citizens of Reddit, I am u/SomeColdHuman. To give some context to the story I am about to tell you all: I am 13, almost 14, and I have a 9 year old little sister. We're both huge Nintendo fans, and our Switch, especially Splatoon 2, is a huge bonding point for us. 9 months ago, I came out as gay to my parents, but my sister doesn't know yet. Anyways.\n\nMe and my little sister, whom I'll call Kyana,  were turning on our Switch one Saturday morning. Recently, in the Plaza (the hub world where you can post writings and drawings) it had become a running gag to joke about being in the LGBT+ community. I looked up from my phone to see my sister scoffing at the many posts, reporting some as she went. The conversation went something like this (This was a few weeks ago so it's paraphrased):\n\nMe: \"Hey Kyana, what are you doing?\"\n\nKyana: \"I'm reporting all these posts.\"\n\nM: \"Why? There's nothing wrong with them?\"\n\nK: \"It's just... Weird. It's nasty, I don't want to see it anymore.\"\n\nAt this point I was starting to lose what little temper I have, and went back to my phone to ignore her. Since then this has died down as the trend and frequency of posts has, but I can tell as her brother she still feels the same. I know she's just young and doesn't understand fully, but I'm so scared to talk with her about this. So Reddit, I must ask.\n\nAm I The Asshole?\n\nP.S: Sorry if this looks bad, it's my first post and I'm on Reddit Mobile",

      "description": "Recently broke up with the ex bf who held this belief, but trying to be open minded and see if I really am in the wrong here.\n\nIf we were arguing about something, he would always quite aggressively ask me questions that were worded to at the same time support his side and be impossible to answer in any other way. Imagine this hypothetical scenario:\n\n\n*i am paying bills on my phone. We are 8 months into a rocky relationship, have discussed the housing market in general and what kind of loans we each could get, in general terms, but have never broached thd subject of living together. He sits down beside me and sees what I do.*\n- Can I see what savings you have?\n- No? That's private information. \n- So... What do you think I'd do with that information? Do you not trust me??\n\n\n*I am excitedly talking abour where we are going. I am notorious for getting lost often, but rarely know exactly where I go wrong. Me not finding my way somewhere is a running joke among friends and family.*\n\n- look bf, that's the church! On the map it says the place is north of tbe church but left of the fountain! Look, there is the fountain! So, let's go that way? :D\n\n*gets us lost. He is angry that my instructions got us lost. I say if he objected to my instructions their whole derivation was laid out and open for correction if he felt I was wrong. He claims I sounded like I knew where I was going and I shouldn't sound like that unless I am sure. I  claim that he should know me well enough after 2 yrs to know that when I am excited I speak in exclamation marks.\n- Oh, so you are saying I should never be able to trust you??\n\nI am not claiming to be the angel here or being right or wrong in each scenario. I simply think such questions, forcing me to either say something I don't really stand for, or forcing me to agree with his side, are not helpful in a relationship. They make me feel cornered and manipulated and makes me feel like he does not care for my opinions only that he \"wins\".  He claims such questions are very logical (being yes/no) and therefore being very helpful in resolving a disagreement.\n\nAm i the asshole for not agreeing?\n\nTl;dr; Are exaggerated questions like \"So you don't think i should be able to trust you??\", \"So you want me to ignore my feelings and only care about yours??\" and \"So you think I should never look at another woman's chest again??\" helpful to resolving conflict?

      "description": "Like the title says, I currently have my mom and sister blocked on all social media platforms. I also have blocked all of my sisters friends on social media.\n\nThey say it’s rude and disrespectful because I’m not letting them see that part of my life.\n\nWhen they were my friends on social media, however, they would screenshot a lot of my posts and make fun of me, or they would get pissed off by what I post.\n\nOn Snapchat, I posted a picture of a vaporizer with Koi CBD products, stating that the product was helping me tremendously with my anxiety and depression. It was screenshotted by my sister, sent to my mom, grandma, and dad, and before I knew it I was being CAPSLOCK YELLED AT in my family group chat.\n\nApparently vaporizing makes me look immature. My sister asked if I was still in middle school. To top it off, CBD is a cannabis derivative, and therefore people will think I’m using weed illegally. \n\nThey told me to immediately take down the post.\n\nMe, being 20 years old, said no, I’m sorry, but I’m not taking it down. You can unfriend me if you don’t like what I post.\n\nAdditionally, I have bad luck, and sometimes I like to post about it to give people a laugh. For example, one Snapchat said “throwing up at work and boss said “ok”. Gonna be a long day today, wish me luck!” \n\nI was told to immediately take down the post. Why am I such a Debbie downer? No wonder why I don’t have any friends if I’m constantly complaining on social media etc. \n\nI told them, hey this truly isn’t a negative post, I just am posting about my bad luck.\n\nSame thing happened when I was driving the golf cart and my job at a country club and it started pouring rain. I videoed myself being poured on and golf balls flying at me, I thought it was hilarious. Apparently I was being negative, and again was told to take it down.\n\nThree strikes and your out I guess, I blocked them because they don’t like what I post and I’m constantly cocksuckered by my entire family for anything I type or decide to share with the internet.\n\nCan’t post a picture of a glass of wine either, because i don’t turn 21 for another 6 months and god forbid anyone knows I had a drink before I turned of age.\n\nAnyways, I’m on vacation and they’re mad that they’re blocked. I told them, they don’t like what I post, they refused to unfriend me, so I simply took actions into my own hands.\n\nAITA? Maybe social media shouldn’t be used at all for anything about my personal life and instead I should be friends with my family and be careful?\n\nI feel like I’m not TA, but my family is pissed for a reason.\n\nReddit, AITA?",

      "description": "I feel kind of petty writing this, but I was totally flabbergasted when he excitedly called me over to show me part of his advancement talk. \n\n(For those not in the know, advancement is a part of getting a PhD, I don't know how it works at all schools in general but in this case it means he's done everything he needs for his PhD except his dissertation. It's a very big important step along the way, the next stop is basically defending your thesis/getting your PhD.) His advisor has been having him put it off (He really could have done this 18 mos ago) to have him get some papers published. \n\nSo anyway, he's been working on this SPECIFIC presentation for WEEKS, it's super important, and more than that, it's a culmination of the last five years of work he's done.  \n\nAnd, yeah, he does mention his professors, his parents, and I on the acknowledgement page, and I wouldn't have cared if there was no picture at all, but I felt very diminished and overlooked when I saw this huge picture of a sports team he sees maybe once a week as the main focus. A lot of people have done SO MUCH to help him get where he is -- he did all the work, I'm not trying to take anything from him -- but it's inarguable that his parents and I have rearranged our lives to support him. I moved across the country to a state I promised I'd never live in again, because that's where the best school who accepted him was located. I pay his taxes at the end of the year. I put money into his Roth IRA. I arrange MY LIFE so he can use MY CAR because he doesn't have one.  \n\nHere's the thing that really confuses me and pisses me off -- it wasn't even his main sport. He has a sport where he was a professional coach for YEARS, and he works out with THAT sports team at LEAST three times a week. He's involved with tournaments and teaching new referees, he is SUPER involved.  \n\nSo WTF is this other for-fun sports team that he barely even sees or practices doing front and center of the acknowledgements?\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So before anything I'd like to say that I don't want to cut ties with her completely, I just think maybe being best friends isn't the best idea anymore. Now that that's out of the way, I'll start. \n\nMe and this friend met early last year, let's call her honey, later on we met 2 other people, let's call them jester and safira, that later on became my best friends (still my best friends). \n\nThe story becomes abit complicated and confusing here but I'll try and explain it the best I can. Last year we got into a few fights with honey, when we asked her what was wrong she always told us in a sarcastic tone  \"oh, it's NOTHING. \" either that or she'd tell us to figure it out ourselves. So at one point we decided to go to the school counselor to talk about it, turns out she was angry at us because I was hanging out with jester more then her (safira is a year older than us so she had her own friends her age she usually hung out with). And I realized \"oh fuck, she's right\" so after that I started to include both of them so it would be fair. Stuff was good but then we'd get into fights more frequently, and this year I found out she's pretty hot headed. This one happened almost every time, every time we try and figure stuff out and sort out an argument at one point we'd just go back to square one, every single time (also to add alot of times when I tried to talk about what I feel about what she's doing to me, she cuts me off and tell me what I'M doing to HER that was upsetting HER, which led to me never talking about what she did to me). So, last year is done.\n\nNow it's 2019, one month in already stuff isn't going well. Then jester said she was to moving schools, of course we were both sad since she was moving the same week she told us she was moving. So after jester left things were fine and then they started getting bad again. \n\nAn instance of me having enough of her crap is her trying to invade my personal privacy, . I bring my journal to school everyday so whenever I was stressed, anxious or anything of the sorts I would write in it and it would make me feel alot better when getting my thoughts out. Alot of times she'd ask if she could read it and every time I'd say no. And then she started trying to take it from me even when I said no multiple times. But honestly this one's kind of my fault, last year I had a similar journal I'd write my thoughts in usually I'd let her read it since there was nothing in there that was too personal or anything. This year I got a new book, I still would let her read it for some reason, then when things started getting more personal in the book I stopped letting her read it and now here we are. Recently it's been getting worse, there were multiple times I had a mental breakdown either because of something she said or me being scared of what she wants so I don't upset her. I should also mention she has really bad family problems which might lead to why she acts like this. \n\nIf you have any questions then feel free to ask me.",

      "description": "My (34f) husband (44m) got in a huge fight last night and he just doesn't get it.\n\nI've been wanting a dog for awhile now and he's aware. We have 2 cats and 2 ferrets. We had 3 ferrets but 1 was really old with multiple health problems, which he had when we adopted him. He passed away. A week ago. My husband wants to get another one, but I don't. I do all the work for all the animals. The only thing I don't do is the cat litter box because of a health issue I have, my doctor says I'm not allowed to clean it. \n\nSo I brought up the issue about the dog. Before I could get a full sentence out, he cut me off and said, \"We're not getting a dog, that's final!\" He was extremely rude, belittling, and treated me like a child. I was just trying to have a discussion with him about this and he completely shut me down. This isn't the first time. He does this whenever he decides he's right and I'm wrong. But whenever he wants something (like the $1000 lightsaber he complains about) I always listen to him and then explain to him why we can't afford it at the time. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells because there have been times where I day something direct, like - \"Hey, do you think you could clean up after yourself in the kitchen? Thanks!\" He gets upset! I'm direct (but tactful) and I can't say things in a direct manner because he flips out and accuses me of \"blaming\" him and of being \"overly critical\". He also does this when it comes to the kids. He has a 15 year old son from a previous relationship and I have a 5 year old son. My son has chores and does more things around the house than my husband or my stepson. My stepson has no chores, constantly has issues at school for not turning in homework, and spends all of his time sleeping or playing video games. When I bring up the issue of my stepson doing some chores or helping out around the house, he accuses me of being lazy and foisting my housework off on the kids.\n\nI'm not upset about him saying no about the dog. I'm upset that he seems to think his word is law and rules our house like a patriarchy. Our relationship is very unequal. He acts like I'm a child - what he says goes and I'm not supposed to argue about it. \n\nThis morning (the fight happened last night) I tried to explain to him why I was upset, and he thinks it's all about the dog. He doesn't get that it's not the dog, it's his behavior! He thinks he had no choice in the ways he treated me and refuses to acknowledge any other alternative, though I gave him several. \n\nHe even texted my friend last night and blamed the entire thing on her, because it's \"her fault for making (me) want a dog\". She's done a lot for us, more than anyone else, but he says he has no respect for her. He refuses to see that this isn't about the dog. He thinks if it weren't for the dog thing, this never would've happened. Yes, it would, it would just be about something else because you repeatedly treat me like a child. He refuses to take any kind of responsibility for his actions and I'm to my breaking point. \n\nAm I wrong?",

      "title": "AITA? Cutting parents out after pregnancy reaction?",
      "description": "\nSince teenage years, I have always struggled with my relationship with my parents. The maintenance of a relationship and most interactions with them are almost certain to be negative and stressful, which takes a huge toll mentally. I have been in a happy and stable relationship for 18+ months now, with someone I had known 2 years prior. Parents met him 12 months ago but did not embrace him anywhere near close to how they embraced past SO’s. Fast forward a few months &amp; we are getting nowhere with them &amp; it is taking a huge toll on me mentally. SO struggling too from the perspective of he can see first-hand the affect it was having on me. We both tried to speak to parents about it on numerous occasions and work out a solution, to which they fiercely rejected all. The only solution they’re willing to work with was to only have a relationship with me &amp; were happy to make me live two life streams – one as a partner to SO and one as a daughter to them. From that point, I decided to cut them out and get on with building a life with SO - rather than work on what I felt like was a brick wall with my folks.\n \nI started speaking to them just over a month ago, shortly after SO &amp; I found out we were 7 weeks pregnant. Given our history with them, we deliberated whether to tell them early. Finally we decided to tell them early, as figured they would be resentful later down the road if we didn’t. They live in a different time-zone, so I chose email to share the news with them. Admittedly my email was very formal as I chose not to put any emotion into it for all the above reasons. Father replied “Don’t contact me directly anymore, do it through your mother or siblings. I can do without your drama. Good luck in your endeavours and hope things work out the way you think they will.” Mother shortly replied in the more excited fashion which opened up a dialogue between us – she even started whatsapping SO!\nThings chug along okay with mother, with me and SO keeping her updated on baby progress via email and whatsapp. Late last week, she shares that she and father wish to visit and spend some time with SO &amp; I before baby arrives &amp; wish to visit it Feb. This seemed very odd to me as Father has not spoken to me since his ‘do not contact email’. SO and I agree to the visit but I ask them to find alternative accommodation – as I do not want my father in my house after his hurtful reaction &amp; behaviour in all of this. This opens up a can of worms, one thing leads to another and mother is upset I won’t ‘just forgive’ my father or let them (him) stay and cannot understand why I am confused that he wants to see me. I’ve literally spelled it out that until father pulls out of his denial and addresses his appalling reaction to my pregnancy, he doesn’t get to play a part in it – child born or not. Mother is very excited and ‘makes the effort on behalf of her father’ she has expressed father is excited and happy – but I have had no contact from him in this regard.\nSO and I do talk about how it would work if I decided I wanted to cut all ties with them again and I have not replied to any further correspondence from mother.\n \n \nAITA 1 – For not ‘just forgiving’ my father and moving on?\nAITA 2 – If I do decide not to have anything to do with them, even after the baby arrives?\nAITA 3 – Am I unfairly punishing mother for father’s denial?\nAITA 4 – for anything else here?\n \nSincerely,\nConfused &amp; Hormonally Baby-Brained.\n \n \n ",

      "description": "Full disclosure - this is my first post ever. Long time lurker, but due to my situation, I thought this might be a suitable first post. (Throwaway because several people I know scroll reddit and are active on this sub.)\n\nI struggle with severe depression and anxiety. Over the past few months, I have really struggled mentally with my job and have been beyond miserable. My job absolutely attributes to my depression. I've had several days where I want to up and just quit with no warning, including several days over the past few weeks. This week I was offered a new position. After thinking it over, I decided that it was in my best interest to take the new job for my overall mental health (better pay, better benefits, close to home, similar hours, but most importantly not doing something I hate.). With that, I just can't see staying there for two weeks given my current mental state. I'm checked out and would literally be just a body in a seat after handing over my projects. It would be a waste of the company's time and money. So given that it'll take about a week to hand things over and scope out everything I've been working on, including instructions, I decided to give them just over a week's notice (next Friday) instead of two weeks.\n\nMy boss was not happy (to put it lightly) I'm leaving and extremely upset that I'm only giving him a week. At this point, while I appreciate my boss and genuinely like him, I just can't do it anymore. I don't owe anyone my happiness but I still can't help feeling like an ass, given his reaction.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole here?",

Few more null birthdays followed, just a cheap and cheerful family meal which is fine but nothing I'd call special or memorable. \nAt 21 (another biggish deal day in my culture) with a completely different group of people, the exact same thing happened as my 18th, I went home after being essentially stood up and just went to bed. 25th rolls around and by this point I have pretty much given up on the idea of any sort of special day so I make no effort to make anyone aware of the day and it goes pretty much the same as any other day, with the exception of a nice cake or pie baked by my mother.\n\nI'm hitting 30 in a few days and my gf doesn't seem to or is struggling I guess to understand why I hate this day, why I'd rather be at home doing my own thing without a care for anybody else in the world and definitely why I don't want to go out. \n\nIdk if ITA or what on this one? I think I just wanted to vent cos this hits me hard every year it rolls around and this sub seemed appropriate.\n\nTLDR not had a birthday that didn't turn to crap, don't want to celebrate or do anything on my 30th and GF doesn't understand why, AITA?",

And in probably any other case I'd be fine with it, she's a smart girl she knows how to be cautious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a little more concerning than that though. See, they \\*have\\* met once. At the same convention she wants to go with him now. By chance, after they had already started talking. \"by chance\" she insists. You meet a man online, then you run into him \"by chance\" at a convention, in the same city - at the same place. And he recognises you. I did mention she's a smart girl, but she can be naive. She insists he's not a creep and she knows him very well, but again she's never really talked to him outside of friendly chat and small talk. I don't really believe she does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few other annoying details that contribute to my annoyance with the situation. She's texted him during dates with me before. Which I've let slide after saying it's not really cool. She has other people she's supposedly close to but she talks to him more. A LOT more. (I know this because she has a habit of telling me all about who she's talking to recently). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've told her that I'm okay with it if she goes with other people as well. She claims she wants to but is having a hard time finding others. She stubbornly insists that I'm being unreasonable by saying that I'm not okay with her going alone with him. That's my issue, if she could at least see where I'm coming from maybe I'd be okay with this. Obviously, she's not my property and I would never force her to. But I have told her that I feel as though I'd be disrespected if she ignored my feelings all together. She doesn't agree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

For our first valentines, I went over at his uni accommodation and spent the day over at his place and we just chilled inside the whole day. \n\nFor context, I live away from home for uni and he’s moved back in with his parents..This year, he had uni and is very busy with his coursework etc and I had work so I wasn’t expecting anything. All day at work I kept hearing about customers and coworkers talking about their Valentine’s Day plans and how it’s going whilst I hadn’t even received a Happy Valentine’s Day from my bf.\n\nOnly around 8pm he texted saying he completely forgot it was today until he saw people holding roses in the train. Told me he had planned to send me roses or whatnot but completely forgot cause he was buried in work. He could’ve still made it up to me by calling me and just asking me about my day or whatever but not even that. I just feel so hurt and not feel cared about. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I brought up this conversation with him and spoke about how I felt?",

      "description": "My ex and I split over a year ago.  He had been cheating on me.  He wanted to and still wants to work through it, but that’s not even a possibility.  I have a son who will soon be 16.  The divorce was hard on him, especially because he didn’t understand why it was happening.  I just told him that his father and I couldn’t make it work anymore and that these things sometimes happen.  It’s never been a good enough reason for him.  \n\nHis father takes him every other weekend.  He’s been filling my son’s head with ideas of us some day getting back together.  Then I get to explain to my son that it’s not going to happen.  Of course at that point I get to deal with his anger at the situation.  The way he saw it was that I kicked his father out of the house, split up our marriage, and am now unwilling to even try to work through it with his poor victim of a father.  \n\nIve talked to my ex about him bringing our son into our issues before.  His response was that if his son is going to come to him to talk to him, he’s not going to lie about his feelings.  To which I responded, no, but you’ll sure leave a hell of a lot out of it to make me the bad guy.  Then it just turned into an argument before he left. \n\nMy son was giving me attitude recently and I got to the bottom of it.  Apparently my ex is being evicted and my son wants me to let him sleep on the couch until he finds another place.  I said that’s not going to happen and he said that’s why he didn’t even ask.  Then went on about how this used to be his house too and I’m the one who divorced him and won’t try get back together.  It’s not fair that I treat him like shit over nothing. \n\nI had enough of this bullshit.  I told him it wasn’t over nothing, his father had been cheating on me and he got caught.  He’s the reason our marriage ended.  It was his choices that got us here and he can sleep on the street as far I care.  My son said that I was lying and stormed out.  After he calmed down he came back, but doesn’t want to talk about it.  I’ve been trying to give him some space to process everything.  \n\nI do regret that it came out in anger instead of though out discussion, but my ex misleading him has been getting his hopes up for nothing and then damaging my relationship with him when I dash them.  I tried talking to him about it and he kept it up, I’m not sure what else I could’ve done.  ",

At first I thought it was sweet that she was proud of me so I happily played, however recently it feels like she has an ulterior motif. \n\nInstead of enjoying the music itself it feels like my mother just wants to flaunt me in front of her friends. I feel used in the sense that mum puts me up on a pedestal as if to say ‘look at what my son can do, what can your children do’. The main reason I feel this way is because she rarely asks me to play when nobody else is around and the parading manner in which she talks about me feels gross. \n\nSo tonight, I got home late from university, was pretty tired and didn’t really feel like appeasing her by playing for her company. She playfully requested for me to play multiple times to which I politely declined, multiple times, until I just straight up ignored her request and continued to walk to my room. Feel kinda guilty, she was pretty upset. AITA?\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my sister to come over.",
      "description": "So just for clarification, I'm 18 and my sister is like 24 (We're out of touch so idrk). Anyways to give some background me and my sister used to be very close back in the day. I still recall memories of when I was like 10 or so and I would follow her around all the time. To say the least, she was a very good older sister, she would always wake me up for school, make me breakfast, and overall just take care of me. My mother back then was always working so it was always up to my sister to take care of me. (FTR she didn't go to school, she is kind of an illegal immigrant lol)  \n\nAs I got older right around 14\\~15ish she began to treat me well to put bluntly like shit. At first, I honestly didn't think much of it. I was a teen by now and was well aware of how sibling relationships can get as you get older. But as we both grew up progressively we became more and more apart. Down the line, she married this dude and got pregnant.  But it wasn't until later when my niece was born that she became a full-blown dominatrix. Legit I dunno why but she became this self-centered cunt who could quite frankly not give a fuck about anyone other than herself or her child. Before I go any further lemme give you a little background on her. she came over from South America (illegally) when she was 16 and lived with my mother and I until she was like 19. She lived the wildlife, to say the least, I remember my mom would always tell her to get a job and help her out a little bit because legit she would just sit around all day, party at night, rinse and repeat. Eventually, she said fuck it and moved out and in with my aunt. Which later she would meet her husband at a club and moves in with him, marry him and whatever. To say the least, shes had it very easy thus far in life. Shes managed to live without even having to lift a finger or work a day in her life. \n\nSo anyway going back when she becomes a mother. Like I stated earlier she became very self-centered. She would go on and on about what's good for her child and be very vain about how she's the world's perfect child. How my niece is smart, beautiful, etc. My mom kinda ate that shit like nothing saying things like \"She sure is!\" and shit like that (dick riding her basically). But me, on the other hand, didn't really eat that shit at all. That's not to say I don't like my niece and all it's just that I'm not gonna suck your dick just because you want my praise. She eventually realized this and this is where her action got out of control. She would completely ignore me when staying over at me and my mom's place. Legit she would walk in say hi to mom and not even acknowledge my presence. Not only that but she would make the biggest fuss over the smallest things. Swear a while back she legit had a fucking freak out because we didn't have milk. Saying shit like \"YOU GUYS KNEW WE WHERE COMING SO WHY DON'T YOU HAVE ANY MILK FOR EMILY!\" my niece btw). I guess somewhere in the crevices of her small mind she thought she was the only thing on our mind or something. But probably the worst part of it all is how she treats my mom. I can't even begin to tell you the number of instances where she just drops my niece in the middle of the night and goes to a club. The thing with my niece is shes kind of a night stalker (Sleeps during the day, is awake at night) so there's no getting her to go to sleep. Which in turn keeps my mom awake. Thing is though my sister very well knows my mom works very early in the mornings but she doesn't give a fuck.  There's also a couple other instances like how she once took my car (without telling me) when I had to go to school which made me miss my classes, along with a couple of other things. \n\nAnyways the whole reason why I'm writing this post is because she's here rn and I kinda just had to vent for a bit because I'm not gonna lie the moment I heard her voice from my room I got like this extreme feeling of dreed or maybe depression. Like for all that's holy I cannot come to accept this woman into my life. As fucked up as it is to say it She's honestly a cancer in my life. Legit she just barged into my room like 10 mins ago without even saying hello and said: \"where are your car keys\" in like the most cynical voice you can think of.  I'm just there like wtf is your problem? you know. Anyways thanks for reading this far. Lemme know what you guys think. Cause honestly I don't know what to do. This might be extreme but I'm honestly thinking of moving out just so I can stay away from her but As the matter stands I can't afford to atm. I'm a college student with a shitty retail job so I'm kinda stuck. Anyways have a good day or night guys. peace.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "  \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting my boyfriend to indulge in friendly banter with my father?  \n \n\nMy boyfriend and I are visiting my parents over the holidays. By „parents“ I mainly mean my poor mother who doesn’t have the strength to leave my abusive father. They live together.\n\nAlthough my father is mostly only abusive towards my mother and much less so when outsiders are around, he began shouting at me for using my mother’s phone as mine had died (and since he deems himself the only one allowed to snoop around in there). I am not afraid of physical violence towards myself, so I shouted back something along the lines of „If you want to argue, better wear your hearing aid“ and kept repeating this, since he wouldn’t understand any other thing I’d say.\n\nBeing the abuser he is, my father said to me – his 24-year-old daughter who has recently broken her foot – „you are never going to be happy, just look at you. The way you sit there, just look at you. You will find no happiness and you will limp for the rest of your life. You bet you will limp until you die.“\n\nMy boyfriend arrived at my parents‘ place one hour after this happened. I told him about it and he consoled me, saying what an asshole my father was. Later he showed me the gift he had prepared for my father. I asked him whether he wanted to give him this gift despite everything that had JUST happened (plenty of other things have happened over the years which my boyfriend knows but chooses to forget about). He said: „Yes, that’s a matter of decency.“ He still eats lunch with my father present (in my family, it is unsual to share meals) and indulges in friendly banter with him. \n\nLast night, I had a nightmare about my father kidnapping my mother, me running after them and trying to save her, all while my boyfriend stayed in a cozy building. I shyly told my boyfriend about the dream, and while he certainly understood the implications, he just hugged me.  \n \n\nAm I the asshole for expecting my partner to at least temporily shun someone who wishes I were disabled until I die? On one hand, I feel like I am for trying to impose on him to be unfriendly towards my father. On the other hand … I just don’t get him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriends is incredibly sweet and caring otherwise.",

      "title": "AITA for asking strangers to let my wife and I ahead of them in the TSA line so Iwe didn't miss our flight?",
      "description": "So backstory: My wife and I went on our honeymoon this summer. This was my first ever time flying, and my wife's first time flying without her parents (except once about 5 years ago). Our naivete is important here.\n\n[Warning: This next two paragraphs are a lot of background that isn't 100% necessary, but provides some context. If it's longer than you'd like to read, skip the next two paragraph.]\n\nSo when we left, we departed from an airport in a medium-sized city (pop. 200k, 1 mil in the metro area). Checking bags took almost no time at all, TSA was maybe 10 minutes, and everything was easy breezy on the way there.\n\nOn the way home, things were a little more chaotic. We left our hotel 2-3 hours before our flight, believing that would give us more than enough time. Now when we arrived for our honeymoon, we hit literally 5 tolls on a half hour drive to our hotel. So on the way back I decided to put no tolls on my GPS. This extended our trip a bit and we ended up getting a little turned around at the airport as well, but all in all, we still felt like we were ok. Then we got to checking our bags. We had not anticipated it taking about a half an hour (this was Orlando, so it was much busier). Then we got to TSA check and the wait was going to be very long (I can't remember specifics, but the expected time to finish TSA would've been past the time our flight left).\n\nAt some point in the TSA line, I said \"fuck it, gotta give it a shot\" and started asking people in front of me one by one if I could go ahead of them as we were late for our flight. I actually was surprised at how nice people were about it. I thanked them and usually the next person overheard and let us go through. A few were a little hesitant, or seemed slightly annoyed, but let me go on. I didn't push it. Didn't try to wear anybody down. Just asked once and if they said \"yes\" I went and if they said \"no\" that would be it.\n\nThings went well until one guy wasn't having it and said \"No, you have to wait in line like everyone else\". He had noticed us moving up the line and was clearly aggravated by it. Now, inside I admit I hated that guy, but outwardly all I said was \"Ok\" and to my wife \"guess the ride stops here\". Neither of us knew what to do in the event we actually missed our flight, and we were getting ready to start researching that.\n\nA stroke of luck hit when the TSA line split into several separate lines and the guy was no longer in front of us. Everyone I asked in our new line let us go on and once we were just a few spots away from the front, I stopped asking and let the line go. We got through, rushed to our gate, (which was boarding when we got there) and made it home on time.\n\nSo, reasons I think I may not be an asshole:\n1) I asked first and respected everyone's answer.\n2) We were pretty naive about flying and honestly thought we had prepared enough.\n\nReasons I think I am the asshole:\n1) I feel like I took advantage of the kindness of strangers.\n2) I still am not very fond of the guy who stopped us even though he had every right to say no.\n3) Our lack of preparation inconveniences people.\n4) Whether I'm an asshole or not, I stand by what I did. It was a desperate situation and I'll sacrifice a little dignity if it means not missing a flight. Obviously I'll plan better in the future, but as the situation stood, I wasn't overly concerned about being a bit of a dick.\n\nFinal note: I know it may sound like I'm distorting how \"polite\" I was to everyone to make myself sound better, but that's really how I was. I'm not a person who just likes to strike up conversations with strangers and I am not very confrontational. I did make an effort to be polite, but it was amplified by the fact that doing this was slightly terrifying for me.",

      "description": "I have 2 children, a high school senior and a high school sophomore. The Missus is a cardiac surgeon while I work as a software engineer at a pretty big firm. Needless to say, finances aren’t an issue for us.\n\nNow I’m of the opinion that my kids’ primary focus should be their education right now. They don’t have/need jobs (besides sometimes part-time during the summer), but the wife and I pretty much pay for everything. As such, the kids just expected that we would pay for their college, which honestly, was a reasonable expectation. The problem lies with our daughter: she wants to major in Comparative Literature or something related to writing. Her reasoning is that she loves writing and she’s good at it.\n\nI’m a bit hesitant to just pay for unconditional college. If her goal was to be a writing professor, or just had a specific career goal in mind in general, I’d be a lot more willing. But as it stands, her primary motivator was just because it interests her. I told her that I’m fine paying for education, on the condition that she majored in something more “practical”. Or that if she had a legitimate plan to get from what she’s majoring to what she wants to do, then I’d be happy to pick up the tuition and living expenses, which means she just needs to pay for her own food. If she doesn’t that’s fine, but she’d have to find a way to supplement her education through loans and scholarships (and I will help her do this).  \n\nShe accused me of trying to manipulate her. Truth be told, I did try to push STEM to her when she was 15-16, but she consistently brought home Bs-high Cs in stem while getting perfect As to A+s in writing. I conceded that she was just naturally a better writer, and I’ll let her develop her own issues. She’s using this information from the past to claim I’m trying to manipulate her into doing a field that I want her to do.\n\nMy POV is, I don’t necessarily care if she does a field in STEM. She can get her Underwater Basket Weaving degree IF she planned to, for example, be a lawyer (and thus has an actual use for the degree), but she can’t just major in something because she “likes” it. Unless the like will lead to a potential career path in mind.\n\nMy wife won’t take a side (she’s normally the one that has these little spats with our daughter while me and her normally see eye-to-eye). So I come to you, Reddit, to help me see if I’m being unreasonable.\n\nAITA for wanting to add stipulations to what I’d pay for in college?",

      "description": "So I’ll keep this nice and short. Yesterday my girlfriend and I went on a double date to a comedy club with our friends. This was in NYC, so imagine my surprise when I run into a friend from college I hadn’t seen since winter break. We had already gotten our tickets for the comedy club, and he was heading home so I invited him out with us and paid for half his ticket. We have an amazing time, comedians were fantastic but right after the show he asked me to drive him to Brooklyn. He’s an orphan, and he’s in between houses, so the lady he’s staying with has to stay up until he’s back home to let him into the house. It was late, 1am, I was the only one with a car and I still had to drop off my girlfriend, and the couple who were 40 plus minutes away, and then drive myself back home to Long Island an extra hour away. His spot was 30 minutes in the opposite direction, I was tired of driving nonstop all day and I had plans to get dessert with everyone after the show. I offered to drop him off at the nearest train station, or pay for half his Uber and he just stormed off. \n\nLater I get a long text saying that I’m a fake friend, that he was always there with my “bullshit” problems and when he needed me to drive a little out of my way I wasn’t there, and just continued to go off on me. I had been driving all day and that would have been an extra hour to my commute home and it was already really late,  but he’s sleeping as a guest and he could face serious trouble for keeping the person he’s staying with up so late. AITA? Should I have driven him home? I care about him and have shown him in the past so this is coming out of left field.  ",

Why can't you hang out with him?\" and walks off down the stairs with Tony (I cannot do stairs due to a physical disability, she knows this as does Tony)\n\nMind you, Drew was having a panic attack at the time and was talking to a teacher, so I thought it would be best to get his lunch for him with Bee and Tony.\n\nAITA for telling her what she did was a bit of a pisstake and very unkind?",

      "description": "My boyfriend died 57 days ago. You can look through my history to get that history if you like.  It was a few days after thanksgiving. So the holidays were super difficult, and then beginning of the year with everyone \"new year new me\" put me in funk.  However, I picked up extra shifts at work, been working out a lot more and trying to channel my energy in positive experiences.  Friendships that I always knew were there, have been making more of an appearance in my time of need.  Brunch, lunch and dinners have consumed my time.  Friends and family have been there for me.  \n\nSo my friend, Sandy.  She was the one I called when I got the call of his death.  She was the one that came with me to his house to  talk to the police, detectives, crime lab and medical examiner.  It took hours. I honestly do not know what I would have done if she was not present.  She helped me call his family, she called mine to make them aware. \n\nBut sandy has always been an intense friend when we are at the bar.  She is married with 2 kids. I am not a mother and recently lost the love of my life. So she asks me what my plans are for the weekend. I say I'm free Friday night for dinner maybe drinks after.   She immediately gets excited, talking about ubering and having a kid free night.  I tell her I plan on driving because I do not want to get too drunk as I have lots to do Saturday and told her I need to be home by midnight.  We meet up later then expected bc of work, so we skip food and head to a local bar.  Run into some people, talking relaxing. But she kept asking me to take shots, and kept asking me to consider an uber ride home.  I had to tell her repeatedly that I was fine. She wanted to dance, so we went to he place with a dj. she struck up conversations with strangers, dancing having a good time. And I was ok with it, annoyed but it's typical Sandy on a free night off.  I sipped on my beer and sat at the bar playing on my phone, talking to the bartender.  Every once in a while she would come over with people (guys and girls) yelling loudly \"this is my friend \"and then I would listen to a drunk conversation about how Fraggle Rock should come back on TV or how the Pats shouldn't be allowed to go to the SuperBowl again.  It wasn't how I expected my night to be, but whatever.  Then Sandy tells the bartender I think he's cute.  I never said that. I also don't find him attractive for the record, but I digress.  He walked off uncomfortably as we have been conversing for a while.  I turned to her and said \"why did you do that, do you think that is what will make me happy? That will take my pain of him dying away\"  She yelled that I was overreacting.  I left the bar. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer husband texted me telling me she made it home ok.  I called her the next day 2 times and texted asking if we could talk.  She ignored me.  Then texted a novel about how I am in a world of grief, and she doesn't believe that I was angry at her, I am just so sad that I exploded on her and she forgives me.    So I let her HAVE it. texted a fucking novel back, saying my anger was 100% in response to her inappropriate behavior. That everyone else at the bar was more interesting then me to hang out with, so you chose to ignore me and honestly I was annoyed but it was expected.  But was not ok was that in your twisted head, you think me hooking up with a dude will help me. I told her that my sisters/cousins and even friends I have not seen in months have taken me out to dinners, lunches, brunches, concerts, festivals and NO ONE has made me feel as uncomfortable as she did. The night was about her \"escape from her lame routine\" then do not play it as you're trying to be there for me. Don't tell your husband you want to be there for me when it's all about you.  If you think the bartenders cute, you tell him that.  If you want to flirt, you do it. I do not, and if/when I chose to do it, I do not need to do with such desperation.  I told her I value our friendship and she has been there for me in ways I can never repay. But I will always call a spade a spade, and what you said was inappropriate.  I said maybe that means our friendship needs to change, maybe we should do lunch and coffee dates, shopping dates, and lounging watching greys anatomy marathon dates. because I do not like who she is when she drinking.

      "description": "I am visiting my hometown around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. I want to spend some much-needed alone time with my family.\n\nI have a couple of old college friends that are also visiting my hometown around the holidays, and they asked me about my end-of-year plans. I told them that I was visiting, but I purposely told them a shorter period of time than I'm actually visiting, so that our visits would not overlap. I did this because I don't feel like hanging out with them, and they've had a negative reaction to me outright declining to hang out in the past.\n\nAdditionally, I have a couple of \"friends\" in my current town that I've been actively avoiding for over half a year now because hanging out with them was taking a toll on my mental health. I'm pretty nonconfrontational, so every time they ask to hang out, I've been telling them I'm \"busy\" with the newest excuse of the week. Recently, I told them that I was busy visiting my hometown, and again, I lied about the dates that I plan to visit, but I told them a much longer period of time than I'm actually visiting, so that I can use the \"out of town\" excuse for a longer period of time.\n\nI'm fully aware that I told all these people two lies that contradict each other. They all know each other, but don't talk regularly. Still, there's a chance that they could put all of this together. AITA?",

      "description": "I moved across the country my senior year of high school and I lost just about all of my friends from the area. There were a handful that I didn’t lose contact with, I’m talking about some “friends” specifically people in this group. I just recently went back,  years later I and I knew some of these friends would be there. I let them know in advance that I would be there and would love to see them even if it was for a short time because I know they’re busy. The two in particular I’m never speaking to again both sounded like they were very excited to seem me again. Fast forward to when I’m in town, my first friend, let’s call her A, claimed that it was too late for her (5PM) then A the next just said she was too tired at around 3 in the afternoon. The second friend (B) who seemed particularly excited to see me ended up not responding to messages or anything. I knew she was busy, I just wanted to say hi, exchange some words and I would have been happy. After this experience, it seems like everything has been fake. I thought A and B would be happy to see me and take time to see me, I don’t think I’m asking much, especially since I thought we were close friends. Because of this, I never want to speak to A or B again. I had a very busy friend who came and met up with me for 10 minutes and then had to go back and work. I was grateful that they did. So AITA for never wanting to speak to A or B again?",

      "description": "My bff D and I grew up down the street from each other. Her parents have become like a second family to me. We exchange gifts on holidays and often do little favors for each other. They even used to let me “piggyback” on D’s birthday parties in middle school because they knew my family doesn’t throw me parties, and have taken me on a couple family trips. D and her folks moved a couple years back (a few towns over), I still visit a couple times a month when D and I aren’t both working (we’re both very busy). \n\nOnto the situation: D and I are going on a trip and need a lift to the airport. This is not the first trip we’ve taken and not the first time this happened. Both her parents work full time and so does my dad. \n\nBoth D’s mom and dad have already offered lifts to the airport despite the fact that they’d have to work after and live more than an hour from the airport. I had asked my mom about a week back if she’d be able to give us the lift, since she doesn’t work and we live much closer (about 40 minutes). And she basically just beat around the bush for a week.\n\nFinally I told her we really needed to know and she told me it was too early and she “would still be sleeping.” I offered D that she could stay the night and I’d pay for a taxi in the morning. Instead, her dad is insisting on taking us, which means he has to wake up a full hour earlier than my mom would have, and then work a full day after. \n\nI haven’t said anything to my mom except she asked why I’m staying the night over there since she thought we were leaving from our house, and I told her that was “only if we had a ride from here, and we don’t.” \n\nSo AITA? I guess I’m asking less if you think my mom is being an asshole to me; and more if I’m an asshole for expecting her to be as good a parent as D’s. I understand I’m not entitled to her time, I mostly feel like she’s being inconsiderate to D’s parents because they always offer to go out of their way for us. Every ride we’ve needed, they give us, even if it’s more convenient for her. I’m also salty because if she needed a ride to the airport, I’d just suck it up and get up early to drive her. ",

      "description": "Hi Reddit. This recently happened and I'm not really sure on how to deal with it. TL;DR at the end.\n\nHere's some back story:\n\nI was a graduating college student (who just graduated last Friday) who had three more weeks to go before the ceremony, but was in a fit due to lack of requirements (both financial and academic wise). I wasn't really sure at that time if I was going to graduate, but I did my best to comply everything. For a week or two, I did what any other college student would do--hauled ass and didn't sleep a wink. The stress of it all had probably gotten to me and I ended up getting sick. I developed a nasty fever and I had all sorts of magical things coming out of my nose, but I kept pushing myself to finish all of my requirements and attended the grad practices. I managed to get them all done, but in exchange, my condition just got nastier and nastier. Now that all my shit was done, I just needed to carry on with the practices and head back home to rest.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nOkay so:\n\nOn the second to the last day of practice, my best friend (let's call him Kevin) messaged me saying he was going home for an event (he worked at a different state) and asked if I wanted to hang out and chill with him and a few other friends on Saturday. Thinking that I might be feeling better by then, I agreed. Now that Saturday was also the last day of our practices. Which I forced myself to go despite being sick. We ended up practicing overtime and I guess that wasn't such a great idea. Instead of getting better, I just got worse. Worse to the point where I couldn't stand, to the point where I would often white out for a second and lose my balance. (Couldnt go to our campus clinic because they were always closed)\n\nI had to message Kevin and my other friends, telling them that I couldn't go. I explained my situation and told them that I've pushed myself far enough. My other friends understood, but not Kevin. He left our group chats. When I tried messaging him, trying to apologize and explain myself, he didn't bother checking on them (the messages were on Facebook). I couldn't meet up with him either since the day after our supposed get together, he would fly back to his state for work. He was a pretty cool dude and we were close enough to be siblings. But he just didn't bother anymore.\n\nI feel bad that I said yes. I shouldn't have led him and the other friends on. I felt bad that he was expecting. But I didn't expect my fever and everything else would worsen. Neither did I expect to lose a best friend over it.\n\nSo I don't know. I'm pretty stumped. \n\n\nTL;DR\nA friend invited me to hang out but I was too sick to go. Explained it to him and apologized but he ended up ghosting me. ",

He once cut his wrist to \"prove\" his love which made things hard for her as she had to listen to people talking nonsense like 'Why is she being so stubborn?' 'Why can't she understand his feelings?' stuffs like that. Truth to be told, she had zero feelings for him and even if she did, they won't have a chance to be together because they both belonged to different religion and it could be a pretty serious issue in a country like India. \n\nI, on the other hand, didn't know who to side with. Since most of the them were on his side, I decided to back her up. Yes, people did judge me for not siding with the person whom I shared a room but some random chick instead. \n\nWell, she wasn't just some random chick to me as she was the only true friend I had in the entire campus even though I addressed every others as \"friends\" as well. We were very close to each other and were there to comfort each other whenever either of us felt depressed or had a shitty day. \n\nApparently, we developed feelings for each other on the run. Even though we were not sure about it as there was a high chance for things to get ugly, we still ended up getting into a relationship. \n\nAs few weeks passed by, he became aware of us and made a huge scene by swearing and cursing myself and my family. All the while, I tried to be calm as possible but eventually lost my shit and got into a fist fight that ended with me in a headlock. I was thrown out of my own room and none of the other roommates protested it probably because he threatened to kill me/anyone who interacted with me. I knew I had to stay away from him for the next few days until things cooled down, so I spent my nights at the college studio. By this time, I was already drowning in guilt and self-loathe believing I made a huge mistake. I had no one to comfort me except her and at that time, her words weren't enough because I felt like the entire world hated me for what I've done. \n\nAfter things cooled down, I tried to have a conversation with him. He was still angry and kept repeating how he still felt the urge to kill me. He then proceeded to rant about how unfair it is of woman to choose \"bad guys\" over \"good guys\". While I, on the other hand, was only responding with how sorry I was to hurt his feelings. \n\nAs he sensed me easily falling prey for guiltiness, he started to become manipulative. He started talking shit about her and fed me lies that weren't actually true. He told me that she actually did have feelings for him and they both were in a relationship before she dumped him for me. He said I was gonna end up like him one day when she leaves me for some other guy. He also said the reason why she dumped him was because they both didn't have a chance to be together implying that one day she'll leave me too as we didn't have a chance either. Having a really confused mind, I fell for everything he said and started avoiding her for not being honest with me.\n\nSoon I learned he was feeding me with bullshit when I asked about it to everyone else. Infact, they were the ones who told me I was being manipulated. Since that day I started avoiding him even though I stayed in the same room with the same people. I also immediately apologized to her for falling prey for his lies and patched up with her.\n\nAnyway things are not the same way as then, he and I are on good terms but I can't take the guilt I feel everytime I am reminded of this incident. So, I'll leave you to judge. ",

It’s my spring break and he took the week off to spend it with me. He has to work today and last night it was 11 and I wanted to go to sleep. He got upset and wanted me to spend another hour with him. I said no and that I needed to go to sleep. He has to get up at 8 in the morning and says that I should stay up later because he knows I won’t get up to spend time with him in the morning. I tell him I need my sleep and that we have the whole week to spend together. A couple hours won’t make that much difference. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to go to sleep and not spend time with him even if we have the whole week together?",

He tells me about hooking up with Amanda, and I, not knowing if she had ended her previous relationship yet asked if he knew the status of that. He said \"I don't really know, but I don't really care. Just don't tell him.\" This is what really bothers me, to not care if he's getting with a girl who might be dating someone.

      "description": "My parents have been fighting constantly as long as I can remember. When I was a child, they would threaten divorce every three months or so. Many fights were mutual, but my father has been more abusive as week. I've heard him lock my mother out in the snow. I also know he knocked her teeth out once. This has been gradually getting better as I grew up, especially after I told my father I was scared of him after hearing him scream at my mother while I was sobbing in my room.\n\nHe has never been physically violent with me, but he would randomly get super angry at some things I would do or say, screaming loudly and getting red. Because of this, my mother never left him, saying things like \"he has been an excellent father, I can't deny it\" every time I would criticize him. I recognize that my mother has been by far and large the victim of this abuse but I resent her for making me grow up in this environment that made us both suffer.\n\nAnother thing is that they would both use me as their marriage counselor when I was a teen/young adult, telling me things I never wanted to know (from the details of their fights to their sex lives), which really took a toll on me seeing them as parental figures.\n\nNowadays, their temper has improved, and it's mostly petty bickering. But it is *constant*. I live on my own now; we spent Saturday together and they could not spend 10 fucking minutes without criticizing one another. I've told them many times that I hate it but they keep going. It's like that every single time I see them. I honestly loathe to visit just because it's so damn exhausting, I just blank out whenever they're not directly talking to me, and always find excuses to cut the day short. The freedom of not living with them has seriously improved my mental health and I feel much better when I don't see them for at least a month. Yet I still feel guilty for doing so, because I know that they love me and are so happy to see me. So, AITA for not seeing my parents more often?",

While at the store we're browsing through the aisles and at one point she reaches in to kiss me. So I lean in...\n\nWoooh... My face scrunched but I didn't want to embarrass her so with my strong stomach acids I sealed it with a light peck on her lips.\n\nA few aisles later I said to her, I said \"hey uhhh... Y-you gotta... Your breath stinks\"\n\nHer face washed red in embarrassment and she got mad and walked off.\n\nSo am I the douche here?",

      "description": " So I am fairly young, 21, and I have been in one relationship for 5 months which ended 6 months ago, I was perfectly loyal and didnt so much as firt with another guy. I do however have what some people would consider a rather high partner count, 25. Most of these guys where short term flings, or FWB. I get std tested every 3 months, never had an STD or pregnancy scare, force all my partners to wear condoms, and inform them if I might be getting serious with someone. So while dating an issue I have is guys who normally want a relationship, always ask my partner count, while their's is low like 2 or 3,  mine is well 25... Im not trying to shame anyone with a high partner count, I do not regret these encounters or what I learned from them. However many guys who I am trying to date see this as a major issue. Im not willing to lie about my partner count, but WIBTA if I told them it's none of their buisness if I'm being clean and seeing them exsclusivly then it shouldnt be an issue. My friends say the guys have a right to know but I feel like this question always leads to drama and insecurity. Some of the times when I told these guys i've gotten ghosted or rejected and called a slut. I get really bad anxiety now when this question is asked because of the reaction I get. Im in the USA so this partner count isnt unusal. ",

      "title": "AITA for ghosting a close, long term friend?",
      "description": "So this girl was a very close friend of mine all through high school. I genuinly loved and cared about her, I still do. A part of me feels like she did feel the same, but I can’t be sure.\n\nStill, we would argue. A LOT. It would start as something seemingly innocuos, and often would be something that wouldn’t get on our nerves if said or done by anyone else, and would quikly become spitting acid at eachother. \n\n\nI do try to make an effort to not touch any sore spots, even when i’m really angry, but i’m pretty sure I must have sometimes. She clearly either didn’t have the same reservation, or she didn’t pay enoug attention to know what I was most upset or insecure about.  I think she ocasionally found it entertaining to push my buttons in public to make me look bad. :/ she did that on quite a few occassions and I know in those instances, she was the asshole, but how I reacted was wrong too. I’m not sure why my temper was so short with her, when with most people it takes a lot to really piss me off. Same with her; she was so chill and kind with most people. For years we just walked on thin ice around eachother, with both of us being stubborn, passive aggressive and very, VERY opinionated. She would twist my words a little, I would massivly overreact, she’d start crying and that would piss me off even more; sometimes it seemed real and i’d keep pushing too much, sometimes it seemed like she only did it to get attention or to win the argument.\n\nStill, a few things she said to me stuck with me, like how she originall only started being my friend because she felt sorry for me for not having many friends. She was one of the more popular girls, and I was definitly not. This is where i’m wondering if I was the asshole all along. I have a few very close friends, whereas she could pretty much chat with anyone, so clearly most people found her a lot more likeable and charismatic than me. \n\nLittle tiny commets like that and, she would project all of her own insecurities on others.  I was constantly being self consciouss and embarrassed about eveyr little thing; my weight, my skin, just anything. Her mother was very... judgemental, old fashioned, i’m not sure how to say it nicely because she was a lovely, wonderful lady, but she had the idea that her daughter needed to be perfect, beautiful, ect. to get anywhere and I know she had a lot of pressure on her from that. And she was; she was very, VERY pretty compared to me. Her skin was very smooth, her hair didn’t frizz or poof at all, she seemed to be able to eat anything she wanted and never get fat. So yes, I was a teensy bit jealous even though I try to tell myself I don’t care about appearances. Or money, or popularity, or any of that stuff she had more than me of. Looking back, if it was me being jealous that made me so short tempred with her, it’s ridiculous, but it doesn’t explain at all why she was the same with me. IDK, maybe theres something i’m not seeing.  \n\nBasically I FELT like she didn’t really care about me, and I FEEL like I spent more time comforting her, doing favours for her, and trying to help her than she ever did for me.  I FEEL like I was just a background character who she compared herself to to feel better about herself. I FEEL like she could be manipulative sometimes to keep me emotionally reliant on her as a friend, bt that could be me misinterpreting some of what she said/did or remembering things wrong so i’m not going to make any accusations.\n\nStill, I could keep ranting and get very one-sided, so i’m going to finish here with backstory.\n\nAfter we finished school, we both went on to seperate colleges. I made new friends at college and honestly, I felt happier with them that i’d ever felt wth her. It sort of made me realise how unhealthy our friendship had been, so I kinda... just slowed down replying to texts, saw her less and less, kind of on purpose. The straw that broke the camels back per say, was when we were arranging to meet in town. I wanted to meet  few minutes later because I wanted to sleep in; I have trouble sleeping sometimes and at my weekends I like to be lazy. I did want to see her, but I hoped she wouldn’t mind making it a half hour later. As usual, we were going to meet in the place that’s nearer to her house than mine, so I asked to compromise and meet earlier if she could come to the spot a bit closer to mine. No, she was not having it. I’m not quite sure what else was going on for her that day, but she got really pissed and then I got pissed that she was pissed at me and.... you get th point. We ddn’t speak again for nearly 9-10 months, we slowly start to talk to eachother again but there’s tension.\n\nThen one day, she comes to meetme at my college. That seems really sweet at first and I wanted to think she was making th effort to coe there to see me and hang out, and she does want to hang out but she also wants me to do some camera work for her and use my colleges equipment. I sort of laugh it off, I help her a bit, but I want to go home. So I lie and tell her I had to babysit, she asked if i’d finish doing the filming for her tomorrow, I say maybe, I leave, and that’s the last time I ever speak to her again. I just ghost her. I’m not quite sure if it was maybe just fatigue of trying to keep a dead friendship alive, or if I was angry, sad, confused, or just felt a bit used. I overreacted, basically. That day was normal, nothing special, no arguments, nothing. I just sort of felloff the edge and didn’t bother to climb back up. She always thought I was selfish when I didn’t want to do something, and I just didn’t want to hear it, because I knew I would get upset and then get defensive, and so on and on and on...\n\nEVERYONE has flaws, little irritating things they do, but somehow we were just unable to tolerate eachothers. I know, since I care about her I should put some effort in to work past our issues, but thinking back on our time together, it’s 90% arguments, insecurity, tension and frustration. It wasn’t healthy, and I didn’t want to make the effort to keep trying. \n\nWe were 11 when we met, and 17 was when I ghosted. 19 now. I still think about her sometimes, but honestly I get panic attacks when I think about her too much XD Still I check her insta occasionally and she seems to be doing ok.\n\nBe honest; I know I did my fair share of crap, she did too, I wish I could hear her honest side of the story but that conversation would only end in a mountain of salt and papercuts. I’m not brave enough to even make small talk,\n for fears of starting world war 3. I just want to be able to see where I was being shitty, so it never happens again. I never want to feel the way I did with her again, and I never want to say or do anything that could hurt someone I care about, so I want to know if there’s somewhere in this story that i’m not understandng or am misinterpreting or being a shitbag about. \n\n\n**TLDR** After a very close and long, but also very unhealthy and bitter friendship, I ghost her instead of trying to work things out or saying a proper goodbye.",

I just happend to be the closest near him.\n\nAs i walked by i said: sorry, I'm already late and just walked towards school.

      "description": "My boyfriend and I planned a group trip skiing out west with some of his friends and some of mine.  We got a big house and he and I got our own room to share there.  Everyone else was sharing beds also.  \n\nIt was a very social trip - we all cooked dinner together every night and played games.  It was so fun for me because I live alone and have a very small family so even on holidays I don’t get to have big dinners and fun.  We also have small apartments in my city at home so no one has big gatherings.   We split up during the day to ski and I was mostly skiing alone there because I’m only an advance beginner while many of them are either experts or didn’t ski.  I didn’t even go to the same mountain as the three guys except Saturday and we only skiied together for two hours.  That was fine but I liked being with everyone at night.\n\nThe last night was Monday night and we all stayed up till 1;30am except my boyfriend.  He was falling asleep in bed at 10 so I snuggled him to sleep and then went back downstairs to hang out.  He got back up around 12:15 and hung out for another half hour and then went back to sleep.  I had asked him at least three times that day if he packed yet.  I packed at 6pm because I wanted to sleep in and knew I’d be up late.\n\nAnyway all seemed fine until the next morning when I woke up at 6:30 to use the bathroom, came back to bed and he got up because check out was at 10 and the boys were skiing that day so had to be packed and out the door by 8am.  \n\nI went back to sleep but he then turned on all the lights, made the bed with me in it and told me to move to the other side of the bed so he could pack.  He said I probably wouldn’t be able to sleep through him packing.  I put on my noise canceling headphones covered my eyes and attempted to sleep but I could sense he was furious at me and he kept banging his clothes on the bed and even put something on my leg.  \n\nI looked at him and he said “don’t say anything - I don’t want my head bitten off and fight on our last day.”  He looked so mad.  I hadn’t said anything except muttering about everyone having gone to bed very late.  He banged around then finally left and didn’t say goodbye even though I was flying that day and he and his friend were staying at a hotel and not leaving till the next day.\n\nLater I texted “ no goodbye?” And he wrote back “I didn’t want to disturb you and get my head bitten off.”  I tried to figure out what he was talking about but he blocked me. \n\nThen later I emailed and said I didn’t understand why he was mad and that I should be the one annoyed because he was so inconsiderate when packing.  We had a walk in closet basically a little room and he had plenty of room  in there to pack or he could have done it quietly.   But I didn’t complain just put on my headphones and ignored him so I had no idea why he was upset.\n\nThen he emailed a response:  \n\n“I’m not going to tip toe during packing.   I have a mountain of stuff to keep together.  \nI don’t need some person lounging in my space during that.   \n\nI just don’t like people that aren’t morning people.   It’s annoying.  \n\nAlternatively, how nice would the morning have been if you were up with coffee and sitting and speaking to me during this.   That’s what I like.  Quality time.  \n\nNot 2 ships passing in the wind doing their own things.”\n\nAITA for wanting to get more than 5 hours of sleep but also participate in the entire group socializing?  ",

      "description": "Start things off with first post, sorry if I’m doing anything wrong and I’m writing this on my phone.\n\nMy (id like to say ex) best friend’s 18th birthday was last year. I got her tickets to Twenty One Pilots. Not gonna lie, tickets weren’t cheap. $132 AUD each\n\nI thought it would be fun, we could camp out together, get ready and have fun together, ya know what best friends do with each other. Fast forward to her actual birthday when I told her I got her tickets. She was very excited obviously because she loves this band but after that date she talked to me less and less. I just blew it off as school because year 12 was stressful\n\nFast forward again to the concert night. She got there a bit before me because I had exams, work and what not. I thought okay cool I’ll go get my number to wait in line thinking she’d save me a number because I got our tickets, we were gonna go together. Nope. I got there, got a quick hello from my supposed good friend and then she ran off for the rest of the wait (around 18 hours). Not only that but her girlfriend was yelling at me for some stupid not relevant reason so I just left. \n\nMy friend then told me to leave the day of the concert and not be with her because she was with other people and ignored me whenever I tried to talk to her. Ngl not a fun time\n\nFast forward again to my birthday. I have major social issues and I HATE opening presents in front of people and she knows that so I said thanks and put the present next to me. She got REAL upset about that and forced me onto the couch to open it. 2 candles, a fridge magnet and a kangaroo keychain. She got upset when she didn’t see absolute enthusiasm and for the rest of the night her girlfriend was kinda dirty looking me\n\nMy dilemma is that I’ve grown up my entire being thankful for anything I receive. it’s a privilege not an expectation to get a birthday present. And people have told me I’m a stuck up ass for not being thrilled with candles and Australian themed souvenirs(we’re both Australians so really it’s nothing special) it’s eating me up inside not being grateful",

      "title": "AITA for expecting my(18F) best friend&amp;FWB(17M) to hang out with me at a dance?",
      "description": "Alright so some backstory to this is that my school has a yearly winter formal dance and this year I was indecisive on whether I should go or not because 1.) I didn't have an official date and 2.) Only some of my regular friends were going to be there and they were either couples or had dates, so I didn't exactly want to step in on their time together. So my best friend/ friend with benefits (yes its a weird relationship but it was going well at the time), suggested that I should go because he ( Lets call him A) didn't have date either and that I wouldn't be alone during the dance if I went because he would be there. We talked about this for about 3 days before I finally caved and bought a ticket bid because I felt like I wasn't gonna be bored the whole time and have wasted my money. \n\nFast forward to the night of the dance, I got there only to be left behind by said best friend A while he goes and socializes with literally anybody but me. We talked for maybe 5 minutes of a full 4 hours. So, just as I was expecting I was left alone with my other friends who were there as couples, and they tried to make me feel better but ultimately I just felt like shit the whole night.\n\nDespite this I still tried to salvage something of the night by asking if A wanted to hang out after the Dance, since my curfew was basically nonexistent, so we could go back to his house or somewhere and fool around or do anything really. A gets pissed off at me for assuming that he doesn't have plans after the dance and explains that he was going to an after party. I was pissed off but I told him it was fine whatever, and asked if he could merely take me home after since we live in the same neighborhood not 2 minutes away. He agrees and we split ways for awhile.\n\nI finally get some motivation back because of my friends who convince me to dance with them inside the venue, so we go in and dance. Multiple times while I'm inside I make eye contact with A as he is in a different circle of people dancing and talking, I try not to engage in him because i'm still pretty pissed off but I glance once and see him basically groping some other girl. At that point I lose all confidence really and text a different friend that I was upset and she comes and talks to me and I explain what happened. She then lets me know that hes been planning to meet up with this girl that he was groping for awhile(days) before the dance because she talked to A about it.\n\nAt the end of the night A leaves me at the dance without giving me a ride home so I had to find someone else at the last second. He then texts me way later in the night with only \"Sorry if you're pissed at me\". Also turns out he didn't even have plans after the dance. The week after during school he calls me out in the middle of lunch in front of my friends that \"I didnt even go with you as an official date so I dont know what you were expecting.\" \n\nI'm not mad at him because he was with someone else, because we're only FWB and I don't have a problem with that. I'm upset because he convinced me to go to this dance because he would be with me and then left me the entire time for someone else that he was planning on hanging with the entire time. \n\nAITA for assuming that he was gonna hang out with me and talk for at least awhile? Or am I just missing something?  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Here's some context. . . My mom(53) has worked for the last 10yr+ as a school bus driver. She gets weekends off and has early days as well as major holiday vacations. She makes less than $35,000 annually, but hasn't made efforts to find something to help her sustain her residency in LA County. She lives with my aunt atm and pays $600 for a 1br, parking, utilities, internet, and laundry included. Last week my sister and her bf, who have a toddler together, got into it. Their relationship was already hanging on a thread because they just couldn't make things work. Her bf is very irrational and vindictive and my sister is very stubborn and proud. Well, he ended up kicking both her and their son out of their apt.\n\nMy mother invited my sister to stay at my aunts house given the situation and because all happened so fast neither of them reached out to my aunt to ask if it were alright. When my aunt found out she exploded. Gave my sister a month, max. She then blatantly told my mother that she needed to find a new place. My mother constantly had issues with my grandmother, who is also living in my aunts house and being supported by her as well. This always put my aunt in a stressful position as mediator. \n\nWhen I heard the news I was devastated. My husband and I offered to help my family as much as we could. My sister was lucky enough to find a room for rent with a family friend for $500, but my mother has little to no option and is even considering sleeping in her car. My husband and I both asked her to consider moving into a 2br and that she would have to pay $800 and watch our 10 month old when necessary so I could possibly work or go back to school, but she said she couldn't afford it. She then exclaimed that we should give her a discount for watching the baby. \nWhen we couldn't come to an agreement she asked us to compromise and get a 1br so she could sleep in the living room at less than what shes paying at my aunts. Neither of us wants to give up our privacy. \n\nMy husband and I are both in the culinary industry, so living in the city is necessary for us. We make just enough to get by here and in the future if the opportunity presents it self we will relocate to somewhere more inexpensive, but this is our life at the moment and we arent being pushovers. \n\nAITA? \n",

Also the bully is latino male and I am a white/asian mixed male. \n\nSo today while I was walking to my school’s lunch line with a pal, I see one other friend that’s walking with the asshole. I say hello to both of them to be polite, but don’t join their conversation because Im with another friend. \n\nIn the lunch line, while I’m talking to a friend, the ass starts to poke my sides and call me a racist, even though before today I’ve never proven to have been so. I brush it off and keep my head straight; he always pulls this crap. Maybe a minute passes and he starts opening my zippers, going through my backpack, and yanks me backwards a bit. In response, I turn around, push him backwards, and while I was zipping my stuff back up, I called him “beaner” and an “illegal bastard that should go back to his country.” \n\nHe looked at me a little funny, but didn’t bother me for the rest of lunch, like he’d typically do, whether it’s throwing food at me or calling me antisemetic or other racist things.\n\nIn that moment, it felt good to finally tell him off, because the only way to get in his thick skull is to get semi-physical and in his face. But at the same time, only a little while afterwards, I felt disgusted by myself that I called him those things, and as if I’m as bad as him.\n\nA small part of me wants to apologize, but I feel that would show weakness and he’d go back to being an ass. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So this happened Saturday I left with a few buddies to go enjoy the day and work on my car. My gf who has lived with me for the last 5 years just up and took everything she owned and some of my stuff and the dog we had gotten together a year or so ago. \n\nNow hear is the juicy part we had broken up 2 summers ago and got back together around christmas '17 and that spring I found the dog running down the side of the highway so i saved her. Went to the pound and shelters asked if it was microchipped and posted flyers. Nobody wanted her so I decided to try and let my gf take care of her. She got a banfield puppy plan (kinda like dog insurance at petsmart) and I have 2 other big dogs I already have a plan with. A few months after we get the dog I found out she had been talking to this guy behind my back and called her out on it. She says he was just a friend...\n\nI decided on Sunday that since she took he dog and everything that I would do some research into the situation. Contacted the police in my state possession is 9/10 the law when it comes to animals. So come Monday I knew she had to work and I knew where this cock sucker evan she supposedly is only friends with lives and I see her car there. I go knock on the door the roommate opens the door and gypsy (my dog) comes running out the door and jumps in my arms. Roommate doesnt know me or anything I tell him the story said I'm just gonna have a play date with gypsy and my 2 dogs all about the same age all german shephard. \n\nThe house she moved into is on a quarter of an acre barely a back yard. My home is on 4 acres completely fenced in has a dog house that is temperature controlled and everything. And she knows I have the dog yet she wont even contact me. Instead she has tried to get my father involved in the bs. He doesnt care about who gets the dog btw.\n\nSo am I the asshole here for getting my dog back because she doesn't deserve her and never took care of her. ",

      "description": "Some background; I live in a house with 3 other roommates, Maria, her adult daughter, Marta, and her teenage son Carlos. (names have been changed) We have 2 bathrooms in our house, Maria’s bathroom in the master bedroom, and the communal bathroom in the hall. Now, I know Maria has nothing to do with this bc her bathroom is always spotless and smelling like a normal goddamn bathroom instead of The Bubonic Plague. \n\nHowever, our bathroom is a very different story. Her kids both promised me when I first came here that keeping the bathroom clean would be our shared responsibility, but in these past 5 and a half months, all they’ve managed to do is fuck it up as soon as I finish cleaning it. They don’t wash their hands, there’s always so much hair on the toilet seat and the sink, it’s looks like they shave their pubes over the bowl, the shower is covered in layers of grime I can’t wash out no matter how I try, when I use the toilet, there’s a 50/50 chance I’ll find a POOP SMEAR on the seat, they throw their USED TOILET PAPER in the TRASH instead of in the FUCKING TOILET, Hell, sometimes they can’t even be bothered to AIM AT THE CAN and just THROW IT ON THE FLOOR. \n\nIt’s disgusting, absolutely disgusting. I have to hover over the toilet seat instead of sitting down. Every time I’m in there I feel like I’m catching an STD. I can’t enjoy long showers anymore, I hate it. I sat down a little while ago and talked about it with the youngest, Carlos, and to his credit, he has gotten way better about keeping his mess clean, but he still refuses to clean anything in the bathroom and I can’t say I blame him bc it’s still a mess. Marta is by far the biggest offender. It’s just the 2 of us at home today, so I grit my teeth and up in there. Like clockwork, within the hour there was unflushed poop in the toilet, tp in the trash and on the floor and pubes everywhere. I’m starting to really dread every time I have to go to the bathroom bc I hate that part of the house. And, I have a strong suspicion that Marta and Carlos blame the mess in there on me in front of Maria bc every time I try to get them to help me clean the bathroom she yells at me for being lazy.  I would’ve already asked her to switch chores, but, other than this one (really gross) thing, Marta is really nice and generally a good person, and pretty much my only irl friend right now, and her and her mom already fight a lot and I don’t want this to be another thing that Maria uses to attack her with. (Maria is generally not such a good person. I’d More-so characterize her as the antagonist older sister in an 80’s, coming of age rom com, stuck in the body of a balding, stumpy, bitter, 49 year old woman.) \n\nWIBTA if I refused to clean the bathroom and asked for another chore instead? At least, until they start to clean up their shit? Idk, I’ve never dealt with this level of unhygienic behavior before and I’m not really sure how to approach the situation.",

      "description": "Throwaway because reddit.\n\nSome background: I have voluntarily for the past 5 years designed a massive sports club website from scratch. This website has the usual site promoting the club but also a database managing members details, attendances and all aspects of the running of the club. Prior to me doing this it was all on paper. Legally we're obliged to keep records for many years. I used to be on the committee but left to just be a regular member when I started full time work. I carried on maintaining the site and making changes as needed by the club. \n\nLast week I received an email from a committee saying my services had been voted out by the committee. No discussion, no forewarning, no formal thanks, no explanation. I was informed separately that several other committee members wanted in on the action. The decision was ratified at a meeting of club members I was conveniently not informed of or invited to. I am still a member.\n\nI have been losing sleep over this, I've lost a huge project that I really enjoyed. \n\nFollowing this I published an open letter, addressed to the committee, sent to the entire membership explaining exactly what had happened. It was completely polite and factual without any of the anger I was feeling (confirmed by several independent people before sending). I immediately recieved multiple emails back from the committee saying that it had been a democratic decision, it wasn't personal and that my letter was unprofessional and unnecessary. I have been threatened with several courses of action for bringing the club and its committee members into disrepute. These threats can swivel as they have no grounds on which to give me any kind of penalty or action. \n\nTldr; got sacked out of the blue in suspicious circumstances from a voluntary role I'd poured my soul into for years. Wrote an open letter to the membership outlining the treatment of a fellow member by the committee and now I'm being told I'm an asshole. AITA?",

      "description": "Hi, so I'm about to graduate college with a degree in Computer Science. My uncle is very aware of this, so during Christmas time he hinted to me in a jokingly fashion that I should make a program for him for some type of price tracking so he can use it to enhance his chances to make a profit off of the stock market I assume. He then said I would end up getting a % of the profits he made if he made it and that is all really. I brushed it off and carried on after that.\n\nEarlier last week he called my mother, possibly knowing that was probably his best way to get me to go to his house and for him to pitch his idea. My mom told me to call him, and I did. It all began with him saying hello, followed by saying \"Mr. Computer Science smart guy\". He then followed by asking me to show up his house and take a look at a something on his computer. I asked him what he wanted me to do, and he was like \"it shouldn't be a problem for you, you are a smart guy who is about to graduate.. if you don't know you probably will figure it out with that Computer Science brain\". At that point I was really didn't like how vague he was being and said i'll think about it. \n\nAfter I said that, he really didn't accept what I said and was like \"Alright, I'll let you go\" but then told me to text him something along the lines of \"hey, it is me and as we discussed on the phone I'll come over and help you\". Which I didn't like at all, I felt like he was trying to get some type of written confirmation on me so he could use it somehow against me(not sure if that is how it even works). After I hung up, that part of asking me to text him that just angered me and I straight up told my mother I wasn't going to do it because I didn't really want to do it and midterms are coming up, and I have my own programming assignments I have to do. I was told that basically I am an asshole for not wanting to help family, and that he is my \"Godfather\" and that I should always help family because they're blood. I stood firm with my decision, but now I am being scolded. I'm wondering if I really am the asshole in this case because I wouldn't go to his house and do what he wanted me to do because he wasn't upfront, and probably use the other family members to pressure me  to work on this project he hunted at since Christmas for me to do to only be commissioned if it made him profit.\n\nAm I really the asshole because I didn't want to do this? I don't really know how big of a job it would have been because of how vague he was being, but I feel like I should stand my ground so people know I won't just drop everything just to work on their next idea.\n\nTldr:? More info I guess: \n\nUncle wanted me to come to his house to \"help him with something on the computer\" I asked what the problem is and he basically answered vaguely saying that my computer science skills is needed then asked me to text him something very specific saying I would help. I didn't text him that and said I did not want to do it.",

      "description": "So my very best friend (let’s call her Katie) who I spend every minute of every day with is currently at Basic Training for the Army National Guard. Before she left, she told me to keep up with her boyfriend (let’s call him Nathan) because she was worried he would feel lonely w/o her or cheat on her, either way, I should keep watch. I wasn’t friends with Nathan before this, but I also did not despise him either. They support each other so I support their relationship.\nLately, he had been texting me constantly, at least once a day, saying how much he missed Katie and how he just felt like he had no friends w/o her here too. I invited him to hang out with my friends (also Katie’s friends) and I, just casually at first, but then specifically to stuff that we would be doing so he wouldn’t have to “mope around his empty apartment” as he put it. He would always respond, “I will get back to you on that.” and respond to it really late at night saying “Sorry I missed it”. His latest response to hanging out with us was, “Well, I am never really free on the weekdays. Or the weekends. But I will let you know.” Its gotten really annoying so that when Nathan texts me that he misses Katie, I ignore it or leave short responses.\nBasically, me and my other friend decided last minute that we are going to see her graduation in two days. Its a 7 &amp; 1/2 hour drive. It was brought to my attention that I should invite Nathan to see her, but at this point, I really do not want to. He did not want to spend time with us originally, so I just feel like an almost 8 hour drive would be miserable if he came along. Would I be the asshole if I didn’t? ",

We started the lovey-dovey talks after a few days, it was really intense. She has severe anxiety issues and is truly childish, when she's pissed she'll be like a teenager and say \" pff, you don't get me \" to pretty much anyone that is right when arguing with her, she's stressed all the time, cries a lot ( everyday actually ), sometimes for really silly stuff. She wants to stay in our medium sized city forever, she doesn't like change at all, she likes comfort. I'm the opposite, but I thought I could handle not moving forever, and went along with it, making plans with her about a house, a car, pets etc.. ( I feel stupid for thinking about that this early.. ) and I told her we would stay together forever ( she said that too, and still does now ) etc.. I'm starting to regret it now ( first, I'm never that cheesy ) and I'm starting to realise after a few months that it won't work.\n\nI won't be happy staying in the same city forever, I don't like our culture, our cities, the way we behave etc.. I need change all the time, I need to travel a lot, to move a lot. We're not compatible at all, we're way too different. We talk a lot and have a lot of fun, but we're fundamentally different, and it's not gonna work. So far you're probably not getting why I feel like an asshole, I'm just a guy who wants to breakup for normal break up reasons.\n\nThe thing is, she's always been really generous with me, she bought me a lot of expensive clothes despite her 250€/month student scholarship, she's always making sure I've got everything I need, she's really sweet, and truly nice, which is why I feel like an asshole, that and the fact that I always told her that I don't mind staying here forever ( until a month ago when I stopped saying these things ). I feel like she'll think I'm \" thanking \" her for being nice by breaking up with her. Plus she's in her exams period, so she's even more stressed, breaking up will crush her since she's not expecting it. \n\nI'm planning to break up next Thursday right after work ( I work from home on Thursdays ), so she'll have the evening to come pick up her stuff with her mom and her sister, I'll go get a beer since I don't want to meet her family. \n\nAITA in this ?

      "description": "I was friends with this girl all throughout college, and we shared a friend group. Late in college, I noticed she had seemed to slight me in particular, shutting me down when I offered advice, not responding to friendly messages, and being resistant to making plans to hang out. I reached out to her via email over the summer, and she provided a thorough explanation of why she had been acting that way. She apologized and expressed she did value our friendship. \nSenior spring she began hanging with a couple of my roommates and her attitude towards me seemed to shift again, and there was an odd, exclusive/secretive dynamic going on between her and my roommates.\nAfter graduation, I met up with this friend once and we chatted. She had plans to travel in the fall and seemed excited.\nAfter that, she made excuses to not hang out, and eventually didn’t respond to my messages. She stopped liking my posts on social media, and one of my old roommates (who was close friends with her) unfollowed and unfriended me out of the blue. \nAt a friend gathering late in the summer, she ignored me when I greeted her. I reached out with another long message in the fall, which was ignored, and I then sent a letter to her in the mail, which was also ignored. At a friend gathering back at our college to see a show, she avoided me the whole night (to be fair, I definitely wasn’t trying to connect with her by this point, as I felt extremely hurt and awkward that she ignored my messages for so long). \nAfter the gathering, I reached out once more and stated that whatever her frustrations with me were, it wasn’t fair for it to impact our friend group and our ability to all hangout together (as my friends intentionally split off with each of us to avoid any awkwardness). She responded after a couple days and said that I was exhausting, it was stressful to be friends with me, I made her feel like she was under a microscope, she didn’t want to be friends anymore, and she felt like things could never go back to normal. She expressed that there was nothing positive in our friendship and she felt there wasn’t anything worth saving. She then said we could discuss it if I wanted but she didn’t care either way, and also said she felt she should respond instead of ghosting me. I did not respond until a month later, when I inquired about if she was willing to meet to have an in-person conversation about things, and if not, I would be around if she ever did want to talk. \nShe then blocked me on social media, and when I liked her ex-boyfriend’s post, he blocked me too. I realize that maybe I pushed too much, but I also feel like her major lack of communication and passive-aggressiveness made it really hard for me to know what was going on. I feel like I wouldn’t have kept noticing little things if there wasn’t anything to notice. None of my friends really know why she had such a problem with me specifically. I’m just a loss and feel sad that she feels we had nothing worth repairing. \n\n",

I recently-ish came out to a handful of people, including my mom, and thankfully everyone’s been pretty understanding and supportive so far. However, I’m not able to socially transition yet and I won’t be for a few months, as I currently live with some relatives who would be less than pleased if they found out. Anyway, I recently asked my mom to stop referring to me using female terms/pronouns because she’s a bit absentminded and I think that if she kept calling me “her” in private and “him” in public she’d inevitably slip up and out me as trans to someone I’m not out to.\n\nI thought I was being reasonable- just calling me “him” for the time being seems far easier than the alternative, and I thought it was a realistic concern- but she was hurt.

We'll name them Zack and Julia, respectively. For some background info, Zack really didn't like Emma and Julia was cool with her. Emma also *really* likes Disney. This is pretty long so TL;DR at the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't remember how the topic came up, but we started talking about Disney World. Julia was the only one who had never been there, so I told her what it was like.  I talked about how you could wait in lines to meet the characters. Then I said, \"Oh, but I hate doing that. What's the point of waiting hours to meet people in costumes?\" Emma suddenly said, \"What do you mean? They're not in costumes! Those are the real characters!\" We all got pretty confused, and I thought she was joking at first. Zack, who I'm guessing thought she was joking too, laughed and said that they were obviously people in costumes. Emma seemed to get really angry after that. Julia explained calmly, \"Emma, you *do* realize that those aren't actually Mickey and stuff... right?\" Everyone but Emma agrees and she starts getting really riled up now. She rants to us that just because we don't believe in that stuff, doesn't mean we should say that its fake. I got pretty pissed at that point and told her, \"How would a mouse from a cartoon even come to life anyway?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe stopped talking to us after I said that, so Zack, Julia, and I got on to the topic of all the fake characters we were lied to, like Santa, the Easter Bunny, etc. and Emma overheard us and got even *more* pissed. She stilled believed in all those things and she was angry that we would say that stuff. We told her that these characters were fake as well, which was a mistake. She claims that we 'do this all the time to her' (which I'm pretty sure we did not, maybe Zack sometimes but not everyone) and that she was going to text her mother that we were bullying her. I had had enough of her at that point and just stopped talking to her. We're on good terms now, and I don't talk about fake characters being real or not, but I feel like I might've been TA for bringing it up at all.  \n\n\nTL;DR - Friend gets mad that my other friends and I told her a bunch of fictional characters are fake, she gets mad and yells at us, I tell her off a bit, she threatens to tell her mom on us.  \n\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Alcohol is a big issue for me in our relationship. She's currently studying for her masters and go for occasional drinking with her classmates. It made me uncomfortable because she never introduced me to those classmates and she got really tipsy a few times going home, at very late hours. This made me upset quite a lot because I feared for her safety. This went on for some time but it didn't really became a friction point until a few weeks ago.\n\nThis was when I invited her to a friend's party and boy did she get dead drunk. I was bombed myself but not to the point where I don't know what I was doing. She lost consciousness and vomited, with some of my friends who were not introduced to her yet at the receiving end.\n\nI and a number of colleagues took care of her until she became well. She said sorry and said she would never want tequila from that point forward. Needless to say, a number of my friends did not have a good impression of her that night.\n\nNow, she went off a with her MBA colleagues for a beach trip overnight. I was confident she won't even touch any hard drinks because of what happened previously (she said she was also scared for her health) although I did honestly expect some drinking to happen.\n\nShe said that indeed there will be some drinking but it will be casual and light. \n\nHowever about an hour later, she comes back to me that her classmates are already beyond tipsy territory, but she's still okay. I was caught off guard because I expected only light drinking but they were having the very thing she swore off - tequila. I was completely dissapointed.\n\nI told her that I was not comfortable with her being in the company of drunk people. She said she's taken in some shots and pretending to be drunk so she won't be given more. I told her I was not happy being led to believe that 1) she was going for a light drinking bout and 2) she said she's never going to have the aforementioned hard drink since the last incident.\n\nI was clearly upset and when we got to a call together, she was lashing out at me for being a killjoy. She says I'm forgetting the fact that she did not get drunk, despite everything. I did tell her that she could have refused, and that I was misled by the whole \"light drinking\" alibi.\n\nFinally she said it was her life and I was a control freak, while I was just looking for real answers why she got herself in that situation and why I was misled.\n\nReddit, AITA?\n",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago but I still think on it time to time as an instance where I totally misread a situation. Backstory: My neighbor and I became friends, know each other about a year at this point. Been over to his house quite a bit, have house sat/watched his cats for a day or two on occasion. One time, he told me they were going to be gone for a week and asked to house sit/watch the kitties. He told me that I would have the run of the house while they were gone, fridge/snack privileges, playing their games, stay the night, etc. I wasn't really planning to take full advantage, maybe eat a granola bar, have a little ice cream (they stocked my favorite) but I like my own place so I wouldn't be staying the night.\n\nFast forward a month or so and he asks me to cat sit for half a week, sure no prob bob. After I feed the cats, I peek in the freezer and see a box of tasty reese's ice cream bars so I help myself to one. I texted him to let him know that the cats were okay and that I partook in a tasty treat. He texts me back immediately saying that \"it's weird that you thought it was okay to just eat our food like that\" after explaining that I thought the previous stays carte blanche rules were still in effect he keeps texting me saying that it wasn't cool and that he was saving those for a special occasion. Totally get it, had no clue, offered to pay for a whole new box or at least to replace the one I had consumed. He declined my offer and reiterated how it wasn't cool. And that was that. I was never asked to come over, watch his cats or really talked to me again after that. \n\nI absolutely understand if he was saving them for something, I didn't place value in something so easily replaced that's on me. But was it wrong to think that I would still have house privileges from the previous watch? Or was I being naïve and overstepped my guest rights? AITA? Thank you for weighing in.",

His death wasn’t a surprise (he was very ill for quite some time) so he was able to draft a will well in advance of his passing. \n\nHe and my older sister got into a big disagreement before he died and he ended up writing her out of the will. \n\nThe biggest issue was that my dad didn’t approve of my sister’s marriage (which required her to convert). I don’t want to say which religion it is. I’ll just say that there are very different cultures and value systems at play and my father was concerned. Personally, I’ve just come to terms with the fact that it’s her life, and she’s going to do what she wants. But my dad had a much harder time with it and, as a result, she didn’t get any of the money. \n\nSo now she’s come to me basically asking if I plan to give her anything. I really don’t know what to think. I feel my dad had his wishes laid out in the will and they were executed as he wanted. Secondly, although I haven’t disowned my sister or anything, I can’t say we are as close as we were before she got married. It’s been difficult because her husband doesn’t get along with our mother and I’ve felt that I have to side with my mom out of a sense of loyalty. \n\nOn the other hand, I do love my sister. And it saddens me that she’s become isolated from our family. But I don’t feel that I’m the cause of it...\n\nAnyway, that’s the situation. So do you all think it would it be terrible of me not to give my sister money?\n ",

      "description": "This story is long, but I need to get it off my chest and know if I am looking at this all wrong. I am a 2nd year university student involved in a fairly tight-knit nonprofit oriented club. As has happened many times before, I was in a friend's room Thursday night playing a few drinking games and generally just hanging out, with people leaving one by one until me and my friend (we will call her Angie) were left. She's been one of my closest friends here, someone that I trusted with a great deal, and I think at least until Thursday she would have said the same.   \n\n\nWe were both drunk and had been having a rough week, so we were just lying on the floor until the next thing I know, she's rolled on top of me and we're making out. She initiated but I reciprocated, and I absolutely could have handled it better, though to be frank, I don't think distributing the blame is a worthwhile exercise. Shortly after we began, she started freaking out that she had ruined our friendship and group of friends, and the next couple minutes were a surreal blur of watching her alternate between hyperventilating and jumping me. Eventually, I texted a mutual friend and confidant of hers to come over and help her, and left, because I did not think I was helping.   \n\n\nI tried to talk to her the next afternoon-I figured it would be awkward, or difficult, but we could laugh it off eventually and move on, and if she had some unexpressed feelings or something that had led to the previous night, that we could air it all out. Instead, she told me explicitly and unambiguously that she never wanted to see or talk to me again. In the time since, she has alternated day to day between wanting to meet and talk but always backing out, and going back to radio silence. This has strained a variety of mutual friendships and relationships, and it is getting worse with everyday. I am trying to give her space and time, and to respect her feelings, but I don't view the silence as productive.    \n\n\nI want nothing more than to try and mend my relationship with my best friend, but I know that from her perspective, I have betrayed her trust and hurt her deeply. My question is: Am I the asshole for thinking that to some extent she is overreacting? It was a brief mistake that we both made, and I can't believe that she is ready to throw away a valued friendship over it--while to some degree the motives are undoubtedly selfish, is it so bad to want to just talk and try to move forward?",

My friends encouraged me to talk to this girl. I've heard about her as we have a few mutual friends. ( let's call her Kaitlyn ) I saw her and let's just say I was interested.\n\nI approached her and tried to talk to her and the conversation went like this.\n\nMe:hey wh.. ( she interrupts me)\n\nKaitlyn: EW GROSS \n\nMe: what?\n\nKaitlyn: go away creep.\n\nI think she began to shit talk me because people started giving me the stink eye and some big burly guy began threatening me so I decided to leave.\n\nI would say six or so months ago I decided to change my a style bit I got a new haircut, new glasses and did some lifting. My friends say I look amazing and I agree. After the transformation there's people who still don't recognize me.\n\nSo yesterday I got a message on facebook from Kaitlyn she wanted to talk over coffee. I just ignore her. Later that day a mutual friend told me Kaitlyn really wants to go out on a date with me. I told my friend I didn't want to go out with Kaitlyn as I am no longer attracted to her. My friend told me that I'm obligated to at least go out on one date with her as I was previously attracted to her.\n\nKaitlyn messaged me and called me an asshole. A few of our mutual friends are calling me the asshole. Some of them are saying I'm obligated to at least go on a date with her. So AITA",

      "description": "This is just today and i know this is a little petty. I just feel a little guilty and was wondering. \n\nMy dad and I, while we both were unemployed, would walk the dogs every morning a long morning walk then a shorter afternoon walk. The morning one is not quite an hour and the afternoon thirty minutes. \n\nI began working about a week and a half ago. Long eight hour shift, on my feet in steel toed boots, where I also bus an hour and eleven minutes there. To get a reasonable amount of sleep I take an Uber back. \n\nI was taking a shower and when I stepped out my Dad asked \"oh taking a shower before the walk?\" And I commented \" I'm still adjusting, don't you remember?\"\n\nThe truth is I had said I'd eventually return to doing the walks. However... I had not said it yet. I had been doing the weekends but never said I'd do the weekday walk yet. \n\nHis \"okay\" was so down I felt really bad. Particularly since my whole social life is my computer and I've been so tired I haven't even had the energy to do my chores outside the weekend. So it occurred to me i haven't spent as much time with my parents besides lunch for the past week. \n\nOn top of that. My dad has major depression and we're very close generally. So I feel really bad when I bummed him out there. I plan to offer to go tomorrow. \n\nBut AITA for rejecting the walk initially?",

      "description": "Context, just finished year twelve with my partner of a few years, and went on a trip to Europe to celebrate. They are French, so we were going to visit their grandparents in Brest and Paris, before going to London, Berlin and Rome. I'm am Aussie so I was freaking out as it is so far away and so much colder than we get here, in addition to spending six weeks alone with them. \nSo first 10 days we spent in France, with their family, all lovely people but spoke about as much English as I speak French. So around the table I spent a lot of time twiddling my thumbs, with the odd translation. It was nice but eventually got quite frustrating. \nNot wanting to be disrespectful and not having come around the world for nothing, I threw myself at the opportunity to try the weird cheeses and drink wine for brekkie. We couldn't go out because my SOs sister and brother in law both worked late, so we had to look after their toddler, which was, you know,  fine, but not really what I'd hoped or expected to be doing for the first week of the trip. \nA week and a bit later we arrived in London,  and I was beyond excited to be able to go out and understand people and try proper British food, so night one we decided to go to a pub around the corner. On the walk my SO said \"oh can we go to that Italian place?\"\nI pointed out that we are actually going to Italy so we might as well wait until then to load up on pasta. At this she became withdrawn and a little prickly, but i thought it would pass. \nIt should be mentioned that they like to think they are a little more cultured than I am. They live in a slightly wealthier area of Melbourne and whatnot, so dont usually go in for pub food. But I figured this would be waved given that we were in the home of fish and chips. \nHow wrong I was, they refused to order anything despite earlier declaring their hunger. That really rubbed me the wrong way, that they weren't willing to step outside the comfort zone, after I'd done nothing but for 10 days. Upon pointing this out, they became angry and told me that we'd done nothing but what I want so far. And at that I absolutely fumed, I unloaded. I told them that what I wanted to do wasn't sit silently listening to their family speak French and then look after a fucking toddler. Not loud enough to make a scene but there were a few strange looks. They called me a cunt and stormed out. \nI could've definitely handled it better but everytime it comes up they insist I was an asshole, so, was I? ",

She always seems to be nice, but kinda fake nice, like she's just tolerating me because my dad married her daughter. K and i have a great relationship, no issues to date (abiut 11 and half years.) A few years back, the thing that really got me riled up, was that she invited everyone except me to go to Hawaii. They never did end up going, but she said they would go, and that she would pay for the whole thing. I wasn't even on the invite list, but I was asked if, when they did go, i could come feed and water the five dogs that would be left behind. I wouldn't have been able to go anyways, due to work and money concerns at the time, but the invite would've been nice. My dad was super pissed about this, because he believes very strongly in family ties, and that family, all family, is important and should be respected. After this incident, I've kept little to no contact with K's mom. \n\n**The issue**\n\nI'm now engaged, and the wedding is in June of 2019.

Didn't talk, because I broke her heart and whenever I'd see her... Well her expression of pain was always difficult to bear. Maybe 5 months after the breakup I reached out to her to discuss plans with mutual friends, and she said she wasn't ready to see me. I've been living out of state since then, and am moving back in a few weeks, to go to school and work for the summer. I want to reach out, in another month, once I'm home. It will have been a year. I'm thinking of writing her a letter. We haven't communicated at all, but we have mutual friends. I don't know what exactly I'm looking for, I guess to see if she's moved on, and is living her life well. There were very good reasons for ending the relationship, but she was still my best friend for a few years, and she will always mean a lot to me. I'm not trying to rekindle anything, I just don't want to keep all those looks of pain from across the street as my most recent memories of someone who was very important to my life. At the same time, I know contact with me will cause her pain and stress, and I'm worried about that. I think a letter would offer some insulation from that, but I don't know whether my desire for some closure outweighs the pain I know I'll cause.",

The most concerning issue to me is that we've been getting water in part of the basement when it rains. I'm super frustrated because the landlord doesn't return most of my emails and so I called a hotline that's run by a local organization to explain your tenant rights. They suggest writing a letter citing the law which says the landlord has 14 days to fix the issue or the lease is terminated and we have 30 days to move out. They even gave me a template which I showed my roommate. They also suggested requesting asking the city to do an inspection. \n\nHere's where it gets uncomfortable. A few weeks ago I asked the landlord if he'd let us out of the lease early given the situation as I have another housing opportunity. My roommate was good with leaving early as well but the landlord said no. Now that I got advice about sending a formal letter and starting the process of terminating the lease due to the landlords neglect to fix the issues, my roommate said he feels like this is a personal issue between me and the landlord. My roommates doesn't want to do anything to pressure the landlord and I guess thinks I'm just doing this to get out of the lease early. I am moving out early regardless of what happens so it’s true I’d rather not pay for the last months rent. My roommate just wants to stay at the apartment through the end of the lease and live with the issues we've been having. It's obvious I think they're more serious issues than they do. \n\nSo am I being an asshole for pressuring the landlord to fix these things or let us out of the lease despite my roommate's preference not to take action?

      "description": "This happened a few years back when I was fresh out of high school and was half way through my second semester of college. My grandfather was very old and suffered from a multitude of health problems, everyone in the family knew he didn’t have much time left so they tried to visit him as much as possible. I tried to do the same but couldn’t very offer due to my heavy school and work schedule and him living six hours away. \n\nAt this time I was suffering from severe depression bordering on suicidal. My then girlfriend at the time broke things off to pursue a much more attractive man as well as near this same time one of my childhood friends had just killed himself. Safe to say with everything going on I was not doing well. \n\nSo when i got the news that my grandfather has passed I was crushed. I had a great relationship with him since I was little and on Christmas he would always buy me a baseball cap with something funny, in that cheesy grandpa humor kind of way. My father told me the date of the funeral and to be there. \n\nI made up an excuse that I was busy, I don’t know why I lied but at the time I didn’t want to say that I couldn’t handle anymore in my life. \n\nMy father was furious and called me a terrible person. I get terrible but I still didn’t go. Cut to afterwards. I was uninvited from all extended family get togethers as well as being ignored or pushed away whenever I made contact. At one point when I was home my dad had been drinking and called me a terrible son that never loved my grandfather. \n\nIt’s been a few years now and things are slowly getting back to normal but this has been eating at me for a long time whether or not I was in the wrong.

      "description": "I saw the story about the guy who cares for his sister and thought maybe this would be a good place to vent/get opinions\nTLDR at the end\n(Let me preface this with if my family should find this, turn back now. You already know, and making a scene because I told strangers won’t change anything.)\nA little backstory: my brother (let’s call him A) is mentally a three year old. Physically he’s racing towards his 20’s and in an extended state of puberty.\nThe doctors said he would die in infancy, and every day is a miracle in my house. But every day for me starts at four thirty, turning on the baby monitor to listen for A, because he drools a lot and can choke on it. And often does. I’m usually able to get back to sleep, but waking up many times during the night to make sure someone helps him and hearing the noises he makes from so early gets pretty tiring. So from the start I’m pretty irritable. I’d like to mention real quick that he was born when I was pretty little, so I’ve been dealing with this pretty well my entire life. I’m his official caretaker now. ranges from smiling like the sun to digging his nails in and aiming for the face because of I couldn’t make his parents come home early. He needs special feedings every two hours, along with diaper changes. (As he’s a big kid and is actually pretty hairy, liquid poop is the worst part of my day) Not to mention he hates it, i would hate it if it was me. He has to be attended to 24/7 and we can’t go anywhere without him. \nHe drools constantly and likes to spread it around, and shrieks when he’s excited. When he’s mad he screams like he’s being murdered, needless to say it gets a lot of looks. When we do manage to get out, he has to have a long list of things that I hate dealing with. He’s been so spoiled over the years because my parents fear he could die any day now, and they tell me I have to let him get away with anything for that reason. \nHe dominates my life, I’m in my 20’s and living at home because a professional cna won’t do what I do. I live rent free for my service, with a weekly allowance, (and bought most things that I ask for within reason) and my parents insist to anyone who asks what I do for a living that I’m a babysitter or unemployed. My brother is the first thing I see in the morning and I have nightmares about him every night almost always consisting of me killing him. I feel like an awful person, and if I try to quit I’ll be homeless and he will have no one to care for him. \nLately I’ve been snippy, sometimes downright rude about it. I hate taking care of him, and his terrible attitude makes me wish the day we all fear would come already.\n\nTLDR: my brother was born able to do nothing for himself, and there’s nothing else to do, but I hate taking care of him. Parents treat me like I’m 13 and pay me the same way. I dream about and often wish he would pass.",

      "description": "Little backstory, I was recently at an autograph signing for a sports team. There were many booths set up that had different players scattered around the mall. I went with my bestfriend &amp; boyfriend but we all wanted to see different players so we split up. \n\nI managed to find my line no problem and settled in for a long wait. A lady &amp; who I assume was her granddaughter were behind me for the wait as well. \n\nI suddenly felt a strong tap on my shoulder, so I turned around to see what was needed. The lady told me to tell some people way ahead of us in the line to move up because they were too spaced out. I obliged by waving down one of the many security guards that were around and explained the problem that the lady behind me was having, &amp; it was taken care of. We moved uo about a foot. Cool. I turned my attention back to my phone &amp; continued waiting. \n\nNot even a minute later, another tap. I again turn around, &amp; this time she is upset that it looks like a woman cut in line. I repeat the same process of waving down a security guard, explaining the problem, &amp; turning my attention back to my phone. \n\nI'm sure you can guess by now that a short wait later, another tap was bestowed upon my shoulder. I turned around again. She explained to me that she found it unfair that there were no posed photos allowed &amp; I needed to find someone to explain to her why they werent allowed. I finally said \"You do realize I'm not in charge of this event right? I'm here waiting just like you. If you want, I can flag down a security guard &amp; you can talk to them if you'd like? I honestly don't know why posed photo's aren't allowed.\" \n\nHer response? \"WOW YOU DIDNT HAVE TO BE SO RUDE. WHAT A NICE CITY WE LIVE IN HEY UNBELIEVEABLE. I DIDNT REALIZE I COULDN'T ASK PEOPLE QUESTIONS AROUND HERE.\" Loud enough that everyone near us in line turned to look at her, and then looked at me as if I did something awful. I sheepishly went back to looking at my phone for the next hour &amp; a half while she muttered under her breath about respecting your elders &amp; a bunch of other shit. \n\nI was honestly shell shocked. I mean, I'm all for helping people &amp; going out of my way when needed but this lady was FULLY capable of flagging down the guards for all of her concerns, yet felt the need to get me to do it? I was never rude, I just explained to her that I literally have nothing to do with how the event is run. \n\nAITA here? It's been bothering me all night.   ",

(my grandmother is also extremely controlling and hardly lets me leave the house. i know she shouldn’t have this power over me and my mother, but she has always been this way, and she is the only one in the house with a license, so she exercises more power than she should over us.)\n\ni know they will be able to find a new apartment, should it come to that. i know my grandmother should find a place for herself, or be committed to a retirement home. i know my mother and brother should be in therapy. but, i can’t enact all of that myself. i feel so selfish trying to leave this situation. if something happened to them that i could have prevented, i wouldn’t be able to live with myself. though i want to be able to live with normal parents, and eat enough to put on more weight and take care of myself. \n\nAITA if i move out while things are the way they are?

      "description": "So during secondary (aka middle) school i was best friends with a girl we’ll call L. We had been friends for like 5 ish years and did literally everything together, never have i experienced a friendship so strong and id say she gave me my first experience of love outside my family. I cant really explain how close we were but we did everything together and we were like 2 peas in a pod. \nAfter we finished secondary school me and L both went to college however me and L both had different lessons completely and only got to see each other once a day, over the course of the year we began to drift apart and both began making new friends while still talking fairly often. \nOne day we were messaging about all the shit we used to get up to together and i said something along the lines of “hey do you wanna make more effort to see each other more.” Since like i said we had drifted a lot. She basically said she wasnt  bothered and that she is always too busy and that people do just drift apart. This did kinda annoy/upset me since someone i would have considered my best mate just told me they didnt value our friendship anymore. However you cant force someone to be friends with you so i just kinda moved on while stopping making effort with her, only speaking to her if she spoke to me or only messaging her if she messaged me, not ignoring her but not bothering with this apparently dead friendship. \nA few weeks later L messaged me basically getting upset i was ‘ignoring her.’ I just told her she was being backwards and she cant tell me that she doesnt care about our friendship only to get annoyed when i stop giving her attention. Her response was that she didnt care about our friendship but she doesnt want to be ignored, this is what really tipped me over the edge and i told her to sort herself out and to come back once she realises how backwards what she said was coz im not engaging in a one way friendship that only serves to give you attention. L continued to make awkward small talk but I just ignored her after this point expecting us to sit down and have a proper chat at some point but we never did. \nAbout a year later me and L dont really talk. She still smiles at me and tries to engage in small talk every so often but i usually ignore her, i dont want awkward small talk i wanted to actually sort stuff out but we never actually did, it feels like she just wants things to go back to normal but i still dont want to if its going to be such a selective random friendship, we’ll be finishing sixth form and going to different unis in a few months where i’ll probably never see her again so i feel like its probably too late for us which is sad since i still think about what we had a lot. Am i the asshole for not just moving on? Should i have just acted like everything was fine or was i right to have removed myself from what was now a toxic friendship? \n\n",

      "description": "Hello people,\n\nSo this actually happened today. This is quite important for the story, so I'm terrified of germs, everyone knows it. I avoid human contact, for example when someone greets me with a handshake and then tries to kiss my cheek I'll be like oh fuck no (and no it's not because I feel awkward, I'm just terrified of germs). I probably shouldn't say more about this 'cause you'll think that I'm even more weird so let's get into the story. \n\nAlright so, we sing the song to my mom and you know how it goes, you make a wish and blow into the candles. Now there was a kid who was basically screeching 'cause she wanted to do it with my mom. Also the kid was a bit sick (she was coughing and sneezing all over the cake), so when it was the time to blow the candles the kid basically spits all over it. At this point I was like alright maybe that small part isn't \"contaminated\" (the cake was pretty big and the kid wasn't near the part with the decorations - this will be important for later). So we had to take out the candles to cut the cake and ofcourse the kid wanted to do it, she started touching the cake with her dirty hands (The kid is around 4 years old by the way), removing the decorations and poking the cake. I asked something similar to \"why would you let her do that\" (because she was ruining the cake) and the parents replied it \"oh she is just having fun, look how cute she is!\". Even some other people told them to tell their kid to stop doing that but they didn't want to listen because their precious princess can do whatever she wants. So at this point, the cake is full of germs, filthy child touched even the part with decorations (she spent some time playing on the floor before she touched the cake, and she kept picking her nose all the time). I politely declined a piece of cake and said that I can't eat anything anymore. I ask my mom to come with me to the hallway so that I can explain the actual reason (I had to because she knew that I was lying, I love cake and I can eat it at any time no matter how full I am). My mom called me rude and etc. \n\nAITA here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, sorry about the terrible grammar and etc. English is not my first language.",

      "description": "So girlfriend split up with me a few days ago (I'm 26, she's 25). We will buy out the lease at the end of April but I went to my brothers for the time being till I find a new place. I'm still helping split April's rent and all the furnitiure and items in the apartment is mine or my families (couch, bed, table, TV, etc). She's definitely free to see other people, that's obvious, but I told her not to bring other guys back to this place because technically it was still my apartment as well and everything in there is mine. I'll more than likely be taking all this furniture come end of April. She accused me of calling her a slut right then and there because I said don't bring guys back but I laughed it off and told her I didn't mean it like that.\n\nWell on Tuesday morning, I had to swing by to snag my roller hockey skates. I walked in and there she was, cuddled up with a guy on our couch only 4 days after breaking up. I wasn't mad, just hurt. I told the guy to leave and then took a few hours of PTO from work and moved basically all the crap I could out of the apartment (my 55 inch TV, speakers, computer, all my clothes, etc). I still left her my 42 inch TV and my firestick to watch Netflix and crap, along with all the furniture for the time being. She kept telling me she won't bring any other guys back and it isn't what I thought it was.\n\nWell, now a few days later, heard from a mutual friend that she has a date with a new guy and she mentioned to my mutual friend that she's bringing the guy back to our place tonight for date #2, netflix and chill. She told my friend that she doesn't know if they'll have sex yet but she wants too. (I have absolutely no idea why she would tell this to my mutual friend either, because it's a girl I've known dating back to pre-k school). So my mutual friend, who was on my side in the beginning, told me this.\n\nNow, sure, it hurts that she is seeing other people only a week after breaking up but she's a free agent. But would I be the asshole for going and moving everything out of that apartment? The thought of her taking it on the bed I will be using for the forseable future, in an apartment I'm paying half the rent for, and them using my 42 inch TV and firestick to Netflix it up, is kind of making me sick. \n\nSo what gives. Tell me how it is so I can gain some perspective because I still love this girl and wanted to help her out this month instead of leaving her high and dry. The fact that I love her is obviously blinding my judgment a bit and probably making me a bit resentful to this. But at the same time I don't want to be walked all over and disrespected. ",

It didn't anywhere, so I asked my brother if I could use his prime account to get it sooner, rather than ordering it from elsewhere and having to wait a few days for shipping. \n\nI asked him, and offered to immediately transfer the money into his bank account before I placed the order via online banking. Seemed like a good idea in my mind, nothing lost on either side and something gained. When I had prime as a student (when I could afford it), I often ordered things for family and friends so they could get them immediately, and most of the time they paid me back. He himself ordered a set of lights for his bike a few months ago using my then-prime account. \n\nHowever, he refused and acted offended that I even asked, then slammed his door in my face and told me to leave. \n\nI feel like I may have been a little presumptuous in thinking he would offer me his account to use, but I don't understand why he reacted the way he did, in my mind it seemed a pretty reasonable request. \n\nTL;DR: Am I the Asshole for assuming I could use the next day shipping on my brother's Amazon prime account like he did mine?

I planned a nice dinner and invited my entire family and everyone said they would come.

Everyone is saying I should just go to my cousin’s party and basically share a birthday party with her. \n\nNo offence to this baby, but I wasn’t really wanting to share my 18th with a 1 year old. Yesterday my mom messaged the family group chat saying that she was upset for everyone assuming I should share a birthday party with my cousin. My aunt’s family told my mom and I that we’re being “ignorant and childish”. They also told me to go cry somewhere else. I then defended my mom and myself by saying that I was only upset that everyone cancelled on me, and that I’d still come to their party. I also told them not to insult my mom for defending me. I then left the group chat because I didn’t want to fight with my uncle. My aunt and my uncle think I’m trying to ruin their little girl’s special day. My aunt’s say I should just go to my cousin’s party and they’d all see me there. My mom and my grandma all said I have a right to be upset.

      "description": "My gf loves to dance as do I. Its something we bonded about as friends when we met. It also something that grew our love. When we dance as a couple now its amazing. I've noticed that I danced to meet people and gain a skill. She danced to get lost in the music.\n\nObviously as friends at dance events I didnt care about her at all. We'd check in and arrive and leave together most times. Since one of my \"love languages\" is touch I really cared about who she touches, hugs etc. Now I've noticed by attitude towards her dancing with other ppl have changed a lot since theres more of a emotional investment. I was ok with her dancing with strangers in a group class or a in an event centered around dancing and teaching of it.\n\nWhen we'd have date nights or group outings with friends - she'd often accept dances from random dudes at bars or clubs. This made me uncomfortable since she was touching random dudes and giving them the thought that there could be more. I spoke up about this and she agreed to stop. At a recent event she did it again and I told her off about it. We discussed it and I said this:\n\nA pretty woman at a club or bar has agency. Men will approach her and ask her to dance. To her its a simple dance. To them its an invitation for more. At a dance centric event (wheres theres lessons and instructors) its more about dancing. At a nightclub where its about \"Just a lil bit\" kind of songs - its about sex or the chance at it.\n\nGirls wont approach me. Her solution was \"you can dance too.\" I told her for me to have that same result as her at a bar - I'd have to go and approach girls, hit on them, compliment them, buy them drinks, and then dance with them to achieve that same social parity. I'd have to do the monkey dance of a single man again, \"Look I'm funny, I have a car, I dress decently etc. etc. etc.\" Or I'd have to pay attention to the room and not her and see who was making eye contact with me.\n\nSHE WAS NOT even CLOSE to cool with that. She was like I couldn't stand it if you even told a girl she's pretty.\n\nThat's when I said - if you don't want to act like single ppl at a venue - then lets act like we're actually together and deny the random ppl dances at clubs and bars? She eventually agreed. I feel bad for limiting how she was when we were both single. Just in a relationship I'm not a big social dancer with randos. I'll only dance with my good dancer friends (who know its just about dancing). \n\nI dont want to change her but are we supposed to adjust for relationships? On our night outs with a group or alone I just dont wanna be a putz standing there sipping beer as some dude is dancing or trying to grind on my girl. We did talk about keeping a distance and she has recently been good about that.\n\nAITA?",

I need someone to help me fix the washer in my shower.  I need someone to adjust the latch on my gate.  I need some help getting my back garden sorted.  I need a new smoke alarm for my hallway.  \n\nBut those things are hard to gift wrap, so despite me asking for help, and despite me begging them not to buy me more stuff, they just keep on buying, and I keep on feeling like an ungrateful shit for never liking/using/wearing the stuff they give me.",

      "description": "Happened a couple years ago. I was working at an art shop in the city which meant i served alot of entitled people. I would be talking to staff (giving them tasks/ work related) or other customers and people would just walk up to me  and start talking at me. I was getting sick of it. I always feel uncomfortable ignoring the person i was talking to.\n\nOne day in particular i was serving by my self and had a line of maybe 3-4 people. Was scanning a ladies items and about to ask all the mandatory questions about memberships and stuff when a lady by passes the line, comes up to the counter and just blurts out (not rudely) 'excuse me but where is blah blah item?'. I was really annoyed and just said 'sorry ma'am im just with a lady atm'. She gets huffy and i think says something like 'i just want to know where blah item is' and i said along the lines of 'im just with someone but if you wait a sec i can help'. In hind sight i probably gave her some attitude.... like in a 'ummm cant you see im with someone' kinda way. She's pissed and does an overly exaggerated mutter 'i just wanted to ask a question. Its was only gonna take a sec. Is that so hard' then storms out. \n\nNow I'll admit that my tone wasnt the greatest.... but i wasnt rude by any means. I was alone in a shop full of people, with a line and a bit stressed. I also thought that interrupting like that was rude. In my mind the lady im serving gets all my attention and the people who lined up get priority. But when i looked at the other people in the line/ the lady i was serving, none of them looked pleased with me. I dont know if thats just me being paranoid but none of them really seemed to talk to me after that. \n\nI thought i was doing right by the other people but its more than likely her question could have been answered in like 5 seconds and i was just being petty.  The reaction of the other customers makes me question if im the asshole.\n",

      "description": "Alright guys so this is also kinds to vent because it seriously worked me up, but anyways my ex wanted me to leave her alone even though I wanted to clear up the false impressions she had as to why I wanted to break up with her. I broke up with her because of personal reasons I didn't enjoy about the relationship, as well as because I wanted some time to flirt around with other girls and be single a semester before I had to go to college. Of course she wasn't too happy because of my reasoning, especially the reason that I wanted to flirt around, but one of her friends told her I tried to cheat on her with one chick and was flirty with another. She had this impression in her head as well as told other people and a bunch of people confronted me about it during my lunch period. \n\nI had no idea what they were talking about so I was honest and told them that didn't happen. I told my ex that it wasn't true and I got a little flirty with other chicks the day before we broke up as I knew we were breaking up, as well as I told her that I never tried to cheat and I guess someone could have said I was flirting with one of the chicks. Now, all that happened between me and that chick was I would call her cute or comment on her outfit and stuff similar to that, and that's what I thought my gf was thinking but she thought I meant underwear pics or stuff like that.\n\nAnyways flash forward to later when I cleared things up with the chick who I initially spread the rumor as well as many of her friends. However I never talked with my ex as she didn't want to talk to me because she was angry. So tonight I started to and asking her what she thought happened and telling her what I thought blah blah blah... But she started to tell me to quit talking to her because she was so angry with me and she doesn't want to talk and needs a few days. Now I get that as I didn't want to talk to her either, but before we had our break, I needed to clear up the misinformation. \n\nSo I continued to tell her that no we need to talk right now before we take that break for exactly what I just wrote. She still wouldn't budge and continue saying I need to stop and she's not going to respond (which she would eventually respond to a few minutes later). I kept asking there the question \"what do you think actually happened,\" and she would say other irrelevant things about me instead of answering. \n\nAm I the ass for wanting do clear things up? I just want to make sure she doesn't go around spreading false rumors and thinking what I did was something I didn't. It could have taken 5 minutes of conversation to do so, but then again I understand why she wouldn't want to talk as she was very emotional about the whole ordeal and I can understand why she got so mad.

      "description": "Apologies in advance for both making a long post and my first post ever on Reddit.\n\nAnyway, I want to first say that me and my gf have been dating for some years in a LDR (Moving in together was a WIP), and I have complete trust in her, which wasn't easy to get as I'm quite a paranoid and jealous person in general.\n\nSomething else that's important to know beforehand is that while I enjoy talking in vc, she claims not to, and we agreed on typing for the most part, with very occasional calls during the week.\n\nStory: Recently, my gf joined a discord group, she asked if I wanted to join as well, so I accepted. People were nice in general, but I noticed that one of the people was always talking with her in a call when she went to sleep.\n\nWhen I asked her about this, she said it was because she has trouble sleeping due to hypersomnia (Which I knew), and does it because it works better for her than watching youtube videos, so she'd join his call of him playing vidya, fall asleep, and he'd cancel out of the call.\n\nI was a bit skeptical, but because I had no reason to distrust her, since A) We'd been dating for a very long time, and she's very anti-cheating, and B) The person she's talking with isn't attractive whatsoever, I accepted it and moved on.\n\nNow forward a few days from that point and both of them are constantly in 4-6h long calls with eachother each night, talking, which at this point annoyed me because I had to agree to only talking for a few minutes each week, while this random guy could hear her voice whenever he pleased.\n\nCouldn't take it anymore and I just asked if I could do the same, with her watching me play games and falling asleep, to which she replied no, I got a bit annoyed at this response and kept pushing, which made her annoyed at me in response and she ignored me, but the calls between them kept going on of course.\n\nI talked to someone else in the server about this and apparently she thinks I'm controlling her because I'm picking out who she can hang out with and what she does.\n\nI apologised afterwards (Maybe a bit too much to be fair), saying I didn't mean to come over as controlling, but I still wanted to talk about it, because it was a legitimate issue to me, and she just kept ignoring my messages, I asked the next day if she was \"Interested in him\" and she went mad. Haven't sent her a message since, and our chat has been dry for about three days.\n\nCompletely seperate from all this: I see sleeping in calls as something couples do, not friends, which frustrates me even further.\n\n**TL;DR:** Me and gf barely talk in vc because she prefers typing, but met someone that she talks with non-stop, which I got annoyed at and she's mad at me for being annoyed.\n\nAITA for being frustrated at my gf for this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

After that I say to M \" I've heard so much about you, you're like a celebrity.\", and with that shit really hit the fan. E immediately leaves the chat and DM's me on ig about why did I do that and how I shouldn't have done that and I ruined her life. Mind you she lives in the US and I live in Europe, and I never actually met E and M, but C and some of my other friends have.

It was a very hard breakup for me and I really don’t want to have anything to do with him because it’s clear that our futures lie on different continents. I am a very emotional person, and all I want to do is facetime him or visit him, but I have great self control so I don’t ever do that since it’s unproductive for me to keep in touch with him knowing that I can find better people in my own country. (Statistically speaking) However, ever since the new year he’s been sending me gifts every 2 weeks. The gifts range from $50-$300 and being the poor college student I am, I just kept them and I haven’t really reached out to him or thanked him or spoken to him.  The main reason why I don’t is because the thought of him gives me bad energy and even nightmares at times because as great as our relationship was, the aftermath of getting over him was tumultuous to say the least. Am I the asshole for not at least sending him a text?",

I travel 2hrs to get to the city and am staying at my friend's place the night before I'm supposed to go on this date. Have to travel another 30/40 mins to get to her area in the city.  I text her that night just checking in to make sure everything is still good and narrow down when and where. \n\nI suggest we meet up and get lunch somewhere. She says ok, and asks if I have a place in mind. I say nah, was hoping u did, kinda joking around that it's her turf, figured she would know some spots. I suggest I'd be down to get sushi and pay for her cuz she told me that's her favorite food.\n\nShe says never mind, forget about the date. I'm like wtf? She says since I didn't have a place in mind, I wasn't serious about meeting. She says it takes 2 mins to look up a place and I wasn't putting in effort.  I called her conceited and said I traveled my ass to her, was gonna buy her food, and that it was ridiculous reason to cancel. She hits me with I'm being too emotional, and that she is on her period and it's her job to be emotional. Says I have no chivalry, and if I wasnt so feminine maybe I'd get some p****. Also, says I shouldn't be treating her like this on IWD.\n\nI say yea I'm allowed to be emotional, didn't know I needed to bleeding outta my d*** to show it. Also say well since I have so much estrogen I'm practically a woman and she shouldn't be treating me like this on IWD.  I tell her im glad we aren't meeting cuz im not on a quest to stick my d*** in as many holes as possible, have too much chivalry for that. (Honestly if she was dtf I'd have been down, but expectations for the date was just lunch and roam around NYC. But that response sounded clever to me.)\n\nI delete her number and our conversation, then hit her up on SC asking for screenshots cuz I thought of posting it in here. Understandably she said no cuz she didn't trust me. Calls me a stalker and psychopath.\n\nThis was supposed to be our first date, ha! Have had great conversation via text and was looking forward to finally meeting her.\n\nI have a tendency to overreact, being drunk definitely didn't help (Not an excuse, just a fact). Hoping I'm not the a**.  Tried to be as honest in this description as possible. It was a fairly long argument and I summed up the most important parts I think. Obviously there is probably a slant to my text in my favor, no one's the bad guy in their own story right? I can honestly say I didn't curse at her or anything like, wether or not y'all believe me is another story.  I told her I was gonna post it on here, not sure if she is in this site tho.\n\n\n\n",

Since we smoke so much our tolerance to weed is higher and it takes more weed or more expensive weed to get us higher- leading to more joints/blunts to be rolled. She sits and chills every time we pick up while we roll so much even when smoking multiple times a day.  She has tried to roll once or twice but doesn’t put much effort in, but sometimes when we roll she will say “sorry i’m worthless guys” referring to the fact she can’t roll and just sits there. The other day I mentioned something to her half frustrated from having rolled 9 joints that day about how it’s annoying she can’t roll, and she feels that I hurt her feelings and upset her and shouldn’t have said that.

      "description": "A group of my friends (all college age) and I are planning a short trip for spring break. We are staying in an AirBnB and I offered to book the room, which was a full 690 charge all on my card. I did this because my friend asked me to, not because I wanted to, because I know people can be awful about payment. \n\nMost of them venmo me their share immediately which I would prefer, but one girl says that she’ll get me a check. I’m peeved about this initially since I don’t have a car on campus so it will be a hassle to deposit the check if online deposit and atms don’t work, but I agree (though I told her I would prefer venmo). \n\nSo because of our schedules not lining up it’s like a full week before she can get the check to me, then a full week before I can try and deposit. And of course the check gets rejected both by the online app and the ATM. So I get peeved and tell her to Venmo me, offering to return the check to her. She tells me to just try depositing during business hours in person and she doesn’t want to venmo since she already gave me the check. \n\nI got really pissed at her since she’s basically asking me to make two trips to a bank when it’s actually inconvenient to do so, since I don’t have a car. And i’m generally annoyed because how hard is it to use this modern, free, hassle free service that EVERYBODY ELSE is using. I basically told her, pretty passive aggressively, sure but it’s super inconvenient for me and that it was hypocritical for her not to trust me (for not trusting me to return the check so she can just venmo) when she expects me to trust her (that the check is legit and I’m not wasting my time by visiting in person). But I mostly didn’t mean it since I do trust that the check is legit, I just am upset she doesn’t seem to understand how inconvenient and difficult this is for me. So I feel bad for mostly bitching about the inconvenience for me, but at the same time I feel like it’s her responsibility to figure out this payment stuff and not mine. \n\nAlso keep in mind that its a significant chunk of money that’s been out of my pocket for weeks now.

      "title": "AITA for wanting my best friend as my Best Man, even though he cheated on the Maid of Honor?",
      "description": "My best friend, FRIEND, I‘ve known since I was in diapers. We were neighbors throughout HS, went to college together, and shared an apartment our last year there. He’s been a brother our whole lives; we’re both an only child. We’ve talked about how we’ll be each other’s best man for as long as I can remember. I don’t really have any friends other than him; I’m not very social.\n\n2 years ago I met the love of my life, FIANCÉ. 1 year into the relationship, FRIEND meets FIANCÉ’S best friend, MOH (Maid of Honor). FRIEND and MOH start dating. FIANCÉ and I both agreed that this might cause complications in our relationship if they have problems, but also acknowledged that we couldn’t really do anything about it. What were we gonna do, tell them they can’t date? They were great together, and MOH found him worth giving up “waiting until marriage.” A few months ago, I proposed, and we are set to be married in a little over a month. I asked FRIEND to be my best man. FIANCÉ asked MOH to be Maid of Honor.\n\n2 weeks ago, FRIEND went out with some other friends, and ended up drunk and going home with a girl. He confessed this to me the next day, and he felt like absolute shit. I told him he’s gotta confess it to MOH. He fucked up and it’s only fair to her, and she’ll be a lot more understanding if he tells her himself. He agrees this is the right thing to do.\n\nMOH‘s livid (rightfully so). I come home from work and she‘s at my apartment. She packed a bag and asked FIANCÉ if she could stay with us to get out of her apartment. I’m fine with this; I can understand she’s going through a rough time. 1 week ago, MOH decided she can’t handle dating anymore, and they break up. She‘s staying with us until she can find another apartment.\n\nFIANCÉ tells me that there’s no way MOH will be able to handle being at the wedding, especially walking down the aisle with FRIEND. I told her that they don’t need to walk down together, or do anything together, but I can’t tell him he can’t be my best man. It would devastate both of us, as well as leaving me without a best man. FIANCÉ tells me I shouldn’t even want to be friends with him anymore, and offers her brother as my best man. She put her foot down on him even being AT the wedding. She says that one of them can’t be there, and that it’s not fair for MOH to both get cheated on, and then ALSO not able to go to the wedding because we “chose” FRIEND over her.\n\nFRIEND is already devastated that he fucked up his relationship. I hate cheaters, but you don’t just turn on your lifelong best friend because he fucked up. I understand that it is very challenging for MOH, but I also feel like since this is MY wedding, it should be determined by what me and FIANCÉ want, and that I shouldn’t go through my wedding without a best man because of MOH. I also don’t think that it should be a choice of one or the other, and that they should both come and be professional and avoid each other.\n\nAITA for standing by having him as my best man?",

      "description": "So a bit of a story is needed for context. My house keep ,which in our country it is very difficult to find an honest and responsible one, has been working for our family in different households. In my brother's, my aunt's, and even some friends. During those years she has always been honest, responsible, and helped with keeping our lives clean and organized. Now living in my own house, my wife has a room which she uses to store her things from her online baby/child clothing store. The room is always a mess since she does not want anyone going inside and messing with her \"system\". Inside you can find a multitude of clothes, accesories, and hell she has even kept the equivalent of hundred of dollars in our currency. Always disorganized but recently she has told me that she cannot find some of the items she is selling, or only finds one piece of a set. Once she said that a bunch of money went missing. She told me all of this, and how she believes the housekeep was to blame, I told her I disagreed with her, but if she did not want her to keep working for us I was ok with that. Me disagreeing with her was not great, she took it like an insult, like I told her she was crazy for thinking this and that I should trust her. I actually thought of lying to her and telling her that I agree, but I told her what I believe. The mess she keeps maybe she misplaced or lost the items, but no way I am telling her that. She also asked what were the other options: me or my 2 year old stealing from her? There is also no way anyone broke in, there are cameras outside in the neighborhood, and 2 big dogs guarding our house. And yes no cameras in the house since I did not consider them necessary. Is it wrong of me for not agreeing with her 100%? AITA?",

      "description": "Without divulging too many details, my co-worker and I are the only two attorneys doing a certain type of law in a governmental office. We have been working there almost the same amount of time and have about the same amount of experience but because she started 2 months before me they made her “chief” and me not, so she’s sort of technically my boss although my real boss made it clear no one sees it this way. I honestly don’t care as I’m there to do good work, help people for a few years with public interest law and then move on to other pastures.\n\nAnyway, her time management is terrible and she’s not nearly as efficient worker as I am anyway. I volunteered to be assigned 60% of the cases so she can handle her “Chief administrative tasks” but after months of her at the last minute dumping her work on me, I made it clear that while I’m happy to be assigned 60% of the cases from the beginning, I don’t like her work being dumped on me last minute. During my 7 months on the job I have not asked the court for a single extension while she routinely does. I have also done a lot of other work to help other attorneys in other departments outside of my area where I think I can help bring value to our organization and I also volunteered to teach a continuing legal education class that I have poured about 75 hours in preparing. Keep in mind, I do all this extra and get my work done on time.\n\nMy office mate (or pseudo boss whatever) however, as mentioned, is chronically late but then will loudly sigh about how it’s not fair that I get to do all these “fun” research projects and she doesn’t. She also keeps repeatedly suggesting that maybe I’m “bored” and need more work and it’s clear to me she wants to dump more of her work on me but because she’s a waspy person and I’ve already made it clear I don’t like that, she won’t say so directly. I have this huge legal training I’m giving in one week, but frankly this coming week, I could take one of her tasks for her with no problem as, as always, I’m ahead. Like, truly I will be bored next week. However I’ve decided not to do that and stay firm because she’s dumped so much of her work on me in the past and I hate that so much (if I don’t get the case from the beginning then I’m stuck with how she’s handled the case up until that point which I find frustrating because it really boxes in how I both interact with the client and what I can do on the case). \n\nBut I’m feeling really guilty. As much as I might seem like the asshole from this post (which I’m now thinking I am), I will have an almost free week next week and she is *drowning* in work. And we’re in the same office so it’ll be obvious I have not a lot to do. And I constantly do things for other attorneys in our office (because I feel like they’re not just dumping *their* work on me but asking for my help) so at some point to her it will seem personal and I really have no issue with her other than a feeling that I don’t like the assumption that I’m *responsible* for someone else’s work. Maybe I should just help her out this one week?\n\nSo my question: AITA for not taking work from my coworker that I could easily take when she is absolutely drowning? Thanks!",

      "description": "Due to lack of engagement and accountability failures from the previous manager and supervisor, I was asked to take over a safety critical team to improve compliance and accuracy.\n\nUnder the previous leader a particular individual was thought of as a high performer due to his willingness to take on a broad range of tasks so the previous leader could sit back and relax. Additionally, this employee was asked, by senior leadership, to be the interim supervisor until I could get engaged and hire a permanent supervisor. However, as I engage my new role I have found this employee to be secretive regarding the execution of many of these tasks and it appears they are for a large part fairly simple to accomplish, yet not being completed in compliance with federal regulations or company policy. Therefore I removed him from the interim leadership role and reassigned him new responsibilities that were more inline with following checklists than making decisions and leading projects. \n\nAt the time I provided specific examples of the behaviors that lead to this decision including examples of non compliance and at the direction of company attorney and HR provided a final warning letter due to the intentional nature of his bad decisions. As a result he has been crying loudly at his desk (while refusing company emotional support services) almost daily for the past 3 weeks, making others uncomfortable. He has also had several mistakes due to not following instructions, procedures, and failing to check his work. I don't typically mind mistakes, but this is repetitive and preventable if procedures were followed. And earlier this week I instructed him to perform a calculation following his task that would reveal errors, he said it wasn't necessary for this particular task. I asked him to do it anyway. Later on, an error was identified, and through investigations it was determined, as I instructed, that the calculation would have resolved this error. \n\nThese are well documented procedures, down to the key stroke, and his generous compensation reflects the requirements for 100% accuracy. That being said, inspite of the attention seeking crying and arguing, this guy is hurting. He's never received negative feedback until I got involved, so I understand the difficulty in adjusting. But after this latest issue disciplinary action must be issued. He's already received a final warning so this would be a second final warning, with days off without pay. The shear amount of coaching that I have to put into this guy is really taking an emotional toll on him. The other option is termination, however my director is a softy and avoids it at all costs. But what is kinder to this guy? Keep warning him in a role he clearly can't handle or putting him out of his misery and forcing him to move on?",

      "description": "So I live in a student house, basically just a normal 2 story house with six rooms in total, 2 on each floor, two kitchens, and a large bathroom. The rooms are 20m², it’s close to the train station, close to the city center, and in a relatively quiet neighborhood.\n\nI’ve been living here for over a year now, and recently two of my best friends moved in since there were rooms free. Exciting! \n\nAll was good and well, until last night. We had a guest over and decided to bake pancakes together, just the four of us. Our guest was impressed with the sizes of our rooms, since his place was a lot smaller. So he asked how much rent we pay each month. I was about to answer when one of my roommates was quicker. \n\n€400 a month, she told him. \n\nMy rent is only €385 a month. \n\nSo I kept my mouth shut and just nodded. We went along with our conversation but I just couldn’t shake this thought away. \n\nI’m afraid that if I mentioned it, they would get angry and mail the landlord. Which could risk into my rent being changed to €400 as well, and I really don’t want that. I also don’t really know why I only have to pay €385? Maybe it’s a mistake in the system?\n\nAm I an asshole for paying less rent than my best friends and not mentioning it to them or my landlord?\n\nI hope this was an okay story to read and I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter. If there’s anything unclear, I’d be happy to clarify some things. \n\n\nps: I’m new to reddit and on mobile, the usual. \n",

      "description": "Mobile User\n\nM:Mom\nD:Dad\nSF:Stepfather\n\nA month ago I (17M) was diagnosed with stage three Hodgkin's Lymphoma\n\n\nI am currently in the hospital because my entire mouth is covered in mouth sores. This makes it difficult for me to eat and talk, warranting a 1 week+ admission to the hospital.\n\nOne day I'm in my hospital bed, my family in the room. I get up to go to the bathroom, which includes unhooking myself from some equipment and taking my IV pole with me. I also take my phone with headphones because i'm already listening to some music.\n\nSo I go into the bathroom, which you can’t lock, and turn the sink on so they don't hear “Pshh.” I urinate in a jug because the nurses monitor my fluid intake and outtake and at this point I had already urinated twice in the jug without the nurse dumping it out. 3 times is the max I can go without it overflowing. \n\nBecause of the noise from the sink I turn the sound up on my headphones to the maximum volume. The morphine makes urinating really slow.\nJust as I finish urinating I hear three knocks on the door through a quiet part of a completely different song (I think 3 or 4 had played by the time I finished urinating) and I'm immediately both angry and anxious as I know what's going to happen next.\n\nMy stepdad says that in France (he spent most of his life there) you knock just to give people a notice that you're coming. He doesn't actually wait for you to say \"come in\" or \"occupied\" or anything. This had led to a lot of conflict at home, and now it appears, the hospital.\n\nI yell \"NO,\" but he's already in the bathroom, door completely open (pushed into the bathroom). My penis was exposed and he seemed confused at the scene that he just walked in on. I don't even think about what I'm doing, I jerk the jug in his face and toward his body so that he is drenched in my piss from head to a little bit of his pants. I then drop the jug, push him out, and close the door. \n\nI yell through the door something along the lines of \"I don't care how you knock in France, in America you wait for someone to say 'come in' before you open the door.\" Then I take it a bit too far in my opinion and call him something along the lines of “pervert,” but worse.\n\nWhen I exit the bathroom into my room my SF is washing his face in the sink and he is fuming. My M explains to me that since I was taking so long my SF thought I may have fainted or been in some kind of trouble. He called out my name while still sitting on the couch in my room and when I didn't answer because of the sound of the sink and my headphones at full volume is when the incident occurred.\n\n*For more context, and I believe this is really important in understanding my mindset, I would suggest you check out my post history.*\n\nSo am I the asshole for tossing pee at someone who was apparently just trying to help?\n",

      "description": "I met this guy online through gaming over 2 years ago. We quickly became really good friends, to the point where we talked every day, shared our secrets and problems with each other, etc. He probably still knows more secrets about me than anyone else. Due to us living only 2 hours away from each other we spent a new year together and also went to a festival together a couple of months ago.\n\nHowever, around half a year ago it went downhill. His taste in games changed. He doesnt like the game and community that used to bring us together, he now pretty much only plays fortnite (which itself is not a problem). However, I dont like fortnite that much, so that alone is kind of already drifting us apart.\n\nAt some point, every call of ours consisted of him insulting me and calling me bad or at least saying that he was better than me. Even as a joke, its just become super annoying and in my eyes is not a way to treat good friends. He always seems super selfish and everything is always about him. Me and some other friends have told him several times that he should stop insulting us, he promised to do so, but then broke his promises, and even told us that we were the bad friends instead. \n\nEver since he started being so toxic towards me/us, I didnt feel to great when I was calling with him. So I more or less decided that I wanted to lose contact with him. At the same time, I also felt a bit guilty tho, because of what we went through together and us having been such good friends, so I never told him the real reasons and only started becoming inactive. \n\nBut now he is constantly putting me on a guilt trip for never being online. As excuses I usually just say that we have very diffirent games that we play nowadays and on top of that, I am working 40 hours a week since summer and I am not the best at managing my free time.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to hang out with him, even tho he always keeps insulting me and behaves very immature and selfish?\n\nTL;DR Guy I met online and was good friends with kept insulting me and my friends, I am slowly trying to lose contact, but he is making me feel guilty about it.

I had just cleaned and bleached the bathroom so I was pretty annoyed. She told me that it was unfair of me to complain because I keep my feminine hygiene wash (it's soap for down there) in the shower and no one needs to see that. The wash has a certain pH that is supposed to be better than using soap for down there and I like to feel clean. I tried to explain that the hygiene product is no different from a clean and packaged pad (which she leaves on the table) and she was not having it. She kept saying no one she knows needs it and it's gross. I say her dirty underwear is gross. I feel like she is obviously in the wrong, but my mum who witnessed the conversation didn't back me up, which is why I am posting here. \n\nAlso sorry if this isn't formatted correctly or something.

It was only once we starting living together I realized that he is up there on the list of pickiest eaters ever. \n\nA couple of months ago, I became incredibly conscious of my diet and what foods I was eating, so nowadays a majority of what I eat are fresh vegetables, grains, legumes, the whole nine yards. I have asked my boyfriend to consider trying new foods, because it is important to me that he respects his body and what he puts into it. (Thinking long term-this stresses me out because if we ever have kids, it'll be SUPER tough to get a little kid to eat a pizza while their dad eats pizza most nights). While his eating habits to not effect my health or body at all, I would like to invest in a partner who is health conscious, appreciates eating good food, and who probably has less of a chance of getting heart disease sometime down the line. He is slightly more inclined to try new foods since I've discusses it with him (hasn't liked any of them yet), but did day-to-day diet has not changed one bit. \n\nAnyways, am I the asshole for wanting him to eat his fucking vegetables?

About 5 minutes later I received a speechless water top-off. And 5 minutes after that I received a speechless water top-off. And 10 minutes after that I received a speechless water top-off.

By that time I was enraged, having never been talked to at the table, and I was super hungry.\n\nLet me post-face by saying: I'm the most placid, easiest customer ever, and generally tip high. I've never walked out, well except for Napoleon Dynamite, that movie was annoying. I just sit there on my phone chilling out. I'm hungry, at lest get a sugary drink in my belly...

They're hit and miss, and when I say that, I mean when there good, they are excellent, and I'm picky. Otherwise they're totally mediocre tasting. The service is always horrible.

      "description": "Im a freshmen in highschool and at my school you can get a meal for 1 dollar for lunch. That day i set down my backback near my friend. I then walked to another table to talk to some friends and while I was doing that he took my money which was only a dollar and spent it on a bag of chips. Someone told me he just took my money so i went over to him to confront him and he told me he spent it. I was obviously pretty mad as I didnt have food for lunch now. Seeing me angry he gives me the back of chips. It was a bag of hot cheetos which I really did not want to eat as even something somewhat spicy makes it hard for me to breathe during excersise and i had a sports game that day after school. So there I am with no lunch and money and a bag of hot cheetos. I threw the bag at him and stormed off. And the money he took wasnt even mine. The previous day another friend told me if i could locate all 50 states on the map hed give me a dollar. I did it and he gave me a dollar so i felt pretty good to spend it the next day knowing i earned it. The day after my friend stole my money he tried acring like it never happened. He Didnt even say sorry or didnt even pay me back. I know this was only a dollar but i didnt get lunch that day. I dont know if he saw me angry that day or if hes just being an asshole. I still havent gotten over it. Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR one friend gives me a dollar, another friend steals it and buys something with it. Doesn't apologize nor pays me back ",

      "description": "Currently, I (15M) am on vacation in Washington, D.C. with my family. I've never really expressed much interest in going here, but I never said anything to the nature of \"I don't want to go\" because there is no purpose. It would just rile everyone up. Well, earlier today, we went to see most of the major buildings and memorials. That's when shit hit the fan; I won't go into details, but I expressed interest in going to the library of Congress. This was shot down by my father, who said it was a decently long walk from where we were. I told him that the walk from our hotel to the Lincoln memorial was about the same distance so it shouldn't be terrible, to which he responded that I don't always get my way.\n\nThis is where I said some things that I regret voicing, and I'm certain that some of it was just me being a bitchy teenager. I told him that I hadn't gotten to do anything of remote interest to me since we've gotten here, and that I didn't even want to be here in the first place. This ticked him off and he started going off on me. Eventually, my mother pulled me aside and told me that I was being ungrateful and that I should be appreciative of all the places I get taken (my parents are fairly well off). I argued that I wasn't ungrateful because I was forced to come, which didn't sit well with her. Eventually, once we get back to the street, my father starts insulting me, and my mother keeps telling him to stop. After he calmed down, my mother turned to me and said something like \"Do you see what you cause?\"\n\nI don't believe that I, as a minor, should be responsible for my middle aged father's actions. Apparently I ruined the entire trip for my family. I don't know if my parents are being assholes or if I'm being a stupid teenager, so AITA?",

      "description": "Hi all,\n\nI live in a condo where pets are allowed. I’m not a big fan of animals as I’ve always been creeped out by them. As long as pet owners are responsible and look after their pets, I have absolutely no problem with them. \n\nHowever, today while I was in the elevator, a woman got on with a giant German Shepard who was unleashed. The dog seemed to be in an excited mood and kept jumping up at me. I looked clearly uncomfortable and kept trying to move away from it. The owner thought this was funny and kept saying “don’t worry, he won’t hurt you! He’s super friendly”. \n\nI told her that i didn’t care if he was friendly and that I’d appreciate it if she would put her dog on a leash and keep him away from me. She got super upset with me and said I was making a big deal out of nothing. This in turn made me mad, so I told her she was being extremely entitled and that I wasn’t asking her to do anything outrageous—I simply did not want the dog near me and that it should be on a leash. \n\nThere were a few other people on the elevator and they all seemed shocked that I wasn’t obsessed with her crazy dog and were siding with the dog lady. \n\nFor the rest of the elevator ride, she kept talking to her dog saying things like “don’t worry, the cranky lady doesn’t like you, it’s not your fault.” and sharing eye rolls with the other people on the elevator as if to say “can you believe this girl?”\n\nAll this made me feel really shitty, but I honestly don’t think I did anything wrong here. AITA for not being okay with an unleashed dog on shared property? ",

      "title": "AITA for never calling my roommate beautiful?",
      "description": "I'd say my (23F) roommate (23F) has always been a very straightforward and somewhat blunt person. Some relevant examples: once in high school we were at a lunch table with other friends when she out of nowhere remarked that she had never thought I was (physically) beautiful, but she could see it all of a sudden. I was neither hurt nor flattered, since I had never sought to impress her. I also didn't (and don't) think she was beautiful either, and to me that is completely natural. We all find some people beautiful and some people, not beautiful. I did however think she had been rude to say something like that, as I imagined some people might be hurt by the first part of her remark. She will also sometimes say to me that someone she sees on social media is ugly - which I also think is rude even though that person is not around, and especially because I have not solicited her opinion on the person's appearance, and I have told her as much. But generally, I have simply taken these tendencies to mean she is the kind of person who appreciates honesty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile getting ready in front of the mirror, she'll often say to herself how beautiful she is and gas herself up - and I'm all for that lol, remind yourself that you're the shit everyday. But a few times, the last time a few days ago, she's followed up by asking me why I never call her beautiful, which is true. I always jokingly brush it off and end the conversation, but I realise that most people might respond to that question by calling her beautiful (am I wrong about that?). However, I feel very fake/uncomfortable saying things to people that aren't genuine; I would rather not say anything at all. I feel like even if I tried, she'd figure out I was being fake right away. She also seems to have a great amount of self-confidence, which makes me think it doesn't really matter to her whether I think she's beautiful or not. Perhaps she has noticed me call other people beautiful, but I don't think I do that that often enough for it to seem like she is the only one I do not call beautiful. I don't hesitate to compliment her features/outfits, but I have never called her overall face or body beautiful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole for never calling her beautiful?",

      "description": "I will try to condense this story down. \n\nSo I (23f) have been caring for my nephew(10m) for the past 6 years and a month ago my brother (28m his father) and his girlfriend (27?f his mother) came back into the mix to try to take him. He expressed he didnt want to leave with them and wanted to stay with me. Me and my brother are complete opposites. We dont get along. He has always been by far my mother's favorite with my mom expressing on many occasions that I've been a burden on her. My sister (28f) has been living with us for a while so she can save up some money to buy a house and before my brother came through the door I told her just be ready because when hes in this house it's going to feel like hell . Well after the month she definitely sees why I said that and has told me multiple times how in the world so I put up with the bullshit in this household. To mother my brother is her baby and no one exists outside of that and she really makes us feel that. She pushes us aside and treats him like royalty while also treating us like shit. Now I'm used to that but my sister isnt so its been a roller coaster of emotions for her. I'm always there to have her back against my mother because she never wants to say anything. \n\nMy brother lives with us but his girlfriend lives in North Carolina. She was visiting for the valentines day weekend and yesterday the three of them (mother, brother, and his gf) took it upon themselves to just take him away.  I was not home when this happened and apparently it happened the day before. Obviously upon hearing this I was angry and so was my little sister who was the one who found out the news. My little sister started crying saying how could they do that. Well I was in school and my sister calls me telling me to talk to my little sister that she has to respect them and their decision because at the end of the day its THEIR SON.\n\n I've always believed that blood is not what makes you a family it's how you care for one another. I have expressed this to her in the past when talking about the situation and she agreed. So I told her to quit her bullshit. My brother and his gf were never here for my nephew even before I had him. He constantly expressed that he didnt want to be with them and cried when they wouldnt want him near me. I'm upset with my sister because she essentially is saying to let it go and how am I supposed to do that. I've had him for so long and cared for him that i always saw him as being my son or my brother. He was my family and he was taken from me without even saying good bye. \n\nPs. If you guys want me to explain the whole background situation more just let me know.\n\nTl;dr I've been caring for my nephew for 6 years now and his mother took him away without me even seeing him. My sister took her side in the matter and said that he was her son and I have to respect her decision.",

      "description": "tl;dr - I rent a room at in apartment, but due to a new job on the other side of town I essentially am now living at my SO's place 24/7. My roommate still wants me to chip in on toilet paper and other supplies that I won't use, and pay a cleaning lady to come in to clean common areas that I have not used in months.\n\n---- \n\nMy apartment is a 3 bedroom. I rent one bedroom for 1/3rd of the overall rent/utilities. A couple rents the master bedroom and together they pay 1/3rd of the overall rent/utilities.\n\nThe third bedroom is rented by 1 person. It has changed renters multiple times since the lease started in May, but now there is a guy renting it. He pays the final 1/3rd of the rent.\n\nBasically for a few months now I've been living with my SO due to my new job. Commuting from my apartment would take 1.5-2h in each direction. I have a 9h workday. Staying with my SO saves me a significant amount of time and improves my quality of life drastically.\n\nMy lease is up at the end of April, so I've left my furniture and some personal items at my apartment. I continue to pay my portion of the rent and utilities.\n\nI only stop by the apartment occasionally to pick up more of my personal items from my room. In the time that I have been away, my female roommate has begun moving my items from the kitchen cupboards into my bedroom. This bothers me because she's doing it without asking me or even telling me she's moving my stuff. I don't need the space so they are free to use it, I just would prefer that they doing move my things without asking me. But that's beside the point.\n\nShe has now messaged me saying, \"I chose to live with roommates in order to cut down on costs. Even if people are away or on vacation, they need to pay their share of the costs.\" She wants me to chip in on toilet paper and she wants me to chip in on having a cleaning service come to clean the living room, kitchen and bathroom.\n\nI refuse. I'm not using any toilet paper or other household supplies, so there's no reason to contribute to the cost. If I were using those supplies, then yes I would contribute, but she isn't really saving any money in either instance, because I'm going to use whatever portion I pay for.\n\nAs for a cleaning service, it is not my fault they have made a huge mess of the apartment. Whenever I'm around, I clean up after myself. When I was staying there I cleaned up after my messy roommates countless times. I'm not making a mess there, therefore I'm not going to pay for it.\n\nSo tell me... Who is the asshole?",

      "description": "Hey everyone. I’ve been work friends with a girl for two years, we don’t hang out outside of work much but we text/snapchat a lot and used to see each other at work until I transferred stores. I’ve also only met her fiancé a few times so we are not close. \n\nShe recently told me that she’s been “talking” to a guy we used to work with. She and her fiancé have a child together and have been together for going on 10 years - it’s been clear that they don’t have a happy relationship but refuse to communicate about it. I’ve tried to be hands off in the situation because it’s none of my business, but then she started telling me that they’ve been hanging out and made out a few times when they were drunk. I told her that I’m not going to tell any of our friends or her fiancé about it but I cannot support her actions and want no part in knowing the details. \n\nShe got upset because she thought I was being judgmental and tried to justify it by saying that she thinks he’s cheated on her in the past, which she’s never said anything about until now. She said she wasn’t asking for my approval but she just wanted to “tell me what’s going on in her life.” I said that she and her fiancé need to communicate better and figure out of they actually want to be in a relationship - she really didn’t appreciate me saying this. \n\nI generally really like her and am supportive of the decisions she makes but I just can’t support her cheating on her fiancé. Apparently this makes me a bad friend. We haven’t talked much over the past few weeks and I miss her friendship. AITA for essentially telling her that I don’t want to be involved with her while she’s cheating in her relationship? ",

      "description": "So my GF and I have been together for a about a year or so now, we're both in high school - I'm about to graduate and she has another year to go.  \n\n\nMy GF's best friend is a fuller gay gentleman (we'll call them Norman) who is the same grade as her, they've been friends since grade school, and she was his main support structure when he came out in late middle school.\n\nNow Norman is Very open about his gayness, to the point it gets annoying sometimes - but, I get it because he's excited to be out, so we just let him do his things with the hopes he reels back a little with time.  \n\\*Note: I'm not the only one who feels this way, the whole friends circle (which includes other gay guys and girls) agree as well.  \n\n\nAnyway, so here's the deal: Norman gets very grabby with some of the people in the group, especially the girls...  \nHe will often \"jokingly\" grope the girls in the group and make comments about their breast size, texture, and if they're getting turned on by it. He will also often want to wrestle with them (sometimes by surprise), which; because of his larger stature, ends up with him on top of them and touching them inappropriately (breasts as well as crotch) and saying sexually suggestive things  - He does this to my GF the most.\n\n  \nWhat kind of annoys me is that most people will just play it off and say it's ok for him to do it because he's gay. IDK, it just really sounds Unkosher to me, especially because this is at school and he's been doing it more since I told my GF I wasn't very comfortable with him doing that stuff - at least to her right in front of me.   \n\n\nIt now looks like he will purposefully go out of his way to touch her inappropriately right in-front of me, I really feel this way because he will intensely glare at me while doing it.  \n\n\nIdk, I talked to another friend about it and she said that I needed to put my homophobic feelings away and let him be this way.... I really don't feel like this is right....  AITA?\n\n  \n",

      "description": "thanks for all the help in advance and apologies for any if all grammar mistakes haha. \n\nGood or bad just need to dialog people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister has come to visit me for 3 weeks (i live overseas). She and i have been close for many years, we call each other best friends and we get along very well. I haven't seen here in 2 1/2 years and when i saw her last week, it was great to catch up with her. Shes always open and a good person to have discussions with. However, there have been a few things she has been saying or doing that have been bothering me this first week shes visited. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a week of her visiting me we take a trip overseas for new years. The trip is going fine but one of the things that have been bothering me really gets under my skin. I've asked here multiply times for her not to do it but she keeps doing it or says \" i do it cause im like our mother\". The mother joke was funny at first but now it has really gotten under my skin. However, i still just drop it and let it go. Later in the same day we are checking into our hostel. I had to book us a separate rooms (mixed room because im male and females cause she is a girl)  . As the hostel managers tell us this i make the joke \"ill take the ladies room key\" and my sister yells very loud and within in ear shot of other guests in the lobby \"don't be such a creep!\". I was very shocked and embarrassed cause it seemed like she was trying to shame me in front of other people. (the joke can be seem creepy but people always mistake me as woman/my sister makes jokes about me cause i look like a woman cause i have long hair and such.) After this incident i didn't want to be angry and be mad so i do my normal process of shutting down, being quiet and distant so i dont say or do anything that could very hurtfully cause i was in a rage state. so i avoid my sister the whole night, go out for a walk by myself, go to bed early.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext day i wake up in the morning and just act normal with my sis. don't comment on the things that bugged me and just let it go. haha. we do some sightseeing in the morning for awhile and than we get breakfast . while at breakfast i happen to look at my sisters phone and read a text she has open. (i never read other peoples phones/look at their personal stuff  cause  i dont want them doing it to me. respect each others privacy) . what i saw she sent to her close friend was \"all he has been doing is looking at girls and like degrading girls\" (not sure if that was the whole text so i could be wrong and im being an asshole).  When i see this i legit get angry and go off a bit. I felt very betrayed that my sister/ best friend would talk behind my back negatively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfirst: it bothers me because i never talk about the things that bother me about my sister to anyone. shes my best friend and even the days were im mad at her or she annoys me i dont say anything about it to anyone. i say it to her.  i have a dialog with her. i just never thought my sister would do something like this. I feel like i cant trust her now cause she will take any my opinions and tell everyone about them. i dont like people telling wrong portrayals of me (unless that person has met me and made their own conclusion about me). \n\nsecondly: I'm a very shy guy and can never talk to girls. im always trying to respect woman cause my best friend is my sister, im close with my mom and i hangout with alot of girls. I try my best everyday to be a living example of integrity, and degrading woman is not in that definition. she has told me years ago i am  \" hyper-sexually\". when she told me that i made sure to turn things down or just not bringing up those topics up with her. during this trip, (to my memory) i might have noticed a girl in passing and took a look at her or said to my sister\" that girl looks good\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow in the past few days ive only answered her questions with yes or no. or given her the information she needs. try and not say anything that might cause her to assume something about me or misinterpret my opinion. I usually can forgive and not care. but with this i can forgive her but i dont want to trust her. and now im sure im making things awkward cause  i dont want to talk to her unless its necessary. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo im sure many of you  will agree, im being an asshole. thoughts? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom. My apologies for the book that I'm about to write, but there were a lot of events that happened leading up to the situation. \n\n**SCROLL DOWN TO SKIP THE BACKSTORY**\nSo I've been trying to plan a trip to Europe in May with a couple friends for the past month. I invited my boyfriend because we've been wanting to travel together more too. However, this last Saturday my friend, who's also been tracking flights to Japan, found flights for nearly half the price of what they usually go for AND it would also be during prime cherry blossom season in March. She ran it past me as something to think about, but ended the call with a heavy implication that her and my other friend (a couple) would most likely be opting out of the Europe trip and doing Japan instead. I wasn't against the idea since both Europe and Japan were desireable destinations, and I mainly just wanted to be able to travel with my friends. I wake up the next morning to a text saying that they bought the tickets to Japan for March because they wanted to jump on the deal before prices went back up.\n\nDuring this time I've been filling my boyfriend in on everything that's happened. Both my boyfriend and I are pretty hesitant on getting the Japan tickets because moving the trip up 2 months felt pretty rushed. However, I had pressed the fact that we need to make a decision soon because this deal wasn't going to last much longer. Because they're my friends and I was a little more willing to take the leap and buy the flight, my boyfriend suggested that I just work something out with my friends first, and if he can make it, he'll join too.\n\nI explain the situation to my friends who had already bought the tickets and ask if they can move their flight to Japan to May so that it could better align with my bf's and my schedule a little better. After some back and forth, we agreed on mid April. I buy the flight with them and it turns out that we were all able to get the same flights so it was pretty ideal.\n\n**YOU CAN START HERE TO SKIP THE BACKSTORY**\nI tell my boyfriend that my friends and I all booked the same flights to Japan, and he should really try to get his flights asap as well so that he can get the same flight back with us (he's joining for the second half, and will be arriving separately) because we don't know how long they're going to be available and for this cheap. He says that he's going to do it tomorrow (Monday) because it was pretty late and he had just gotten home from a flight.\n\nMonday morning comes around, and I check the flight prices. I let the bf know of a few options where the flights are still cheap and hopefully last, but naturally bc it's work hours, he's busy with work. He suggests that we figure it out after work bc he's got his hands pretty full. After work, we look at flights, but unfortunately the ones that would have had the same flight back as us are no longer available (other options still have decent deals). \n\nMy initial reaction was to blame him for not getting the tickets earlier like I was suggesting when I had said to get them asap. And so I was quick to point my finger at him. He got pretty hurt by it because from his perspective it was out of his control - he was really tired getting back home from his flight at around midnight, there was a lot of work stress during the day, and neither of us could have anticipated the flights selling out that fast.\n\nHowever, I just couldn't get the idea out of my head that it was his own fault for taking so long even though there were external factors at play. We got into an argument, and he suggested that he should just opt not to go anymore because it felt like I didn't want him to go with how I was blaming him. To him, it felt like he was just an add-on to the trip, one, because they're primarily my friends, and two, he'd be flying in and out by himself, rather than being with the group for at least the return flight. I felt bad because this hasn't been the first time where I made him feel second to my friends and that he wasn't as important. \n\nEventually I decided to cancel my flights with my friends so that I could fly back with my boyfriend. I chose a flight where I would still arrive around the same time as my friends, but I would have to fly by myself there in order to get the same flight with the bf back. After cancelling and making the change, he felt bad that now, for my trip with my friends, I won't be able to fly with them. And he felt as though he has negatively impacted the trip I was planning with my friends because I won't be able to fly with them. However what's done is done and I'm just glad that I get to travel with some of my favorite people. \n\nAITA for blaming him initially? Because after taking a step back knowing that he gets pretty sensitive with this kind of stuff, and that there's a lot of stress going on in his life currently, I felt like it was pretty asshole-ish of me. I'm just trying to get an a less biased perspective.\n\nTL;DR Told bf to get cheap flights asap. Bf got preoccupied with work and life and ended up missing out on them. I blamed him for missing out on it bc I told him to get them asap but he didn't.",

      "description": "I've (29m) been with my partner (25f) for 8 months. My one complaint is while I'm generally easy going. I feel like she blames me for things that aren't on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've recently moved back in with my mother, I'm close to saving up for a deposit on my own place. My mother has been really accommodating and will drop me to where I work in the morning if she's going out. My partner works fairly close, most of the time she works odd hours as she does shifts, this morning she was in an hour later than me and mentioned last night that she might get a ride with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my partner sleeps over a few nights every week so is well aware of when I have to leave, or so I thought. We both woke up about half an hour earlier, she had her phone beside her and I was asking her to check the time every 10 minutes to which I'd say \"ok 20 minutes left\" each time before I need to get ready and leave. I had forgotten that she'd mentioned about catching a lift the previous night which I know is on me. I get up and say \"right I'm going to shower dress and head\" to which she gets in a bit of a panic and mentions she needs to get ready. I tell her to go have a quick shower first and get ready while I'm having mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to the time constraint she wasn't able to get fully ready (makeup etc), it wasn't till we were walking up after the car journey that I realised she was being very cold with me and didn't hug or kiss when going our separate ways. I sent a message once I got in making sure she had got the connecting bus fine (ignoring the coldness from earlier, I understand people can get a bit annoyed when stressed and had expected this to be fine now). She was having none of it and tried to argue with me, making the whole thing out to be my fault. I tried to briefly explain that my mother had an appointment and that I would have felt bad delaying her because she's going out of her way to help us out but she just ignored it. I asked if the roles had been reversed would she feel responsible or would she feel like I should have been more organised to which I didn't get a response to. I didn't want to argue about it so I just said I had to go into a meeting and I'd talk to her later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs previously mentioned I'm generally very easy going but this has lead to people taking advantage of me in the past, I eventually begin to resent it so I'm trying to stick up for myself a bit because I believe even though it's sometimes easier to \"do anything for a quiet life\" it's not healthy, I do care about this woman and I want it to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering if I'm the asshole for not swallowing my pride and apologising, I'm afraid that doing this will open me up to be a punching bag for anything else that goes wrong for her and I feel like I deserve better in that respect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole, could I have handled this better?",

      "description": "This story isn't super long but, I met a friend a little over a year ago. He is transgender and our small group really helped him out during his \"confession\" (i can't think of a better word) and being harassed/bullied about it. We don't hang out very much anymore but still text sometimes. During our text conversations, he frequently brings up topics like suicide and depression that make me uncomfortable, and it's not hard to tell that he has depression and often thinks about suicide. I eventually got kind of upset because he kept treating me like a therapist and keeps trying to get me to help him. I say anything I can and try to help, but in the end, I'm no therapist. Honestly, this really annoyed me. I kept getting fed up and frustrated whenever we talked. I then started to tell him how I think he needs help and should talk to a professional about his problems and not me. He got kinda upset about this but reluctantly followed my advice. It's been a couple months and we haven't talked or texted since he told me he got a therapist.\n\nSo, AITA for getting mad at my friend for treating me like a therapist, then saying he should get an actual one?",

      "description": "(I’m on mobile so I’m sorry in advance)\n\nMy best friend Kat and I have been friends since kindergarten so we’re practically sisters. Recently I was diagnosed with a very rare form of brain cancer and while we caught it early enough doctors believe I’m a high risk for relapse in the future. Essentially I have been given 15 years max to live. Recently I held a WIG party where my hardiresser and close friends brought in wigs and shaved my head. This is where the problem starts. Kat has been sucked into one of those essential oil MLM’s and has become somewhat of a soul sucking banshee but despite all that she’s been supportive of me and she’s still my best friend. I’ve dealt with her saying her oils could do better for me than chemo and telling me I’m just killing myself faster by not using her oils so I’ve been close to my breaking point for awhile. I finally broke when Kat showed up without a wig or food but with a huge poster board of her MLM along with some of the products she sells. I of course started sobbing and all of our friends ripped Kat a new one. Kat has sent me some pretty nasty emails saying I’m not supportive and her mom has called my mom to scream about how ungrateful I am. I don’t know if it’s just my emotions being out of sorts or the anxiety of everything going on but I feel like a huge asshole. ",

      "title": "WIBTA If I told my GF that I longer want to travel with her?",
      "description": "My girlfriend (lets call her D) and I both love to travel and have taken about 4 major  trips together.  Although I cherish our experiences and memories, I've concluded after our last trip that I don't particularly enjoy traveling with D and feel that I'd be better off traveling alone or with a friend who shares similar interests. I've always envisioned traveling the world and have finally reached a point in life where I can afford to do so but I feel as though I'm stuck with a completely incompatible travel partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust to break down and summarize where some of my reasoning comes from:\n\n\\+  I feel as though I always have to diminish my expectations to accommodate D's in order for us to come to a mutual agreement (if even that). For example, D loves going to very touristy, tropical regions with beaches, palm trees, and resorts. I prefer to either stay in the city  among locals  or out enjoying nature while camping/hiking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\+ I want to experience what life is like for the residents of each country I'm visiting and try to keep an open mind to new experiences and cultural differences. D on  the other hand seems to find very little joy outside of what she permits as normal or acceptable. Anything else is met with skepticism, condescending remarks (not out loud, just to me)  and an overall passive-agressive attitude. D got very upset while we were in London &amp; Paris because people kept \"shoving\" her and the waiters were \"rude\". I tried explaining that they were very busy cities and that no-one was intentionally pushing her around, its just how things are. I also warned her beforehand that servers in Europe may not be as overly accommodating as in the states (which I loved). Needless to say, she didn't seem to get it and I've  come to understand that she still yearns for the American experience even while on a completely different continent.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\+I often end up feeling as though I'm babysitting. D's situational awareness and resourcefulness while traveling is..... not so great.  I have to be by her side at all times or else she would be completely lost due to a combination of poor navigational skills and not paying attention. She doesn't  try to learn the local currency which often forces me to handle all of our financial transactions, which then forces me to hold all our money at all times. This means that we can almost never separate unless she's tucked away safely at the hotel for the night.... She also seems incapable of handling her own belongings. Apparently I'm responsible for cramping all of her crap into my bag(s) and carrying it for her. After one of my bags ripped from being over packed, I strongly suggested that she pack her own for our next trip. She refused, which resulted in us having to buy her an emergency satchel while overseas that she ultimately ended up requesting that I carry it instead. If I ever refuse to carry her stuff, she will make a show out of how heavy, cumbersome, and uncomfortable it is for her to carry on her own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\+ D doesn't seem to have a very big sense of adventure while traveling. She prefers to plan our days around tour schedules and attractions (that I keep track of) , but as we make it  back to our hotel from the activities (usually around 9 or 10) she's ready to call it a night. I prefer to walk around and get familiar with the city. I'm not a club goer in any way but I do enjoy certain aspects of nightlife and especially enjoy it in new places. I like to spend my nights drinking and mingling with locals and other travelers. D doesn't quite understand the reason or necessity for this and she's not much of a drinker at all. I feel that I've met some amazing people this way and I find it to be an important experience for me while traveling.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\+ This one may sound ridiculous but its kind of a big deal. D doesn't seem to understand how to adapt or blend into her surroundings when necessary. Whenever we travel she seems to adopt this temporary persona where her dress attire transitions from normal to flashy, lavish, and somewhat gaudy/revealing. I've found myself in very uncomfortable positions in not-so-safe areas due to the amount of attention she draws. We often get one of two reactions (or both).... Locals will often assume that we have vast amounts money to spend and so we constantly get bombarded by street peddlers/merchants. Or overly aggressive men will boisterously whistle, stare, and hit on her while I'm there. This puts me in an extremely awkward, stressful, and uncomfortable position, especially if/when we're near a poverty-stricken neighborhood.  I always have to consider the worst potential outcome of these situations. We could get robbed because we caught the wrong kind of attention at the wrong time from the wrong person. Or we could get separated and men may become a bit more aggressive without me being by her side.... It just always feels like we have big targets on our backs in these situations which puts my anxiety through the roof and makes the outing far less enjoyable. These occurrences happen at a much lesser degree whenever I'm walking about alone (late at night or during the day).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've explained all of these points to her on multiple occasions, but they either fall on deaf ears or cause an argument with neither of use coming to terms. Either way, I'm determined to enjoy my next trip to the fullest. WIBTA if I told her that I don't enjoy traveling together and that we should do so separately for now on?",

      "description": "So me and three others live in a dormitory together, and while it used to be a tight ship (rotating duties on bathroom cleaning and emptying the trash) it has since fallen to a bit more of a relaxed state, which means the trash has overflowed. This is gross, so I took some initiative and took it out and replaced the liner, expecting to get things sort of back to how they were.\n\nWell the other day I'm doing my thing when I hear someone rustling in the trash bin, and I see my roommate Terry balancing a lid on top of a box he's just shoved in the can because it's full and now it cannot close properly.\n\nMe: \"So you gonna take the trash out?\"\n\nTerry: \"Why don't you?\"\n\nMe: \"Uh, because I took it out last time. And I didn't fill it up just now.\"\n\nWell Terry shakes his head and just walks into his dorm. Ok, fuck me. I forget about it until the next day when I catch Terry as he's about to leave the room, \"Hey, you gonna get the trash on your way out?\" He shakes his head and just leaves. Well, later that same day (just yesterday) he sits by me for dinner and I ask him \"Hey, did you end up getting the trash?\" And he says to me: \"Look, youaintlaboeuf, I promise you, I will get the trash, but you have to stop being a smartass about it.\"\n\nWell this pissed me off, so I tell him \"Well, you should've taken a minute to take the trash out when you're the one who filled it up.\" Safe to say that was an awkward dinner.\n\nI see him back at the dorm later and for 4 full hours he walks by the full trash, lid precariously placed on his shoved-in box, to go sit at his desk and play video games or to use the bathroom.\n\nI am pissed, but I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong here? Should I just take it out myself (I probably will), and if I do should I say something to him about it?",

      "description": "Hi AITA for understanding a joke I saw as serious?\n\nMy friend and my best friend  planned to mess with me and they did by saying they had a secret between them and I couldn't find out about it. Curious to know what it was I insisted that I would find out, my friends got a kick off of seeing me irritated like that, but it got me irritated so much to a point where I got really fed up with this I told my best friend I'd tell someone important about one of his secrets to find out(I wouldn't actually ever do that, I just really wanted to find out what it was). The joke between them goes on for a few more hours of the day and it has really made me irritated because we're all friends and tell each other's secrets and sorts so I didn't see a reason for them to hide anything from me, my friend ends up teasing even more despite me having to go home quickly so I'm already stressed out and sick of their game at this point. Then finally it got to a point where I said:\"I'm going home I don't have time for this.\" My friend got sad and then once I saw this I came back to make up with them. We both go home and call each other, they said I need to take a joke, while I argued that I do need to lighten up but this joke went too far. Feeling very guilty since my friend began to question my trust for both of them I apologized, I was still left feeling bad after that though, I know I'm sometimes too serious but it just felt like the joke wasn't funny, it reminds me of when I used to do those types of jokes with my younger brother (which I later realized he hated, so I knew I should stop) where someone or two people want to mess with you for their own personal kick out of it over an extended period of time. I don't mind if it's light jab for a few minutes to an hour, but when it's an on going joke intended to mess with you for around a quarter of your day and you're the one who has to apologize for reacting in a certain way then blamed for not trusting either of them it really makes me question who the person in the wrong was, I might be a sensitive person but this is a \"joke\" that didn't feel like a joke or even a funny one for that matter.

      "description": "This is kind of a situation that has spaned over most of my life so sorry for the long read. \n\nSo this all started when I was in 5th grade. Our neighborhood didn't have a lot of kids and A new kid moved into the neighborhood. Wasn't long before we because friends and eventually best friends or so I thought. We had a relationship where we were rough on each other like typical guys or so I thought. We would tease and insult each other. While my insults we're pretty infrequent and superficial his got progressively more frequent and more specific to me attacking how skinny I was or weak. Eventually turned to punching my arms or legs pretty hard and wrestling me when everyone knew I didn't stand a chance. I kinda accepted it was how friends were. I was a nerd in school and didn't have a lot of friends so I thought it was normal. Eventually I started hanging out with his whole group more and more and likewise the insults occurred more and more. It eventually started really messing with my self esteem and how I saw myself as a person. At the time I just thought I was being over sensitive. Things got worse after we both lost loved ones, he developed a drinking problem and I basically through myself into work, working 40+ hours/week and going to school By senior year of high school my self worth was all but non existent.\n\n I get to college and make a whole new set if friends, I completely 180 from who I was to who I am. To the point where I wouldn't even recognize who I was back then. I hung out with him a few times over the summer when I was back from college but we drifted apart pretty rapidly after I left. He was a lot better at this point but not perfect and I was also extremely busy with school. He eventually got a girlfriend stopped drinking and had a kid. \n\nLooking back I know the relationship wasn't healthy and I was effectively being bullied. There's a lot more dynamic to the relationship it wasn't all bad we had lots of good times typical to a normal friendship but it wasn't all good either.\n\n He reached out to me recently and I entertained the conversation with the standard how have you been etc. I can tell he has changed for the better but I still kinda resent the relationship and don't really want anything to do with trying to reconnect. He even reached out to my sister asking about me and why I was being distant she didn't respond and immediately texted me. I replied that I'm a completely different person and didn't want to reconnect.\n\nI'm glad he got help and changed his life around. I had forgotten a lot about that time if my life till after he reached out clearly wanting to reconnect with me. I honestly don't want to go back down that relationship path I am very happy with who I am and where I am at in my life. So am I the asshole for not wanting to reconnect even though I can tell he has gotten a lot better and we are both in better headspace.",

      "description": "Throwaway account.. Some context: I am in sales but I don't get a commission, I get a profit share where I get a % amount of profit after exceeding a certain threshold. Prior to December, I was on my own team and if I billed out more than, let's say $50,000, I made a % profit on the excess. So I billed out $60,000, I would get a % on the $10,000. I usually nearly meet this threshold, but I've made it a few times for a nice bonus at the end of the month. My coworkers and I each specialize in certain products and it just so happens that my products sell for more money than my coworkers'. Some of my coworkers never have and never will meet their threshold and make profit share because of the nature of what they sell and that's just their fate. I'm sympathetic to their fate.\n\nThat said, my coworkers and I at the same location were all put on the same team starting December. This was done without my input or approval. Now, we collectively have to exceed about five times the individual threshold, around $230,000, to make profit share. After that, we split 5% of the excess equally, or about 1% of the profit would go to each of us.\n\nI hope my problem with this is apparent. Some of my coworkers just don't bring in enough money to even get close, and looking through the books, this team has never once even gotten close to $230,000 in sales in a month. I brought up my concern and was told that it's on me and the other big earners to carry the team. I'm willing to give it a few months and see how it works out, but, effectively, my threshold doubled, maybe even tripled, over night without any input from me, and then I would have to split that profit equally. I'm sympathetic to the fact that my coworkers need help, but there are others in my organization that are individual and easily blow past their profit share every month, sometimes by $20,000 or $30,000, and they don't split that with us.\n\nI feel like I'm a jerk and like I'm selfish for being upset about this, but seriously???

      "description": "I had boarded the train prior to the family of four ( the parents, a girl and a boy both around 5 years old) and managed to get a seat from a corner seat. The train was quite full but there were about 2 more seats at the other door. However, the family squeezed on the train at the last second &amp; went over to the empty seat beside me.\n\nThe parents told their son to sit on the seat (prob because he was the younger kid) and he kept whining loudly that he wanted his older sister to sit beside him while pointing to my seat.\n\nThis small train that I was taking has seats against the sides, parallel to the doors and has only one carriage. So mind you, his whines could be hear throughout the carriage. His parents did nothing to quieten him down (honestly the seat was big enough for the 2 of them in one seat lol) and i decided to just let him have the seat.\n\nWhen i got up, the parents lifted the girl into my seat and did not even acknowledge me. And their kid still continued talking loudly. Within a minute, we reached the next stop and they got off. (The stops are really short) \n\nAt this point I was rather annoyed and I said outloud to my sister something sarcastic about how they were only going to take one stop after they were out of the train.\n\nAITA for making that comment that some other passengers probably had heard it too?\n\nHonestly, the incident only triggered me because my soles were hurting as we had been walking around the whole day &amp; i really wanted a seat but this is irrelevant because its my own problem.... \n\nBut is it entitled of me to want any acknowledgement that I had given up my seat for their kid? Even a smile or a nod would have sufficed...... ",

      "description": "My (21f) boyfriend (21m) and I have been together for four years. We are about to move out together, after basically living with my parents for 18 months or so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have discussed potential compromises (chores, house decorations etc.) and are agreed on 99% of things. We made an agreement for him to be home between 21:30 and 22:00 on a weekday. Weekends wouldn't necessarily have a time, this is just so it is more of a compromise. The issues I have don't go away on the weekends, but I'm more likely to see my friends and family on the weekend too. This would also exclude anomalies, like concerts or family meals etc. But, as a basis, 21:30 is an agreed upon time for him to be home, with 22:00 being used as a buffer for traffic or losing track of time. His friends have told me I'm being controlling and abusive by expecting this from him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason this is even an issue is because I have pretty bad anxiety about being on my own. My parents once left me home alone, and I couldn't handle it and had to stay with someone else. I had a rough childhood, which has left me with almost consistent feelings of anxiety. I don't mind being alone during the day, but when the sun starts to set, it's like a switch within me that makes me instantly anxious. He knows this, and he knows my past, whereas his friends don't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere will be times where this isn't relevant, if I want to go and see family, or my friends, but the simple fact is that I don't have as many friends as he does. I sometimes see his friends, but whenever I am around them, it is made abundantly clear that they are his friends, and not mine, and so I try and avoid them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are due to move out next week, and it is making me feel awful that they think I am controlling him. The last thing that I would ever want is to control him. From my perspective, it is agreed upon, and actually suggested by him, as he wants to better his routine. I would never force him into doing this if he hadn't agreed on it. But, when I made this point to his friends, they said the only reason he agreed to it is because he feels bad for me because I don't see my friends as often as he does. This isn't the case at all; I like the fact that he is close to his friends, because he has a relationship with them that I can't fulfil (I really do not know how to play FIFA). I also prefer to not have many friends, as I'm a massive introvert.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother issue also comes from the fact that my best friend is a guy that I dated in high school. I have no feelings for him, and my boyfriend knows this, but I know he doesn't necessarily trust him. So, if every time my boyfriend wanted to stay out late, I had my friend over, it would seem as though I'm 'punishing' him. Or that's what his friends said it would seem like. I of course would not be punishing him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do, and want this sorted before we move in. So, am I the asshole? Is there a different solution?",

      "description": "A little backstory: my fiancée and I have been together about 8 years. However, for the past year and a half, we have been doing long distance due to me getting experience in my field of discipline and her moving away to go to medical school. \nBack in the fall of last year, she started her second year of med school. She soon started letting the stress of school start to really affect her as I had found out she had started drinking heavily (she is now in AA). A few months later, I had found she was coping with the stress by smoking several packs of cigarettes everyday (she has always hated cigarette smoke). Even more recently while visiting her during the weekend, I noticed a paper towel in the trash can with quite a bit of blood on. When questioned about this, it was revealed to me that she had begun self-harming herself. She showed me her arm, and it looked like it had been cut a hundred times and was still bloody from where she had obviously done it that day. When asked who knew about this, she stated her doctor, a school counselor and two of her new friends (one of which has an extensive history of self-harm). \nAfter returning to my place following the weekend, I contacted the other friend since she had known longer than me about this and wanted to know what her perspective was on all of this (my opinion was that things couldn't keep spiraling out of control and that she seriously needed to take a break from med school because her health was the most important factor). What I was informed from the friend was that this was definitely the first she had heard of the self-harm and even smoking habits.... Even when my fiancée had told me that her friend's reaction was to cry when she found out (fiancée later says she got confused about who knew and thought that she had known....). \nFast forward to now, this friend has decided to cut ties with my fiancée because she has said she has helped all that she can and that it is starting to affect her life. My fiancée says that I had absolutely no right to contact her friend to discuss this (I would have never told someone that did not already know) and that her doctor agrees that \"I crossed a line\" by reaching out to her friend. Am I the asshole for trying to talk to my fiancée’s (now past) friend regarding this new destructive habit?",

SHE TRAPPED ME. \n\nMy fiance and I are in the middle of cuddling and watching some stupid horror b-movie on our bed. Its shit so we're not really watching it. Out of nowhere, she asks me if I love her. Sometimes we have some gushy wushy love talk sessions when we're bored. \n\nI reply, \"What kind of question is that? You know I love my baby.\" \n\n\"Do you reaaalllyyy?\" We do this a lot. Sometimes it leads to sex so its fine.\n\n\"Well of course I love my poo bear. Do you love me too.\"\n\n\"I love you with all my heart. You're my best friend.\"\n\n\"Love you too.\"\n\n\"Am I your best friend\" as she pinches my arm, the trap is being set.\n\n\"Sure.\" \n\n\"Am I more of a friend than (insert name of my best friend)\" \n\nThe trap is sprung, I can either chop my leg off or slowly wither away and die. I choose the latter.\n\n\"You're my best girl friend.\"\n\n\"(best friend) is a better friend than me?\"\n\n\"(best friend) is my best friend, you're my heart.\"\n\n\"You're my best friend.

The way I see it a mans best friend is separate from his wife. You have your best friend, you have your wife. Separate things.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Here's the scenario from a week ago. They're over at my house smoking. I was holding onto the blunt too long so my friends girlfriend (also my friend) says I need to pass it. Completely valid. He says \"he paid for it don't tell him what to do\" \n\nI honestly agreed with his GF because I like to keep things fair as far as smoking among others go. Idc who pays for what. Well she gets offended and they bicker back and forth for a while and I remind them to quiet down because I don't like the yelling. \n\nWell they give eachother the cold shoulder for an hour which leads to more bickering here and there. Eventually she says \"screw it I'm going home\". He says that's fine and She leaves.\n\nTurns out she didn't actually leave. She's just sitting in the car pouting. She then decides to text MY PHONE \"tell joe (her bf) if he wants to talk to me then he's gonna have to come out here\" \n\nI told him it's not worth it. Mostly because I didn't want my neighbors to see two adults arguing in my driveway cussing like sailors over something so stupid. \n\nShe could have left. She instead decided to continue the charade by not even leaving when she said she was to just drag on the drama. \n\nI understand that couples have their issues but this seems like it happens way too often and is completely unnecessary. \n\nAt the same time I feel like I may be trying to habe too much control over the situation if I tell them to leave their arguments at the door or not come over at all.\n\nIf I did ask for that WIBTA?",

      "description": "I'm currently a first year at uni, and live in university accommodation with 5 others. Whilst everyone in my flat is definitely less close with each other than what I've seen with other people's flats, we all get on well and have no issues with each other at all.\n\nUpon meeting my flatmate (Let's call her A) she was pretty outgoing and super nice, especially when I was ill after freshers she'd always offer some sort of medicine when she saw me in the kitchen.\n\nA short while after introducing A to friends of mine from high school, she quickly dumped her bf from home and started dating my friend from school, who we'll call B\n\nThis is where I saw issues with some of A's behaviour:\n\n-A had essentially sealed herself off with B's friend group, making no attempt to make any friends at university or join societies/sports clubs,  and A's friendship with the group rested on her continuing to date B\n\n-A actively made an effort to not make friends even with people from our housing block. This included deleting friend requests on FB from people who had met her from the block, ignoring people on the staircase (which had offended  people from the flat across), and when me and some others had plans for a floor dinner to give everyone a chance to meet people from the other flats, she would lie about having too much uni work and instead have B over in our flat.\n\nIt was clear that if A and B were to break up, she'd be left in almost total social isolation (she is friends with another girl from my flat), which is exactly what happened.\n\nA now often complains that she has no friends at uni, but l think it's her own fault. I sat down with her to show her all the sports clubs on offer during first term, and had encouraged her to try and make more friends and go out of her comfort zone, she would agree but there was no actual effort there. She locked herself in with B and is now paying the price for it. \n\nA had also lied to me both about the breakup and other smaller things, which made me lose the little sympathy I had left.\n\nThis being said, I know for a fact that she has problems that she's been dealing with, but I don't think it justifies her lack of effort towards expanding her social circle. I see a lot of what I was like in early highschool, but I actually made effort to change and I'm in a better place because of it.\n\nLong story short, I've got no sympathy for someone who makes no effort to change their situation.\n\n\n\n",

In my opinion, if you live in a building like that with other people you shouldn’t own anything bigger than a small Bluetooth speaker.  I’m so angry, maybe it’s irrational.

We all got along fairly well within our core group, and though issues arose, the close proximity meant these things usually had to be dealt with amicably. \n\nPresent day, nearly a year after graduation: I'm living with two of my former classmates. I get along with them both, though one more than the other. We'll call this one A, and the other roommate B. \n\nRecently, B's girlfriend got into a row with one of our friends (we'll call her C) who tends to be a pillar of our group, the one who is at every gathering. This happened a few months ago, and I'm not good at keeping up with drama, but I do know that B and his girlfriend blocked this friend on every platform. I don't know how much the situation has changed, but given that they probably haven't seen each other since, I don't think it's improved much.\n\nRecently, me and A hung out with a bunch of our classmates (without B), and we had a blast. I suggested that people come over to our place for the next bash, as we haven't had the chance to show off our apartment yet. A was on board, as was most of our group, but C said that B wouldn't wanna be there with her, and would probably take off to his girlfriend's. I haven't asked B yet, because there are two outcomes I see: either he agrees and feels the need to leave his own apartment, or he says no, and that just leaves us all feeling resentful.

We got along very well and after I quit the job there we stayed in contact. I liked her but never wanted something from her but tbh she was flirty sometimes during work. \n\nSo one evening she started texting me that she misses me and that we should do something together. She suggested that we should go swimming. I kindly declined her offer because I knew that she was in a relationship with her long time boyfriend and that it would feel odd if we went swimming together. She was okay with my declinement but when I asked if her boyfriend was okay with her going swimming with other men she said that „he does not have to know“. \n\nNow a week later I stopped by my old workspace and I talked to her a bit where she said that she was leaving in a minute and that we could go together. \nI walked with her when she suddenly did not went to her place and turned to her friends house which she has keys for. She asked if I want to hang out a bit and went upstairs with her where things went to another. Afterwards she told me that we should keep meeting like that. I said I was okay with that. \nI honestly feel a bit guilty for being a affair partner but am i a asshole for that?\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for blowing up at my son after he failed to meet my expectations by not getting into UC Berkeley or UCLA?",
      "description": " \n\nMy personal background (this is relevant, I promise): I’m the youngest of 4 brothers and the first in my family to go to college. My parents have retired from rust belt factory jobs, and my 3 older brothers currently work at similar jobs. Meanwhile, I obtained a doctorate in experimental physics and currently work at a large, internationally known tech company. \n\nMy son is a smart kid. No doubt whatsoever. Straight A student until sophomore year of high school. He’s probably read every book on World War II in the local library. He self-studied high school level mathematics as a fifth grader. In middle school, he captained his school’s quiz bowl team for all 3 years and led the team to a second place finish at a national level competition. His teachers even gave him special recognition at his 8th grade graduation. In short, he was an excellent student.\n\nI worked as a lecturer for the introductory physics courses at the local state university while my son was in elementary and middle school. I wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about teaching but hey, it helped pay the bills and I was (mostly) liked by my students. Over time, I slowly began to dislike my teaching job. At the same time, I created a plan for my son’s future education. To that end, I studied for and obtained my RHCE certification by the end of my son’s 7th grade year. I applied to several smaller companies in the SF Bay Area that summer and obtained an offer from one.\n\nNow, here was my plan for my son: Since the state I was living in at the time (Louisiana) did not have a good public university system, I wanted my son to attend high school in California. That way, he could get in-state tuition at either UC Berkeley or UCLA. Even though those schools are not easy at all to get into these days, I had every reason to believe that my son had what it took to get in.\n\nI accepted my job offer, rented a room, and drove to California right before the start of my son’s 8th grade year. My wife, son, and daughter stayed behind because there wasn’t enough time to look for an apartment, sign a lease, and move across the country before the start of the school year. Also, I wanted my son to spend all 3 years at the same middle school. The spring after I moved, I flew my family over to California for a week to look at apartments and high schools. Eventually my wife, my son, and I decided on Henry M. Gunn High School in Palo Alto. \n\nMy family and I moved into an apartment in Palo Alto in August 2014. The rent was outrageous and the apartment had only 2 bedrooms but I was willing to put up with it for the sake of my son’s future. I remember an incident about one week after my son’s freshman year started. After dinner, I asked my son how he was doing at school and what he thought about California. He said that the weather was nice, the other students were mostly friendly, and that the open air campus was a refreshing change from his middle school. But then he started crying about how he was having trouble making friends in California and that he missed his old friends in Louisiana very much. I reassured him that he would make friends in California as well. But then he said “Dad, you don’t understand” and went to his room.\n\nMy son did end up forming a small circle of good friends during his freshman year. As the school year went on, both of my kids said that they wanted to visit their old friends in Louisiana over summer break. I said that they could as long as they got straight A’s, which they both did. \n\nIn the past, my son was never particularly into video games. He did play some Pokemon and Mario Kart in elementary/middle school, but those games never affected his academic performance. When he was in Louisiana, his old friends introduced him to a game called League of Legends. It’s also important to know that when my son becomes truly interested in a subject, he will obsessively research it. There is a reason why he read almost every book on World War II in the library when we lived in Louisiana.\n\nFor reasons still unknown to me, my son’s interest in League of Legends began to rival his previous interest in World War II. I once caught him playing at 4AM when I went to get a glass of water. He started watching streams when doing homework. I tried several methods to limit his amount of time spent playing League of Legends, but he found a way around them every single time. When I wrote a shell script that limited his time spent on League of Legends to 90 minutes per day, he partitioned his laptop’s hard drive and installed OS X on the other partition. When I created a firmware password so that he could no longer partition his hard drive, he biked 4 miles to the Apple Store and had them reset it. When I resorted to confiscating his computer, he cried and said that League of Legends was one of the most important ways he had of staying in contact with his old friends in Louisiana. I told him I would return it if he got straight A’s on his mid-semester progress report, which he did. I honestly shouldn’t have given it back, because he ended up getting 2 B’s at the end of that semester.\n\nLeague of Legends honestly ruined my son. Academics were never his primary focus anymore. He went from getting straight A’s to having 1-3 B’s per semester. In the spring of 2018, my son’s college admissions decisions came in. My son was rejected from 8 schools (S/A-tier UC campuses + private research universities), waitlisted at 2 (UC San Diego and UC Irvine), and accepted at 2 expensive out of state public universities (Purdue University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Throughout that spring, I held out hope that my son could get off the waitlist at either UCSD or UC Irvine. When that did not happen, I told him his options:\n\n1. Enroll at either Purdue or UIUC, despite the financial strain it would place on the family\n\n2. Enroll at UC Merced, the bottom tier UC campus\n\n3. Attend community college for 2 years, then transfer to UC Berkeley/UCLA\n\nI was not enthusiastic about (3) because I felt that it would be difficult to transfer into a S-tier UC from a community college. My son was similarly unenthusiastic because he didn’t want to live at home for 2 more years. He was even more vehemently against (2) because he felt that UC Merced was beneath him. That left us with (1). I thought “I’ve already lived for 4 years in this 2 bedroom apartment for the sake of my son’s future and I have a decent amount in my savings account. Sending him to the best university he got into will be worth it.” My son eventually chose UIUC over Purdue because he was admitted to EE at UIUC vs Physics at Purdue. \n\nAfter his first semester at UIUC, I had my son show me his grades. To my great disappointment, his semester GPA was only 3.0. I sternly told him that I did not pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition just so he could give me such low grades. He then replied that college was a completely different experience from high school and that even people with 4.0 GPA in high school find it hard to maintain 4.0 in college. I disagreed with his assessment, but since we were on vacation in San Diego at the time, I only told him that he should work harder next semester.\n\nThis leads to the incident this past Friday, my son’s birthday. I called him that evening to wish him a happy 19th birthday. Our conversation went something like this:\n\n“Happy birthday son. In case you didn’t read my last text yet, I just paid your tuition for this semester”\n\n“Thanks dad.”\n\n“Don’t forget what I said in San Diego: I didn’t pay all that money for you to get 3.0 GPA, so can you promise me that-”\n\nI didn’t even complete my sentence before my son started raising his voice.\n\n“Dad, can you fucking quit it with the obsession about grades? Ever since high school you’ve never-”\n\nNow I am pissed.\n\n“Son, do you know what you are? You’re a disappointment to your mother and to me. We sacrificed so much to send you to Gunn so you could attend Berkeley and look what we got in return! Your friends are at Berkeley and Stanford because they worked hard and got straight A’s in high school unlike you. Also, they’re probably applying to all sorts of internships right now but you? You’re afraid to show your face at a career fair because your GPA is so shit! They’ll throw your resume straight into the trash! You know all too well how I grew up in that factory town and how hard I worked to be where I am today. I don’t even want to call such a lazy shit like you my son anymore. You must at the very least-”\n\nAt this point, my son hung up. I tried calling back him but he never answered. Around an hour later he texts me:  \n “Dad you’re such a fucking asshole. A real father would never call his son the shit you called me. You know what else a real father would not do? Create a grandiose fucking plan such as yours for his son when his son is too young to fully understand it. Why the fuck did you move me to California when you knew full well you were taking me away from the network I built in Louisiana? Maybe you could have given me some god damn emotional support in high school when I needed it. Instead, you spend all that time fucking with my computer trying to stop me from playing League. Guess what? That just made me want to play it more. Jokes on you, Dad. I might just have gotten into Berkeley if it wasn’t for your constant fucking interference regarding League. That was the entire point of your fucking plan, right?”  \n \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here for being pissed at my son for wasting tens of thousands of dollars with nothing to show for it? Or is he the asshole for not working hard enough in high school? Or are we both assholes?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "description": " \n\nThrowaway here because people know my regular account. \n\nI’m getting married in June. I’m going to have my friend Jim as my dude of honor, and my friend Jane as my bridesmaid. \n\nJim and I have been friends since college, but my friendship with Jane is longer and a bit more complicated.\n\nWe started to be friends in high school where we were friends with two other girls (they’ll be important later). Typical teenager and 20 something drama happened, and I’m not close with the two other girls anymore. One straight up said she didn’t want to be friends with me anymore, and I guess the other friend just followed her lead. I’ll admit that Jane and I used to be closer when we were younger, and we drifted apart but I still considered her a close friend.\n\nWhen I got engaged I asked Jane to be my bridesmaid. When I asked she was kind of hesitant. She was engaged too and said we’d probably be planning weddings at the same time and she was worried she wouldn’t be able to devote a lot of time to my wedding. I told her it was going to be super laidback and she wouldn’t have to do much and that I wanted her there, so she agreed. \n\nPlanning the wedding has had its own ups and downs (lots of drama from family), but Jane has been a good enough bridesmaid. My friend Jim has been planning my bachelorette, and they both went to see me get my veil. I think she could stand to be a bit more involved, but considering distance and time she’s doing enough. \n\nWhen Jane first got engaged, she wasn’t even sure if wanted to have a traditional wedding. She was talking about doing something really small and only inviting immediate family and close friends. It turns out that she actually is going to have a ceremony and reception in the fall. \n\nI awkwardly found out over dinner after pushing her for wedding details that she was planning on having bridesmaids, and I wasn’t one of them. She claimed it was because I live far away (not really, we live on different cities on the east coast and are about a train ride away) and she didn’t want to bother me because I’d be busy with my wedding and marriage. \n\nTo make matters worse, the two girls I had a falling out with are of course in the wedding. \n\nIt hurts so much since I assumed we’d all be together during our weddings. I’m hurt. Jane and I went through a lot together and I really wanted her to be a part of my wedding. I’m hurt that she doesn’t feel the same way. \n\nWhen I told my mom she was shocked and said how rude Jane was. My fiancé said it was okay to feel hurt and that it was a dick move, but that Jane also has a right to have whoever she wants in her wedding party.\n\nAm I wrong for feeling like this? Should I confront her? I don’t even know if I want her in my wedding anymore. ",

The LL then got back to me with an itemized list of charges. The state statute is very clear, after the 90 days LL forfeits any right to withhold anything from the security deposit. I pointed this out in a reply, and demanded my deposit back. LL is now claiming I'm using a technicality, they're also claiming that they could have charged more but were nice not to. \n\nKeep in mind also, according to the statute, LL could end up paying treble damages if I have to sue for the deposit.",

      "description": "I asked my father to pick me up from high school today because he didn't have work, so he drove with my sister to do just that. So my sister texts me telling me that they've arrived and are parked near an elementary school across from Store 1. She also tells me shes on the road perpendicular to a large, main road. However, there are two elementary schools on opposite sides of my high school and coincidentally, they're on the exact same road (and both on the opposite side of the store). I admit I might be a little ignorant, but I only knew of one of the elementary schools so I headed towards that direction. I walk down the entire length of the road (about 5 min) and still don't see our car, so I decide to text her again. I'm getting a little frustrated at this point and I ask her where they are, and a couple of minutes later she asks why I'm not calling her. I facetime audio, ask her where the car is, and tell her my location. We have a short conversation about where the car is and I tell her where I *thought* the car was (I'm sure both of us sounded frustrated), and she replies \"why would you think that? There's so much traffic over there. *You're stupid.\"*\n\nI'm pissed. We argue on the phone and eventually hang up. I know where the car is, though, and once I get in (after my 5 minute walk back), she says, \"So you made it.\" I reply, \"Yeah, but you didn't have to call me a retard over the phone.\" We proceed to yell at each other, her blaming me for not picking up the phone (my phone has a prepaid sim card and I ran out of money. I was using a portable hotspot for facetime and imessage), and me claiming that I didn't know about my phone or the other elementary school. My father joins in, yelling at me for being an ungrateful prick and eventually threatens to throw me off the car. He doesn't hear me out and I doubt he knew that my sister called me a retard.\n\nI do think it was a stupid argument, but I still want to know if i was the asshole.",

      "description": "I have had the flu for the last week and have been doing horribly. High grade fever for two days straight, weak and fatigued, just super shitty in general, missed 4 days of work. My boyfriend, who I don’t live with but have been dating for about a year and a half, is a foreman in the construction industry, and has known I’ve been sick the entire time. In fact, he had stayed the night prior to the morning it hit me like a ton of bricks. He mentioned several times that he “better not get it”, which I understand, he can’t really miss work when he’s running the project. \n\nAnyway, we’ve been texting the whole time I’ve been sick, and he’s been sweet and all, but absolutely refused to come by even when I told him I was hallucinating from a fever and a little frightened being by myself, which I legitimately was (100% not trying to be manipulative or whatever). I’ve been lonely and feeling like complete dog shit and several times almost passed out when I stood up which legit scared me. At one point, he asked me if I was eating and drinking enough and I had told him that I hadn’t been able to keep any food down for a couple days but that I had been drinking water. He asked if I had Gatorade and I said no, and that I was in no shape to leave the house to get any. He insisted that I should get some, but didn’t offer to get it himself or bring it to me, just that “you probably really need it”. \n\nI haven’t had anyone else helping me out or coming by and he’s been fully aware. So am IATA that it’s now been a week and I’m full on fucking pissed that he’s avoided me this whole time? Like, I’m starting to feel better and I don’t even want him to come over now, he just texted me to see if I wanted to watch a movie tonight and I *really* feel like telling him to fuck off, but I haven’t replied yet. Again, I understand that it would be really shitty for him to get sick for plenty of reasons, but ffs, is it asking too much that my boyfriend show up and comfort me or just make sure I’m physically ok?\n\nSomeone help me out with some perspective please? \n\n\n",

      "description": "TL;DR I might be pregnant. I want the maybebaby, so does SO. But I’m clinically depressed and have a moderate drinking problem. \n\nThe highlights are that we’re a “stable” (stable in that our relationship is strong and we’ve been together for 10+ years), suburban couple in our mid 30s. We have 2 other kids in the house, both of whom are pretty demanding due to being on the spectrum/mental health issues. We have a stable income and live in a well to do middle class area with good schools etc. My SO and I always discussed having 1 more child, especially one close in age to our youngest who is almost 3. Our 3yo is suspected to be on the spectrum but diagnosis pending until she’s a bit older. I have been unable to work for the past year due to severe depression and chronic anxiety. I am medicated and in long term treatment but still highly symptomatic. I’m also a “reactive drinker”. When my mental health spirals, I tend to want to escape into a bottle (or 3) of wine. I don’t get drunk in front of the kids but it does upset my SO. He and I both actively monitor my drinking and I hold myself accountable to him and my counselor about what and how much I drink. It’s an openly discussed problem and I am using my support network to improve. When I’m not depressed, I don’t drink to excess. \n\nI am pro choice and am considering whether or not I should terminate this pregnancy. My SO would understand but I’m not sure he would be able to accept it. I too would hugely regret a termination. But when I look at our current circumstances, I’m unsure that we would/could be good enough parents to another baby, and how the extra stress would impact our kids. While we could financially support our family, and would love another child as much us our current kids, we’re a bit fucked up right now. \n\nWIBTA if I kept the baby knowing it would be born into a difficult home/family? I’m so torn. ",

Im guessing because she's broke and wanting to get high. \nBut an I the asshole for not dishing out more money?\nI do plan on moving, I have applications out for income based housing as I'm older and can't work like I could 20 years ago.\nJust wondering.

      "description": "Next Saturday is my Birthday and my girlfriend had planned that we‘d go play lasertag with 8 of my friends. I do however not have 8 close friends and thus she invited a few guys as well that are somewhere in between an acquaintance and a friend. My girlfriend paid €220 and each of my friends would pay only €10. All 10 of us are university students and have very limited budgets. \nOriginally this should have been a surprise but I asked her to tell me beforehand because I have a lot of studying to do and need to plan my time accordingly. \n\nI feel like she created an economic incentive for my friends and not so close friends to come to my birthday, which I absolutely hate because i‘d only want to see the friends on my birthday that also want to see me not the „friends“ that want to have fun on my girlfriends budget. Additionally I feel like she just spent too much money. \nBecause of that I asked her to either let everyone know that they need to pay their own share and to tell them there is no obligation to appear after the initial commitment by them or to just call it all off and say i‘m sick, which she decided to do as the other option would have been very difficult to communicate properly. \n\nShe is now really sad and mad at herself as she feels like she should have known i‘d not want her to pay any of that. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n",

      "description": "This is going to be a fairly Catholic question but I am looking for all the advice I can get. (Quick note: I am a confirmed Catholic, but after my confirmation, my parents and I left the church. To the active Catholic community, I am a lapsed Catholic who has become secularized, whereas my fiance and his family have always been in the Catholic community.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend proposed to me 6 months into our relationship, I did say yes, I love him very much and I can see us having a life together. To most people on my (secular) side, we are moving fairly fast. However, to the Catholic community he is a part of and raised in, we aren't moving fast enough. A few days after the proposal, everyone in the Catholic community began asking when our wedding date was going to be. After some weeks of consideration, tossing around a few dates (did I want summer, fall?), I put my foot down and set our wedding date in the winter at just over a year and a half away from our engagement (i.e., 26 months from when we first met). This was 100% my decision, me setting the day and my fiance agreed (mostly by saying he was just happy to show up). But after the date became official, the questions began. People I barely knew from the church would come up and ask me the wedding day then immediately ask why the date was so far away. On its own I know these aren't hostile questions, but the more time goes on, the more accusatory those same questions become. More then once, I have been asked if there was something \"wrong\" with our relationship and if that was why the date was so far away (I don't know exactly what they mean by 'wrong' but I dislike the implications). \n\nI can handle these questions, they aren't fun to have thrown at me every Sunday after mass, but I can handle them. The part I can't handle is the jokes. People my own age in this community, people who I met through my fiance and who are our friends, make jokes about our wedding date. These jokes are everything from \"oh, guess you can't do (insert traditionally married couple activity) until you're married! Too bad you put the day so far away haha\" to borderline cruel where I get told I'm not in a real relationship and 'playing house' (my fiance and I are living together, much to the dislike of my fiances family but that's a whole other thing). Some people don't even try to hide their judgement, at a New Years party I was called out in front of the whole party and my drunk fiance for having a wedding date so far in the future and then berated for, in essence, 'sullying' my good Catholic fiance with my secular dating practices (not the first time this happened, doubt it will be the last). After that party, I broke down and my fiance agreed to actively start helping me combat situations like this, instead of continuing his \"happy to show up\" jokes. \n\nI could continue to write up stories like this but the just of my question is, am I an asshole to my fiance for making him wait to get married? I know I get this treatment because I'm not one of the 'good-olde-Catholics' but this is affecting him too, his friends are giving him this same treatment and, if I'm not enjoying this treatment, he can't be either. We have everything booked now, one advantage to a date a year in the future is plenty of time to plan, so the date isn't moving now. But I have to know, am I an asshole for choosing a date so far away and making my fiance uncomfortable with his own community? \n\nI know there's a lot to this story and I hope I made it make sense and provided enough info, but I really am looking forward to the advice from anyone else who's dealt with situations like this, Catholic, secular or otherwise. Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to read this. ",

      "description": "Throwaway account\n\nMy GF(25F) and I(26M) agree that her family has issues with picking favorites. The brother has had 2 cars bought for him. My GF's sister has had one car given to her. My GF was the first in her family to have to take a loan out for a car. Oldest brother had 5 years of college paid for, neither of the sisters did. Took an extra 4 years for my GF to get her license because she's the only child her parents didn't teach - she eventually saved enough money for an instructor. \n\nGF just finished college and is trying to get a job together so she can scrape up enough money to make payments on school/car loans, and move out of their house and in with me - but as a teacher where we are it's been difficult. \n\nRecently, my GF's mom had to give up her drinking addiction, but now the parents are taking vacations 1-2 times a month to go gamble. I can tell this has been affecting my GF. Especially because they ask my GF to \"babysit\" their dog. By the time they ask (maybe a day or two in advance) they've already planned the vacation and have \"no other options\" at this point. So my GF has to cancel any of her plans and stay at their house so they can go gamble. I've told her to just say no, but her parents are very good at convincing her. \n\nThe final straw came when my GF told me that her family was leaving to go gamble for the three days before Christmas. She'd be stuck at home alone watching a dog for 3 days, while I'm busy with the holiday plans that were already made. \n\nWe both agree that when she moves out she'll be much happier. My real question is about the fact that I didn't go to Christmas at her parents' house. I felt that they chose gambling over family, and would do so again in a heartbeat. I also felt that SOMEONE had to tell them \"No\". \n\nI let my GF know ahead of time that I wouldn't go, that I didn't feel comfortable around her family, and that I was sorry that she was caught in the middle of it. I've also expressed a number of times that I think her family is still suffering from different forms of addiction and I think her agreeability is helping enable it. \n\nShe was already upset that she'd be stuck alone, and was feeling down about her family. We planned to celebrate Christmas at both families' houses on Christmas. She still came to my family, and has been very upset that I didn't come to hers. \n\nSince then she's said that she's not going to tell me anything about her family any more, which I think also means she doesn't have anyone to vent to. Should I have put these feelings aside for one day and spent a few hours with her family? Or am I justified acting on the things she tells me about her family? ",

      "description": "I guess I should preface this with some info. I (20F) have been with my husband (21M) for several years. We got married last summer and live together at university. \nWe had a healthy sex life pre-marriage, but recently I haven’t been as into it (I don’t know why). My husband is always into it, and it feels like even minor flirting with him will end up as sex. I try to fake it for him, because I really do love him, but it makes me sad, and sometimes he catches on and gets upset. When I deny him outright (like he has told me to do), he goes and isolates himself, sometimes for hours. Lately he seems less into me, and I’m so scared. \nWe’ve talked about this quite a bit, and it usually ends with a decision for me to try and increase my libido. I really do try, and he says he understands, but it’s like he wants sex every night, and either I give it to him or we have a long conversation into the night and I’m almost too tired for class the next morning. \nThis is starting to affect my schoolwork and our marriage and I just don’t know what to do. I feel like it has something to do with his untreated depression and I always feel awful for not wanting to always have sex, because he spirals into an awful depressive fit more often than not. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: my sex drive is low, my husband gets upset and standoffish because of it, I feel obligated to fake it for him, and it’s starting to affect my schoolwork and our marriage",

      "description": "Throw away account since I have friends who know my main account.\n\nSo just a little back story here, my girlfriend works in the medical field and is very successful, and she has no money issues whatsoever, so the price isn't what's bothering me.\n\nMy gf and her ex dated over 10 years ago and stayed friends after breaking up. They dated in their early 20s and now we're all in our early-mid 30s. I've never had a problem with him hanging around, and I've never had any reason to think they were still seeing each other. He comes over all the time and he's a chill dude, we get along fine. \n\nRecently he'd been having car issues, and he doesn't make enough to be able to fix them all right away, and buying a new car was completely out of his budget. This is when my gf told me she was going to buy him a new Tesla model 3.\n\nShe's never been one to spoil him with gifts or give him charity at all, sometimes he'll stay for dinner but that's really it. So this was a big shock to me. I probably had a bad initial reaction when she told me because the first convo ended in a big fight. I asked her why she felt the need to do this for him, if she was still in love with him, had they been fucking, and a lot of things I really shouldnt have said. She just told me that what she did with her money was none of my business, and it was \"the least she could do\" for all the support her ex had given her over the years.\n\nI think this is completely ridiculous. I get that it's her money, but this just reeks of a giant red flag. Spending $50k on an ex just because he's having car trouble is insane to me. She told me that I was being unreasonable and if I had such a huge issue with this, then we'd have to \"reconsider things.\"\n\nShe already bought him the car and now is waiting on the delivery, and she and I haven't spoken in about a week. I've talked to some friends about this and its about 50-50 on whether I'm in the wrong here.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

At first it was amazing (definitely honeymoon phase) and that lasted a while. Lots of cuddling and intamacy (not talking about sexual). My love language is a Physical Touch with a dash of Words of Affirmation. His love language is solely Acts of Service. What started out as a very fulfilling physical relationship has turned to pretty much zero physical contact. I know he loves me, he says 'I love you' and he always cooks me dinner. He does the laundry so I have clean work clothes. He fixed my car in the middle of a snow storm. But he doesn't hug or kiss me unless I ask. And cuddling is right off the table. We sleep against either side of the bed. Its breaking my heart, and making me feel unwanted. I can rationalize it and tell myself he loves me but I dont't feel it. I'm having a hard time with the feeling of instant rejection when I go to cuddle in bed and he asks me not to. I know he loves me and shows it in his own way but am I an asshole for feeling terrible that I don't receive love in my own love language?",

      "description": "My girlfriend left my place moments ago to get space. I think she left feeling hurt that I ruined what she wanted to do and me feeling that she ruined what we had planned with a surprise which could have been pleasant if it had been done differently. Am I the asshole here?\n\n**Backstory:**\n\nI'm 26 and she is 36. We've been dating for a few months now. There have been a few times where I felt she was unreliable with plans already made or things she said and didn't follow through with. There have been a few occasions where she wasn't ready at the time we had planned on. There have been a few occasions where she said she would call/message in a while and didn't. Or she would stop over when something was done and didn't. Or changed her mind altogether.\n\nMy previous relationship ended with me breaking up with my ex because she continuously blew me off last minute for other things. One time we were planning to see a movie and she said she would rather hang out with some friends. I wasn't invited and later came to find out they had gone to the movies. This hurt me deeply and to lookout for myself I called it quits with that relationship. It had become a pattern.\n\nI shared this with my current girlfriend and on the occasions I mentioned above rather than bottle things up I let her know that it bothered me so she wasn't new to how much being reliable meant to me. I said it along the lines of I don't think there are a lot of things which bother me much but this is a sore spot and something that ended my previous relationship and with it bothering me could she please be considerate of that.\n\n**Which leads us to tonight:**\n\nI had spent the night at her place and before leaving to do some stuff I put out there that maybe we could do something later. She knows I've been wanting to go see a movie together for a while. As I was finishing up at the gym at about 9pm I asked if she would like to see a movie.\n\nThe conversation went like this:\n\nMe: I could go for some chicken tenders and an ice cream cookies sandwich. What about you? (the theater has food)\nHer: What time\nMe: Would you like to pick? I know I'd like the tenders ice cream and you. Not too worried about which movie or time.\nHer: Sure let me look :)\nHer: Okay I picked that happy death day 2 at 10:30pm is that okay\nMe: Yes, done.\nMe: I'm home now going to have a protein shake. I'll be back over in time for the movie.\nHer: Is there anything you want me to bring\nMe: Not that I can think of.\n\nWhen I was leaving the house I told her I was on my way and she said no don't go she is on her way. At that point I was in the car just down the street but no big deal I went back home. She gets over and comes in, sits down for a few minutes and I play some music. We were timing the movie to get there missing most of the previews. I was very much looking forward to and planning on being warm with a blanket at the theater and getting food there because I was hungry. As I was putting my coat on for us to go out the door she tells me wait. That I have encouraged her to speak her mind and go with what she is feeling. I asked what's up. She said she doesn't really want to go to the movie now and would rather do something else. She isn't sure what but will I come along for a surprise night. She mentioned going to a graveyard or some railroad tracks or out to a bar to get a drink and shoot pool. I told her that yes she is most certainly free to speak her mind but those things didn't interest me at the moment, my heart was set on getting food and being cuddled up watching a movie. I said I didn't want to be outside in the cold (New York) and we had gone out to a bar on Friday already. She asked why I couldn't be more open minded to surprises. I responded that I'm okay with surprises but I didn't like how last minute this was after we already had plans and were almost out the door. I told her I believe that had she instead suggested a surprise night earlier such as at 9pm when I first asked about seeing a movie, I would have been receptive to it. I followed up with, can we still go see the movie tonight and do a surprise something another time? She said no, she isn't going to see the movie now but I am welcome to still go myself. I said okay you can go do what you want and I'll go see the movie and I don't like that we ended up in this situation. There was some more back and forth at which point I likely would have missed the beginning of the movie so I changed to I would stay home and find something to eat.\n\n**Change of plans:**\n\nLet me admit I was upset now and took a snarky tone. She wanted me to go along with her for the ride and see what happened. I asked if we could still take care of me getting something to eat and not be in the cold. So there I am and we're in the car. She stops for gas and we're talking. I brought up again that reliability is very important to me and that I felt this was her being unreliable and reminded her that it had ended a relationship before. I'm not sure how rough it came across to her. I didn't mean it as a threat, rather I was distressed and urgently trying to convey how important this was to me so that it would be taken seriously. She said she would just take me home. I said here I am already with you, I can stay quiet if you like, let's just do what you want to do and make the best of things. She took us to Walmart where she proceeded to wander around and get nothing. As we talked while walking around she divulged that she had wanted to go to her father's grave but I had ruined that for her and she was no longer in the mood for it. I said I wish she had said so sooner, that I thought that would be a sweet thing to do and that I was up for doing that. She lost her father about a year ago which I am sympathetic to. I went on to say I would be honored to go with her and that I recognize the significance of her inviting me there. She reiterated that it was already ruined for her at the moment. I asked how long she had known this was what she wanted to do. She said it hadn't occurred to her that it was what she wanted to do until when we were leaving the gas station.\n\nAt that point I wasn't happy but was talking about salvaging the night doing something and said of all things I didn't want to just walk around Walmart. So we left and she said she would drop me off at home. I said we could watch a movie at my place, still go to the graveyard, go out for a drink, do something to end the night on a better note. She could come in or we could go to her place. Reluctantly she came in but just started cleaning stuff. We weren't doing anything together. She said I could start doing what I wanted and I said what I wanted was to do something together. She said I told you in the car I didn't want to do anything together right now and want space. She got her coat and left. \n\nSo from planning to see a movie and have food to being here writing this. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Both my friend and I are 27 years old. Known each other for almost ten years now. College educated(she's almost done) and both live with our boyfriends. I've been with my guy for almost six years and she's going on only nine months with her guy. Last Sunday we got together, just she and I, and we started talking about our futures. Where we want to live, marriage, houses, babies, etc. Regular stuff people in their 20s probably talk about. So when we got on the subject of children, I said that I was in no way ready to have kids. Financially speaking for the most part. She kind of seemed surprised when I said that. She said she wasn't either, but I could tell she was forcing herself to say that. She also said it was due to money. She then proceeded to tell me that she isn't on birth control and had a pregnancy scare about two weeks ago. I asked her why she wasn't on anything and she said that everything she's tried messes with her hormones. Which I can understand. So I asked if she uses condoms. NOPE. She says they both hate them. Ok, yes its better without one, but for gods sake use one. So I said condoms are better than nothing and they can prevent pregnancy. She huffed at me and said, \"well you know, if I were to get pregnant, Tim(that's not his real name) would be totally ok with it (insert uncomfortable giggling here from her) and I know my parents would help us out. \" \"And then I know he would propose too.\"  (insert more uncomfortable giggling from her) Would they though????? And is she sure he would be ok with that??? Has she actually sat down with him and spoken seriously about this? She lives in a one bedroom apartment with him and can't afford internet or gas money, or money for going to a laundromat. Occasionally I invite them to dinner they say no due to financial struggles. How would she care for a child if she can't pay for food? It would be irresponsible of BOTH of them!  How is she so nonchalant about the possibility of getting pregnant?  That scares me as her friend. So I called her out and told her that she's being risky and irresponsible and it would probably be a mistake, and she should wait to have kids. She then left my house all in a tizzy and I haven't heard from her since. So, AITA for being upfront with her about this? ",

      "description": "I’m on vacation with my family and my sister and I decided to go to the pool at the hotel. We sit down at a pair of chairs under an open umbrella and stay there for a little. There is only two other people at the pool at this time. \nMy sister and I decide to go into the pool. While in the pool, one of the two other guys at the pool  who is sitting close by to where our chairs are asks if we minded if our umbrella was folded up so the sun wouldn’t be blocked for him (since the sun was moving the umbrella was now starting to block the sun near to him). Of course we say we don’t mind at all, we’re in the pool rn. \nThe guy just then kinda stares at us, implying that he expected us to get out of the pool to fold up the umbrella (not one that we brought nor even opened) at our chairs for him while he is sitting 5 feet from it. This continues for 5 min or so until he says in a flustered manner to the bartender at the pool bar, “so sorry to bother you. We asked them if they would fold up their umbrella, and for some reason they won’t. could you please do it, so sorry that we had to ask.” \n\nObviously nothing so scandalous/important but it really bothered me cause it just seemed very passive aggressive and entitled to think that cause he wants the umbrella (that is the hotel’s and was up when we got there to sit under) down that we should get out of the pool and do that for him while he’s sitting there out of the water and close by. But i dont know if I’m over exaggerating and I really should have done it.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "Some background...\n\nI met my(28F) ex-FWB(36M) about 2 years ago when I was in an open relationship and well lets be honest, he was stepping out on his own relationship. Long story short we fell in love and I thought we were going to have a relationship. We did not. I got over it and met my current SO who I could not be more happier with.\n\nEven though we didn't work out, we still stayed friends ( he consider's me one of his closest if not best friend). However what he considers \"friends\" and what I consider \"friends\" are two different things. For him our \"friendship\" includes heavy flirting, reminiscing about past sexual experiences we had in graphic detail and hinting, covertly and overtly, about picking up where we ended. Most of our talk is me steering him away from these  topics and trying to have a normal conversation that isn't NSFW or something I'd be ashamed to have my current SO listen in on. But he still continues and uses his charisma and charm to breeze past my boundaries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrent times...\n\nMy former ex-FWB is , with his GF, coming back to CA  to visit his GF family ( he moved to SC about 6 mos ago) and is heavily insinuating that he wants to have sex with me when he gets some free time and  while my SO is at work. I  oscillate between  jokingly laughing off this talk or  saying no, not happening but he keeps pushing the issue, saying it will happen since he \"knows the effect he has on me\". I finally get super fed up and vehemently tell him I am under no circumstances cheating on my SO and at best I will have lunch with him. To which we have the following conversation \n\n\"Well, I guess I'll just have to take it then.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Take it?\"\n\n\"Well, it's obvious you are putting up a fight because you don't want to feel guilty, so I'll just take it. This way you can just say you had no choice, thereby feeling less guilty.\"\n\n\"You mean you are going force me to have sex with you??\"\n\n\"Not really since we both know it won't be force once we get into it but just a way to get things started. This way you can live with the secret so to speak.\"\n\nWe had more conversation after that but I can't remember most of it clearly but the gist was he's not above using force to get over my fake resistance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my best friend about the convo and she immediately said block him and practically did it for me. However, I'm feeling like maybe I should have let him know why instead of just ghosting/blocking him, especially since he considers me a close friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for blocking him after that phone conversation and not telling him? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: Ex-FWB wants to have sex with me when he gets to town and is willing to \"force me\" to get it, blocked him after what he said without telling him why.

      "description": "Background: Growing up, my mother and my father weren't the best couple; it was always off and on. I never truly liked my father, but some times were enjoyable. He has never really done anything to support my younger brother, me and my older sister. (i.e. one time he bought us a GameCube for Christmas and took it back the next day (never got it back) so my mother bought us one to make us feel better). Anyways, things like that my siblings and I got from his side of the family thought our childhood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast-forward to me when I was 15-16 years old. I witnessed my father drive drunk with my baby step-sister in a blizzard. I was eventually subpoenaed to testify what I had witnessed. The baby's mother took him to court over custody. There I was, 15-16 years old testifying that I saw my \"father\" drive drunk with my baby sister. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring this whole thing, my father's side of the family basically disowned me, including my grandmother. They told me I would never make it anywhere without them, made me feel like shit, and haven't really talked to me since.\n\n Since then, I moved away (3hours) to college, I am currently in the final semester of a Masters program. I am currently 25 years old and very happy with life, I have a house that I own, and a small family (SO and dog). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago, my grandmother got really sick and ended up in ICU at a hospital one hour away. No one from the family contacted me to let me know what was going on or anything - I found out from Facebook. \n\nAITA for not visiting? I feel like I should, but I do not really know any of that side of my \"family\" anymore. I would feel awkward visiting and talking with them after what they had done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Fathers side of family basically disowned me at 16yrs old for something out of my control. Now 25 and grandmother is dying. No one has ever reached out in since disownment (?). ",

He was very sporadic on his feelings towards her. He said “i love you” after a week of initial dating, then said things were moving too fast. He was always flip flopping and she got sick of it and dumped him. When she broke up with him, he really freaked out. He said he was going to get his gun and kill himself. She also revealed to me then some troubling things he had done and said to her when they were dating.\n\nHe has a son from a previous relationship and he told her “I wish you were (son)’s mom instead of (baby mom)”. She also told me that he had made jokes about getting her pregnant and on one occasion had stolen and thrown out her birth control. \n\nThis isn’t even covering the fact that he was rude to me and all our friends the one and only time he hung out with us. \n\nSo anyways, apparently he has apologized for everything and admitted to her that he screwed up. She told me tonight she’s getting back together with him after a month of being broken up, and that he is MOVING IN with her next month. \n\nI told her it’s a bad decision and it’s too fast and that i can’t stand him, he creeps me out. I told her i don’t want to see him unless he is actually proving to make positive changes. \n\nShe said that if she could forgive him, then why couldn’t i?\n\nI want to support her but i think he is a monster.

My husband's family only speak Spanish, which I am not fluent in or even close. I try to communicate with them all but I can only speak very simple sentences and I don't understand most of what is being said to me. Belive me when I say I try to learn the language but it has been super hard for me to do so. Most of the family stop speaking to me once they realize I can't understand the language and with that I cease to exist. My husband tries to include me but after a bit he gets caught up with his family and I am left to myself, usually in a corner on my phone. Eating is a big part of getting together and and I try to include myself in the preparation but I am always cast to the side because I am a \"gringa\" and some how that means I am unable to cook anything. Tonight dinner has been prepared and as usual I have been left out, I am used to it so I just stayed out of the way. Time had come to eat and the table isn't large enough for everyone, seriously there is one chair and spot short, which means I am left out from eating. I was asked to wait until everyone was done and then I could eat. All the other wives are sitting with their husbands eating, talking and having a great family time. I am near tears, so I just got up and walked out and am now sitting in my car. I have refused to go back into the house to wait for my \"turn\" to eat, when my husband came out to get me. AITA for refusing to wait my turn to eat? Even though I'm sure everyone is wondering why I left and refuse to go back in.",

      "description": "AITA\n\nI was already 31 when I met my eventual husband. I’ve alway been very vocal about my feelings toward pregnancy and breeding in general. I don’t hate kids. I just don’t want them for many, many reasons. I also don’t understand why other people want them, but that’s off-focus.  \n\nAND I WAS CLEAR. This has always been an unwavering topic. So, we date for 2 years then get married. We are still on the same page at this point. (Again, I don’t hate kids. In the early years of our relationship, I talked frequently about becoming certified to foster in the future.) Fast-forward another 4 years and he keeps bringing up kids. After a few weeks, I finally asked him directly why he was pushing so hard right now. Well, it turns out it’s because there’s limited time left to have a child with me. WTF!? And then I asked him when i was ever unclear about my personal feelings. He said he figured I was joking or that I’d change my mind. What? I was 31 years old when he met me. I wasn’t some hormonal child. I wasn’t waiting to be talked into something. I’ve had OVER A DECADE to consider my decision. 1) I was always very clear about my feelings toward NEEDING a biological child. To me, it’s all very selfish. I don’t need something to have my eyes to feel love. What if I physically couldn’t have children? Where would our conversation be then? Also, now I’m 37 with high blood pressure and low income living in one of the worst developed countries for women’s health.\n\nSince I’ve confronted him directly about his jokes and passing statements, he’s doubled down. It’s very much an ultimatum. AITA for not wanting biological kids?",

I live with my mother because I’m a high schooler and my dad works weird hours because of his job so he’s asleep when I’m at school and at work when I’m home. Because of this, my mom has a lot of say in my life, what I can/can’t do or believe. \n\nMy mother is a massive democrat, just like everyone on her side of the family so I’m kind of alone, and in her mind “everything Republicans do is an act of war and democrats are the only people who can save society.” I lean a little bit to the right on most issues, but for her any lean right is too much. \n\nRecently she found out about what my political opinions are because she looks through my phone. She found that I follow Republicans on Twitter. She tells me that anyone who’s republican is racist and bigoted. \n\nShe consistently grounds because she thinks shouldn’t have the views I do.  Am I an asshole for not having the same views as my mother? Is there any advice for handling my situation?",

For the past 6 months I have started to have classes with her as well, and I have too developed feelings for her, but I want to ask her out. I have tried to talk mulitilple times with him about it, but he just refuses to adress it. Also one of my other friends thinks it's alright that I ask her out since he have had over two years to do something and done nothing, so that makes it okay for me to ask her out. So AITA if just ask her out anyway with out talking about it with my friend? \n\nTL;DR\nMe and my friend both have a crush on the same girl, him for a long time, and me for about 6 months, I want to ask her out, and I have tried to talk to him about it but he doesn't want to.

      "description": "So, it’s Christmas Eve and that means that it is literally not busy at all. We’re located in a highly populated city, and the restaurant I work in is downtown. Instead of restaurants that wait your table, we are like Chipotle or Panda Express when it comes to serving them. We have all of the food ready, you just need to select and we scoop it up for you to put in your bowl. \n\nAs my coworker is helping another customer, a man walks in. I greet him as usual and then he asks for food, saying that he’s got kids and they have been out on the streets for a while. He doesn’t have any money though. \n\nOur policy is not to give out food for free, especially to homeless. The city has a high homeless population. Being that it was Christmas Eve, I said, “Okay, but only rice and veggies.” He asks for meat but I tell him that I can only strictly give him what I offered. He tries to make a case for it but the other customer that my coworker was helping offers to pay a little extra so I could add meat to this man’s food, we end up charging her and she leaves. \n\nSo, I give him his food and put meat inside. As I was making it though, he asked for more portions but it would cost more so I didn’t add any. He then, takes out and talks on his phone and doesn’t listen to me as I ask again and again what he wants in his bowl. \n\nWhen I finally get through with making his bowl, he asks for more food. Obviously I say no, sorry I can’t. I already gave him plenty in terms of rice and veggies. He even asks for salt and pepper but we don’t have any. \n\nAs we hand over the bowl to him, he continues to ask for more and I finally ask him to leave. He calls me heartless and says that I will be awake at night since I didn’t give him food for his kids. While I acknowledge that my tone was not very nice, I asked him to leave. He asked why we are kicking him out of the store when he paid. I say, “Sir, you didn’t pay. The other customer did. You didn’t pay for anything. So I need you to leave now.” \n\nHe eventually leaves all while threatening to tell my manager about this, saying he would come back another day and tell her about me and how I was very rude to him. If anything, my manager would be angry that I tried to give away food. \n\nAnyway, AITA for kicking a “customer” out of the store?",

      "description": "Today's Valentines Day, as some may know. Now, besides never really celebrating it, I thought to myself it'd nice to pick up my gf from school, and give her a card that I've made her. I thought we were celebrating Valentines Day Saturday;we had planned to go to a ballet and get something nice to eat. But okay, today I had made plans to chill with my friend during the day, especially since 1) my gf had school all day \nAnd 2) my friend and I haven't seen each other in a while, it was like the one of the few days hes free. I\nAnyways were hanging, and as I'm spending my day with him, I'm  realizing he's kinda lost and thinks about going back to school  all the time. Things are going better for him, financially and time wise. So I thought \"hey, why don't you come with me to pick up my gf, you can check out and see the school yourself. You'd be able to see if you like the students that walk in and out, and there's an open exhibit  (I thought it was open until school ended, but less than half of it is always open. We get to school, and I text my girl (who, at the moment of writing this may very well be my ex) that I got to school. She had ended class early and I had only planned to get to her school 10 minutes before class was supposed to end. She ended up waiting 30 minutes for me cause she ended class 50 minutes early. Point in case, she gives the cold shoulder to me and my friend the entire ride home. We say by to my friend, we talk at her place, and she's saying I was rude an inconsiderate. I feel like she was being a bit too possessive and that scared me but I don't know if I'm being the asshol or not. She spoke with her mom, who's a therapist, and said that my gf's feelings should be acknowledged. While I acknowledge her emotions, I don't think it would've been ethical to not be there for my other friend, and hey, encourage someone to do something they're seriously thinking of doing but need some help. But maybe he didn't need help and maybe I was an asshole there too. Also, there was this inside joke inside the card I wrote her, but she found it offensive. HERE'S THE INSIDE JOKE : sometimes she says she loves me. I say \"me too\" and she's always laughed and said she \"hated it cause it reminded her of the #metoo movement.\" I assumed it bothered her, humorously,of course.So I ripped up the card made her in front of her. And left her apartment.\n\nTLDR: Valentines day fiasco involving gf. Something about not giving the proper attention.",

They are all pals and are very much \"lads lads\" in that there is a lot of slagging eachother and \"banter\". I don't necessarily fit that crieteria since I'm kind of a girly girl.\n\nI mostly get on well with them, but they can get personal very quick and it sometimes gets to me. They will \"joke\" that I'm bad at my job, I lack social skills, act condescendingly towards me and all of this, Infront of other colleagues who are not in their group which to me, makes it worse\n\nAt first I would take it pretty personally as I try my best at work, get a lot of praise from others about my work, ect. I learned to take it, laugh along and maybe sometimes fire back but never that much. \n\nFastforward to today, a girl who I'm friends with came into the office asking for help with her phone, that she needs to download a document from her phone, but she has no data. I offered her my hotspot, because I have unlimited data and it's no big deal. \n\nThe guys start making fun of me, saying I'm going to far out of my way to accommodate this request and I reply saying \"it's no big deal, if I can help I will\". They \"joke\" that I help people when I shouldn't (my manager included), bringing back an old case where the cleaner brought in a personal laptop, asking if I could get personal files off her broken machine, which I did because it took all of 5 minutes and she cried when I have her the usb with the photos on it. \n\nIn response, I said jokingly but kinda seriously (to my manager) \"well I remember a time when you asked me to set up a work laptop for your wife to use, but it wasn't a problem then was it?\"\n\nEveryone mentioned the tension and acted awkward, while my boss laughed and joked I had crossed a line and some things stay within the IT dept. \n\nAm I an asshole?\n",

Well I thought I was just in luck because I saw that the museum had a connection called \"public WiFi\". I connected to it and then it redirected me to a website where it asked for a password. Confused, I asked the lady guarding the door what the password was. She was happy to help me. After a bit of back and forth she determined that it was just a glitch and I didn't even need a password. She fixed it and I went on my way. \n\n\nWell a few moments later a hear a girl from my group (that I had never talked to) going on about how \"some bitch asked for the WiFi password\". She went on behind my back accusing me of disrespecting the soldiers and being \"too addicted to her phone\".\n\n\nI instantly felt bad but my friend reassured me that he would've done the same thing.\n\n\nTLDR; went to a war museum, asked for a WiFi password, girl said it was disrespectful.",

      "description": " I'm(20F) currently attending university in the US northeast, and I share a townhouse style dormitory with 7 other girls. The A/C in the house is controlled by 3 thermostats, one per floor. My best friend recently got a boyfriend, and he sleeps over in her room every night of the week (we have single rooms).\n\nSome new girls moved in this semester, and they like it cold, so my friend and I bargained with them that they wouldn't move the dial past the middle mark between \"Cold\" and \"Hot\". Cool, we all agreed that if someone is too hot, they open the window in their room to let in the freezing air outside. Glad we could agree.\n\nI noticed a week later that in the mornings I was waking freezing in a bed covered in 3+ blankets. I told my friend about how I keep finding the A/C dial moved to halfway or all the way \"Cold\". She casually told me that when her boyfriend comes over, it’s too hot to sleep, so she and he have been moving it down at night. I was baffled. She and I just told other people to stop freezing us, and she turned around and was the one doing it now!\n\nThis started in January. I asked her at least twice a week to stop for reasons including:\n\n1. We told the other girls not to make it cold, so you shouldn't do it.\n2. They agreed to open their windows if its too hot, why can't you?\n3. I don't sleep in pajamas, maybe you guys should try sleeping with no blankets or clothes to reduce how hot you get.\n\nHer corresponding responses were:\n\n1. But I can't sleep when it's hot, and someone keeps turning it up in the morning, so then I wake up. (Plot twist I was the one who was turning it back up to half way)\n2. Well &lt;boyfriend&gt; said that if we do that then the heat is just going to turn on more often, so I figured it isn't worth trying it out. (There’s no way of knowing where the temperature reader is)\n3. Maybe sleep with more clothes on? I've slept in long sleeves and pants since I was little, and I'm not going to change now. (So why do I have to change?)\n\nFast forward a month, and I was convinced by my boyfriend to buy a space heater because this petty argument is not worth having for 3 more months. Now I'm comfy and warm in my room regardless of what the other girls adjust the A/C to. I even had a conversation with her about why I bought the heater, and she said she felt bad.\n\nToday, she messaged me and said something along the lines of \"ugh &lt;boyfriend&gt; and I didn't even sleep together last night, and the other girls turned the A/C all the way cold. so annoyed with them making it cold all the time\". I just froze. Was she seriously complaining about other people making it cold in the house at night when she ignored my complaints for a month?\n\nI responded \"Well I unfortunately have no sympathy for you when it comes to the A/C bc you and &lt;boyfriend&gt; forced me to adapt to the cold, so the cold no longer effects me and I dont care about it anymore.\"\n\nAITA for telling her that I have no f\\*\\*ks to give and blowing off her complaint?",

      "description": "So first of all to clarify everything, this happened back in 2011 when I was still on Elementary School. This kid that I'm gonna name Mario was one of my only two friends at school, I'm gonna call my other friend Luigi. So the reason I had only two friends on my last year of elementary school it's because I'm on the spectrum so I always been having these issues to get to communicate with people. Mario and Luigi were 12 years old and I was 11 yrs old. This is a long one :&lt; sorry.\n\nSo me and Mario decided to make our science project together, Luigi pretty much decided to make his project alone bc he belongs to r/iamverysmart. And I don't quite remember what Mario and I were trying to acomplished but we kinda needed a wood little table, bleach and some other things I don't remember by now. We decided to make a test of our experiment at my house, the same day of the exposition (We had to go to classes from 12:10 m.d to 5:10 p.m that day) so he came to my grandma's house and we went to the backyard to get to work (We were basically home alone since the only adult at home was my uncle that has down syndrome). \n\nWe use some cheap gloves from a random supermarte to cover our hands, but after mixing everything the gloves started to melt so I got scared and took them away. Now, Mario takes one the gloves that are still melting and says something like: \"Don't be a coward!\" and throws the glove at me.\n\nMe, obviously, a kid with asperger and no reflexes just received the glove in the face. More precisely mi right eye (For anyone that may wonder, My eye still works, but not as a perfect healthy eye, I wear glasses with a hell of an augment on the right side and a .5 on the left side). When I was hitted by the glove it hurted of course (mostly I felt my eye was on fire) and started screaming and crying, my uncle had a wonderful response to this, he took me to the shower (clothes still on me), go me into the water and made me wash my eye (Wich I did terribly bad but neither of us notice that).\n\nAfter a couple of hours I decided it didn't hurt anymore and I was ready to go to present my project, but I was mad, I was gonna do it alone and without amy evil glove. Since the only two persons at home were a kid with autism and an adult with down, so we thought I was fine and cool for school (My eyebrows and skin around my eye were white, YES, fucking white).\n\nWhen I got to the school the rest of my clasmmates were asking me:\n\n\"What happened to you?\"\n\"What is it with your eye?\"\n\nAnd I didn't have a reason to lie so I just told them (Especific words, I remember using these ones):\n\n\"Mario threw bleach in my eye\". \n\nAfter that I went to sit down but the teacher called my mom to take me home. Mom decided it was cool to not take me to the hospital that day. Later that night my mom sended me to sleep but I felt uncomfortable and told her my eye was still hurting (I kept that to myself the whole day), she freaks out and takes right away to the hospital, doctor tell us I'm gonna need glasses for life and told my mom to not wait thatany hours the next time bc if she made sleep and took me to the hospital the next day I probabbly would have only one eye working by now.\n\nThe following year (The rest of it, from august to november if I'm not wrong) everyone stopped talking to Mario bc they were afraid of him bc I never explained how the bleach situation ocurred. I was mad at him for a week or so and then we started to play Pokémon together bc kids. \n\nAm I the asshole for ruining the reputation of the kid that nearly made me lost an eye or did he deserve it?\n\nThe next year Mario moved to El Salvador, I stayed in Costa Rica and I don't know what has been of Luigi, probabbly showing off his 28000 IQ and claiming to be more powerful than Shaggy.\n\nSorry for any grammar error, as said, I'm from Costa Rica so I don't speak english that much.",

      "description": "First time poster, long time reader \n\nBit of background info: I'm a doctor working in ER (Emergency Room) and as you can imagine it is busy at the best of times. It is hard to maintain a social life and go out to meet people. \n\nA while ago, I treated a patient who had a benign condition (was discharged within 3 hours). Lets call her Sally. There was a bit of waiting time for lab tests and etc, so Sally and her young son were getting a bit impatient. I built some rapport with the two by playing with the kid (making balloon animals using gloves etc). All the tests were fine and she left with some paperwork which always has details of the treating doctor.\n\nA few days later, Sally contacted me on instagram (she found my profile by the details of the letter) and basically said she was interested in me. I obliged and we went out on a few dates. Fast forward to about a week ago, we had been dating for 3 months. I had grown to really care for her child and I was falling in love with her. I finally introduced her to my family and told them the truth about how we met. Even though they really liked her, they were completely against the idea of us dating given how we met. My parents sat me down and explained why it was wrong and convinced me to call off the relationship.\n\nAfter struggling with their advice and the feelings I had for my girlfriend I finally made the decision to break up with her. I'm miserable but I think ive done the right thing. Since then my phone has blown up with missed calls and texts. Sally's sister has messaged me saying that I took advantage of her and forced her into dating me even though this is completely untrue. \n\nI cant help but feel that I shouldn't have broken up with her. I can understand why people would thing its unethical to date former patients, but im feeling really conflicted.\n\nSo reddit, AITA??",

      "description": "This is a throwaway. Me and him have been friends for years and we've been through a lot. We know everything about each other and until recently, i've never even had a negative thought regarding him.\n\nI think it's important to note that ive had feelings for him for a good while (im a male, we're both bi). I've generally just kept this under wraps as I didn't really want anything to jeopardize our friendship, plus i always had the general impression he didn't feel the same way. This led to a lot of heartbreak any time he ever talked in a romantic way about anyone, and any time he ever said he had a crush on anyone, i would feel destroyed. \n\nThese feelings created a giant sense of hopelessness inside me that stuck for a good while. Eventually I started to get over him once he started talking about some girl all the time and i realized i just had to move on. \n\nHe eventually got into a relationship and I genuinely was happy for him at first. The shock of this happening, strangely enough, actually got me to like myself a lot more, due to the sudden realization that im pretty much all i got. Ive always suffered through self esteem issues, so the fact that this helped me out just a bit felt like the bittersweet beginning to a new chapter.  But slowly I've started to realize that he's been communicating less to not only me, but our whole friends group. He's also just stopped hanging out with me in general, always making lame excuses as to why he can't. It's as if I've just been phased out of his life and i was never there. Like I'm sort of footnote, like we were barely ever friends at all.\n\nThis created feelings of deep resentment. Its reached the point where I genuinely get angry whenever he speaks of his gf. And that seems to be all he speaks of anymore. Every time he makes one of his excuses for why he can't hang out, i want to scream at him. I used to think of him and it would genuinely make me excited, but now I feel as if he's someone completely different, and sometimes, someone I just genuinely don't care for. Is this just my feelings for him making the situation look worse than it is? I don't know, but tell me.\n\nAITA for resenting my best friend that i also have feelings for? I don't think he's the asshole mind you, I just think he's caught up in the good feeling of his new relationship.\n\nTL;DR: best friend in the world that im pretty in love with went into a relationship and started paying less attention to me and all my other friends, which created feelings of resentment.\n",

His parents live up north so I had only met them on Skype.\n\nThe weekend before last we travelled up to meet them at their house (Big beautiful converted farm house. They’re loaded.) to have dinner at theirs for the first time.\n\nBut then I found out what’s for dinner.\n\nChinese food.\n\nOf course.\n\nAnd you know whatever. They’re old and they don’t understand how insulting it is to cook someone’s “ethnicy food” for them despite never even visiting the country so I just sort of brushed it off.\n\nBut it didn’t end there. When we were having dinner she literally asks me “So what do you think?”\n\nAnd to her credit it was really, really good. I had no idea until the ensuing argument with my boyfriend on the drive home but she is a well respected chef and has worked in Michelin star restaurants has books and stuff. But that’s not the point.\n\nSo yeah this gets my back up a bit. So I snap back with “Yeah it’s great. But I’m curious what make you want to cook a Chinese?”\n\nAnd she goes “I just thought you’d appreciate some home cooking. (Boyfriend) mentioned you missed it.”\n\nAnd it is true that I’ve missed the food my mother cooks because I cook anything that can’t be microwaved really.\n\nAnd I go “Oh? Home as in China?”\n\nShe replies: “Home as in, the food you’d have in your family home.”\n\nAnd that’s where the Dad starts, totally inappropriately “(Wife) has worked bloody hard to make this right for you, sorry but I don’t think you can sit there and complain when she’s trying to make you feel welcome in a foreign country.”\n\nAt that point I was done. I was born in this country and have lived here all my life. I didn’t say another word, got up, took my boyfriends keys and locked myself in the car sleeping there alone in the cold until morning. He came out to try and get me to sleep indoors or even suggested we get a hotel but gave up pretty quickly.\n\nThe next day on the drive back was a huge shouting match. He literally called me a “Selfish entitled cunt” and I called him worse things too. Which made me cry I was very upset by that and still am and he won’t apologise because I won’t.\n\nAnyway. His parents were incredibly problematic and were racist to me intentionally or not. AITA for not bowing down to their racism? Am I justified in being mad at my boyfriend for not only refusing to take my side but also calling me names?",

One day I let them come in so we could watch TV together. I fucked up and placed my laptop on the floor right next to my bed next to the wall so that they wouldn't accidentally sit on it or drop it jajajajaja! Big mistake, THE GIRL LEGIT JUMPED ON IT like it was some sort of musical mat!!! I was so mad because they are 5 old enough to know what it is right?\n I only mentioned it once to my brother like, \"hey 'the girl' stepped on my laptop after I told them no running around in the room, you mind giving me half so I can get a new laptop\" and him and his wife immediately thought I was the biggest douche for asking!! \"They dont know any better!!\" Should I ask again or should I suck it up because I guess I did initially fuck up?",

      "description": "It’s more complex than the title suggests. \n\nA few weeks ago I went out to a popular West Hollywood club with several friends to celebrate a friend’s visit to LA from NY. I stupidly drank that night for the first (and last) time in many years. I have absolutely zero tolerance for alcohol so an immediate black out ensued. Immediate. According to photos and friends we had a great time though and all made it home safely. \n\nA few days later I received a DM on IG from an older gentleman (he’s 40, I’m 25). He informed that we met and talked a bit at the club and that he also let me borrow his jacket when I got cold. Again I have absolutely no memory of most of the time night so I didn’t remember this person and I did not come home with a jacket so it’s obvious I drunkenly lost it. I informed him that I had lost the jacket, amongst other things that night and swiftly proposed to pay for/replace it. He refused and said it wasn’t necessary. I persisted and he insisted I didn’t have to pay for the jacket. Cool, right? No. \n\nIt became obvious very quickly that he was interested in me by an avalanche of “compliments” and very suggestive comments. Reddit, I would have never spoken to this man had I not been intoxicated. When he asked for my number,  I told him right away that I’m not sure what impression I gave at the club but I had no interest in dating/being courted/flirting or anything similar but that I was willing to talk to him as a friend. He acted as if he was okay with that. We spoke here and there for the next few days and he simply couldn’t hold back the suggestive, objectifying, and flat out perverted comments. He was making comments about my body, a lot of what ifs, and just annoying things. I warned him several times over the course of the couple of days were were talking, that I didn’t appreciate any of that and had no patience for it. When it persisted, I basically told him to fuck off. \n\nHe then called me a rude bitch and is now demanding I pay for the lost jacket. Typical nice guy act. The way I see it he’s saying “I didn’t want you to pay when I thought I had a chance at screwing you, but now that it’s clear I don’t pay for the Jacket.” \n\nAt first I was willing to, just to get him tf off my social media and phone but after reflection I’m like fuck this guy. Would I be in the right to block him and move on? Or should I pay for the jacket? ",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my busy bf to help clean?",
      "description": "The title may make things sound a little obvious but, there are some caveats to my scenario.\n\nMy bf and I are in our mid-20s, living together for a year now. We first had an apartment, then, I bought a house that we moved in to together. We had talked about this for 3 months beforehand and agreed on this process, him being involved in all the house hunting. He pays me to live in the house and half of utilities. We had some friends come stay with us last year, too, and they help a little with money, as well. Altogether, there are 4 of us, along with two dogs (ours) and a cat (the friends’).\n\nRight after we moved in, I started grad school, which is primarily online, and my bf started a tough degree program that currently has him on campus twice a week, but he has two labor-intensive online classes as well. We both work full-time, he is at work four days a week and I work three days a week, but my work week is still 36-40 hours, depending on if I leave on time or not. \n\nObviously, because of our schedules, I am at home more, and I kind of have to be home, since one of our dogs is still pretty much a puppy. Also, my boyfriend is struggling with his degree, which has made him pretty depressed and kind of difficult to talk to about a lot of things. Some of his biggest complaints is that he never has time to relax, he can’t get into any of his hobbies, and we haven’t had a vacation in over a year; all of these things come up daily, in addition to how much he hates his job and is starting to think he picked the wrong degree. \n\nBecause I know how hard things are for him right now, I feel bad asking him to do anything. However, I’ve done laundry, washed dishes, and cleaned to some degree for about three hours everyday the last four days, including days that I worked 16 hours and work the next day. My bf was off or only has a short shift each of these days. The days I’m off entirely, regardless of if he is off or not, I clean about five or six hours a day. Last Sunday, for example, I deep cleaned our bathroom and living areas for six hours, all while my bf played guitar. \n\nWhich, to some degree, is fine. He needs time to relax and decompress! It’s just frustrating because he hasn’t done much to contribute to the house since his semester began, which stuck me with everything, despite the fact that I work more hours and also have schoolwork. I know it seems to him that I have more time because I am “off” more than he is. I don’t think being “off” should mean that I automatically always do more household work. \n\nI don’t know how worthwhile talking will be, either, since his bad mood has made discussions difficult, as I mentioned. Last night, for example, I brought up that I’d washed dishes and cleaned the kitchen every night last week. His only reaction was “just stop doing it, then, I’ll just do it from now on.” Which is not what I was saying, I was trying to set up a more fair way for things to be done, such as if he cooks, I clean the kitchen, if I cook, he cleans the kitchen. But he just got on his phone and would not talk any further, making a big space between us in bed.\n\nHis actions are making me feel like I am the asshole, even if I make sure I am being non confrontational and try to ask if he feels like my assessment of the situation is unfair. He hasn’t spoken to me since I brought up the dishes last night, and it’s now 9:30 the morning of the next day. So, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Yeah I know weird title.\n\nSo my issues is as follows:\n\nA very good, longtime (since 1st grade) friend (we’ll call him M)of mine, recently (about a month ago) introduced me to another one of his friends (lets call her F).\n\nI found out that my friend fell hard for F some years ago, and has just not worked up the courage to tell F that he feels that way again, since the last time he was unintentionally kinda creepy about it (a whole other story).\n\nNow in the following three weeks since I met F, I became very good friends with her, with us talking nearly every day. Nothing wrong about that right?\n\nThe issue arose last week, when F came over to my place to finish up a show we’d been watching separately. All was good, until a few episodes in, F repositioned herself to be cuddling up to me. And that was when I realized I’d fell for her.\n\nSo kind of without any real verbal acknowledgement, we are kind of together, and I learned a day or two ago from my other friend that F has liked me for a few weeks now.\n\nAt this point it is important to mention that no one knows about this besides me and F, so it’s totally secret.\n\nBut I know M really likes her too, and he never got a real chance to try and make it happen, and the more I talk about M with friends of F, I realize more and more that he had been subtly dropping hints of some kind.\n\nAnd now I feel kind of guilt about it, kinda like I ‘stole his girl’, but the main feelings of being an asshole comes from the fact we’ve known each other for just over a month, while M knew F for years before I ever met her.\n\nAm I the Asshole here? Or am I just being an idiot?\n\nThanks guys.",

He's currently working full-time so I didn't think it would be a problem for him to pay the \\~$12 fuel money since i'm taking the \\~5 hours out of my day to help him out, but he proceeds to call me a selfish asshole and starts yelling at me to \"hurry the fuck up now\" and telling me he's never doing me any favours again, so I just told him i'm not going anymore and stayed home. Was it an asshole move to stay at home? Cause I feel kinda shitty about it since I won't be seeing him for a while, and now he's left on bad terms. ",

      "description": "So, it is agreed between me and my father that he buys me the bus passes I use, and most of  the time it goes well. Except, sometimes we don’t have time/forget to buy them, in those cases, I am forced to buy them myself, we have not any precise agreement about those cases, but we pretty much agree that he should give me back the money I used. So far he has not given me any money back, and since I am an unemployed student, my income is very limited. \n\n\nThis morning I was going to my SO’s place, and ran out of passes, I also happened to be out of money, so I asked him to transfer me the money I would need. He then became annoyed because I have used a lot of them recently, about 10 in the past 4 days. He also was annoyed that he needed to transfer me money, but most the money I had was spent to get passes. I hate spending money, so it’s not like I had spent all my money on other things.\n\nI responded to his annoyance by telling him that it was because of him that I ran out of money, because he never reimbursed me for my passes. During this part of the conversation, I may have been disrespectful to him, but I don’t believe in my ability to judge this, I would be very biased. He told me I was being disrespectful, and I told him he was the one being disrespectful to me for not reimbursing me. He then proceeded to tell me I was not thankful for all he had done for me (considering he is my father, he has done quite a lot for me), and that I only see him as a source of money. Which both are false but may be the the impression I am giving out. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'm graduating from University this coming May. I've told my family that I don't want to participate in the graduation ceremony. My basic reasons are\n\n1. It's in southern California in hot weather for some hours. School doesn't do shade since it gets in the way of photos. My family would have to sit in the sun, and so would I in a gown that makes the heat even worse.\n\n2. I don't want to waste the money on it. I received some honors and the school makes you pay for them if you graduate. Literally just for like ribbon thing.\n\n3. I have no sense of school spirit and I don't see the point in it if I just get my degree mailed to me.\n\nMy family wants me to participate for the following reasons.\n\n1. I'm the first person in my family to graduate University. My family comes from poor villages in Mexico. My dad left school after 2nd grade to work to help the family. My mother left school after 1st also to work.\n\n2. Its a special occasion that everyone else does.\n\nSeriously ask me questions if any come up for you. \n\n",
