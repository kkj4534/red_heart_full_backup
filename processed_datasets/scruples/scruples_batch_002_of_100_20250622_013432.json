      "description": "So I recently start hanging out with these two guys who are brothers, Levi and Ian. the same age as me (21) at the time. We become amazing friends and spend so much time together and literally can find any way to have a good time.\n\nBut then there is their best friend, (they have the same best friend) Adam. Adam is 24.\n\nAt first Adam came across as friendly and interested in getting to know me. But then one day when I'm in the car with Adam and Levi, I start going through what I like to refer as a \"lull\" where I don't initiate any conversation and just become quiet but it's kinda like I'm socially spent and I just feel \"low\" and at the time I assumed I was depressed but never went to get it checked out.\n\nWell ever since that time Adam started treating me different. If we were all in a car he would talk and interact with every single person except me, even if I said some kind of comment directed at him. The only time he would seldom \"talk\" to me was indirectly when someone brought up something about me that i did that was funny or silly in a joking way and he would take it more serious and thrown in a passige aggressive remark. \n\nIt was like Levi and Ian didn't see it. And at first I thought I was going crazy and just paranoid and I remember literally telling Ian \"I don't think Adam likes me\" and his response was \"I think he just doesn't know you\". \n\nI never experienced this with Levi and Ian. It was like day and night. It was so fun to be around them that I put up with Adam's behavior, even when it meant he would \"control\" the group and be the person deciding what we would do. \n\nLevi and Ian eventually notice my \"lulls\". It was first brought up with Levi asking me what I wanted the most in the world and I said to be on vacation for a weekend. I hadn't gone on vacation in two years due to financial circumstances with my family, my dad having lost his job of 20 years a couple years back.\n\nThen Levi mentions that his family (middle class like mine but on leaning toward upper middle class) had a cabin in the state just north of hours and says would I be down for going on a vacation and I said yeah that was so nice of him. He says we can plan for the end of the summer (it was late June at this point)\n\nIf becomes evident Adam is going on this trip as Levi sends me details of dates and what to bring. I wondered if this was something I really wanted to do as it's been like going to the dentists office Everytime I'm around Adam no matter how hard I try to be his friend, and I want to be his friend.\n\nSo the day comes and it's like I should have turned back and ran but I didn't the moment I found out we were traveling all in Adam's car and suddenly 20 minutes in the driving of a 4 hour drive I'm regretting coming. It's like they don't see that I'm being excluded from the conversation or that anytime i mention something Adam brings up something that he, Levi and Ian exclusively do (they always hang out together and Adam keeps mentioning how next Saturday they should do this or that and Levi tries to act dumb and says \"Saturday\"? And Adam says we always hang out on Saturday. (Adam is making it obvious he wants me to know that they hang out every Saturday without me and it bothers me not that they do but that he's trying to antagonize me with it) \n\nAnd then we get to the trip. It's hell. \nThree days of doing things I've never done before but Adam wants to do and it's like Ian and Levi don't see it and remain who they are usually but at the same different people in terms of acting oblivious to Adam's behavior and to me it's like I'm the only one who sees a fire but everyone around me doesn't even smell the smoke.\n\nI try to hide my \"lulls\" because I know it will upset Adam. I get quiet and try to collect myself during this hellish time and try to be positive but it's too much. A couple times I put on my sunglasses and wipe tears as I pretend to be readjusting them.\n\nThen the day before the last day of the trip I'm in the room I sleep in in the cabin and Adam comes down stairs and says \"whats wrong /jillerski?\" And I say \"what do you mean?\" And he sits down and motions me to sit down (on the bed in front of him because there are two beds in the room) \n\nHis exact words \"you're like a roller, coaster. You're fun to be around and then ten minutes later you're bringing everyone down.\" And I'm like \"....I'm sorry.\" I feel bad because in general I hate bothering people. He says \"this trip wasn't cheap, and you won't be invited again unless you start getting your act together.\" And I tell him I'm sorry that I've been feeling down because of my family's economic problems and that sometimes I don't feel good and he said \"well just pretend to be happy.\" \"You're starting to bring everyone down and it's ruining the trip for Levi and Ian.\" And I said ok and I smiled and went outside and saw Levi and Ian sitting in the boat (we were gonna go out for the day) and they are acting like two people who are trying too hard to not act like they knew what went down. And we go out and I pretend to be happy the whole trip and smiles smiles smiles. \n\nWhen I get home eventually and I get signal back in my phone (couldn't talk to anyone outside of the 4 of us because I had no signal) I get a text from Ian saying \"I hope Adam didn't say anything that bothered you\" and I just stopped hanging out with them and maybe I am the asshole for ruining the trip they generously provided. And maybe I'm even a bigger asshole for not hanging out with them ever again.",

      "description": "A couple of months ago I was fired for no reason from a job I actually enjoyed. I feel like I contributed a lot to the job, but ultimately they didn’t care about me or anything I did. In the end, they turned my position into an unpaid one, and decided to fire me out of the blue. A big problem at this job was management. Things that were supposed to be done by someone else, often ended up being my job and often times ended up being done outside of work hours that I was never paid for. A lot of the people at this job were older than me, and had a lot of problems with technology. Which led to me offering a lot of tech advice, which while appreciated was always met with a snide comment or two about millennials. Like I said, I liked the job a lot though, and so I put up with it. \n\nIt’s been two months and no one has removed my name (misspelled btw because that’s how much they cared about me) from the company website. It still says that I work there and at which position. And even though my name isn’t exactly right online, it’s really unique for the area, and a simple google search brings up my Facebook/social media accounts. I’ve had people contact me asking about details about the workplace/etc. and every time I write back something like, “Actually, I don’t work there anymore. The company is just super behind on updating things and its social media.” Am I the asshole for not contacting the company and letting them know their mistake? I feel like I’m only going to get more and more people contacting me. ",

I have a job but I'm trying to save right now because I want to go on holiday at the end of this year.\n\nThis sibling borrows my car (which I paid for) and leaves it without refuelling and leaves it in a mess every time. Dirty tissues, rubbish and it always smells of fucking perfume after. My girlfriend got a little worried because of that!\n\nAnyway, she borrowed my laptop case ages ago, saying she'd give it back that day. She didn't. I asked her for it and she literally said \"Bye!!\" and got in a taxi to the train station and went back to uni. \n\nToday, with all the family about, I simply said, \"Hey, can I have that back now please?\" pointing at the case. Holy shit. She started screaming at me saying I'm selfish and blah blah blah. She said \"You've got loads of money, buy it yourself!\" to which I responded, \"I did. It's mine... That's why it fits my laptop perfectly but is loose to yours...\". \n\nThen my mum started on me saying I should share. How the fuck am I supposed to share a laptop case when we live cities apart?\n\nI just want my stuff back. I don't complain about the mess she leaves my car in. The one time I asked for my phone charger back, she flipped out and cried to my parents (I got it back and refused to apologise). \n\nAm I an asshole here? Cus everyone in my family seems to think I'm 'selfish' for wanting my own stuff back. They don't seem to see how much I put up with when I do lend stuff. Fuck, I even 'lent' her money to pay for her friends phone (sister 'jokingly' slapped it out of her friends hand). I think I'm more than reasonable here!",

      "description": "throwaway, too personal for main.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: My brother and I play in handball teams, from the same club, but since he's only 16 he plays in a younger category than I do (I'm 18), called U18 for \"under 18\" (which means, I was playing in that category last year).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis afternoon, as per usual, I came to see him and his team play against another team, that I've played last year. My brother's team starts to behind in goals, and the opponents and their coach seem to think this is a great opportunity to be crazily disrespectful, making dirty fouls, clapping loudly whenever our team misses a pass, insulting the crowd and making fun of my little brother's team (\"hey let's try and get that 10 goal lead\"). Things are clearly heating up, and I'm slowly getting mad and excited, even though I still remain quiet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game ends, my mom and I are heading out, while my father waits inside gymnasium for my brother. The enemy team's players come out: they're loud, obnoxious, and complaining about a lack of fair-play from our team. I'm out of the car, while my mom's sitting in it. I overhear them trashtalk my club one too many times, and it makes my blood boil. I open the car's door and tell my mom I'm going to see them. I call the other team's coach, and tell him that I reckon he's being pretty arrogant for a coach that didn't see his team win a single game the year prior, and lose every week-end by 40 to 10. By the time I end my sentence, my mom has jumped out of the car, stepped in and is insulting the coach. I know she's short-tempered and really hot-headed, so I'm considering holding her back ; but the coach is already getting inside his car. I turn around and start walking towards our car, certain my mom is right behind me, but after a few steps I hear them both still arguing. When I look back, my mom has opened the coach's car, and she's almost stepped in yelling at his face. I'm pretty paralysed at this point, still very stirred up. I don't move until a few seconds later, when my mom finally comes back to the car, sits in and lets out a sigh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know what I did probably wasn't the right nor best thing to do, but I just felt like this time I wouldn't let it go ; but I also realise that was she did was very wrong, and that the guy could've hit her. She then asks me that I don't tell my father, as he'd be really angry at her for what she did, because it could've turned out real bad for her. But I also don't want her to do that again, when noone else will be by her side to help her if it turns bitter. This has been getting on my nerves, and I cant get it out of my mind\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; my mom and I got into an argument with some guy, but she crossed the line and kept going at him when him and I had backed down; she doesn't want me to tell my dad. WIBTA if I did tell my dad what happened?",

I just want her to clean their cages and leave them alone (rabbits and guinea pigs). They don’t like being held upside down/dangling mid air and she keeps doing it. Briefly, not torturing them or anything but wtf...\n\n3) is always giving me advice. “You’re going out in those high heels?” Or says things like “I can’t wait to see how HUGE you get in your third trimester (I’m pregnant). Touching my pregnant stomach (just small taps one or two fingers). \n\n4) comments on our things being expensive. We don’t have a lot, but the things we do have are very nice quality. Towels, shirts, appliances. She just keeps mentioning it over and over. \n\nI don’t want to seem like I’m being snobbish but I really just want her to come, clean and leave. Or perhaps it’s me and I’m being unfriendly. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "AITA For never returning my mom's love? My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "First of all I wanna say that I’m german so my English might have wuite some mistakes but hopefully is atleast understandable. I also just remembered this sub while being confused andhope this is the right place. I don’t really am a frequent reddit user and made a new account just for this. So I don’t really know how all of this works but here I go.\n\nSo I am currently having quite a hard time with one group of friends from high school. It’s been around half a year now where from my perspective they started becoming more and more distant. Or rather me and my best friend at that time. The last time we did anything together was a week before Christmas and since then it especially went down the drain.\nI should probably add that both of us are kinda broken on the mental side which lead to us not really being able to react properly at that time making us grow apart quite a bit.\nIt ended with me becoming distant or excluded from the rest of this group of friends. They ignored me, wouldn’t talk to me and did stuff without me. \n\nThen in the beginning of this year my mind cleared up a bit. But they kept ignoring me. One day then I was told I was too negative und that that only dragged them down so they started to avoid me. And I can at that point only agree that I was still pretty negative and all.\nBut them ignoring me didn’t really make that better at all und made me grow more annoyed and confused which in tirn would make us grow even further apart.\n\nSo I decided to offer a full turn. I wouldn’t be negative and just stop doing so and they in turn wouldn’t ignore me. And then we did that.\nOr so I thought. I took extra notice on my behavior and all and didn’t really do anything they complained about (yes I’m certain about that. I even kept track and wrote that down for a bit).\nBut even though they agreed they didn’t do anything of the agreement. They stayed distant and kept treating me like air.\n\nAnd now a few days ago after I tried to initiate talking and all, which failedin both ways. When I talked about stuff I was interested in and that happened to me or just asked general questions I was really just talking to a wall. Now I tried going with something they ((ex)best friend) was interested in.\n\nAgain I need to say how I made these friends rather recently when one of them transferred to my school 1.5 years ago. And they also were the first proper friends (or so I would say) in highschool (we are close to finishing but my mind stopped me from being able to properly interact with others before them).\nAnd through my (ex)best friend. I opened up quite a bit and was able to start doing things I always wanted to do (join a theatre group, considering going to a dance school) but also stuff irrelevant to them (eg. school chorus).\n\nGoing back to the other thing I tried. After I tried talking about that topic and before that aswell in a way I now realize. \nThey accused me of copying them and that being the only reason I do those things (subjective interpretation of what they said). They also wrote that they would still be avoiding me because I would be so negative and annoyed which I have to admit, I started tobe again after they did nothing of their part while I kept pretending that it didn’t bother me to not be negative.\n\nSo AITA for reacting negatively and annoyed (I would be ... I don’t really know ... unfriendly I guess) after they ignored me for so long me being sad about it, reconciling afterwards but them not doing what they said they would. \nAnd especially now after they simply told me that they will avoid me even more after I didn’t just remain cold after all of that and also accusing me of just copying them and being to only reason I do the things I like.\n\nAm I in the wrong for reacting negative to this.\n\nI don’t remember what I am supposed to write at the end and I just hope I didn’t come to the wrong place cause I don’t know if this is appropriate for this sub nor if it violates the rules but I really don’t know.\n\nI also apologize for the outdrawn sentences I know they are/were annoying if you read this far. And I already want to thank you for that.",

When I looked back to see who it was a big guy wearing an old torn jacket asking me if I had money to help buy his lunch. I said no and put my earbuds back in he tapped me again and made up a sob story about how is mom was in the hospital. I just said no again and put my earbuds back in. The third time he happed me I got really pissed because I had already told him no twice and after the second time he had gotten close to me and closed off the exit from the booth (I think he was trying to intimidate me). So I angrily took my earbuds off stood up and aggressively told him to back the fuck off. Once I said it he backed off and left me alone. But a few of the people in the restaurant gave me a dirty look and i felt bad. So reddit AITA?",

      "description": "This'll probably be branded as a sanctimonious shitpost, and if that's what you take away from it, I apologize, but that's really not the intent. I just felt like this was something no one talked about, so I'm attempting to now. I've only recently actively looked into this sub, but I've fleetingly seen posts for quite some time now that have really grabbed my attention. People seem to write in often where the scenario they depict is almost too outrageous and ridiculous to believe, or they seem very obvious that OP would is NTA. It really looks like people take the catharsis to a little too close heart, and forgot that honesty and transparency is needed in order for any of the resolution to be genuine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only outlook I have in these evident posts being genuine is kind of a cynical one. It's sad to say, but I think it's really possible there are plenty of people who really don't know or know how to expect someone close to them to be a decent human being with fairness and compassion. They often land themselves with people who aren't worth a damn because they don't know they deserve better or the right to fight for improving their quality of life with family if they've truly been wronging you. I really hope that's not the case, but, either way, it boils down to the conditioned inability to stomp out the bullshit, or you being the one creating it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't doubt that many of you have candidly presented yourselves as unbiased as you could, but, what's funny is that no one has pointed out how absolutely absurd it is to expect someone to \"depict both sides of the story\", like the sub states. You will always be speaking for the other person. No matter how bipartisan you are about the ordeal, phrasing is everything, and anyone can tell a story differently without changing the events to make themselves the victor and the other the villain. These nameless people the OP has conflict would almost always have a better chance at gaining favor or defending themselves if they were able phrase things the way they wanted to, or at all for that matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the other extreme, there's nothing stopping anyone from making up a dishonest, slanderous story to reap the affirmation they might desperately desire to quell their unchanging, narrowed outlook on any given situation. I don't blame them to be honest, because it seems like something we all do to some extent. Reddit, and social media in general is a great place to escape to and experience a rare and odd form of gratification, especially in the way you present yourself to other people. You get to control how much or how little you want someone to know, and since verification of these types of \"text only\" stories doesn't really exist, there's nothing stopping you from completely inflating your ego and confirming how \"right\" you are, even at the expense of the truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is in no way a novel concept, but I feel I really need to say that some things are better left unsaid if they can't be told sincerely. If you need some kind of break from reality or can't face the decisions you make, that is entirely your choice and freedom to do so. I just don't think it serves any kind of long-term benefit to pose as these relatively innocent, guiltless people if that's not how you exist in the real world.",

      "description": "So I started dating this girl about 5 months ago, when I met her she had told me about her past relations which I did not judge her about. One of the guys she had relations with was her best friend from her home town whom she said she was in love with but he broke her heart. I've always told her that she is and adult and she can do what shes wants, I would never tell her what to do. Shes been keeping a friendship with him through texting ever since we started dating. She told me yesterday that on Friday  they are going to hang out (she didn't tell me what they were going to do). Am I the asshole for not wanting her to hang out with this guy, ever. Really love this girl but I dont want to be hurt because of this. He is single, and about 2 months ago his girlfriend broke up with him.",

      "description": "I have this friend who is like a sister to me. She's been my best friend since we were very young (like 5-6). We'll call her Brittany.\n\nSo recently Britney has been severely depressed and has been suffering from panic attacks. We do not live near each other, so we only get to see each other about once a month, but we talk every day. Brittany has been having panic attacks during which she is unable to breathe and cannot talk. I receive a snapchat from her every day early in the morning or between 6-8 PM of her crying with captions along the lines of \"I hate myself\", \"I want to die\", \"I'm having a panic attack and I want to kill myself\", and even \"I want to shoot myself\". Every single day I reply with \"I'm so sorry\", \"what can I do to help?\" \"I wish I could be there with you and help you through this\", etc. Every day I receive a reply with sometime similar to \"you can't understand\" or \"you don't really care about me.\" She also flips out if I leave her on read/open for more than five minutes.\n\nI feel like it is worth noting that I also suffer from depression and anxiety, and I have been seeing a therapist about it for years. I have also encouraged Brittany to seek help, and to go to therapy or see a doctor, but she ignores this advice and instead chooses to deal with her panic attacks and depression by vaping and occasionally abusing drugs.\n\nLast night, I was very upset about a personal situation. I was not in a place to give advice, and frankly, I wanted to die. I was in a bad place. Brittany sent me one of the usual snapchats- \"I want to kill myself\"- to which I sent back, \"me f\\*\\*king too.\". Minutes later I get one saying \"wow thanks, you're such a great friend\" (obvious sarcasm), to which I replied \"I'm sorry, but I'm going through some shit right now and I honestly just want to die.\" I was pretty upset, so I turned my phone off.I woke up to a message saying \"well, that doesn't give you the right to treat me like shit.\" I left her on read.\n\nAITA?! I love her (she's family to me) and I want to help her, I really do, but I don't know how anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Friend is suicidal and when I told her I was too she flipped out on me for \"treating her like shit\".",

Before I could realize what she said another topic has brought up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater in the car I told my boyfriend (M28) that I was shocked by her saying that. My boyfriend said he thinks \"the N-word is a normal word like table and chair\". I asked him what he thought about the word \"idiot\", he said that was NOT a normal word but offensive. He went to the movies earlier that day and saw Green Book, which is about separation from white and black people in public spaces that happend a few decades ago.  \n\n\nI tried to talk sense to him but he was only offended of words if it offended HIM?!\n\nThis all just blows my mind.

But I let the people of reddit decide what is what.\n\nThe background: I have a very close group of friends, some of them I know since I was too little to walk. They are very close to me and I really like time with them. My GF has a little bit rough relation with them, but she doesn't mind me meeting with them.\nUnfortunatly there were situations, when I prefered spending time with them, rather with her (usually she and I had plans, my friends had plans and I wanted to fit into their plans). \nAfter a situation, when I was at the party on the other side of the city and she had a 30min nausea and nosebleed problem (I would get to her in about 20-30 min, and I thought that she would feel better soon) I promised her that I will make sure that she will be my top priority.\nI also made a mistake of being unprepared for her birthday at the start of this year, what was a big FU for me.\n\nThe situation: my close friend will have his birthday this month. I was invited today, and I told my GF that I want to come. This lead to the argue I mentioned before. We wanted to come back to our homes for the weekend that the birthday would take place, and we would probably spend time together. It was clear, that I would have to stay in order to attend this party. She got mad at me, because I promised her that she will be the most important to me.\nShe asked me why I want to make his (my friend) birthday good, when I ruined her birthday, why I broke my promise so soon, and why is she the \"second one important\".\nI told her, that he is very important to me, and It's his birthday in comparison to just coming back home to spend some time together.\nI promised her that it will be the Last situation that they (i.e. my friends) will be more important than her.\n\nNote: she has to go back as she has some students she must teach to on that day.",

      "description": "My friend Kevin and I were going to a local gaming bar/LAN to hang out (yesterday) and he mentioned wanting to play Magic the Gathering with paper cards since he started playing the online MTGA game. I told him I had some cards in my attic somewhere and that I can bring a few decks to play yesterday. I knew that his gf is a little controlling about what he does sometimes so I even asked him if he's sure that he wants me to bring my cards. So I spent like 2 hours rummaging through my attic for my cards and brought them to the event. \n\nAfter we play a few rounds of another game, I ask him if my friend wants to play Magic now. Before my friend can answer, his girlfriend just interjects that he's not going to be playing anything but the game we're currently playing. So I told her we already made plans to say and asked her \"what do you mean he's not playing?\". She ignored what I asked and just repeated that he's not playing and \" I don't care if we already made plans\". At that point I was a little more than pissed and I started yelling that she can't just tell me that my friend's not playing in his place and that she's really disrespecting me. She just ignored everything I said and started telling the people around us that I have anger issues and that everyone else should be careful of this guy(referring to me). \n\nI got really pissed at that moment so I started packing my things up and got ready to leave but I was stopped by Kevin. He was nice enough to ask me if I still wanted to play but I just said \"I'm pretty upset and it's probably better if we don't play\". Then I just left with another group of friends. \n\nBy the way, I'm a straight guy, so it was purely platonic intentions.\n\nAnyways, Kevin's gf apologized to me today about telling everyone else that I have anger issues, but I'm pretty sure that it's only because some other people I knew from the bar told me that Kevin told her to apologize to me. I apologized also and just pretended that when she said he couldn't play it was only a joke and I completely misinterpreted. But at the time I was 100% sure she was serious about what she said, or did I really misinterpret at the time?",

      "description": "I know the title makes me sounds like an asshole but let me explain the whole thing.\n\nMy bf and I were together for 2.5 years before I broke up. Since the beginning there were several things he used to do that’d make me feel uncomfortable. i.e. we different taste in music and if I posted a song on some social media he’d comment “that’s garbage” or “trash” just to let me down. \nThere’s also a huge festival in my city every year that’s basically a whole month (June, for Saint John’s) with lots of concerts and dancing and stuff. All my friends go to this place for this festival every year and I really wanted to go when we were together but he told me he didn’t wanna come and that he’d be mad at me and stop talking to me if I went there with my friends. \nHe was also selfish when it comes to do things I wanted do and would only go to places that only he wanted to go and I had to come with. But he’d make a total of 0 effort to be with me when I wanted to go somewhere, and I couldn’t go by myself either. Plus, he was cheap and if I bought anything with MY OWN MONEY he’d tell me I’m spending too much money and that I didn’t need whatever I was buying even though it was MY MONEY. \nLong story short, around Christmas I had enough when he told me he was going to buy a brand new and special edition of the War and Peace collection, by Tolstoy and he knew I wanted to read this collection for a while now and he already had a collection himself. When Christmas came I was really excited and he came to my place with my Christmas gift: his old collection of War and Peace he’d no longer need because he bought himself the new special edition. I mean, HE BOUGHT HIMSELF THE NEW COLLECTION AND GAVE ME THE OLD ONE HE ALREADY HAD FOR CHRISTMAS.\nBy that time I had enough. For everything that was wrong with the relationship that made me uncomfortable and now this. It wasn’t the gift itself that made me upset, but the fact that he put 0 effort on my gift. He just needed someone to get rid of his old collection to and thought I’d be the perfect person to get this.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": " I quit my job last May due to a lot of personal issues caused by the place and several issues with management. I mean this manager drove off every good employee including myself. Now the owner was a nice lady most of the time I was there. Toward the end of my 3 yrs there she started going through a mid life crisis and became a bit of an entitled twat. Boss's mom worked there as well and I LOVED this little old woman like she was my 2nd grandma. She is literally the only reason I would still visit the store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently the little old lady had a heart attack. She's had her surgery and is in recovery. I am super relieved by this. The manager asked for several days if I would come back because the boss and her mom were both out due to this. I always said I had other plans. Not lying I legit have tests for autism coming up and am trying to get an appointment for possible skin cancer tests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday she sounded extremely desperate. Said she would let me come in whenever I wanted, that it was only temporary, that things were royally fucked and they NEEDED some serious help. I agreed to come in and talk about it tomorrow. I have to admit I REALLY don't want to do this, but I do still like the other owner and I know he would greatly appreciate it. I also know it would make little old lady's recovery less stressful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo things are very concerning to me. One is that she would not discuss why things were so fucked beyond reason and Two is she would not discuss how I would be paid or how much. If they are I am going to insist it's in writing or I walk. I know that's probably an asshole move, but not why I'm writing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnto the thing that I feel like makes me an asshole. I want to limit this temporary work if anything. I can't decided between 2 weeks or 1 month. I know that the recovery time for a triple bypass is 3 months and it's getting close to summer meaning they'll be SUPER BUSY. I know I should do the full 3 months to help out. I just cannot explain how much I do not want to return to a place where I felt so unappreciated, stressed, depressed and angry...I literally woke up everyday and my first thought was \"ya know if you just break your hand they can't yell at you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: They totally would have yelled at me for breaking my hand. The old manager made fun of me for having a kitten funeral and balling to the point of vomiting which is a whole other thing, so yes this place is pretty fucking shitty to work at and they would totally make it about them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be an asshole for limiting the time I'm willing to return?",

      "description": "So there’s a bit of backstory. My mom is 48 and I’m 26. She hasn’t worked in 5 years. We lived together in TN until I moved out to ATL at 17 because of her domestically abusive boyfriend. She had a child with him and my half-brother is now 5. She ultimately moved to Seattle to get away from him. She was in Seattle for less than a year before her twin sister, and later her mom, kicked her out for allegedly being too difficult to live with. I offered her to move in with me so she can start fresh, get a job, save for a car and ultimately get her own place for her and my brother. Since she’s been here for the last 5 months I’ve: built a resume for her, my sister has applied to numerous jobs for her, she has applied herself for 0 jobs herself. She despises my GF and was mad at me, at the time, so she destroyed my relationship by FB messaging her that I was cheating on her. My lifestyle has changed significantly as I don’t care to have people over now that I’m essentially living my mom again. She is as my family put it “difficult to live with.” My new stress has factored in to me drinking more which she profusely points out, as if this is the stem of the problem (I’m a mellow quiet drunk just so there aren’t any ideas).  I’ve been through so much stress since she has been here. She has once locked me out of my own apartment when she was angry with me. My utilities have literally tripled as she is nonchalant with energy usage. She offers nothing towards rent or bills and I’ve been fiscally struggling since she’s been here.  I told her that I would be ok through all of this if she would just get a job and advance her situation. She says she was depressed and that’s why she hasn’t looked for a job. I suffer from depression too but if had a kid I wouldn’t let anything stop me from providing for my child. I don’t want to end up hating my mom by prolonging this situation. I told her she needs to make plans to leave. AITA for kicking my mom, and therein my brother, out?",

      "description": "So couple of weeks ago, a flatmate of mine invited handful of his friends to hangout and have some beer. There was a guy sitting on the floor right in front of the TV. He called me over because he wanted me to open his bottle of beer (I did that for a couple of people using my teeth). I went close to him and opened his bottle. As I was planning to hand the bottle back to him , it slipped outta my hand and fell on the floor. Some of the beer fizzed out on the floor and I noticed his phone lying on the floor, in the puddle of beer. I quickly grabbed his phone and handed it to him to avoid any damage to the phone. After a few minutes, he shows me that there's a black line on his screen but we didn't talk much about it. \n\nA week ago he starts calling me and my flatmate, asking for the money to replace his phone screen. He calls me multiple times a day and I've stopped accepting his calls. My flatmates told me that I should not pay for the screen and I think the same since his phone was on the floor and I had no intention to damage it. Also, I'm really annoyed by the amount of calls and texts this guy has been sending my way and any sense of guilt is gone because of this behavior of his. AITA for not paying him for the damage? ",

On top of that they have always dealt with things such as planing for family vacations and applying for my Canadian citizenship without keeping me in the loop. I know,, I was, quit spoiled. \n\nThat being said, last summer I got a job and a drivers license and apart from still relying them for a place to live until I finish collage I do everything on my own. \n\nMy girlfriend on the other hand was not spoon fed like I was and had to work from a young age to afford anything and often had to cook her own meals. She moved out of her parents house at 17 and apart from occasional asking her parents for money she has been entirely independent for the last two and half years. \n\nThe problem arises when she brought up the fact that I was very immature when it came to a lot f things. From forgetting to turn off the stove when I finished cooking and leaving stuff out of the fridge (I have never cooked before) to not lowering the toilet seat ( I always had my own bathroom).  Little things, but there are many more.\n\nShe was clearly frustrated and I let her know that I intended to do everything I could to fix all the issues she had brought up but it wouldn’t happen overnight and she’ll have to wait. This only added fuel to the fire, telling me she doesn’t deserve to wait. And that was extremely rude of me to imply she had to put up with it. We end on the fact that if I don’t manage to mature the relationship will end.\n\nI feel like she doesn’t understand that it’s not something that happens overnight and I’m doing everything I can to fix it. So, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Little bit of background, it’s an academic competition that I am competing in with a group of people (namely my sister and another set of sisters). (Yes this is a high school thing, I am a senior in high school). My sister and I were cut off from competing through our own region because our original partners told us we couldn’t work with them the day the project was due (so we couldn’t have time to even put something together). So we joined forces with these other two girls we met through this competition who live in a different region to compete through their region. However, this meant that my sister and I would have to pay for everything on our own- registration fees as well as travel expenses. Our parents were not willing to help as they felt it was unimportant.\n\nInitially, we thought the finances would be an issue. We even told them we couldn’t do the project because we couldn’t afford to pay the fees out of pocket, but we convinced ourselves and each other that we could make it work through getting jobs and making the money ourselves. At this point, we didn’t know exactly how much this competition would end up costing. We were just determined to make it happen. \n\nLater on, after we had registered for the competition, our partners told us that the registration fee would be $60. At this point it was too late to back out, so we decided we needed to find a way to raise that money ourselves. \n\nFast forward to tonight, one day before the competition, the girls tell us we have to bring 60$ checks to the competition tomorrow. My sister and I can’t write checks (I mean we know how to we just don’t have checkbooks) so we had to ask our parents, who freaked out when they realized they’d be having to cut checks for 120$ for both of us... and eventually if we moved on, it would be even more. They basically told us that we couldn’t afford to go on with this competition even if my sister and I raised that money ourselves, as we need that money for college. \n\nSo I told the girls the situation and they got pretty upset. For now, I’ve told them we would do whatever we could to make sure we could pay that 60$ each and show up to the competition tomorrow, but we told them we might have to drop out for further levels of competition. Long story short- they’re pissed. AITA here? ",

      "description": "Everyone in my situation is in their early to mid-twenties. \n\nA little background info:\n\nSo I am 21 years old and in college working on my teaching degree.  From the ages of 14-18ish my life was chaotic because of situations I put myself in. I was constantly gossiping about people, spreading other people’s secrets, getting way too drunk, victimizing myself when things would go wrong, talking about vulgar things a work to get attention (like going into extreme detail about my sex life to coworkers I barely spoke to), etc. \n\nWhen I was 18 and had dropped out of college after graduating 2nd in my class in high school, I realized I didn’t like the person I was becoming and was embarrassed by my actions. So from there it took a lot of mindfulness and practice to be a better person, and although I still sometimes catch myself starting to do my past behaviors, I do genuinely feel like I’m a good person that makes a positive impact on other people’s lives. \n\nNow to the current situation:\n\nI have a best friend, D, who I’ve been close with since middle school.  She loves having big groups of friends rather than close, individual friends so she always wants me to hang out with her friends.  The problem is, most of her friends act the way I did when I was 18. It was so so hard for me to break those habits so I don’t want those behaviors around me. \n\nFor example, D’s other best friend, H, is constantly flirting with married coworkers and slept with her ex’s brother to make him jealous.  I don’t want to be around H because it frustrates me to hear these stories and I don’t want that kind of toxic energy around me anymore. I figured since I haven’t known her very long (only a few months) it wouldn’t be very damaging to stop the friendship.   D told me I was being very judgmental about situations that don’t affect me at all and can just be funny stories to hear about. \n\nAnother example is with D’s friend A. Long story short, A had a one night stand with a guy, the guy didn’t want a relationship, so she’s been harassing him for the past YEAR, lied about aborting his kid (she was never pregnant), stalks his current girlfriend, creates fake profiles and phone numbers to contact him since he blocks her every time, etc. When he rejects her, she cuts her arm and sends him pictures. I don’t want all that in my life. D says I shouldn’t take it too seriously since A isn’t hurting me directly. \n\nSo, AITA for judging these people and not wanting to be friends with them?\n\nTl;dr My best friend has very chaotic (imo) people in her life that I don’t want in mine. Am I too judgmental?",

      "description": "So, I contacted my former high school teacher a few weeks back asking for private classes, he didn’t have time, but would ask around.\n\nA week later, we had a phone call, where he introduced the teachers and their time schedules. He told me he needed a definitive answer within a week.\n\nIn 4 days time, I asked him to make some adjustments (changing a certain part I wanted to learn, removing some teachers, cutting some of my hours)\n\nWhen I asked him what the total price would be, he wrote a paragraph saying that he spent a lot of precious time in search for teachers and that because I made too many adjustments in such a short timeframe, he asked me to transfer the money within 4 days, to a bank account in another country (belonging to his father), so he could avoid taxes.\n\nBecause I’m still abroad and he asked me to transfer the money within 4 days, my parents did not approve of it and told me I should first meet again, before transferring the money. \n\nSo when I told him that and apologised for wasting his time, I got a message saying that he wasted 3 years teaching me, that I wasted not only his, but also other teachers their time, that I apparently didn’t trust him and that I really needed to work on my way of doing things and that he was really disappointed in me and that the connection (as in networking) has basically vanished now.\n\nI mean, I felt sorry, but I also think it was a bit of an overreaction on his part and that it’s actually very unprofessional and that he could have simply said ‘alright, unfortunate’. I haven’t replied and I probably won’t.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for essentially flaking, although it were my parents that did not agree, or is he for overreacting and talking me into a guilt feeling.",

      "description": "  \n\nFor context: I am currently in Africa doing an internship and my sister is in our home country and has been mentally unstable for about three years now. All of our contact has been through messages sent back and forth. We both handle our problems very differently. I am a person who will apologize quickly, so I lash out once I truly lost my patience and she is more the person who will wait until something blows over.\n\nSo we have had a small argument about something insignificant a few days ago. I decided to swallow my pride and apologize to her. I thought I did so in a very carefully constructed way, telling I should not have done the things I did and that I was sorry. She did not respond. It might have been her way of handling the argument we had. Cooling down before sending a message, so that it would not be written out of anger. I decided to text my mom asking if I had done anything wrong.\n\nAs time went by, I was getting more annoyed, since I was the one reaching out and swallowing my pride. I did not want to show any of this anger to my sister though, since we have always been very close and me hurting her might sent her back into mental instability. I ended up venting a lot of my anger towards my mother and saying that I want my sister to apologize to me. She managed to calm me down and I went to sleep. \n\nThis morning, I saw that my sister had sent some messages and I was secretly hoping they were apologies. However, These messages were just to show her side of the story and telling me she does not want to include our mother in our arguments. Then there were some casual messages afterwards to try and end this entire situation. This almost broke my patience, since I felt the only reason I included our mother was to protect her from myself. Additionally, she still ignored the apology message I had sent the night before. I sent one message saying that I did not like it that she ignored my apology, because I had to use a lot of self-control to type it. I think it might have been her way of putting this entire situation behind her and moving on. I feel that I need her to at least say that she appreciates that I apologized.\n\nNow I feel like I might sent some hurtful messages if I contact her again, since my patience is almost spent, but I still want the opinion of others. She was right that I should have not included our mother, but the situation gnawed at me and I had to get a second opinion. \n\nSo now I would like to ask you guys: Am I the asshole by saying I want her to acknowledge my apology?",

She had only been seeing this guy for a couple of weeks and only knew him from Tinder. \n\nAfter we got back together I noticed that she kept chatting with him. What really got to me was on New Years Eve he texted her  and she was chatting with him briefly. I had a very frank discussion with her that it seemed strange to me and it felt like she wasn't cheating but basically keeping him in reserve if it didn't work out between us. She said she would stop talking to him. After that, we still both had our traveling jobs and would only see each other monthly and really didn't learn anything from the previous times so eventually we wound up breaking up again. It's been about 6 months and we're doing our best to renew our friendship as much as possible but she admitted he was the first person she slept with after we broke up. \n\nIn our time, I was never insecure about being on the road, I feel very secure we wouldn't cheat on each other but that was the one thing I was insecure about and it ended up manifesting itself to be true. She says it's not wrong, which is true, but I still feel disrespected. \n\nThoughts? ",

I’ve met her once, she seemed like your average peppy and happy-go-lucky girl. I didn’t have an issue with her, nor did I think anything about it at the time. What I know is that he really liked her for a long time; I suppose to the point that you could say he was in love with her. He spent all of his time around her and they hung out a whole lot for a while.\n\nBut a month ago that changed. Although we’re close, we never really hung out too much, and now all of a sudden he’s always asking me if I want to hang out. I’m with my friends, but we invite him along as he knows them.\n\nOne day, when we were together alone, he broke the news to me. I always knew he was depressed, and I’ve always done what I could to help talk to him if he needed it. He’s a very private person, so he never told me too much though. When I found out that she just left him right after he told her, without any hesitation and without saying anything, I was beyond angry. I was confused how someone could be so... heartless.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hi, I made a reddit account just to post this because it's been weighing on my mind all day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons with this group for about 2 years; I'm the dungeon master, meaning I control the story arc, world, and overall flow of the game for anyone not familiar with it. One player in the group who has been a friend for years (henceforth referred to as R) constantly interrupts the game by talking loudly, arguing with my rules, and generally trying to get everything to go his way. Others in the group have complained about his disruptions as well, and I have had many conversations with him on how to improve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, to the current story. The session was already going awry because the group kept splitting off and fighting amongst themselves. I honestly don't care what their characters do, but I do care when the players yell and fight as it causes a disruptive environment. So R had been goofing off with another player, Z, all night. They sat in the corner and talked and didn't pay attention which slowed play down for others since I had to keep repeating myself for them. Z has really never been a problem so I simply told her to quiet down and she apologized (even though the behavior continued). R, however, refused to acknowledge what he was doing was wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the end of the night, I was fed up. About 10 minuted before the session was due to end, I tossed a marker onto the table which R then picked up and hurled at my face (probably trying to be funny). I was pissed. So I waited until it was his turn in combat again and told him to either pick up the marker or have disadvantage on the rest of his rolls (roll twice and take the lowest). He refused and another friend picked up the marker to avoid confrontation. So I then told R to either apologize for his behavior or have the same punishment. He refused and said he would continue playing without listening. I skipped his turn and continued playing with the others. He proceeded to quit the game and then sulk around for the last ten minutes (because his car was trapped between others and he couldn't storm out like he wanted to).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was ready to go to bed after dropping off another friend, but I instead came home to 15 messages from R. He began by pouring out his heart about how much he was looking forward to the evening and I ruined it, and how he spent his own money to pay for snacks (we paid to feed him dinner), and generally being manipulative. He called me an ass/asshole exactly 7 times. He complained that I singled him out instead of dealing even punishments. I was reading these messages and crying (I cry when I get frustrated) so my mom snatched the phone from my hand and read the messages. He is no longer allowed at our house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I will eventually forgive him, but I was tired for taking to high road for once. So was he right? Was I being the asshole by punishing him over others?",

At the end of last schoolyear, I noticed that I was always the one iniating contact, whether that be just texting or asking to go do something. Now, they weren't ever hostile towards me or gave any indication that they didn't want to be friends, but they just didn't seem to have any interest in doing anything with me outside of school. I noticed this with all of my other friends there as well, so when I switched schools I just decided to stop contacting them. I stopped texting them, didn't ask them to do anything, etc. Just to see if anything happened. And nothing did. No one tried getting in touch. So I just decided, fuck it, if you dont want anything to do with me then I'll stop trying. Now my friend texted me out of the blue, for the first time in months. Im not sure what to do.

      "description": "So bit of background. I get the bus to work which takes approximately 50 minutes. I am 6ft5 and get a little bit anxious when I feel like I'm in a confined space, not panic attack bad but I find it difficult to relax and my stomach goes a bit mad. My stop is the first stop so the bus is empty, and most of the seats are difficult to fit my legs behind. As a result I have a really uncomfortable journey. That is unless I get one of the seats on the top deck of the bus at the front, where there is legroom a plenty. It's the only seat I can comfortably sit in. \n\nThe bus stop is pretty busy and most people want this seat, however the vast majority of people are significantly shorter than me, and I am always the tallest person there. So when the bus pulls up I will weave between people to get round them and get that seat. My reasoning is that they will suffer little to no discomfort from sitting in the seats with less legroom. To clarify this isn't a queue where you are rewarded for being early, it's a bit of a free for all and you're rewarded for guessing where the doors stop. The unwritten rule is that if you guess right you are rewarded by getting to go on the bus first, generally people don't push past each other once on the bus has stopped. I however flout this rule believing my need for the leg room seat to be greater. \n\nI mentioned this to a friend and she said 'ahh tall white male assumes he's entitled to the best seat on the bus, typical'. She was joking but it got me thinking, should I actually be doing this or am I being a selfish asshole. \n\nA few clarifications: \n\nI do not use my size to physically push past people, for a tall lad I'm quite nimble it's more of a weave. \n\nThe queue system is respected generally once the bus has stopped\n\nIf it was a traditional queuing system I would go early, let a bus go by and make sure I was first in line for the next bus. \n\n**TL;DR: Am I (a tall man) the asshole for weaving past people to get a better leg room seat?**",

Half the staff is looking up at him with very upset faces. His face turns bright red and he rushes out, his friend trailing behind him. I void the order and go on with business.\n\nMy friend say that it was an over reaction and I should’ve just given him a warning and told him not the do that again, but I feel the look was already the warning.

      "description": "Last week I had an early Christmas dinner with my family so my grandparents could celebrate with us too, as they don't live locally.\n\nI arrived at the family home early, played some board games with my grandparents and helped my mum and sister with their hair and makeup.\n\nMy stepdad sat upstairs playing PlayStation. Nothing wrong with that, he likes to chill after work. But he was yelling/swearing at a game nonstop for 2+ hours. \n\nLater, when he was downstairs, I overhead him saying to my 15 year old brother, 'you really are a waste of space, aren't you.' Not in a joking way, in a I genuinely dislike you way.\n\nWe go out for dinner and at the table my mum brought up how 'awful' my sister's eyebrows/makeup used to be. My sister is visibly uncomfortable/upset with everyone chiming in about her sense of style and asks my mum to stop talking about it. She doesn't.\n\nI said that as a general rule, criticism of someone's appearance should be asked for and not just blurted out. I could sense an argument brewing so I said, very pointedly, 'we're not talking about this now'.\n\nThe rest of the meal was fine besides a few obnoxious comments from my stepdad calling my brother a 'boring loser' and we head home to play games.\n\nWe're sat round a table getting ready to play games and pouring drinks and I ask if someone can pass me a cracker joke so I can send a photo of it to a friend who has a love/hate relationship with corny jokes.\n\nMy stepdad tells me to, 'get off your phone, you freak.' and keeps saying it. I childishly respond like, 'gEt OfF tHe PhOnE' \n\nHe reaches over and smacks me in the head and I just lose it. I yelled at him, calling him a 'fucking idiot' and a 'miserable old cunt' who ruins every occasion with his bullshit.\n\nI leave the table and he's trying to bait me, like 'aw, are you going to run away'. I decide it's best to call a taxi and dip as I'm so angry.\n\nAs I'm waiting my brother asks if he should go upstairs to see if I'm okay and my mum just says, 'No!' \n\nMy grandma messages me the next day asking if I was okay. My mum messaged me two days later asking if I wanted a baking tray dropped round, completely ignoring anything that happened. \n\nEvery year it's the same old drama. I cannot deal with such negative people for extended amounts of time.\n\nI decided I wasn't going to bother going over on Christmas day and now everyone is up in arms.\n\nAITA? ",

My friend and I were about to play some Smash Ultimate on my Switch, which I had brought at the request of said friend. After one or two 3-stock games, my girlfriend, who shares a lunch period with us, begins to get up close to me and says, \"I want attention.\"\n\nMy girlfriend is quite obsessive. Any chance she gets to see me, she'll take it, and God forbid anyone gets between her and me, even her/my own friends. If she wants attention, she'll get it, one way or another.\n\nI take notice, but keep playing. I do, however, put my arm around her, as well as offer her my controller so she could play. She denied the offer.\n\nThe bell rang and I gathered my things. My gf was visibly pissed. I asked her what was wrong, knowing full well what was wrong. At first, she said, \"Nothing. I'm fine.\" However, it was clear, even from the way she said \"fine\" that there was a problem.\n\nAnd then she blew up on me (I'm not gonna transcribe the whole convo, it's late and I'm tired). I apologized so that she would calm down, especially since we had history together next period, and I did not need that awkward tension.\n\nSo, should I have paid more attention to her and turned aside my friend, or was I in the right?",

      "description": "About 8 months ago, my friend and roommate (let’s call him Tom) hooked up with our neighbor (we’ll call her Sally) (idk if this is important but before and after this we were all friends and still are). Now, keep in mind, although my roommate is a pretty attractive dude, he hasn’t really been with very many people (to my knowledge only one before her and one after her). \n\nAnyway,  after they hooked up, Tom started telling people they were dating. When Sally found out about this, she didn’t want to embarrass him so she went along with it and then broke up with him a few weeks later. In the wake of it, he was devastated and very angry. Right after this, summer quarter at our school began and it happened that Sally and I were both staying and taking classes. We never did anything over summer but we did become very close friends and hung out almost every day. During that time, I became attracted to her and unbeknownst to me until recently, the same thing happened to with her.  \n\nAfter summer, Tom studied abroad and was gone for a few more months. When he got back, it was obvious that he still had feelings for her by how he acted around her (super nice, a little nervous, etc.)\n\nAbout 2 months later, we were all at a party and all very drunk. A few hours before the party ended, a group of us left early to go hang out at Sally’s apartment (Tom stayed at the party). \n\nSally and I both blacked out and ended up having sex. Anyway, I told Tom because I felt bad and after we talked for a little, he forgave me.\n\nFast forward another month and Sally turns 21. Now at this point Sally and I are the only ones who are 21 in our friend group so we go out to a bar to celebrate. Now Tom won’t talk to me and I feel really bad but I’m not sure I did anything wrong. Am I the asshole in this situation? (Also suggestions on where to go from here would be very appreciated). ",

      "title": "AITA for abandoning my FWB at detox?",
      "description": "This story has a little bit of character setup before getting to “the incident”. A fwb of mine had moderate to severe alcoholism coupled with depression and anxiety. She had to have a drink first thing in the AM and first thing when she came back from the university and nursed a buzz almost all day. She knew she had a problem and in her words was “waiting for some incident to give her a wake up call.” \n\nHer main job was a bar tending gig back in her home town 2 hours away on the weekends. 3 weeks straight I got snaps every night of the weekend of her driving drunk. Since she was mixing her anxiety and depression meds with alcohol, she blacked out pretty much after 2 drinks. She doesn’t remember our first 5 dates because of this and we both are speculating the only reason she blacked out so easily for a period of a few months when she went on new meds.\n\nOn top of all this, she was a “runner.” She’d be in a group of friends and just decide to take off. Not in a sprint, but casually say, “I have to go to the bathroom” and then leave the bar for us to try and track her down. This happened 3 times when I was with her.\n\nHer mentioning she needed a wake up call wasn’t too alarming to me. Loads of college students drink and I didn’t take her seriously about being an alcoholic. After the month of drunk driving snaps is when I realized this could end poorly.\n\nThe incident. \n\nOn one of the weekends she wasn’t scheduled to work, we went out for a late dinner with a mutual friend. She had been drinking all day and had 2 drinks at the restaurant when she became unresponsive and passed out in her seat in the restaurant around 9:30 or so. She had never passed out before. Blacked out-many times, but she didn’t sound inebriated or display any sign of drunkenness whatsoever in any of those situations. We were both pretty fucking embarrassed and I was a smidge angry to have to drag a passed out women from restaurant. The mutual friend that I had dinner with also was aware of my fwb’s drinking problems and that she was in a downward spiral. In jest, one of us had mentioned,\n\n“We should just drop her ass off in detox for alcohol poisoning so she can finally have her god damn wake up call. She wont remember the last 8 hours of today anyways. She will probably think a stranger dropped her off and would be none the wiser.” \n\nSo thats exactly what we did. I left and went home. She came to and sobered up there, and had no idea how she got there, or any recollections of the evening. I lied to her and said we got dinner and a few drinks, and then she ran off as she was prone to and we couldn’t find her. A week later or so, she got her hospital bill which was a few grand she couldn’t afford. I stopped seeing around this time, so I’m not sure if “she had her wake up call or not.” \n\nTLDR: dropped an alcoholic off at detox to give them a wake up call when I could have easily just taken care of them at home myself.",

      "description": "I have a second job as a coach for a high school girls lacrosse.  We currently have pre-season training going on and I see the kids a few times a week to run around the indoor track or do weightlifting. It's always run by the head coach and myself (assistant coach) but because I work closer to the school, sometimes I get to the school first and get practice underway until the head coach arrives. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe athletes had practice on Valentine's Day, and I decided to change things up a bit. The head coach was still en route so I gathered the troops and talked to them about Galentine's Day while we waited. In my monologue, I suggested they recognize all the strong women that came before and use this day to turn to each other and make a commitment to celebrate and unite as strong, young leaders. I finished my statement by saying it's hard being a woman in today's culture and girls should stick together and work to raise each other. My speech lasted about 60 seconds, most of the kids seemed receptive, and afterwards practice went on as usual. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next afternoon I get an email from the school's athletic director with the head coach and some other big honchos cc'd in. He instructed me, in no gentle terms, that I was a coach and my interactions with the students should be strictly lacrosse related. The AD was not thrilled with the fact I was \"pushing an agenda\" without the head coach present and gave me a slap on the wrist for \"unprofessional behavior\", implying that I wouldn't get a third chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reached out to the head coach immediately to ask what the fuck was going on. She told me although my intentions were good, apparently some athletes thought I was specifically targeting them in my speech for being mean to other girls on the team. One told her parent who went over the coaches' heads straight to the athletic director. Head coach acknowledged that I had the best of intentions, but it wasn't my place to say that to my athletes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am utterly flabbergasted. I thought telling high school girls \"women are great, be excellent to each other\" was simple and safe but apparently not. I thought I was doing something good but everyone around me seems to believe I stepped out of line. ",

      "description": "Throwaway since my entire household uses reddit. Sorry, kind of long.\n\nOn Christmas day, one of the roommates offered everyone in the house some of his opened bottle of wine. It was gone by that night. \n\nI had received a different bottle of wine as a Christmas gift from my mom. I left it on the table for the next few days, intending to put it away, but it kept slipping my mind. It was one of those Game of Thrones bottles with a pretty cool label. Game of Thrones is a big deal in our house, and I had wanted to open it for the premiere. \n\nI came home from work Friday to find it opened and half drank. Pretty bummed, I wanted to know who did it so I could explain that it had been mine. When I found out, I texted him and just let him know what was up - that was mine and had been a gift. He immediately replied that it was the wine our other roommate had offered to him before it was offered to me. I explained that no, that bottle was gone. The one he was drinking tonight was mine. I got no reply. \n\nThe next day I was busy and really only saw him in passing. On Sunday afternoon when I saw him again, I asked if he'd be willing to replace the bottle or if I was just eating the loss. He got a little annoyed and said people drink his stuff all the time and he never asks for it to be replaced. Now, there is one person in this house who drinks other people's alcohol on a regular basis and it's not either one of us. And he knows that. I said I only cared because it was a Christmas gift that I had a plan for, then walked off to my room, deciding not to pursue it further at that point. I realized it was partially my fault for leaving it out. As I entered my room and pushed the door closed it shut rather forcefully. Totally unintentional, I swear. I wasn't really feeling more than disappointed and a little frustrated at this point, and I haven't intentionally slammed a door in anger since I was a kid. \n\nWe ran into each other a little bit later and he asked, \"You do understand it was a mistake, right?\" I said a bit tersely \"yeah, but you haven't even apologized for it.\" He started raising his voice at me at this point, and I definitely started to raise mine back in reflex. He was saying a lot about how it matters to him when people drink his beers but he never asks for it back or an apology. He kept saying it was a mistake, and I said I agreed that I shouldn't have left it out but once he realized it was mine instead of the other bottle that an apology would be warranted. That's when he screamed at me that he didn't make any mistake, but rather that I did. His reasoning was that I should have known that he would think it was the other bottle (the one opened, drank by all, and emptied 3 days prior) and open it and drink it, and my refusal to reconcile with my mistake was not his problem. \n\nIt was at this point that I got confused and dropped my raised tone. I said that made no sense. How could I have known that he would think that? He kept yelling, yelled that I was too emotional, then walked off. Now unfortunately he is also the landlord's son. He told me he wanted me out in 30 days. I thought it was just something said in anger and decided to let him cool off. I waited until I was about to go to bed that night and apologized for getting so heated and making him upset, because I was. I can be a little reactionary when I feel people getting upset with me and that's what happened here. My emotions were especially out of wack because I was/am stil dealing with being sexually assaulted on Christmas eve. Not an excuse for getting heated and I will own up to that, but it explains it a little. I never wanted a blow out fight over this, just a \"shit, sorry dude\" at minimum. Regardless, he told me my apology means jack shit to him, and that anybody willing to \"come at him\" in his own house like that would be willing to do it again. He said he lets us live here out of the kindness of his own heart and I abused that.\n\nHe served me with a notice on New Year's Eve in front of a roommate and a party guest. Now I'm being kicked out of my house over wanting an apology for a bottle of wine. Am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for requesting this from my friend who lives with me for reduced rent",
      "description": "Tldr; friend lives with us for cheap rent, reacted furiously to my request to give my long distance wife and I a day to ourselves in our home and asked that we do not do so again. \n\nI'll try to keep it to the point.\n\nMy wife and I bought a house last year. We live in a HCOL area so this was a big deal for us, a very significant part of our lives. Prior to that we had each been saving and living in random shared accommodation for years, so a huge motivation for us to buy was to have our own space together.\n\nThe property we got is somewhere we hope to one day start a family and so it is more than we need for two people. We considered getting a lodger and one of my best friends (let's call them J) was looking for somewhere at the same time. Despite being wary of ruining an important friendship through the friction of living together, we decided it made sense. This was the first time in my life that I was in a position like this and for reasons I can't really explain it was and I guess still is important to me that I was giving a friend a  good deal. We settled on offering J the room for 600 instead of 900.\n\nWe lived together like this with no problems for a while and then for work reasons my partner moved overseas. This means that we will see each other approximately 4 times a year for the next 3 years. I continued to live in the property with J for the next few months with no issues.\n\nThe first time my partner got time off work to visit was over Christmas. A few weeks before this we asked J if we could have the place to ourselves for a couple of days while my partner was here. His response did not seem particularly enthusiastic, but nor did I notice any particular resentment about it. J said he would work something out, and if necessary stay with his girlfriend. We did not discuss specifics such as dates and I was quite content that there were no problems.\n\nFast forward to the week before my wife got home and she wanted to confirm that it was still ok for us to have the place to ourselves so she sent a message with the dates we thought would be most convenient for J given the plans we knew he had over Christmas. His reply was very snippy and said he had not realised this was still a thing and it was not ideal to be unable to come home but that he would stay with his gf. We thought this was really weird but as he was away at the time we didn't have a chance to speak in person we just said thanks and left it at that.\n\nOver the next week J was very off with me, refusing to engage in conversation (messages) with me etc. This was out of character and definitely a consequence of simmering resentment that my wife and I didn't understand. Finally, my wife arrives home and we don't have much on our minds except each other and we have an amazing day spending our first Christmas together (not actually Christmas, just another day we chose to call that) as a married couple in our home that we had bought together (bonus: it was one of the best days of my life). As agreed J stayed with his girlfriend and we are grateful for this, despite being wary about his message and feeling that hanging over us. \n\nThe next day he sends a very hostile message asking us to do him a favour and next time my wife was visiting not to ask him not to be in the house he rents from us. I reply asking if that was everything that was bothering him and he confirmed there was nothing else. We suggested that we talk about it when he was home.\n\nHe arrives home and stays in his room for a couple of days (unprecedented behaviour for him) until eventually I ask him if he wants to talk. Basically, he said his problem was that it was inconvenient to him that we would ask him to be out of the house and that he found it mind blowing that we would think it was an acceptable request. He had run it past other people and they unanimously agreed with him.\n\nIn reply we were pretty firm that we didn't think it was an unreasonable request and that he should have said if he was unhappy so we could work something out that didn't inconvenience him. He said it was the general fact he couldn't come home that was inconvenient rather than the specifics. I know it's not really relevant, but for context his long term girlfriend lives reasonably close by and it's not unusual for him to stay with her. Obviously we would not have asked him to sleep on the streets or get a hotel or something. The conversation ended with an agreement that it came down to a difference of opinion about whether the request was normal and acceptable.\n\nThat was a couple of days ago now, but I have since been feeling rather bitter about the whole situation. I feel like a close friend of both of us should understand our need for some time alone in the brief spells we get together. I also feel extremely resentful about his bitterness towards us, and the fact he was speaking to other people about how unreasonable we are, despite the fact we give him a significant discount on his rent for being our friend.\n\nI have tried to be as unbiased as possible writing this, I hope I have managed to present an accurate picture because I am looking for honest feedback about whether my feelings are justified and whether I should set them out plainly to J.",

      "description": "First time here, sorry for any issues and this happened years ago so it is kind of blurry with what was said. This account is mainly for a game but I do sometimes branch off and can be considered a throwaway.\n\n\nContext: This happened in high school, I believe my second year with Friday's being a shorter day and during break time, there was a lot more on offer including hotdogs with the usual bacon rolls, sausage rolls and there was plenty of choices normally. I should also mention I have autism which is kind of vital.\n\n\nStory: One day, after one of my classes, I went to the canteen and waited in one of the three lines with it being for hot food. I was behind the deputy head and trying to look to see what was left since I was quite a bit behind and even said to myself \"I hope there is still some hotdogs left\" since I liked having a hotdog on Friday.\n\nThat was when the deputy head looked back and said \"There's nothing there for you\" and, due to my autism, I took it literally and just left the queue and went off to the extension of the school as that was where my next class was. I was never great with jokes and always took them literally like if someone said I was in trouble, I would believe it and be worried at what I did.\n\nAnyway, I'm now in my maths class after the bell went off and a few minutes into it, the deputy head knocks on the door and asks to see me. He wondered why I wasn't in the queue anymore and I explained to him that he said there wasn't anything there. He said he was just joking around and offered to let me go back to the canteen to go get something. I refused since, in my mind, there wouldn't be much I'd want and I would be wasting 5-10 minutes in a class I really struggled with plus I wouldn't be able to explain it.\n\nI should mention that, after the confrontation and him saying it was a joke, I did start crying, high school was hell for me so I guess it all piled up at the time and the deputy head did say for me to wait after class as they would get something for me. I didn't believe it considering his past action before I went back into class. I imagine people were looking at me but the teacher did give me some tissues and didn't ask me any questions.\n\nAt the end of class, I waited for a minute but he never showed up and so I had to rush to next classroom which was on the opposite side of the main school which was History. I believe 20 minutes into the class, the deputy head found it and walked over to give me a bag containing two different sandwiches, a bottle of water and some grapes.\n\nI got a lot of questioning looks and my friend asked what I got and I just said quietly as I put it next to my bag \"I don't know why I got this...\" but I never threw it away and after my last class, I just went home as it was the end of the day and aside from one sandwich, I did eat it all.\n\n\nHowever, thinking back on it recently, I really feel like I was in the wrong for taking a simple joke so seriously and I feel like I might have unintentionally guilt tripped the deputy head without realizing it. As for the deputy head, I think he knew I should have something to eat since it was a lot of time to go without anything to eat or drink so that was probably their reason (about 6-7 hours) but still...\n\nTLDR: I took a joke seriously and left the canteen without food. The deputy head told me it was a joke after taking me out of class and did offer solutions with me leaving class for time but I refused. They then said to wait after class but I didn't, thinking it was another joke and not trusting but he did give me a bag of food in my next class.\n\nAITA for that situation in the past?",

      "description": "Throwaway because I don't know who in my office uses Reddit. \n\nMy old boss quit like 6 months ago.  New boss seems alright, pleasant enough, pretty high energy.  Due to the nature of our positions we work pretty closely together.  We know a little bit about each other's personal lives (nothing major or private,) just general stuff like spouse's, children's and pet's names, hobbies, education, etc. We get along very well but I wouldn't call us friends. Today he had to leave in the middle of the day, informing me that his 15 year old twins were home sick from school today and he was going to go pick them up some medicine, check in and come back. He was gone a little longer than expected but it wasn't a big deal, i'm pretty independent and had plenty to do. When he got back I asked: \"How are your poor babies doing?\" trying to be friendly. \n\nNow looking back, it could have seemed like an odd thing to say. In my family we call all the kids babies, regardless of age. When talking to my mother about my younger siblings we still call them babies. Pretty much it's interchangeable for \"my kid\" or \"your kid,\" even if said kid is an adult. That being said, the following exchange was surprising to me:\n\nMe: \"How are your poor babies doing?\"\n\nBoss: \"They're not babies, they're in high school.\"\n\nMe: \"Awe, but they'll always be your babies no matter how grown up they get\" *chuckle*\n\nBoss: \"Are you stupid? They're fifteen, they're not babies.\"\n\nHe then proceeded to enter his office and slam the door. I haven't spoken to him since as he left for a meeting while I was in the restroom. I'm not really upset more just perplexed. I don't plan on saying anything about it, just pretending it never happened but . . . AITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway because I don't want to risk anyone seeing this post on my main.\n\nNow before I start, I'd like to say that I know that this is going to seem a little bit similar to [that episode of HIMYM](https://how-i-met-your-mother.fandom.com/wiki/The_Stinsons), but believe me, I wish my situation was as comical as that one. \n\nHere's a bit of background- My mother was an only child with three kids, dad left after I, the third one, was born (though if I'm being honest I'm not even certain if we all have the same dad, she never liked to talk about our dad). Grandparents dead, no contact with any other family members. Me, my two brothers, and her are the extent of the family.\n\nSo let me start this off by saying that my mother is dying. She has probably a month to live, and that's being hopeful. I'm not going to bother going into the details, and if I'm being quite honest, I'm not 100% sure of all of them. Apparently it's common for patients with it to have heart attacks or strokes, and after she had one stroke she asked that if she had another one to not help her and let her go. I'm not certain if the hospital is allowed to do that, but that was her request (the reason I'm not sure of all the details is because I'm not at the hospital with her. My older brother stays with her, and me and my other brother try to make it to any important news sharing from the doctor. \n\nWhen we were younger, my mother always said she wanted to see all of us settle down and start a family with someone we loved, so we could have what she never got to. Both of my older brothers succeeded and made her happy with that, but I have not. However, I have been in an extremely casual relationship for the past year. I'm talking basically a FWB type thing but slightly more serious. We've gone out on dates with other people in that time with no jealousy, but if either of us ever wanted to maybe make things more serious, we'd be open to the possibility of it. I've brought her home to holidays and such at home, but my mom is aware of how casual we are. \n\nSo with my mother's wish she always expressed when we were younger, and the current... situation, I've been considering telling my mom that my \"girlfriend\" and I are engaged, so that she can die at least thinking I'm on my way to creating the life she always wanted for me. When I told my brothers my idea, they had different responses. The oldest said I was an asshole for even considering manipulating our mother, but the other understands where I'm coming from and would be okay with me doing it, even if he wouldn't do it if he was in my situation. I also talked to my \"girlfriend\" and she said she would do it if I thought it was for the best. I'm just worried that if I do my oldest brother will think I'm an asshole and resent me for it, and honestly I'm not too sure if it's the best idea myself.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA?",

      "description": "So this weekend I (21/M) wanted to come home from college and visit my parents for the weekend. It's Super Bowl Sunday and the Lunar New Year (we're Vietnamese) is this coming Tuesday, so I thought it would be nice to spend some time with them. \n\nAs a full-time student and a part-time worker, I called out weeks ahead of time so I could make this visit. That being said, since I didn't have work this weekend, I thought that it'd be nice to finish up on this portfolio I'm working on since I don't normally get this much freetime during the week. For this portfolio I needed 10 of my best design pieces, a cover letter, and 2 essays. This seems pretty standard, but I'm taking this application very seriously as the program accepts only 30 students per year. And unfortunately this is something I have to do on the side, since my current classes and work are also a priority. Therefore I also had a couple of assignments to complete this weekend as well.\n\nSo on Friday night and all of Saturday, I basically worked my ass off doing as much work as I could, so I could do some more and on Sunday and be finished by the time the game kicks off. But earlier today, as I was still doing my homework the door bell rang and I discovered that my parents invited friends and family over for lunch and to hang out during the Super Bowl. This was something my parents didn't tell me about as I was expecting to have some alone time with them later tonight when we're watching the Super Bowl and having dinner. Since I was still busy with my work I kept myself shut in my room and didn't bother making menial small talk. \n\nIt wasn't until a bit when my parents came into my room and asked me to come out and hang out for a bit. I kindly declined, since I thought they would understand my circumstances. But after that, they would come back every 5 or so minutes to get me to come out and get some lunch despite how busy I was. But even then, I was indecent and still in my sleep wear, since trying to finish up my assignments was the first thing I did when I got up this morning. After a few more attempts, I finally snapped and raised my voice at them, enough to where (though not intentional) everyone in the kitchen and living room could hear me. I basically told my parents to leave me alone to let me do my homework and that I'll come out whenever I'm finished. They left, then my mom came back, brought food to my room, and has left me alone for the last hour or so. All I wanted to do was finish my work and watch the Super Bowl with my mom and dad, but I feel terrible about it as it must be embarrassingly awkward for their guests.\n\nOne half of me says yes I am the asshole, while the other says it was justified. Needless to say, I definitely could have handled the situation a lot better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tldr:** \n\nI came home to visit my mom and dad for the weekend, with a shit ton of homework due on Sunday along with portfolio work I needed to do to apply for a very competitive undergrad program. They had guests come over to watch the Super Bowl and celebrate the Lunar New Year, which I was not told about. After my dad was becoming very insistent on me coming out to have lunch with everyone, I raised my voice at him and told him to leave me alone so I could do my work.",

      "description": "I am more of the kind of person that likes to upkeep vs. deep clean. So when I see something is dirty, I clean it. If I'm in the bathroom and the sink is dirty, I clean it up. If I see the trash is full, I take it out. Every now and again I'll go ahead and clean an entire room, but I don't feel the need to announce when I clean. I especially don't announce it if all I've done is wipe down the stove or counters. \n\nA couple of my roommates on the other hand, make it known when they clean something, which is fine, but it's how they say it that annoys me. For example, one of my roommates cleaned the kitchen and ended the text with telling us to keep up with dishes for the rest of the semester. We're all guilty of occasionally letting dishes rack up, but telling us to keep up with them for the rest of the semester rubbed me the wrong way. I hand wash all my dishes almost immediately after using them because I know if I don't, I will forget about them. So typically, it's not my dishes that rack up. Or in some instances, they'll be passive aggressive after they've cleaned up. I think the thing that gets to me the most is that they just assume I don't clean. I don't expect anyone to assume it was me that cleaned the kitchen if I don't say so, but they'll just assume someone else did and then jump to a conclusion. \n\nLast year I lived with different roommates and never had any issues with not being clean. I did the same thing I do now and never had any issues. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I don't say anything when they send these texts, but I just want to make sure I'm not getting in my own head. My thought process is that we all live here, we all clean. We're just doing what we're supposed to do so why make a big deal out of it? I really just want some other perspectives here so if I'm being a jerk I can adjust. ",

      "description": "My brother (early 30s) is autistic. He is high functioning but his disability is immediately obvious to anyone who interacts with him. He recently informed the family that he has a girlfriend in the Philippines he met through an online dating site that he video chats with. We all think it is very weird and we are pretty uncomfortable with it. We know American men who have lived in the Philippines who said tons of women their desperately want an American husband so they can live in the US, so we strongly believe that's what's going on here. At first we were discussing how it was weird but ultimately harmless because he has little money so would never be able to fly her across the world. (He works part time minimum wage and that barely covers living expenses). This is assuming she can't afford her own ticket. But then we noticed that they are Facebook official and both posting lots of cringy stuff on facebook, and he recently changed his profile pic to include a screenshot of her. So still I think ultimately probably harmless but pretty embarrassing. My mom wants me to talk to him about it and tell him what the men we know who have lived in the Philippines have said. Basically she (along with others in the family) wants him talked out of the whole thing but thinks it's better if it comes from a sibling. I am one of two siblings who is in a position to talk to him in person, and the other sibling refuses. Letting him know when he is making a big social misstep is something I gave often done, and I think this qualifies, but it also seems to make him happy. Would I be the asshole if I told him his long distance girlfriend is likely just looking to use him to get a greencard?",

(I respect your opinion if you believe that this isn’t a valid gender identity, but I find the idea convincing from both my personal experience and a biological capacity.)\n\nAdditionally, I am extremely androgynous. I have been been asked what I *am* in everything from a swimsuit to a skirt to, once, rather remarkably, full nudity. \nIn a practical sense, this means that, because most people classify others as male or female, I have a lot of Schrödinger’s conversations- I don’t know what a stranger perceives me to be unless they say something obviously gendered.\n\nAdditional relevant information is that I’m mostly anatomically female. I do have some mild dysphoria from that (I genuinely hate most of my secondary/post-pubertal sexual characteristics, and am active working towards fixing that issue), but I can usually avoid situations where I know it’ll crop up.\n\nSo, walking up to a public restroom, pay my 50 Euro cent and reflexively try to enter the women’s restroom, because honestly, I just need to piss. The attendant waves me in the direction of the men’s room.\nAfter a moment or two of hesitation, I call upon my limited German and tell him I am female. He looks me over, shrugs, and doesn’t try to stop me agin. Some of the other patrons are noticeably uncomfortable, and I leave as quickly as possible.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making everyone else uncomfortable? I’d have been happy to use the men’s but I lack the anatomy, and I’m unsure what the etiquette is about sitting and peeing there.\nThanks in advance for your time.\n",

      "description": "My bf’s close friend was the one who introduced us. My bf and i have been together for about 5 months. Let me tell you about his close friend: he’s really something.\n\nHe’s been obnoxiously annoying lately, especially when he’s high. He’s been high for about a whole month straight. I have no problem with my friends or anyone high but he’s the worst when he’s high. I used to smoke but i’m 3 months sober. He recently tried pushing me to take a hit when we were all hanging out on the weekend. I told him no about 4-5 times and he proceeds to ask why. I told him i chose not to and i’d appreciate it if he stops. He then still ask me why i’m sober. I just ignored him. My bf is also sober for the same amount of months as me but his friend pressured him to take a hit from his wax pen (electronic THC vaporizer). My bf  told me he only took one hit just for his friend to shut up. \n\nAnother time, i had a half full water bottle. I was planning to finish it but he asked if he can have some. I said that i’m thirsty and i plan to finish it myself. I guess he didn’t process that and took my bottle and drank all of it. I had to buy another one but it was just annoying. Whenever he tags along with my bf and i, i stay quiet the whole time because knowing him, he will be rude to me if i open my mouth.\n\nThen, my bf and i were going to give his cat a bath. Guess who popped up the scene? His friend was also high during this. We bathed the cat but as my bf and i were busy bathing the cat, i needed help to get a cup of water so i asked nicely for his friend to get me a cup of warm water. His friend decided to pour the rest of his mountain dew in the cup, mixed with warm water. He didn’t tell me and i almost poured the cup on the cat until i saw a hint of green. I just poured it out, washed the cup and refill it with only warm water.\n\nI get it that he’s my bf’s friends and i respect that. I even told my bf about all of this, my bf knows his friend annoys me to the max. My bf even agrees that he’s been a drag lately because of the use of marijuana. Honestly, he probably think this is all a joke and i could possibly be taking this to heart. I just don’t like having him around. Am i the asshole?",

      "description": "One of my closest friends (we'll call him Jim) semi-recently (within about the past 5 months) broke up with his girlfriend of 3 years (we'll call her Ashley) and moved away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have always been very close to Ashley, and would consider her to be my closest, or at the very least second closest friend, especially with the distance between Jim and I making hard to stay close. The way she acted around me was always a little off, and Jim definitely noticed too. But after Jim moved, things started to get...weird. It started when she made a passing comments about how she would date me or how attractive she thought I was. I didn't think much of it at first, because she's an inordinately nice person, and I figured she was just trying to raise my spirits after my past relationship. Because we're good friends, we message each a lot, and she always tells me how I'm pretty much her closest friend. The second to last time we hung out, we were watching a movie, and she decided to lean up to me and cuddle. Well, no big deal, I figured-after all, I think two friends can cuddle without it being sexual, and have with other female friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell at this point its pretty obvious that some sexual tension was building. The last time I hung out with her, we both got *extremely* drunk. She made some comments about how hard she was trying to not make out with me or take things further. Now, even in my borderline black-out levels of drunkenness, I had zero intention of taking things further, as I believe that would be incredibly scummy and immoral. However, by the end of the night we ended up cuddling in bed together-and I mean *really* cuddling. In the morning when I sobered up, I felt really bad about the whole situation. I thought i made that pretty clear, but she has a habit of not talking about these kinda things and acting like nothing happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell a couple days ago, Jim was talking to me and told me that Ashley had \"a thing\" with another close friend of ours (this one we'll call Bob). All I really know is that she spent two nights over at Bob's house, and he then later texted Jim and told him that he \"didn't want to go behind his back\" and that he and Ashley were planning on having \"a thing\". Neither Jim nor I were fully sure on what he meant by that, but he didn't want me to talk to her about it, as he doesn't want her to know he told me and didn't keep it between him and Bob. He said he was OK with it but that he didn't understand why Bob would be OK with it. While I'm almost positive that they did not have sex, I am 100% sure that some wicked intense cuddling was happening, and maybe some slightly sexual stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAshley never told me about any of this, and obviously has no intention to. Oddly enough, I feel used and cheap. Maybe I shouldn't, but I feel like she was kinda toying with me. I'm a pretty emotional person, so suppose I felt like we just had developed a closer bond, and the fact that she does shit with Bob  within the a month kinda hurts. She wont tell me about it because she knows it will hurt me. While I had no intention of trying things with her, the fact that she would do all this weird flirty stuff with me, not really talk about it, and then spend two nights at one of my close friend's house doing god knows what makes me feel used. I don't want to paint her in a bad light, though, as we are extremely close, and she has never been anything but overtly nice to me, and I have confided things to her that I would never  tell anyone else. That being said, with this whole situation, I told her that I no longer want to hang out with her 1 on 1, and I really don't feel like speaking to her at the moment. I know that I said earlier that two people can cuddle without it being sexual, but this whole situation with Bob feels off to me. Idk\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for feeling used and being mad at her?",

      "description": "For some brief context I'm 20 going on 21. I'm trying to enlist, but had a ticket I had to take care of before I could go any further. My father has always been there and my mother has never been apart of my life, so he's filled both roles.\n\nMy dad has always been my best friend and will always be my best friend, but he's very much the \"overprotective\" type in terms of parenting. I've stated to him multiple times that I need to fight my own battles otherwise I never will and he agreed entirely with me, but since then he still acts like he's coming to my rescue whenever I need to stand up for myself. I just recently got a ticket for unreasonable speed with poor weather conditions (wrecked my car) and I had asked him for some advice and if he could come just so I know what I'm doing. It came time for me to go up and talk to the judge and DA to see if I couldn't get the ticket dismissed or bumped down so it wouldn't affect my time with enlisting. He asked if I wanted him to come up with me and I said yes, but let me do the talking I want you there as support (because yes he is very much who I look to if I get nervous or stumble) he agreed he wouldn't say anything. So the judge asked me if I wanted any documents explaining what unreasonable speed is due to it being a vague area. I was about to say no when my father starting viciously shaking his head yes, so I said yes. The judge said it may take up to 30 days for them to get some documentation from the State Trooper explaining, he asked me if there was a date I would prefer to come in on and just before I was about to explain my situation and that I didn't need the document I just need the whole court process over with so I could continue with the recruitment process my dad just started talking and explaining everything and said we could talk to the DA to lower the ticket. My dad then proceeded to not even let me talk to the DA and instead took complete control of the situation for me.\n\nAfter we had left the court room I confronted him saying that was exactly what I didn't want him to do. He started going off about how I wasn't going to push the issue and I was already done talking that's why he took over. I just got quiet and didn't say anything and he just kept pushing the issue saying he doesn't understand why I'm upset. I was set off by this and told him that he always does this, he needs to step back and let me fight my own battles. He didn't understand this and got extremely upset with me over this, explained that he only wants to help me. I explained even further there is a difference between helping and doing it for me, I'm 20 and need to deal with things so I know how to.",

      "description": "Throwaway, I’m on mobile, so sorry for formatting. I’m writing this from the airplane, seeing as this just happened a few minutes ago. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are on a flight direct from California to Europe. It’s 10 hours... we left at 6pm Monday and are arriving at 12pm Tuesday in Europe. So a lot of our fellow passengers are taking advantage of this to catch some sleep. \n\nBf and I are in window and middle seats, respectively. In the aisle there is (or was) a guy, probably in his 30’s. Pretty nice guy, was chatting with us before takeoff, etc. \n\nThe entire flight, bf and I have been using the built-in entertainment systems provided by the airline to watch movies, track the flight, etc. since we aren’t tired and are terribly bored. Most other people have their screens off and are sleeping, but a few others are doing the same as us. \n\nAbout an hour ago, I noticed the guy next to me (aisle guy) was shifting, trying to find comfortable sleeping positions, alternative between putting a blanket over his head and taking it off. I didn’t think much of it, because I’ve done that too, and it’s never been because of light disturbance. I figured he was just trying to find a comfy sleeping position. \n\nSo finally, about 5.5 hrs into the 10hr flight (12am California time, 8am Europe time) he gets up, finds a flight attendant, and moves. He wasn’t rude about it - when he came to get his stuff he said “no offense, I’m just switching seats because of the screens”. Apparently our screens were bothering him and he couldn’t sleep. \n\nThe fact that that might have been an issue honestly never even crossed my mind, which makes me feel a bit asshole-ish. But at the same time I feel like it would have been unreasonable for us to not use our screens when we aren’t tired and can’t sleep and have nothing else to do. He didn’t ask us to turn them off, but I still feel like a dick for not even noticing and thus forcing him to move. \n\nWere we the assholes here? ",

I was nice at first, but i began catching feelings and falling for her. So i asked for space and told her i was always here for her, but i was still to into her to be friends like that. (I've never been friends with an ex before) \n\nFlash forward to last night:\n\nMy ex came over to my house. Told me she's tired of me lying to myself. She said i didn't have feelings for her, and i only lust for her. So to prove it. She started stripping and told me to have sex with her. Cause after sex I'd know if i actually loved her or i just lust for her cause I'm single and horny and she's hot. \n\nI asked her that if she needed to do this to see if she had feelings for me and she said no, she only loves me as a friend and doesn't want to be with me at all. \n\nI told her what happens if we do this and i have feelings for her and she said \"I'd respect that and give you your space\" so i told her let's keep doing that. Cause sex isn't just sex with her. We've been through too much, and I'd definitely want more and want her to be with me. \n\nSo basically i turned down sex last night, cause she thought we'd bone and I'd be like \"wow I was just horny, let's be best friends\" \n\nTldr: \nTurned down sex with my ex, because i don't believe i could do that, or be close to her without having feelings for her.

My neighbor relies on an electric collar to make his dog behave, which works only after he's repeatedly called him and shocked him multiple times.\n\nTo avoid problems, I try to time when I go out with my dogs bc I don't want to be caught on the stairs/in the hallway at the same time with mine and his dog, but we've had run-ins before where I quickly have to duck away with mine.\n I'm not going to act like my dogs are perfect, one is reactive but I'm working on him. The other is pretty okay with other dogs as long as they don't invade her space. Even so, they are always on leash so I can control them, unlike my neighbor who relies on his dog listening to him and his collar.\n\nI contacted the front office (last October) about this happening and they told me to take a picture of them and email it. At this point, I've emailed them over a dozen times and I believe they have fined him once but it hasn't changed this problem.\n\nTonight we had a run-in and his dog was very close to mine. He finally got his dog away after shocking it a few times. I hadn't said anything to him until this point about it, but I spoke up and said \"Hey, he's a pretty big dog, he probably needs a leash.\"\nHe was pretty dismissive, \"Oh he's fine, he's just training.\"\n\nI have already reported him this week so I'm not sure if the office is already planning on doing something, but am I an asshole for continuing to report him?",

      "description": "This is a really stupid question -- you've been warned. But it's been driving me nuts. \n\nHere's the sitch': my partner and I live in a lovely apartment building, we get along with our neighbors and it's all peachy. However, the new upstairs neighbors are super inconsiderate with their noise-levels. I don't know *what* the hell they're doing, but there is consistent, non-stop, aggravating \"tap-tap-tap, taptaptaptap, tap-tap-tap, taptaptaptap\". It'll go on for hours. Not exaggerating here. \n\nMy hypothesis is that someone is at their computer or listening to music, and they habitually \"drum along\" with whatever they're listening to. They seem to wear headphones, at least, so that's nice. \n\nBut seriously, folks, this aggravates me to no end. (I get really bad tension headaches that sometimes morph into migraines, and I also have really weirdly specific anxiety triggers, which include strong wind, for an example. This tapping has turned out to be an anxiety trigger.) This endless tap-tap-tap-tap-tap when I'm trying to enjoy a quiet weekend afternoon, or at *fucking 11:30 at night*. It raises my anxiety to the point where my heart is beating like rabbit's, blood pressure is high, and sleeping gets pretty difficult. \n\n*Anyway, it's absurd, and I know that. Just giving some context as to why this drives me fucking bonkers.*\n\nMy partner says I should just bang on the ceiling when they do it, and they'll knock it off -- but I can't bring myself to do that, because I feel like nobody responds positively to that. (Why the hell should they?) \n\nSo. Would I be the asshole if I: \n1) Took my partner's passive-aggressive suggestion to just bang back at them. \n2) Took the time to go up to the apartment, introduce myself, and ask them to pretty-please stop drumming on the floor. At least in the fucking bedroom. At least at night. Please. \nor 3) (The one I'm least inclined to do) File a complaint with building management. \n\nI think #2 is the least asshole-ish option, but my partner says it'd be weird. \n\nSo, internet -- WIBTA?

      "description": "This began when I was a kid and noticed that my parents desk was a mess so I cleaned it as a surprise. My dad got mad at me for it. I'm now 29 and moved back into my parents house. I like to have a nice clean house so i keep my room clean and sometimes go on cleaning sprees where I'll clean the whole house.\n\nWe have had some drama in the past because of this. Basically, I try to clean something and my parents freak out, I mean like full blown insanity. I don't even clean it, I just suggest I might try cleaning it and ask if their OK with it. Its at this point that they just start yelling and say \"get out, get out right now, its our stuff don't touch it.\" And I try to remain calm but for some reason I don't instantly comply with their demands because in the moment I just freeze rather than instantly walk out of the room. their yelling gets louder and more aggressive and angrier which ends up making me mad so i may lose my temper and say something like \"fine, you want to yell at me for doing nothing... i might as well clean something\" I realize this is an asshole thing to do but I haven’t done this in a while but done it before so I guess this is what my parents are worried about.\n\nI hadn't cleaned up their part of the house like their room or their office in years and tonight I finished cleaning my room and since it was my moms birthday (my mom usually actually likes when I clean but I think since my dad hates it so much she agrees with him) and they don't have a problem with just dusting their problem is when it comes to moving their stuff around/organizing. So I figured I would do some dusting, no problem, everyone is happy.\n\nmy mom comes to see the room, everything is fine. I ask her nicely \"Can I straighten out this pile of papers? Just straighten out not move or anything\" She says well OK. So I start straightening out the papers. Then my dad comes up like a tyrant lunatic, doesn't even know whats going on and starts with the \"get out! get out! get out!\" And like I said I just freeze so they keep getting louder. my mom instantly sides with my dad and everyone's yelling at me and i'm generally calm and waiting for them to stop yelling so loud so I can decide what to do.\n\nSo yes, I probably shouldn't mess with my parents stuff in their room.\n\nI probably should leave their room the second they tell me to.\n\nAnd yes I should probably move out and get my own house.\n\nBut I still have the aching desire to make their house perfect.\n\nIn the times when I've managed to clean things it in the past and created trouble none of their stuff is ever lost and they usually really like how everything is so clean in the end. So sometimes I think maybe I should just let them get angry and clean their room for the greater good. Well lately I don't (past 15 years) because they are so insane about it.\n\nSo am I the asshole? and what should I do about still wanting to make the house clean? or is that a question for [r/Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice)",

      "description": "My sister is getting married this weekend, and while part of me is happy for her, most of me is dreading it because I don’t think it’s the right move. Some necessary context to help you decide if I’m wrong here - \n\nI’ve never liked her fiancé, even before they got together. I was vocal about my disdain, up until they started dating. Then I backed off completely with my outright dislike of the guy but I have to admit I’m cordial to him at best, and definitely not friendly. Now to the actual question. \n\nMy parents are not good at planning parties. Her fiancé’s parents are far away. My MIL is wonderful at party planning and is a saint, so my own mother asked her for help. But my MIL and I live a few hours from them. \n\nFor the past 4-5 months I have been transporting wedding items back and forth from my parents’ house to my MIL’s house. I travel for work, so sometimes these transfers have taken place during my work trips (which isn’t out right prohibited, but it does make me feel sketchy. Which I expressed to my mother and she blew me off). These trips aren’t super often, but probably one or two every other week. \n\nNow the wedding is three days away and there is still a lot to be transported. I have already volunteered to take off work Friday and drive down really early in the morning to get everything there. The wedding isn’t until Saturday. My sister just texted me on behalf of my mother asking me to leave work early on Thursday as well so that I can get there sooner and make sure we have everything we need. \n\nI really don’t want to do that. I’m taking my vacation time for this already. And I’ve already taken lots of time out of work to make trips for them. I want to tell my mom (who works from home) to make the drive herself tomorrow if she wants everything there so soon. But I am having a hard time deciding if I’m just being really selfish and mean because I already don’t want this wedding to happen, or if they’re being unreasonable asking me to leave work a day and a half early for items they could have retrieved themselves much sooner. \n\nSo, AITA?

      "description": "I hosted a party at my house a little while ago and when the party had wound down, me and my friend (casual friend, not super close) were hanging out having a drunken conversation. After a while, I had said I was tired and going to bed. This was around 5 am. He then continued to carry on a conversation which I had tried to end several times when I repeated myself again, saying I was tired and wanted to go to bed. I then followed up asking how he was getting home. He said he was driving so I offered to grab him a blanket and pass out on the rug since all the couches were taken. He ignored my question and continued to talk. I then told him I could call him a ride home and pick him up in the morning to grab his car which he also seemed to not hear. I tried bringing this up several more times until I finally started raising my voice and telling him to make up his mind and asking him if he could hear me. He seemed to ignore everything I said and kept trying to drum up more conversation. It ended up with me telling him to get out 45 minutes later (around 5;45 am) and (semi)forcibly escorting him to the door. He's usually a really good guy and I like hanging out with him, but I'm embarrassed to talk to him now. Am I the asshole for kicking him out?",

I will not share my results with him. AITA?\n\n\nMy Father was Adopted from a foreign country within a few weeks of his birth. The adoption paperwork that he has has his original name and a few bits about his adoptive parents, but no information on his biological parents. I know specific bits of information about the circumstances of his adoption so will be able to verify if the right person is found (not sharing on here though). \n\nHe had a decent childhood with his adoptive parents and grew up knowing about his adoptive status. Both adoptive parents have passed away over 15 years ago.  \n\nThere have been many discussions over the years about his genetics and family. Every time he has said he has no desire to find his biological family. He is happy with his life as it is. \n\nMyself on the other hand, I feel really strongly that I need to find this side. I am nothing like my family on my Mother's side and have strong genetic traits for the country where he was born. I was deeply unhappy as a child being the outsider.\nI have ordered an Ancestry DNA test in hope that I can find out more about his family. Having information about medical risks too will be awesome. In a best case scenario there may be a relative linked too. The likelyhood of finding his parents is small due to their age, but there is still a chance. \n\nIf, and I am well aware that it may be an if, a relative is found I do not intend to inform my father. I don't really have a plan in place for how to deal with it if I do find them though. I'm not sure they would welcome knowing their biological son doesn't want to know them. I would not make contact if that was the situation. \n\nI will be doing the test, this thread isn't to discourage me. But AITA for doing it without informing him? \n\nAlso any advice is appreciated. \n",

They have a tendency to not get along well with eachother. I really hate the constant conflicts between them, but they continue to hang out with eachother. I can't separate them despite the fact that they seem to outright hate eachother, and only get along for brief periods of time.\n\nOne person in the group[we'll call her Allie (not her real name)] has a tendency to frequently hit another person[nicknamed Dan] in the group, sometimes over minor stuff or for no reason at all, like shaking a bag of chips to evenly coat them with seasoning. Basically, she straight up acts like she hates him, sometimes. \n\nDan has a tendency to take or mess other people's with stuff without permission[I tried to leave the group after an incident where I had to pick up my stuff and was nearly late to class because he stole Allie's mechanical pencil[to eat the lead a second time that day], and I dropped my stuff, but I guilt tripped myself into going back to them], like food, a computer that someone is already using, etc.\n\nThe entire group seems to hate on a third guy for seemingly no reason, one incident that springs to mind is when Allie got mad at him for making jokes. They weren't about any serious topics like death or something like that, she literally just got mad because, in her words, \"I hate jokes\" [she would joke with us very frequently]. \n\nI'm scared to confront them about this, since they'll probably ignore me, or just say that i'm being stupid and whining for nothing. Am I the asshole if I would rather go be alone than be around them when they're together?\n\nTL;DR- basically, I'm good friends with people.

I even bought my old cell phone on Facebook Market so when I saw a phone I could buy my little sister for cheap, I decided to go for it. She was going to be upgrading from an iPhone 5s to an iPhone 7. I bought the phone for the cheap price of $200 and drove home to get the phone activated. Right when tried to get on, it was showing that I needed an update in order to be activated but it would not allow me get into the phone any further. Decided to take it to U.S Cellular, Verizon, and even to the Apple store to find out if there was anything I could do. I was still in contact with this guy and he told me at one point if it didn’t work I could get the full $200 back. After figuring out the problem, a flaw in the logic board that this phone experiences often, the guy who sold me the phone told me it is too much of a hassle to meet up again and I should’ve looked into it more before buying the phone. Is this my fault?? Should I have never expected him to let me return this phone in the first place? AITA?",

      "description": "So some backstory both my \\[18\\] girlfriend \\[19\\] and I are part of the same discord server as have the same friends. One guy \\[\\~20\\] in the discord has been having some \"financial issues\" and has know my girlfriend for about half a year. Around August of LAST YEAR he asked her for money to buy some souvenirs at some PAX convention because he didn't have any money left over from his airfare/hotel. Being the incredibly nice person my girlfriend is, she gave him about $250 for a total. It turns out that within a week he's purchased some new video games. Suspicious, me and a couple friends figured he just used the money she gave him to buy them. He claimed he gets \"grants\" from his school that average around $2000 or something and he would pay her back yet come September. He then asked her for another $250 to buy a Razer mouse and keyboard that was \"on sale\" and could get it cheap and that he would pay her back. Again, being the nice person my girlfriend is, she gave him the money. Welllll come September and he says he needs until October. Alright...getting suspicious again, but I try to stay out of it because I hate internet/Discord drama. So he then gets back to her around the end of October/early November and pays her HALF claiming he would \"give her the rest plus interest.\" Unsurprisingly, he asks for another $250 for reasons my girlfriend won't tell me because I've expressed serious anger about it before. He then tells her sometime December that \"plans have changed\" and he's going to be joining up with the US military, whatever the hell that has to do with anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's now late February THIS YEAR and he has yet to pay her back. It came up again in a conversation with her and in a blind rage I went on to Discord and messaged him saying stuff like \"you're a pathetic adult,\" \"stop leeching off girls you've never met,\" and \"if you need financial help get it in real life not Discord strangers.\" He replied obviously angry saying stuff like \"You're so tough behind a screen\" and \"You don't know the full story so shut the fuck up.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I don't know the full story and frankly I don't care but if you need help you shouldn't be leeching off of someone you've never met to purchase expensive and unnecessary stuff and claiming to pay them back. Someone like him has no right to ask for MORE MONEY claiming to pay them back after already $500 in debt to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Girlfriend is now pissed at me because she got angry texts from him saying things like \"Keep your boyfriend in check\" and \"I don't need his shit when he doesn't know anything about it.\" She is in school and said she doesn't want anymore drama. Should I have just stayed out of it or was I in the right to get involved?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Guy asks for $700 from my girlfriend and says he will pay her back but hasn't in in about 6 months, got pissed off any messaged him on Discord. Girlfriend gets pissed at me for getting involved and stirring up stuff.",

I love both of them and I don’t treat them any differently, to each other they’re sisters.\n\nNow my MIL is a good person I’ve never had problems with her but as long as I can remember she’s always had a preference towards my daughter. She’ll buy her clothes ask her about her day etc etc she’s very respectful towards my niece like way too formal and she doesn’t interact much. Now that the girls are growing they both are starting to see the favoritism. It hurts me because both call her grandma. \n\nI’ve talked about this to my SO and multiple times he’s said something to his mother but she blows it off. I know I need to say something. My question is though wibta if I start rejecting gifts for my daughter ending her visits due to the favoritism? \n",

      "description": "My sister has been vegan for many years and she is also raising her son vegan. He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA?

I moved in to stop the dog, but it started lunging and biting my dog things escalated pretty quickly. \n\nI kicked the dog off my wife a few times and it kept coming back (our GSD didn’t retaliate which was good/lucky) few moments later of snarling, lunging and biting  the guy ran up and got his dog as it circled for another pass. \n\nI walked up to his face and said “are you fu*king kidding me, letting your dog off the lead like that, fu*k sakes” he said “they got out the gate.” My wife said “sorry (for me) it’s the shock”.  That I reacted like that.\n\n(This was the only exchange of words)\n\nIn saying that the fella was a bit bigger than me mid 30s or so, he did seem like he was ready for me to hit him I could see that cross his mind (I have never been in a fight) but for me the thought didn’t cross mind. \n\nI turned around and walked away with our dog and wife, stopped around the corner checked on both of them, no blood drawn few scratch marks and a bit shaken up. \n\nMy wife said my reaction was fair and hopefully it makes the guy a bit more vigilant next time. \n\nAnyway spent the whole way to work over thinking my reaction... I know I’d sign say anything I regret but it was a reaction personally I wasn’t expecting... am I the asshole? \n\nTLDR ; dog attacks wife and my dog, I scream at his face for letting his dogs loose. \n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to deal with my parents?",
      "description": "This will probably be a long one, so strap in folks.\n\nThis August I started my freshman year of college. I came to a university about an hour and a half from my home and my boyfriend from back home would come to visit every weekend. \n\nFor some background, my parents have always been kind of ...weird? I hesitate to call them outright abusive, but going out to see my friends would always result in them making me feel guilty about not staying home with my family. I’d be expected to watch my sister (8) and brother (6) all summer long and during the week.\n\nThey were always specifically weird about me dating. My best friend when I was in 9th grade asked me out and I said yes. Yes we were both girls; yes I’m bi. Anyway, my parents flipped actual shit. I had come out to them, but I don’t think it was about that. They wanted me to explain why EXACTLY I liked my friend and wouldn’t accept the answers I would give. They cut me off from my only 2 friends and put me on “suicide watch” (my mom is a psych nurse). When I told my psychiatrist I felt depressed and had considered suicide, my parents yelled at me and told me it wasn’t that big of a deal. \n\nFlash forward to the fall of junior year, I start talking more and more to this guy that had always been part of my friend group but I never got to know that well. I tell my parents I want to date him. I immediately am told that I’ll never be left alone with him and that he’s not good enough for me and this and that. I broke it off with him quickly due to the intense pressure they had been putting on the relationship. Not too long afterwards, we started dating again because that’s what horny 16 year olds do. It had been kind of rough, but once he got his own car, we were able to sneak around pretty well. \n\nMy parents always suspected we were together. I told them we were casually dating but not official and I honestly think they have forgotten I told them that. My boyfriend and I have been together 2 years as of October though, and I’m honestly really happy in my relationship. \n\nFlash forward to early October this year: my parents find a corner of one of those sex ed condoms in my room back home and call me while I’m studying in the library. I’m essentially told I’m a whore (which I’ve actually been called due to my being on birth control because of suspected endometriosis), to send my phone (which my step father pays for... I wasn’t ever able to get a job back home because I was expected to babysit and no one would teach me how to drive) back to my parents, and that my parents wouldn’t be sending me the prescription for my Vyvanse (which I’ve been on for about 6 years for ADHD). I was accused of having sex in the house — something that would have been nearly impossible due to my parent’s schedules and also I just wouldn’t do that. \n\nNeedless to say, university was pretty difficult while I was unmedicated. I also got a statement from my school telling me that I owed them some $5,000. Seeing as my parents had effectively disowned me and my school wasn’t going to let me register for classes next semester because I had literally $200 in my bank account, I stopped going to classes and found a job. \n\nI was applying for a job at a coffee shop and an insurance agent from across the street told me to come in to her office and she’d interview me right then and there for a job as a telemarketer. Long story short, I ended up being pretty decent so she paid for me to take the licensing exam and I’m currently just waiting for the state to process my application. \n\nMy boyfriend from back home went to the local community college because he’s going to be able to go for 2 years debt free and then transfer to a university for comp sci. He’s moving down here on Friday (and I’m moving in with him) and he’s gonna go to the community here. Before you tell me how silly that is because we’re only 18, trust me I know, but really there wasn’t any other way I could get an apartment that I can afford before I get kicked out of my dorm because it’s the end of the semester. His parents are helping us out so much and I will be eternally grateful for them. \n\nMy parents wanted me to come home for thanksgiving. Apparently my mom (39) has been having seizures? My family has a history of weird made-up sounding medical conditions and I’m honestly not even sure what’s real or not in regards to that. I didn’t go home if that isn’t obvious. I also don’t think I want to come home for Christmas either. \n\nMy parents tell me it’s not fair to my brother and sister that I don’t come home, but I honestly fear for my safety if I were to go back home. My mom has filed a PFA against my step dad essentially for false imprisonment before and I honestly would have been able to do the same at least 3 times. \n\nTo be clear, my mom and I talk sporadically, but it’s not like she’s offering to talk about what’s going on. They came down here after the incident to have dinner with my boyfriend and I go talk about what happened. It was actually terrible. They put my sister in the chair between him and I and they were essentially interrogating me the whole time. My step dad kept offering me money (which he wouldn’t have actually given me) to break up with my boyfriend. My boyfriend isn’t like a terrible person or anything. He was a decent student I high school and my friend group is really just d&amp;d and mtg nerds. I was very involved in high school (president of like 3 clubs) and he supported me every step of the way. My parents know all of this. \n\n\nI know there are probably gaps that I didn’t fill in all the way, so feel free to ask questions. I’m also on mobile so idk if the formatting is gonna be weird or not. \n\nTl;dr: am I the asshole for not wanting to go home for the holidays after my parents disowned me?",

      "description": "For the last year I've had the same stylist, who I would see 2-3 times a month. She knew what I wanted and all I had to do was sit down and enjoy the experience. I have absolutely no clue what sized guards she used, what type of clippers, or anything to do with what I was paying her to do. A few weeks back I learned that she retired and my hair has been getting pretty shaggy since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a job interview tomorrow so I finally decided to find a new stylist. I went to my normal shop, sat in a new (to me) person's chair, and tried to explain what I wanted. I told her that I believed the sides were usually a 2.5-3 with the top longer because that's what I styled. I also said that I'd like to start with cleaning everything up and working down from there because I wanted to look good for my interview. I don't know where the miscommunication happened, but before I knew what was happening she popped on a 3 and did one long line right along the top of my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short I sat there in silent rage as I lost all of my hair, paid, and walked out without leaving a tip. I talked to my buddy after calming down a bit and he says I should have tipped because she did her job and it was my fault for not better explaining or showing a picture of what I wanted.\n\nI understand the logic there and if I went to Great Clips I probably would've done just that and never would've made this post. The issue is that I pay $40 just for a basic cut at my barbershop and I feel that extra cost goes to having a stylist that knows better than to chop off large chunks of a customer's hair before making 100% sure that they understand the size they're asking for. On top of that, I clearly said a 3 on the side while keeping the top longer so why would I get a buzz cut out of that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is what I had](https://menhairstylist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/short-messy-hairstyles-for-men.jpg)\n\n[This is what I wanted](https://www.menshairstylestoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Spiked-Fringe-Textured-Top-High-Fade.jpg)\n\n[This is what I got](https://www.menshairstylestoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Number-4-Haircut-Buzz-Cut.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AItA for not tipping? Is this entirely my fault for not showing a picture of what I wanted? Or am I in the right to be angry about this and not tip for what I feel to be poor service?",

      "description": "Have a good friend. Three years ago he broke up with his ex of five years; it wasn't well known but they already had their life together planned out, and they almost were engaged (but, honestly, they may as well have been). They broke up b/c of some issues my friend was going through, but whatever. \n\nHung out with friend the other day. He wants to try and pursue his ex's best friend. I bluntly told him I thought that was a terrible idea and hed be a big asshole for even trying. \n\nOf course, no one likes being called an asshole. So He got mad and started getting defensive. I explained my reasoning, but that didn't matter. Our hangout ended early due to this. \n\nNow, I know you \"can't stop\" who you fall for. But you can control who you date. And i think that going after the friend of someone who almost married you is completely disrespectful. Now, if it was someome you only dated for a few months, yea sure it's not that big of a deal. Heck if the ex is obviously fine with it and has completely moved on,  go for it. \n\nI obviously get a lot of people who disagree with me... until they are in the position themselves. One moment theyre saying \"you can't stop love\" or \"I'm not going to let my ex control my future love life\", and the next theyre saying \"I can't believe my friend is now getting intimate with my ex\" or \"it's so awkward to go to get togethers and see my ex with someone who was supposed to be my friend\". \n\nI hold this opinion because I know what it's like to watch this happen. It hurts. It sucks. It tears apart friendships, even if one attempts to stay strong. \n\nI do not just hold this opinion to my friend. I think this should apply to all. \n\nObviously, I can't stop him. And im not telling him \"what to do\". But i do think it is not only stupid and disrespectful, but drama inducing. And i will look down on him for doing it. \n\nSo... Am i an asshole? ",

      "description": "Let me begin by stating I do not like dogs, but I like our friend/roommate so I was happy to put up with them. \n\nSo at the beginning of September, we moved in with a friend (I will call her Pat) who has two service dogs. These service dogs are not truly trained as service dogs. When moving in, Pat said she wanted the big room in the house so she could keep her dogs in there while she was at work. My wife and I agreed to this. We moved in, and she let the dogs roam around outside the room. We didn't mind, as they weren't bad or misbehaved in any way. Then the landlord didn't like the dogs being left outside the house, so she brought them inside and left them inside while she was away at work. \n\nOver the past two months, we have been coming home to find dog poop in the kitchen, hallway, and living room area. Not just in a single pile, but its normally spread out. It was one of the dogs in particular, so Pat said she would keep the dog in her room after a month of talking to her about it. We were happy and didn't mind the other dog being out as the second dog wasn't really a problem. Well, this week the second dog pooped TWICE in the house. The first time, my wife came home to it and there were over 10 spots where there was poo. The second time was 2 days ago. Pat had let out the two dogs in the morning. My wife got home and let out the second dog again. The dog peed outside, then came inside and pooped twice on the floor. My wife and I talked to each other about it, then she had to go to work. We messaged each other more about this via Telegram app, venting to each other our frustrations about this. We didn't say anything mean about our roommate, but just that this was her problem, and that she really needed to do something about the dogs pooping (mind you they have pooped in the house over 15 times in the past 2 months).\n\nThen last night we went out for a Thanksgiving dinner, and at the end of it I get a call from our roommate. In the past, I told her that if my computer is unlocked, she can use it to game or browse the internet or watch videos. I don't mind since she doesn't have her own. Well, I left Telegram open and she decided to read the messages between me and my wife. Again, we didn't insult her, we said nothing bad ABOUT her, just voiced our opinions that we hated having the dogs poop in the house and that we should talk to her again about this. She decided that she didn't like my wife and I \"talking trash behind her back, or talking behind her back at all\" and that she was going to move out. Today she began to move out her stuff from the house. \n\nWe have talked to her about the dog situation several times. She has brought up that she will get diapers for her dogs, or hire a dog walker. She has done none of those, stating she doesn't have a lot of money. But she goes out and eats a lot, spends money on weed (we do too, but not as much cuz she wont use edibles), buys new expensive wigs, and even bought a new mattress pad for her bed. She has friends who she borrows money from, but this doesn't seem to be as important. My wife and I are just very tired of coming home to find smelly dog shit everywhere, and we were just venting to each other about it. We of course don't share all of our feelings with her because we are roommates and we are trying to be nice and accommodating. We also don't want to keep bringing these things up over and over and over because then we feel we are nagging her. Are we the assholes for venting to each other and not just straight out complaining to her like she wanted us to?",

      "title": "AITA for saying that people who donated to a Go Fund Me should be updated before it's shut down?",
      "description": "  \n\nTLDR: My sister is angry because I suggested that instead of just shutting down the Go Fund Me her daughter started for her and sending the funds to the adoption agency because she changed her mind about adopting, she should post an update explaining this to the donors and giving them a chance to have their money returned if that’s what they wanted.\n\nI’m going to try to keep this short but include everything that could be relevant. I’ve talked with a few people close to me about it and they say I’m NTA but I want to hear some objective opinions and maybe get some insight into what might be going on from people outside of the situation.\n\nMy sister, we’ll call her Susan, is very angry with me/basically not talking to me after a conversation we had. I’m really hurt and don’t understand why. We’ve had issues in the past but nothing we haven’t gotten through, and I thought we were close.\n\nA while ago she decided to adopt a child from overseas, which can cost upwards of $35,000, and one of her daughters, we’ll call her Lisa, started a Go Fund Me (GFM) to fund part of the cost of the adoption. In general I don’t like GFM or the philosophy behind it. I think people should work for what they want, not ask other people to pay for it. Even though I’m a bleeding heart liberal in some ways, I have a Libertarian streak. \n\nHaving said that, it’s not always black and white and when Lisa started a GFM for an emergency dental surgery that sounded very scary over a year ago, I contributed to it, and I contributed to Susan’s adoption GFM in the last month because it’s a really good cause and adoptions are ridiculously expensive, but mostly because I love my sister and wanted her to feel supported. So I contributed to the first one because I was afraid my niece was basically going to die without the surgery (it was a huge tumor inside of her mouth, or something along those lines), and I contributed to the adoption one for the reasons I already stated. I will never contribute to another GFM again as long as I live.\n\nSusan asked me to forward the GFM page to friends/put it on social media. I told her I don’t have social media and she said what about Reddit? (because I’m always sending her stuff from Reddit). I told her Reddit’s not like that, or at least not the way I use it. But I was trying to think of different ways to help her raise money, like doing a raffle or a race or something. I wanted to do something more quickly though and ended up making a donation and sharing the link with several close friends, 5 of whom donated. This was very hard for me to do because I really, really don’t like asking friends to do this kind of thing. Like I said I don’t believe in the GFM mindset to begin with, and I don’t like putting friends in the position of saying yes or no. But I did it for my sister despite feeling very awkward and uncomfortable, which I never told her about. So this might be important—she never had a clue how I feel about GFM, or knew that it was difficult for me to ask my friends. No reason to tell her that and make her feel bad. Either donate happily without complaint, or don’t.\n\nFast forward to the conversation. We were talking on the phone about a week ago and she told me she’s been having a really hard time. Our whole family is sad right now because my other sister’s husband, our brother-in-law, an amazing, wonderful person, died unexpectedly three months ago. So we’re all grieving for him and for my other sister. Our dad died last December too and even though (or because) I wasn’t close to him, it’s been hard, and I’m sure to differing degrees that was hard on Susan, too. But the bottom line is Susan has been really sad and emotional. The reasons behind why she wanted to adopt and why she ultimately decided not to after all are related to trauma from her past that she’s still working through. There is a lot more to this but the bottom line is she’s having a hard time, and we talked about all of this for maybe over an hour. \n\nAs we were getting off the phone, I said “This is obviously not the most important thing about this situation, but can I ask what you’re doing to the GFM?” It’s in quotes because I worded it very carefully in my head first because I didn’t want her to feel I was discounting all the emotional things she's going through. She said that Lisa was the one who set it up and they were just going to shut it down and donate the money raised to the same adoption agency for the same child, but for the next person in line who wanted to adopt him. \n\nI suggested that they do a final post explaining briefly that the adoption wasn’t going to happen and what was going to happen to the money, so people would know. I told her I did not want my own money back at all, but that it would be nice to offer people their money back if that’s what they preferred, since although it was going to almost the same thing, it’s not exactly the same thing. Susan really didn’t seem to understand this and said that there was no way to make everyone happy. That even if they did make a final post explaining what they were doing, 50% of the people would still be unhappy. I said that might be true, but it doesn’t mean it’s not a good thing to do. I said that it’s nice when people donate money to let them know what happened to it, especially if what they initially donated for—in this case Susan adopting a child—doesn’t happen. \n\nSusan said she didn't think this way. That when she donates to a cause, she knows she's \"pure of heart\" and she has good karma and she doesn't worry about what ends up happening to the money. I said that's not how I approach donating at all. That when I donate to a cause, I'm \"pure of heart,\" too, but that I expect the money to go to what I was donating to and if it doesn't, I think that's fraud. Obviously she and I are on very different spectrums when it comes to charity, and maybe just in our approach to life? I don't know, maybe this is why I'm not understanding why she's so upset.\n\nI said that for instance what about the GFM that Lisa started for the oral surgery over a year ago? The last I heard, as of a couple of months ago when I last asked Susan, Lisa hadn’t had the surgery, and I hadn’t heard any updates. My sister said Lisa had just had the surgery yesterday. I am wondering if this is what upset my sister, that I was asking about that. But all I was saying was that people like updates and to know how the money was used. So she said she was going to check with Lisa and see if there was a way to return people’s money for the adoption GFM and I told her there was no rush. I told her again I did not want my money back, but I wanted to offer my friends their money back in case that’s what they wanted. \n\nSusan did not seem to understand AT ALL why I was so concerned about my friends. But I felt responsible. Susan said “But all you did was send them a link to tell them this was available to donate to if they wanted to.” I said no, that’s not the way it is at all. They could give their money to a million causes. They only donated to this one because I’m their friend and they care about me, and by virtue of that they care about her. So I felt responsible. She did not get that, not a bit.\n\nSo 5 minutes after we get off the phone, I realize none of this is necessary. I call her back and tell her I want to do the donation to the charity, so I will pay my friends back, explain the adoption isn’t going through and so we wanted to return the money. But it will be out of my pocket because I am totally happy to donate to this cause. But my sister doesn’t want to do that. She says she wants to talk to Lisa. Maybe 15 minutes later she texts me and says she’s sending me the money and a few minutes later I have the full amount in my account—the money I donated (even though I said I didn’t want it back) and the money my friends donated. I emailed her that I got the money but I don’t know why she returned my donation , too, when I told her not to. I also didn’t tell her to return my friends’ money—I just wanted to offer it back to them and let them have a say. They probably would have said not to worry about it. \n\nSo I feel like by handling it all this way she twisted what I asked for. I didn’t ask for my money back. I didn’t even ask for my friends’ money back. Just to offer to give it back if they wanted it. Why was that so bad? Why is it so hard to do a final post telling everyone who was kind and generous enough to donate what happened to their money? \n\nI told her about the site Go Fraud Me and how people use GFM to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars by doing things like lying and saying they have cancer. Not that she’s doing that! Of course not. Just that it makes people cynical. I said in the email that it’s my own personal conviction that when you accept money from people for a charitable cause, you have to be a good steward of those people’s money. I said it that way so she wouldn’t feel I was judging her. It’s MY personal conviction.\n\nBut still I felt really bad because I know she’s going through an emotional time, and so I dropped off a really beautiful bouquet of flowers for her later that day. She wasn’t home so I left them on her porch and texted her letting her know I left her something. The flowers were meaningful because she told me during the conversation about how this summer she made everyone a bouquet of flowers from her garden and not one for herself, and this is related to how she never takes care of herself. So I got her fresh flowers. About four hours later she hadn’t responded so I texted and asked if she got the flowers. A couple hours later she responded very coldly. “Yes. Thank you. I don’t want to talk and want to be alone.” So I’ve left her alone but I feel her cold treatment of me is really unfair.\n\nAll I did was say that people who give you money o",

Last night I found out that she slept with this guy again last week. Luckily I havent slept with her since they hooked up. Well I was alittle drunk when I found out and started a argument with her. And basically told her either she was lying about him having herpes because they were arguing. Or she stupid enough to actually fuck a guy with herpes? She said she takes precautions for her health and I say that's not good enough. I already decided I'm not going to fuck her anymore, and best part is I didnt even have to tell her she decided to break off sexual relations with me (apparently I dont trust her).

Plus its nice to always come home to a pristine home.\n\nThe cleaner we usually use died, she was an elderly woman who we both had established trust with, but I still set up some nanny cams throughout the house just in case. You can never really know someone, and my wife has several thousand dollars worth of jewelry and I myself have several designer watches and glasses.\n\nBut even if we didnt have valuables i would want the security of a nanny cam.\n\nWith the death of our previous cleaner, we used a third party service that gave us a younger woman. She had a clean background according to said agency.\n\nHowever, I didnt want to keep it a secret that we video the cleaners anymore. Even if we did catch her stealing in the act, I really wouldnt want the drama of calling the police and finding a new cleaner. I told her outright, we videotape everything while youre here. This was meant as a deterence factor. \n\nThe girl meekly acknowledged and agreed and everything was normal. Until later, my wife told me I was rude to tell her that. That I shouldve just video taped her discretely and let the chips fall where they may if something does happen.\n\nI dont think i was rude, but what do you think? AITA?",

      "description": "So. This might get a tad long. I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI got married 3 years ago. I live in the same town as my parents with my wife and daughter with a son joining us soon. I met my wife at college and she moved here with me as we both had excellent job offers in town. \n\nMy wife and my parents don't like each other. My father is a demanding man with what I believe to my Narcisisitic personality traits. My wife is a very independent aint-take-no-crap-from-nobody kind of person. Its not been fun, let me tell you. My mom just hates anything that causes issues with my father. \n\nSo. Low to mid grade discontement on that front most of the time. Recently, we decided to take a three day trip to see two national parks before the new baby arrives. Somehow, pure stupidity I guess, me and my wife had a conversation about who should watch our daughter she had come away thinking we were asking her sister to come down, and I came away thinking we were asking my sister and mother (my Dad is out with work right now). So both parties get asked. A month goes by and the date approaches. The issue comes to our attention. \n\nMy wife has asked my sister-in-law and she has taken time off work and planned travel to come and watch our daughter. My mom and sister are hugely, greatly, to my eyes unreasonably upset about this. My mother doesnt work and my sister is going to college nearby. I make the decision that its too late to call off the sister-in-law plan. So I tell this to my family and they explode. I mean. Three days of phone calls and yelling. My mother won't speak to me. Says I prefer my wifes family to my own. My Dad sent me a text today that says \"Your daughters grandparents lose out to an aunt.\" As if there were some sort of relational hierarchy. I also told them that I think it would be easiest to let my daughter stay the night another weekend and just let my SIL take her this weekend. So not just \"no\" (they were very excited that this was the first time my daughter was to spend the night with them), I did offer a solution as well.\n\nThis is all compounded by my family feeling like we tend to favor her family, which I believe is because we kind of do because we don't fight with them. \n\nAITA? \n\nTL;DR\n\nAccidentally double booked both my Sister in law and mother and sister to watch my daughter for a weekend. Family flips out like I've betrayed them because I decided since my SIL took time off work, she should get to watch my daughter for the weekend, and my family for another weekend. AITA? ",

      "description": "Typing this in my phone so excuse the grammar and syntax. So last Wednesday, I was at dominoes on my phone whilst waiting for my order. A big guy who was twice my size (I am 16) busts into the restaurant asking for my phone, saying his gf was currently being raped. Who quickly tells me his life story, something like he went to prison at the age of 18 and his mum got raped by her uncle.\nHe dumps an iPhone 5, an iPhone 6 and a dumb phone on the table claiming he has no credit. In my mind I thought this was a mugging as how could someone possibly have the money to get 2 iPhones ( I also thought those phones were attained through previous muggings) not have credit on his SIM? Wouldn't it be easier to put on credit if it was that urgent?  What made me say no was the fact that he reeked of cigarettes, was bigger than me, and had a deep hoarse voice which was being used in its upmost volume. He also was definitely faster than me, as a general rule I don't give valuables to strangers who I think can outrun me. \n\nAfter my denial, he said \" I understand your concerned for your safety, but you're also an ignorant pussy\" and continues slagging me off for 5 minutes. He then proceeds to threaten me by punching me in the face. One of the lines I recall and will deeply reside in my mind is \"I TELL YOU MY GIRLFRIEND IS BEING RAPED AND YOU DONT HELP ME!\" which looking back now, I should've. He then says if I don't leave the restaurant he'll punch me, so I left. I walk around the restaurant to make sure he doesn't hurt the cashier, (I was the only one there). After a while the cashier gives him a phone and I hear yelling . Strange thing was he didn't call the police.\n\nHe stated that I shouldn't be around him, whilst he was having a fag near the entrance, I ask if I am now allowed inside to collect my order, to which he says yes after asking multiple times.\nWhilst I collect my order I am told he lived upstairs.\n\nI think I'm an arsehole. I think what I should have done was hold his phones for ransom whilst he uses mine. I was stressed, and put under pressure. In my only defense, I thought it was a  mugging, I don't ever trust strangers and he did come across as really dodgy.

We are both 40 years old now and have had sex less than 5 times. We are great companions and are very much in love and do enjoy passionate times, but it rarely leads to actually crossing home plate. By that, I mean we do everything but have actual sex. \n\nNow she wants me to move in with her where I already know I will be extremely sexually frustrated. \n\nThe only reason I’ve stayed with her this long is the “everything but actual sex,” is actually really good and enjoyable and is very regular, consistent and so frequent that sometimes I’m not into it but she still insists and gets me off. \n\nNow, I’ve been looking at where my life is and I realize I’ve made a lot of mistakes. She has not. She’s got an amazing job and makes oodles of cash. \n\nWIBTA if I stayed with her because financially she helps me achieve a lifestyle I would never be able to achieve on my own even though I’m not happy about the sex?

When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

No matter how late, he'll wait. Now, what he buys isn't a regular ice cream, I'm talking full on tubs of that special \"Oreo Belgium triple chocolate caramel swirl\" Kinda stuff. \n\n Now for someone with an unnatural love for dairy, a massive sweet tooth, and no way to get to a store in my day to day life, this sucks. \n\n I mentioned it one day to him and he yelled at me and used excuses about how it's his money and he works 9 hours a day so he deserves it. \n\n My mum was persuasive enough to let my dad give me 1/3 a tub yesterday, and it was nice as heck. I went back down today to hopefully get some more, and he stopped me by saying that \"I've had my third, have something else\" \n\n Me and him are the ONLY two people that like ice cream in this house\n\n So he's gone and taken 2/3 for himself. \n\n This wouldn't be a problem or anything but he makes me feel crap whenever I even mention the words \"ice cream\" anymore. \nLike he goes on this talk about his life and how I don't deserve it. \n Should I stop bugging him about it? I feel it'll be best considering I'm quite obviously annoying him too much about it. ",

      "description": "I've been working at a new job for about four months, during my first month in training I had a side by side with a guy, \"Greg.\" Now Greg was showing me the ropes and we got into talking and it seemed we had a lot in common and that was great, to me (24f) it's always nice to meet people who share common interests. Our \"side by side\" last two hours\" and nearing the end of the time I realized he might be hitting on me a bit with the laughing, general comments, and him trying to get me to join a singles group in our area, so I dropped a comment as casually as I could about moving here and getting a place with my boyfriend, to avoid embarrassment on both parts. After my session few other of us new hires were making our way to lunch and I got some jabs about him flirting with me, and I laughed them off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to now. I've been working for two and some change on the \"floor\" (after training class) and Greg has been staring at me at any chance. It was clear when I first moved up to the floor that he had a crush. He'd walk passed my cube and stare. However, surprisingly he hadn't said anything to me, no \"hi\" or whatever. I wouldn't be hurt by him not talking to me, but i found it odd him staring at me and brushed it off at first as maybe a crush, a few weeks later, I mentioned something to my cube mate, and he mentioned that he'd noticed Greg staring at me. It's been two months of him staring at me and at points changing his route to the bathroom to come check me out at my desk. I feel very uncomfortable and Stressed. I know looking at someone isn't really a big deal, nor having a crush, but it's been a while and other's are beginning to notice and joke or share concern. \n\nWould I be an asshole to tell my supervisor I'm uncomfortable? I just don't like being ogled at work. FYI I don't wear flashy or revealing clothes, and don't think it'd be some \"attention grab\" that would give reason for him looking at me (not that an excuse). Also I noticed him a few times showing up in front of a coffee shop I frequent on my days off walking past back and forth.... I just feel rather uneasy. ",

      "description": "So my roommate has been dating this girl for around a year now. She had to go study abroad for 6 months. That put a huge strain on their relationship. They broke up 2x while she was abroad. He tells me all his relationship problems. When they first broke up in the summer, he called me. He was very distressed and upset. I did my best to comfort him telling him that their dynamic wasn't the best and that they fought constantly and that it was no big deal. Sometimes it just doesn't work out. He ended up getting back with her less than 2 weeks later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis girlfriend is shy so she has trouble making friends. She was lonely when she was studying abroad. My roommate tried to fill the void but it wasn't enough for her. On many occasions, she has said hurtful things to him on why they should break up. Things like \"Give me reasons why we should stay together\" or \"You may think we have good conversations but i don't\". Everytime she comes over to see him, she ends up just watching youtube videos or they end up spooning for 2 hours. Ive heard their conversations and there are many awkward silences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has dumped him 8 times. Every time it is because something upset her and he did not respond appropriately. She then dumps him and blocks him on FB. A week or two goes by and then she realizes that shes lonely and misses him. He always welcomes her back with open arms. Its gotten so bad that I can predict correctly within 3 days the next time they break up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey share the same major but next year, she will be working across the country. His field of study is not very diverse so a part of me believes that he thinks once hes in the work force, he won't find anyone else. I always ask him what he likes about her and all he can say is shes a nice person and he thinks they have good conversations. He is so desperate to stay with his girlfriend that hes whipped. Most of our mutual friends also believe that his relationship is not healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my girlfriend and she said that its his life and who am i to tell him anything about his relationship. I asked him what he is going to change so that it will work. He tells me that every time they get mad at each other, instead of breaking up, they're just going to wait a couple days and then get back together. After pushing him for more, he gets mad at me. I also got mad and told him that from now on I won't ever talk with him about his relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that its quite literally none of my business but I tried my best to look out for him. I tried convincing him to see my and all our friends point of view by saying harsh things about his relationship. Is what I did wrong? Telling him that his relationship is not healthy and it won't end well? According to my own girlfriend it is. What do you guys think? AITA??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- Roommate has rocky relationship with his girlfriend. I said harsh things about his relationship to try and get him to see my point of view.",

We've been a friend group for about 4 years, and that's how long I've known Lyra.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met Lyra IRL in January, and that's when I learned some stuff that I hadn't known about her before: she's white (she used a black girl's pictures), she's 15 (she said she was 21), and the details of her personal life were just really different from what she had said before. So...I met her irl thinking she was 21. I didn't know she wasn't a 21 year old black girl until she and her parents picked me up from the airport. (I just didn't say anything until we were alone \"I thought you were black\" and that's when she told me she was 15.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLyra and I kind of had silly crushes on each other and had done some light flirting in texts before...she revealed her true identity lol. She wanted (and wants) to continue this flirtation and even date. I never really told her no because I've been so conflicted and I really value her friendship. Well...I actually DID say no at first, but then I felt like a major asshole because she said her age would only matter if I were in the relationship for sex, which I wasn't, and I'd like to clarify I only held her hand and hugged her a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I know the situation is messed up. I want to remain friends without...I don't know, hurting her. We're best friends and I really love her. But there's another aspect to the situation which is that none of our other friends know her true age, and I've been informed that they could get into legal trouble. Lyra doesn't shy away from anime smut and fanfic and has written, drawn, and roleplayed adult scenarios with a couple of our other friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone I've talked to so far seems to think I AM an asshole, but so far I don't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: my best friend turned out to be a 15 year old but I want to remain friends and not tell our other friends the nature of her deceit.",

      "description": "A bit of context: I'm currently a college undergraduate, majoring in history. I'm also the daughter of two academics. My boyfriend of about 5 months graduated last May with his BA in history. He's currently working a sales job that he mostly likes, but doesn't love.\n\nThat out of the way, here's the situation. Boyfriend loves history, and intends to go to grad school soon with the intention of getting a PhD in history and becoming a professor. Thing is, the job situation for history professors is [atrociously terrible](http://www.megankatenelson.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/AHA-Today-November-16-2017-1.png). I know everyone in the humanities (or the arts, for that matter) thinks they can beat the odds, but I don't think he understands how bad the odds are. I also think he doesn't understand what grad school is actually like, and he's expressed a very rose-tinted view of being a professor (he called it \"a six-figure job where you get summers off\", which is inconsistent both with actual salary data and with my personal experience).  This is something he's really passionate about, but I think he's setting himself up for a lot disappointment and heartbreak.\n\nI know that, as his girlfriend, I should be supportive. We aren't financially tied, so it doesn't hurt me financially if he goes into debt. Even though I love him a lot, I know that realistically its unlikely we'll be together by the time he finishes he finishes his degree (things change, people move, etc). I just see what dismal prospects lie down this path, and I don't want that for him.\n\nThere's also the issue that as a history major myself, I also wanted to be a professor before my parents convinced me against it and diverted me to a (hopefully) more realistic career path. It's not something I want anymore, other than in the sense of, \"in a perfect world...\", but I feel like if the topic comes up I have to lie and say that I was never interested in to job, or I have to a hypocrite and say that I want something for him that I don't think is a good idea for me. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I expressed my concerns for him, or should I just keep my mouth shut?",

      "description": "Hi\n\n\n\nThis is going to be long and I'm sorry if there's mistakes and if it too difficult to understand.\n\nI never have a great relationship with my father. He is...a man who has a title of Father to me. Did I loved him? I did...I don't recall calling him daddy ever since i knew the truth. I think it's disrespectful not to, but i couldn't bring myself to call him that ever again.\n\nHe is a liar, cheater, heavy smoker, gambler and quite an alcoholic. I think he is abusive... but I can't understand it...not violence... he did slapped my mom once and treats us like grass.\n\nI don't love or hate him. I don't want to hate him. If I do, I just keep suffering. I could still imagine myself having a cup of tea with him.\n\nI think I am a bad person. Too cold and heartless.\n\nI couldn't look at him without 'it' being calm. I avoid talking to him as much as I could, I avoid his family as much as I could. Sometimes, I want to torture them and kill them, but that's not me. I have mental illness. It corrupts me, though I try to keep hold of it. I just want to get out of here.\n\nI remembered texting him long ago, writing a lot of swear words. I hate you. \n\nYet I forgave you. I forgave someone who force mother to have abortions, someone who doesn't even want me from the start, someone who wanted to give me away and ruined our lifes and still hurt us.\n\nI feel...like i'm the bad one here. He took all my money that i was saving for school and a house ever since I was 11, maybe it's ok, right? He's my father...Mom asked him to pay for college or university if I ever able to get into one, he said no. ha..it's reasonable...?... But if it's his other daughter, why is he so willingly...to do anything for her? How different am I to her? Is it because I demand too much? Or is it he doesn't love me because i'm...a child from someone else...which was supposedly dead or is it because i'm not a boy?\n\nI have a list. I wrote what I want from him.\n\nA table and a chair. Piano class and art class, tutor , school , cheap drawing tablet, etc. Also have treatment about my mental illness, I don't want to do anything bad...again.\n\nHe earns 10k a month, but he refuse to pay treatment and always drag things so long. It been 7 years, in those 7 years, I should be in school and learn something. Honestly, it was my fault too. If I had just try to search for a school myself when I was 11, maybe I couldn't end up like this. Even so, I wonder will he pay for it? Last time I asked....he lied to me and i never end up going to a school for another year.\n\nI feel like i'm demanding him so much. But people are telling me they, his family, took more than we did. But still, aren't i too much? \n\nI just want to get a stable life and able to go school. Get a job and leave this place with my mom. I thought of bringing him along, but it will upsets mom. He might try to get me into something too...like mom said he did it to her. Get something from me.\n\nI thought of giving him money each month when I get a job. After all...he's my father and i'm grateful...he even give us money. It may be hundreds of dollar like 200 and expect us to live on that for the whole month, but it's still better than nothing.\n\nMom wants revenge. BY selling the house and leaving him. I...pity him, maybe I feel sad for him. I feel bad for turning a blind eye... mom said to not worry since he have 3 kids. But for someone like him, wasting all money on gamble and have little savings...I wonder if he is going to suffer. If he is...I feel bad. BUt there seems to be no way of settling these... he'll never listen and won't quit gamble if i recommend him to do so.\n\nAM I an A-H for wanting things and him paying for all of it and still leave him?\n\nAlso if you read all these, wow...I...thank you. I hope...it's not stupid. I'm nervous, very nervous while writing this. I think by doing this, i may get some advices from people.",

      "description": "AITA for wanting to fire my sous chef who is dying due to diabetes and intense hardheadedness? \n\n(Sorry this is long, got to get it off my chest.  TL;DR at end.)\n\nI’m a chef, I hired this guy as my sous almost two years ago.  He has diabetes.  He’s always sick, especially when it’s really inconvenient, like when I am out of town or when we have really busy weeks with lots of banquets or offsite events.  I brought it up to him in the past, if he thought stress exacerbated it, because whenever we were really busy and I needed his help, boom! in the hospital.\n\nEventually, I had to take him off of salary bc he was missing too much work and I told him, you know I don’t wanna fire you, I understand you don’t have control over this, blah blah blah, but I’m not paying you a salary when I can’t depend on you.  So I put him on an hourly wage instead and I promoted one of my other cooks as a sort of junior sous chef so I had a fall back for 1st sous chefs eventual sick days and to ease the stress on 1st sous so he wasn’t pushing himself so hard.\n\nHe’s got this stomach thing where it goes into paralysis and won’t digest the food sitting in this stomach and then when it starts pumping (?) again and drops all of the old food into his gut he gets really ill.  Apparently this happens with diabetes?  I have also, more than once, found him passed out on the floor of the employee room when he’s gone up for a shot.  When he gets sick and goes home I won’t hear from him for days and have to contact his sons to see if he’s dead.  I ask him about it after and he says he just comes to after days and has to look at a calendar to see how long he missed. \n\n1st sous chef has had this illness for 20 years.  He refuses to go to the doctor for regular treatment or even when he’s ill.  When I say “in the hospital” it’s because he gets so fucking sick that his kids call 911 (they’re all grown adults BTW).  He does take insulin, but that’s as far as any self treatment goes.  He smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish.  I know lots of other people with diabetes, my aunt for example has never ever had to go to the doctor for complications due to diabetes, neither did my friend in high school (and he was 17 and an idiot), and neither does my CURRENT prep cook, who ALSO has diabetes.  Because they take care of themselves! My prep cook brings himself little sugar free cookies and bananas to work with him and eats these cactus tortillas bc they have less sugar than corn. So it’s increasingly frustrating to deal with his constant sickness, not because of the inconvenience to me and the business, I solved that with 2nd sous chef, but because we’re all watching this dude kill himself in front of us and he’s the most stubborn mother fucker in the world and it’s breaking my heart.\n\nOk, so last Friday I’m up in my office doing some paperwork and go into the kitchen to check on things and 1st sous is gone, 2nd sous says he got really sick and left an hour earlier.  No big deal, we’re extra staffed with a new guy training so I’m not worried about it and leave at my normal time.  Saturday 1st sous is a no show, I text and call, but as usual hear nothing.  2nd Sous coincidentally lives with 1st, so I ask him if he’s okay and he says he hasn’t talked to him that he was asleep when he got home the night before and was still sleeping when he left for work in the morning.  My days off are Sun. and Mon. and 2nd sous is going out of town to visit his fam for Thanksgiving, so I assume I’m going to be working on both of my days off to cover for 1st sous.  C’est le vie, they’re super slow days so boring, but no biggie.\n\nTuesday comes and 1st sous comes in to talk to me.  We go outside and he tells me he found a diabetic ulcer on his foot and that it started to “stink” on Sunday.  He refuses to go the doctor bc he knows they’re going to tell him to amputate.  His plan is to cut off the dead tissue himself, apparently he’s done this before (…) and his friend gave him some weird oil shit that’s supposed to kill the infection before it can get into his blood stream (I forgot to mention, he says he is allergic to all antibiotics) I try and talk him out of it and tell him prosthesis have improved, he’ll be able to do everything he can now, no one will even be able to tell, but he won’t even consider it because HE WON’T STOP DRINKING AND SMOKING.  Like it’s his fucking life blood, I was like, what?!  You won’t stop smoking to have more time with your kids?   And he shrugged and said he’s raised 5 good men and they don’t need him.  Basically he wants me to give him two weeks to “get back to normal.”  In my opinion, he is not going to get back to normal.  He is going to ignore this until he gets blood poisoning and dies.  I told him that I think he shouldn’t waste what time he has left working and that he should spend it with his kids and he said, yeah maybe.\n\nThis situation has been really stressful in a lot of ways, I really care about him and I obviously don’t want him to fucking die and he was crying telling me and I was crying and it was all very awful.  After our talk he went back inside and drank a whiskey while I input invoices, so what can ya do, he’s not going to change for anything including his own life.\n\nThe owner of my place told me that I can’t fire him over this.  I said I’m not going to watch him commit suicide in front of me and that’s not fucking fair to the staff and that it’s not doing him any favors allowing him to continue working.  Every step he takes will be pushing the infection into his bloodstream (I’m not a doctor, but I believe you’re supposed to “off weight”?) It might seem callous, but I really don’t want to let him back.  I honestly think it would be better to fire him because if he was unemployed he could get Medicaid, maybe hospice care, maybe die with some dignity instead of fainting in the bathroom at the bar after a long shift without eating.  Even in the event that he pulls off some sort of miraculous hobo surgery on himself and gets all the necrotic tissue out, how long until it happens again?  His kids are all moving away, 2nd sous is moving out of their house, who’s going to call 911 next time? I worried I'm being selfish.  One of my cooks pointed out that maybe he really really loves cooking and wants to die doing it.  Ummm, I love cooking too, but I certainly would not be working myself into a grave were I in this situation, I love other things more. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTL;DR Sous chef is dying from complications from diabetes, refuses medical help, is literally going to cut away parts of his own foot, and wants me to hold his job for him until he recovers.  I think firing him is for his own good, the owner says I shouldn’t, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "For those of you who live in aus, you’re probably familiar with the Coles “Stikeez” promotion. For those not, there are 25 collectibles, small plastic toys that look like little broccolis with names and faces etc. \n\nhttps://www.practicalparenting.com.au/media/11988/130219stikeez-lansscape.jpg?width=620\n\n^ for context. \n\nAt work, we do our weekly Milk order through Coles. Each $30 spent, entitles you to a Stikeez character. \n\nIt’s my responsibility to place the order, and when asked if I wanted Stikeez included, I clicked no. \n\nThis is the 3rd promotion of this sort Coles have run in the last 6 or so months, of pointless plastic, with no proper intention other than to get more shoppers through their doors. \n\nPersonally I’m trying to be more environmentally conscious, I’m in my min 20’s, and the future of environment feels like my responsibility, and my choice to make more pro-active decisions where I can. \n\nI could not, with sound conscience, say yes to having this pointless shit sent with our order. \n\n2 colleagues have since found out that I declined them and cracked the shits at me for doing so. \n\nI would agree it’s not my decision to speak for the office as to whether we get them or not, but office workers aren’t really entitled to them because they come with our work order. Go and spend your own money at Coles if you want to collect pointless landfill I reckon. \n\nAnyway, am I the asshole here for saying no, with our environment in mind. Or should I have said yes, since my colleagues collect and it’s not really my decision. \n\nThanks lol",

      "description": "We used to have unlimited WiFi, but 2/4 roommates don’t use it as much as myself and the other roommate, so they wanted to lower our plan to save money. I was fine with this and didn’t think it would be a problem. However, we went over our limit and got charged a late fee, and they got mad at me and other roommate for making us go over. Roommate and I wanted to go back to unlimited(lol) to avoid late fee and everyone just pays $6 extra per month. Obviously the two who don’t stream as much (and said they use their unlimited phone data plans for WiFi instead of House WiFi). I get upset and start thinking about how one roommate takes the longest showers/baths yet I don’t complain about the water bill(until now cuz I’m upset). Basically I need internet strangers to let me know if this is a battle worth picking. Is it best to just split the WiFi between myself and the other roommate who uses it more, or is WiFi something we all should split evenly? am I in the wrong for asking them to help pay for a service they don’t use as much. I guess a non related but upsetting thought I can’t get out of my head is that this one roommate who wants to lower the usage, literally bought a $400 full length ballgown on eBay, with having no event to wear to, because it was so pretty. I guess my thought process is hindered by this waste of money, yet $6 a month is too much for unlimited WiFi. But I’m probably just salty. Set me straight Reddit! I need perspective before I wrongly blow up. If anything I could just pay for WiFi myself with my own password... help provide clarity please! ",

      "description": "We're all in high school (16-17)\n\nSo basically my friend (lets call him T) has had a (kinda dysfunctional imo) relationship with his girlfriend (lets call her M) for around 2 years. Im not really good friends with her but we get along.\n\nRecently T has been talking to a different girl (A)  since he is no longer interested in staying with M. For the most part M is cool but she can get really dramatic and aggressive over the smallest things, and my friend has lost all romantic feelings for her. T has told me that he's only with her at this point for the sex.\n\nNow he's been getting serious with A (going to her house, kissing, I don't think they've fucked tho) but he still hasn't broken up with M. I've been clear with him that at this point its hardcore cheating and he should just end things with M to avoid any serious repercussions. He says that he'll do it but he has pussied out many times.\n\nJust now M texted me and asked me to keep something between us. I think it would have been better if I stayed out of it completely but stupidly I said yes. She then told me about how she thinks he's cheating on her because she saw some messages on his phone coming from A. I played dumb and said she was overthinking things, and that A was just a friend.\n\nShe explicitly told me not to share any of it with T, but honestly he's my one of my best friends. I may not agree with his decisions but I'll back him up no matter what. The way I see it, my loyalty ultimately lies with him and not M. So of course I sent him screenshots of the convo to basically say \"hey, she knows. Time to end it man.\"\n\nWell he ended up calling her, and he mentioned some things that were in the screenshots that I sent, so she figured out that I ended up telling him. She confronted me about it but I denied everything and left it at that.\n\nSo in conclusion, was I wrong to lie to her and break her trust? She must feel like shit after what I did, and I don't blame her. Was there a better way to cover for T?",

The band director, who is a second year teacher, said I think we (him and I) should get the staff members gifts as a Thank Yous!! Great idea... but I have a few problems.   \n\n\nOne, I was told at the beginning of the season from the school admin I was going to get paid 4k. However, like the little bambi I was (probably am), I didn't ask for this in writing. So I was recently called into the office so they could tell me, just kidding, here's 2k. Meanwhile, the director makes 14k for essential the same job responsibilities because we are both young and trying to figure things out. Two, while I cannot confirm I believe the staff makes about the same as me (2k) despite having less responsibilities. Three, there are five of them and two of us. Therefore to get them each something of value we will likely have to pay a pretty penny. Four, I have a buttload of student debt. Yes, that my bad and I know that is a personal problem but I am trying to remedy that with the next point. Five, I am on the path to FIRE, which means I save every penny outside of rent and home-cooked, coupon-clipped food. Thus paying $50 (which I think might be optimistically low) is absolutely heart-wrenching to me. To be honest, I don't think I have even spent that much on my boyfriend of three years (no worries, he hasn't on me either, we like it like that). Six, a first year teaching salary is okay, but nothing too fancy.   \n\n\nWIBTA if I said no?",

      "description": "A little backstory, I'm a senior in High School and currently working between 25-30 hours every week to pay for a college education and to have money on the side. My family is far from lower class but my parents have repeatedly threatened to not pay for my college education as soon as I do something they don't agree with. Just to give you some examples, so you don't think I'm a snot nosed brat whining about how my mommy won't let me play video games 24/7, the things I did which pissed them off include: coming out as gay, having left leaning views, and hanging out with \\*gasp\\* people who aren't white. I solved this problem by getting a job and having a reliable back-up plan if they ever decide to totally cut me off. I work in fast food and as much stigma as the job gets for being a \"dumb persons job\" it really is a lot of work and moving around especially if you work 6,7,or 8+ hours at a time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I'm constantly getting shit from my family for not being home as much, grades dropping from 95's to 89's and 90's (ikr), etc. Today, I do so much as open my mouth about how tired I am. I immediately hear from my sister \"well your the one who chose to get a job\". Um excuse me, wtf? I point out that regardless of whether I chose to get a job or not, work is still work and definitely not fun and that I don't appreciate being put down for choosing to be slightly more independent. She responds with \"I'm not putting you down, just reminding you that you chose to get this job that you don't need so you can't complain.\" This spiraled into a 30 minute argument over whether or not she was putting me down/if I have the right to complain. Honestly, I wouldn't even be asking this subreddit or questioning being right here if my ENTIRE family hadn't agreed with my sister. So, AITA?",

We ended on good terms and are now very close friends.\n\n I was spending the night at her house and we were sleeping in their game room with her brother as usual. She was asleep on the other couch and me and her brother were on the couch together. He’s tried to do things with me before when I was drunk or high, but this time I was sober. He kept getting closer to me and eventually started touching my boobs and under my underwear. He kept doing this for a while and eventually turned my face towards his and kissed me. I kissed back and let this continue for about 5 minutes before i looked at my friend on the other couch and realized what I’d done. I told her brother I had to pee and ran off to the bathroom and then upstairs.\n\n I feel terrible about what I did and I just need to know if it’s as bad as I think it is, not that bad, or worse.\n",

A few weeks ago I had the realization that I am gay and I've been stressing immensely recently because I know I can't be in this relationship as a romantic partner. I don't know how I would do it, and I don't even know if I should. I'm scared of losing her as a friend and I don't know if I can go through with breaking up with her. We have mutual friends and I don't want them to turn away from either of us, because over the past year we've all built a great support system and I don't want to ruin that. I'm so scared that coming out would just cause more pain than happiness at this point, and that it'd just be greedy. Am I wrong for thinking the way that I am? Is it wrong to potentially ruin multiple great friendships just for myself? Would I be the asshole if I came out to my girlfriend, and potentially ruined her time at college?",

      "description": "Full story: Went on a weekend getaway trip Denver with friends and friends of friends. A few of the people were local while others (like me) were flying in from New York. Two friends of friends flew in before me and rented a car so they could go to the hotel first. I was picked up by my local friends and we had a great weekend in the city. On the day of departure, my local friends recommended I just ride with Jane and Kevin (the two aforementioned friends of friends) since they were on the way to the airport too. I agreed since it made sense for my local friends to go directly home and not waste time dropping me off if Jane and Kevin were going to the airport already. \nA few days later, I Venmo requested Jane and Kevin -and everyone else on the trip- food charges that we had eaten and split among the group. Kevin declined my request without any communication and sent back a request for gas. Now at this point I was a little confused since I had spoken to Jane (the one who had rented the car) and she had said gas wasn't an issue. The tank was only half empty when it was filled so with gas prices being around 3.50, I figured 20 bucks was the max that gas could cost - split among 3 would make it a little over 6 dollars. After declining my charge for food which was about 6 bucks, Kevin charged me an additional money for gas. I immediately declined the charge. Now several individuals who have been roped into this debacle are asking why I declined. Am I the asshole here? Is he? Both? Or is it just some miscommunication?",

      "description": "My husband use to work at a company where he would finish work at 2:30 (instead of 5pm) on Fridays. He’s since left that job, but part of his agreement at his new position is that he is allowed to leave work early one day of the week (Wednesday) to pick his 12 year old daughter (from a previous relationship) up at school. \n\nOn Wednesday’s, he usually gets home around 3:45 instead of 5:30. He then usually makes supper and gives my SD a ride home between 7&amp;8pm so that she can have a consistent morning schedule. \n\nWe have 3 other children (3 months, 4 and 7). Our two older kids take gymnastics and for the first time, their gymnastics lesson has landed on the same night as we have my SD. The 4 year old from 5-6, and the 7 year old from 6-7.\n\nI think it’s great that the nights aligned because instead of me having to make supper and take all 3 of our kids to the 5pm lesson, I can start supper then take the baby and our 4 year old, and my husband finish supper then bring the 7 year old and his 12 year old to the later lesson (gymnastics is in the same city as his ex, so he drops off the 12 year old before or afterwards). \n\nMy husband thinks he should change which day he leaves work early because he feels that it’s not fair to the 12 year old. I know it’s not ideal, but I don’t feel it’s a huge burden for the 12 year old and IMO the fact that he gets to leave work early should also be used to contribute to the rest of the family’s activities as well. \n\nIf it was the only time we spent with his daughter I would understand where he’s coming from but she’s with us the majority if of every weekend so there is lots of opportunity! \n\nAITA for asking him to use that time for the rest of our family as well? Or should I respect that he want to change the day he leaves early so that he can protect the time for his 12 year old?",

      "description": "Okay well I posted casually in another AITA post and I actually got some good feedback on a minor disagreement with my gf. So I figured id ask about a situation that happened last year thats been bothering me.\n\nI was taking an art class at my university that allowed us to use whatever medium we wanted to create a work based around a central theme.\n\nI chose the camera and my theme was \"Decay.\" I took pictures of run down buildings, dying plants, and decomposing animals to show how \"temporary\" even beautiful things are. This took a lot of work and set up.\n\nThe class itself was meant to critque my work. I got good reviews, great even, but the pictures of dead animals and vegetation made my classmate remark \"This seems more like horror porn. Like a morbid curiosity.\"\n\nThis woman was very pretentious and offensive during the class. Her project consisted of clay animations forming from nothing and was sort of a counterpoint to my \"Decay\" work. Just a bunch of stop motion clay forming people and houses.\n\nI told her that her art was lazy and took no risk. It was just a \"stamp\" art project meant for school. Generic and not interesting. I may have been angry at her reaction to my art but it was still the truth. Also when you compare bravery its much more daring to go out into the world and capture it than to sit in a room playing with clay and cameras for a week.\n\nShe complained to the teacher that I was being harrassing and we had to go into mediation with a counselor. It was resolved but who do you guys think was the asshole?",

      "description": "His ex is bff’s with his sisters.  She hates me guts and so my SO’s older sister also hates me.  This is the younger sister’s baby shower and she invited me (for the first time ever since I was “banned” from their events) I think to make peace because my SO was refusing to attend events where I was not invited (but his ex was).\n\nWhile i appreciate the gesture I am getting crazy anxiety over being at a place with two people (ex and older sister) who have spent the last 2 years talking crap about me to anyone who will listen, including my SO.  I’ve been called racist names (“chun li” “fried rice”), called trash, been threatened violence if I come near them, etc etc though things have been quiet since the sisters’ dad died.  Though by the younger sister’s admission “they promised not to hurt me but they might talk” (????).\n\nMy SO’s kids will also be there and I have never been in the same place as their mom and them.  Their mom has made it clear that she hates me to the kids and that she doesn’t want them to like me.  So although the kids and I have a good relationshop I feel bad putting them in a place where they might feel divided in their loyalties and like they have to act a certain way towards me to please their mom.  I am also scared that if the ex sees them interacting with me positively she might make trouble for them or my SO.  \n\nMy SO says I am overthinking and have been promised “safe passage” and that I am being a coward and an asshole for not accepting his younger sister’s peace offering.  I was hoping he could relay the message that I had other obligations (it’s my sister’s birthday) and give her a gift/card from me but he says no.\n\nAITA here?",

I said sure and she asks me about what happened downstair in the living room and that her son was quite upset and asked me if I was just joking or if I was being serious. I said I was being serious because I hadnt seen this movie yet and I wanted to watch it without knowing whats gonna happen. Then she said he is only 9 and he is just gonna spoiler stuff and theres nothing we could do about it. Then I added that I could apologize and she was like yes, please\". I didnt feel like apologizing but since this is not my actual family I did not want to have an argument with them.\n\nMaybe I was too harsh and I just do not see it? \n\nAITA?\n\n(excuse any spelling or grammatical errors, I am not a native speaker)",

      "description": "Okay. I feel pretty petty after this so I've made a new account.\n\nTo start this off, I've wanted a dog for years, as so many kids do. Its always been a solid 'No' from my parents. Then recently it turned into 'Maybe..' and the last few weeks we've been looking at dogs. Now, there have been periods like this before but after research into the dog weve been interested in my mother has usually been put off. For what feels like forever, my father has wanted a Chow Chow. I introduced him to Samoyeds not long ago and hes slowly fallen in love with them. My Mother, surprisingly, has too. I ignored it at first because I assumed theyd just see it as a cute dog.\n\nHowever, recently, theyve been showing me dogs for sale near us. Within a reasonable price range too. I was excited, but didnt show it. I didnt want to get my hopes up. Until my mother allowed me to message one of the breeders.\n\nThey didnt respond. I didnt let it bother me, as by this point, my mother had promised me that when it was suitable, we could get a dog. We messaged another. They requested the money upfront. Another. Another. Another.\n\nFinally.\n\nWe found someone who told us we cod come view the puppies. They werent ready to be taken, and so we did. They were gorgeous. My father, mother and I fell in love with a little boy named Nico.\n\nWe get home, all giddy, fast forward a week. All I can think about is the puppy. I mention it to my mother and she smiles, \"Oh. Didnt I tell you? We're not getting the puppy anymore. I dont have the time.\"\n\nOkay. So. I understand my mother not having the time. Even though she stays home all day. It just annoyed me a little, if she'd told me at the beginning it would've been easier to process, like, we were at the point where my brother had bought dog collars, bowls, excetera. We had doggy-proofed the rooms of the house.\n\nOkay. This is where I feel like a bit of an asshole. I just kinda cried, I may of snapped slightly at my mother, saying she always seems to lead me on with these types of things and tease me and its not fair. Yes I cried. Yes it was petty. She shouted at me for being petty and I just feel stupid for acting so childish. Its not even like I can move out and afford my own dog, I'm 13. I dont know if there was some factor that im completely misreading here but I'd love some input from an adult who could come at it from a more mature outlook. x",

After that she just turned around and basically never talked to me all evening. \n\nMost of the times I don't mind if she asks me to have a look at my phone and read the conversations I have with my friends, she knows I don't like her doing so without my permission, but if she asks it's okay.\n\nHowever, I feel I have the right to just say no, without the need to explain myself, if I don't want her to invade my privacy and snoop around in my private conversations. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I love my fiancé to death, but this has been a constant pout of contention between the two of us for quite some time. She brings up the idea that places are haunted or that astrology has any actual bearing on our actual lives and most of the time I’m willing to just smile and nod and let her go on thinking whatever she wants about that kind of stuff, but it actually makes me really angry when she tries to explain real life circumstances using astrology for example \n\nX can’t get along with Y because he’s a whatever sign and he’s a whatever sign and so that means they are incompatible \n\nI think this is the biggest load of bullshit and extremely counterproductive to people actually understanding each other. Rather than fabricating a reason why they can’t get along why not try to find common ground and common understanding. Wouldn’t that be 10x better than ascribing some special meaning to the way the stars and planets align on any given night? \n\nAnother example of my supposed close mindedness is my refusal to believe in ghosts. I’m an avid horror movie enthusiast and love a good possession story but I know it’s all fake! When you die you get pumped full of chemicals and buried in a guilted box or you get cremated and have your ashes spread and you are gone. That may be an uncomfortable concept to some but gone is gone. My fiancé claims her friend Beverly who passed away when she was young is still around and looking out for her, while I would never ever ever attack this belief as she is and always has been very sensitive about the matter but she believes my refusal to acknowledge the existence of spirits is a direct insult to her friends memory. \n\nAll of this was brought to a head the other day resulting in a brief fight followed by a long awkward car ride. It all started with a conversation about ouija boards. She said she would be upset if I ever brought one into the house, given her beliefs I understand that but i think it’s genuinely silly to be scared of an inanimate object. The fact that this specific object is seen as a bridge of sorts doesn’t really change my view of it. Come on it’s a freakin board with letters and numbers. Sure it’s a fun party game but there’s always some asshole guiding the selector thing. Following me saying this we discussed both of the aforementioned situations and this resulted in her telling me I was being closed minded and inconsiderate of what she believes. I said it’s healthy to be skeptical of things that are seemingly incorrect. (this may have been where I fucked up) \n\nWas I so quick to dismiss her beliefs that I hurt her feelings over it? Is she being overly sensitive? I honestly feel like it’s a really stupid thing to fight over because the answer is so fucking obvious but I guess if you are brought up believing in that kind of stuff then it might be hard to shake later in life.

      "title": "AITA for starting an argument with my girlfriend after she snuck one of her guy friends into her house?",
      "description": "Hey all.\n\nA week ago, my girlfriend and I hung out with two of her girl friends. We are all sixteen. \n\nWe spent the whole day together, playing mario kart, getting food, having a good time. I had to go home at midnight. but my girlfriend was talking about how her friend, (let’s call him D, for douchebag) was going to sneak into her house at 1. When she first talked about it, my whole mood changed.\n\nI trust my girlfriend with everything, but I do not trust D. Sure, we are all mutual friends, in fact, D is quite fond of me. The thing is, a month prior, me, D, my girlfriend, and two other friends were hanging out, and I repeatedly saw D staring at my girlfriends caboose. I told her about this, and she started defending him. She did the whole, “I’m not saying you’re wrong, but are you sure you really saw what you think you did?” Yeah, didn’t feel too good. \n\nA week prior to this, I had told her how her sneaking him into her house made me feel super uncomfortable. My argument was if she can’t sneak me into her house, she shouldn’t sneak another dude. She didn’t really fully listen to my argument, because she said “It’s just what WE DO, it’s what our friend group has always done!”\n\nSo, Saturday night comes around and they sneak D in. He brought a dab pen and a Juul. They hang out, and he left at 5. On the drive home, I damn near had a mental breakdown. I felt like I was having a heart attack, and knowing that D having a dab pen with my girlfriend and being a horn-dog was a recipe for disaster. Was the thought of that kid fucking around with my girlfriend plausible? Possibly. Was it my anxieties getting the best of me? Most likely, but regardless, I shouldn’t be put in that situation anyways.\n\nSunday morning comes around, and she could tell something was wrong because I didn’t talk to her once I got home, I just gave her a “goodnight” which I never do. \n\nI tell her the way she made me feel was the worst I had ever felt. The sole fact that she would sneak a dude that isn’t me into her house made me uncomfortable as it is, let alone\n\n1. He had weed with him (he had her hit the dab pen, this makes me mad at him, not her, in this case).\n2. If they got caught, she wouldn’t be able to hang out with me at least until 2019\n3. He’s a horn dog who I have seen staring at her ass\n4. If I ever snuck a girl with weed into my house, she would have a goddamn epiphany\n\nShe started by trying to defend D, saying “Oh it’s just what we do, and D is a very good friend of mine.”\n\nI kept detailing how shitty it made me feel, and she realized she fucked up. She began crying and profusely apologizing. She said she was sick with herself. I told her I didn’t mean to make her feel that way, but I was not okay with what she did and I needed to tell her. She cried more, and got off of her phone. We FaceTime later and talk about it for 4 hours. It was less of an argument, and more of a debate, because while this pissed me off monumentally I am pretty good at not starting an “argument”. \n\nShe eventually admits that she knows what she did was wrong, but she didn’t at the time. She then goes on to tell me that she doesn’t usually care what happens to her, and she always tries to put her friends first, because she hopes it will make her happier. I believe she may have been trying to guilt trip me? I don’t know, but I said “I’m sorry you feel that way, I really am, but the risk she took that night risked our entire relationship and that is not an okay risk to take. She keeps apologizing, and I keep saying that I accept her apology, but we will have a real problem if that happens again.\n\nSo here we are now. After many days of being angry with each other, we are back to normal and ready for Christmas. \n\nI still feel a little shaken up over it, and I never really got an apology for what she did, just for how it made me feel.\n\nI’m not going to push her about it anymore unless it happens again. It was our first big argument, and I don’t want that to happen again.\n\nTell me what you think.\n\n\nTLDR; Girlfriend sneaks a guy friend into her house in the dead of night against my wishes, I tell her how that made me feel, she starts self deprecating and making me feel bad, whilst also apologizing for the wrong thing, and we argue.

      "description": "This is a throwaway account, as I don't want my SO to see this. \n\nMe (F18) and my girlfriend(F20) have been together for about 11 months and have already been through quite a few rough patches, mostly because we are both very emotional and have a lot going on around us. For the last few weeks everything has been going decently well but I just don't feel the same as I used to. \n\nWe were friends for a while before we started officially dating and we even helped eachother through past relationships. She is completely head over heels in love with me and I used to feel the same way but lately I guess the spark is just gone. I feel like our relationship has become a routine and honestly my feelings have become less romantic and more as those of a bestfriend. \nOur affectionate and sexual relationship also has gotten semi boring for me and honestly feels like the same pattern everytime enough to the point that I don't even want to bother anymore. \n\nMy girlfriend is also very close with my family so it may be awkward afterwards. She's been dumped before and everytime it's taken a dark toll on her. I feel like she's the closest thing to my perfect match that I'll ever find so I don't get why my brain is becoming indifferent towards her. \n\nI must add that I suffer from severe and chronic depression so I'm not sure if that may play a part. I know breaking up with her would tear her apart as we have a plethora of future plans and have even talked about marriage, adoption, and moving internationally.\n\nI don't want to break her heart or do anything I might regret but I have know clue how I can stay in a relationship with someone I now only love platonically.

      "description": "I apologise if formatting is weird as I'm using a phone to type this out, to show what happened properly I have screenshots through the link at the bottom of this post.\n\nTo make things easier to follow through, these are what I'm using to represent each person in my story:\n\nEBF: Ex Best Friend\nBF: Best Friend\nCBF: Closet Beat Friend\n\n\nIt was around 17th of November when this all started happening, I was hanging with my friends at my high school like usual when EBF comes to us and she sits down with us, everything is going fine usual except one thing, EBF is barely talking to me like she used to, which made me worried but I didn't think of it much at first, so the next day comes, she's there and the same thing happened, so I'm a little more on edge cause I started getting worried I did something to upset her. for the next week I couldn't properly concentrate because of this situation, I assumed that she hated me so then I proceeded to go to all of my social media accounts and remove her from everything that I followed her on (Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and Tik Tok). One day BF sends me a post from EBF's close friends list saying \"HUGE SHOUT OUT TO MY BEST FRIEND NATHAN FOR BLOCKING ME ON EVERYTHING\" and all the sides were just her showing screenshots of her not following/added on my social media accounts, then I go to text her why did she just stop talking to me all of a sudden, the response she gave me was really childish and didn't even give me a proper straight answer when I first asked her, so when I asked her to tell me why she did again, she said that she needed some times and that she can't always be talking to everyone, the thing that really tipped me over the edge was the fact she started talking to BF even though she said that she wasn't emotionally able to talk to a lot of people even though it's still the same amount of people. We went on and argued a bit then eventually she started saying that I need to think about her more instead of just thinking about how I feel and she tells me that I'm being selfish. I eventually get tired of the whole argument I then say that I should just next time I should understand what and why BF choose to do whatever she's doing and I need to stop being entitled, then she responds with almost the same thing I said to an extent. After this I got so annoyed at myself because I thought I messed up and I'm a complete joke and other self deprecating stuff, then for a bit I went into this stage where I was like \"yeah I'm in the right she was being a massive bitch screw her she doesn't matter to me anymore\" but I feel like I've come full circle but instead I feel awful about this.\n\nThese are the screenshots, I wasn't able to get all of the screenshots of the argument, I lost one or two screenshots but I only have the beginning and the end of the argument: http://imgur.com/a/HZZNnUE\n",

      "description": "I am female. My gym has an indoor track. It is narrow in some places but 3 people can easily walk side by side through the narrow areas. One some days of the week, traffic walks/ runs clock-wise and on the other days, traffic goes counter clock-wise. Last Sunday was a clock-wise day. One other user was there already when I came up but she was walking counter clock-wise. Not really thinking about it, I joined and went counter clock-wise as well. Maybe 5 minutes later, another user joins us (there are now three people using the track) and he goes clock-wise, which you are supposed to do on Sundays. The first three times we pass each other, he tells me to change direction because I'm walking the wrong way. I was already into my groove and the person who was there before me is also still going counter clock-wise, so I smile at him to be polite and acknowledge what he's saying but continue the way I was. Each time he speaks to me about walking the wrong way, he gets a little more agitated. The final 'confrontation' ends with me telling him that there was more to life than worrying about which way I was walking. He stopped after that. \n\nI was up there for a total of 10 minutes and there was only the three of us on the track that whole time. I'm not typically a rule breaker so I'm not sure if that guy was making a big deal over nothing or if I was being a jerk. ",

      "description": "So, there are numerous nuances to this question. \n\nEvery time we hang out, they're drinking. It's like they can't go out without having liquor. I don't drink, so I don't understand the near-constant need to drink. \n\nWhenever we go out around someone's birthday, it ends up as \"We're paying for X's dinner, because it's their birthday.\" Well, this burns me for a few reasons. First is that my friends make a LOT more money than me, but secondly, they always pick something expensive, where I can barely afford food for me, much less an appetizer, drinks, and an entree for the birthday person. Third, it's always something I won't eat. 95% of the time, it's Asian. I'm limited on what I will eat because it will give me bathroom problems if it has too many spices. I'm limited to white rice and a bland meat, with salt and pepper. I do eat other things, and regret it later. An example of this was a friend chose Asian seafood for her birthday. I checked out the (expensive) menu and found one thing I could eat safely, teriyaki chicken and white rice. Birthday girl chose a family-style meal which started at $100, and contained literally NOTHING I could have. So I would've been paying upward of $40 after food, drinks, and tip for food I can't have. \n\nAnother thing is that we have different schedules. I work nights and they all have regular 9-to-5 jobs. When asked when were available to hang out, I'll give them a time, it's agreed on... then changed so I can't make it. This time, I suggested breakfast, because they I can go home to sleep, which THEY AGREED TO, then just today, they've changed it to a liquid lunch and karaoke and then a hard lunch, probably on an Asian place, based on the neighborhood. \n\nI feel like an asshole, mainly because they tell me I am. They tell me I don't try (which is bullshit, I think, as I try many cuisines because I like to eat, and I want to know what I CAN'T eat), but it seems like they're outvoting me as a group to do what the majority wants. Which isn't a problem, I just don't understand why they ask when everyone can make it, then change it so I'm the ONLY person who can't make it. \n\nI made it a New Year's resolution to try to see my friends more, but this situation made me realize exactly WHY I don't like to see them. They always make me feel excluded, mainly because I can't afford to do the things they do (they all just had a spa day together that I found out about via whatsapp), and say \"That's okay, you don't have to come.\" \n\nI feel like, with the spa day, and everything else, just stop inviting me. Hell, I've been trying to extricate myself from these people for years, and it always comes down to \"/U/notastepfordwife, you're not trying, you're kinda selfish, but we love you.\" I feel like, if I'm the asshole, they wouldn't want to be around me, either, right? But they want to hang out, and I keep doubting myself. I know I'm an asshole in some respects, but is this one on me? Am I just not doing all I can to be a good friend?\n\nHelp me out, here. If I'm the asshole, I want to be better than that. But if I'm not, I gotta figure out how to tell them that I AM trying, but I'm not feeling included.",

I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?",

      "description": "So this has been an ongoing thing for about 3 years, I've spent so much time trying to decide if I'm justified or not. My gf complains about the smallest things, if I touch her foot getting out of bed, if I want the brighter lights on because I'm doing something but she wants the room darker(she generally likes a darker room and I'm the opposite), random people being assholes on the road. I used to be the same way and i spend a lot of time not saying anything to her because it always turns into an argument. I no longer let the small things bug me, if someone's following too close while I'm driving I move over and let them go that kind of stuff. I am 31 she is 24 and I try to be understanding that some things she just hasn't figured out yet but I also don't feel like I shouldn't have to just listen to a constant stream of complaint daily, I try to tell her that life would be a lot easier if she learned to let little things go but she doesn't take any criticism well so it's like my only choices are an argument or to STFU.",

      "description": "I (23/M) have been friends with my girlfriend (22/F) for about a year now, and have been together for about five months. For the most part everything is good, she's a very kind and loving person, and in most aspects I'm happy with the relationship. However, there are a few issues, the most prominent of which is the fact that we haven't had sex in the five months that we've been together (Or the month or two that we had been dating.) \n\nWe've gotten close once towards the beginning of the relationship. Sparing the details, during foreplay she told a joke that we both laughed at for a while, and as the laughter died down she mentioned that it killed her mood, and we could pick up where we left off another time. So, we stopped. It was no big deal, sometimes you're just not in the mood. \n\nAfterwards though any time she started to flirt with me heavily and I would respond in kind, she would respond with something along the lines of 'Hard pass' or 'Down boy,' because 'she's just teasing.' Being rejected so frequently and exclusively is doing a number on my self esteem, and the constant teasing is leaving me pretty frustrated. Strangely, she's frequently mentioned how 'healthy' our sex life is to our mutual friends.\n\nNow, I'm someone who has a high sex drive when I'm in a relationship, and I really need physical intimacy. A decent part of a relationship to me is the feeling of being wanted, and expressing your want for your partner.  I've tried talking to her about it a few times trying to figure out her reason for never wanting to get intimate in case it's something that we can work on, but she has yet to give me a reason beyond just 'not being in the mood.'\n\nConsidering everything else in the relationship is very good I feel like it would be extremely shallow of me to break up with her over sex. But, it's a serious source of stress in my life at the moment. With her either unsure of the problem, or unwilling to talk to me about what the problem is, I don't see it getting any better.\n\nWIBTA?",

      "description": "Obligatory notice that this is a throwaway.\n\nSo I (18f) was asked out by my friend (20f) a few days ago. I'm openly bisexual so her gender is not the problem. She approached me when our whole friend group was hanging out and told me that she \"really liked me\" and then waited for a response. I had kind of suspected this was going to happen for a few days, but I wasn't sure and hadn't prepared a response, so I just went \"sorry, I prefer us as friends\" essentially, but with all the grace of someone putting their foot in their mouth. She took it gracefully, and before I left came up to me to make sure I was still okay hanging out with her, which I am. \n\nHOWEVER, the past few days since she has asked me out, she has been pushing our friendship in a more touchy-feely direction than it had been before. To clarify, that means things like asking for hugs, sitting very close to me at every opportunity (thighs touching). Now, I am a fairly physically affectionate person and have that kind of friendship with some other people in our friend-group, but since she's only doing this after she told me she liked me, I'm kind of uncomfortable. \n\nSome other things that might be important to note:\n\n1. This friend-group also contains my ex boyfriend, and we have managed to regain our friendship and be okay around each other, even though we are nowhere near as close as we used to be\n2. The girl who asked me out is someone who I had planned to live with, along with two other girls, in an apartment-style dorm next year, and we are currently filling out our housing applications for next year.\n3. Even though the rest of our friends might have overheard our various conversations I don't have any idea if they actually did and I have not asked them their opinions on the situation.\n\nSo, I'm feeling very strange right now and turn to you to tell me if I'm being an asshole to my friend.",

      "description": "We're in a program that helps autistic adults become independent. This program takes place in an apartment complex in which we each get one roommate (2 people per apartment, 6 people in total). We've been dealing with drama regarding a \"client\" here for weeks. He's been making romantic advances on my roommate (including touching her ass), has called me hurtful names, and treats his roommate and everyone else horribly. We'll call him Mike (not his real name for privacy). \n\nWe recently found out that Mike is being discharged from the program--much to our (me, my roommate's, and two of our guy friends') relief. He initially lied to his roommate (one of the guy friends) saying he was getting discharged from his primary care. However, Mike's case manager wishes to fight the discharge--not that the staff of the program will agree to it as they are tired of Mike's bullshit. \n\nDue to the mounting drama, her depression, and people spreading rumors  (Mike, and a few others most likely), my roommate cut herself for (presumably) the very first time. I didn't see the cutting happen, but my roommate showed me the cut on her arm that she had made and was on the phone with the local Crisis team. I'm very close with her to the point where we're like sisters, and I'm very concerned for her. She's opened up to me in the past, and told me she has made a few suicide attempts, and that she has depression. I'm basing my suggestion on the rule (?)  that \"if a friend tells you a 'secret' that is potentially dangerous to their health, tell an authority figure\". In our case the \"authority figure\" would be staff. \n\nI want to tell the staff about this incident, but I also don't want to butt my head into business I should not be involved in (even though Mike has done hurtful things towards me as well but I have already informed the staff of that). The longer Mike is here, the more I feel my roommate will suffer and possibly cut herself even more, maybe even lash out at me or one of our guy friends if it gets to that extremity. She's already barred him from being in our apartment and blocked his number, but who knows. \n\nWIBTA if I told staff that my roommate cut herself, even if she told them already? ",

      "description": " WIBTA for adopting a rescue dog? Based off the title it probably seems obvious, but like always the back story can change it up. (I broke a rule so I fixed it and am reposting) \n\nMy aunt breeds Australian Shepherds. She's a responsible breeder that only does one litter a year, is very careful about lineage and breeding for health along with the typical pure bred traits. She does it as a side business and it helps pay for stuff around the farm and house that they wouldn't be able to afford to get fixed otherwise. She's also just an amazing hardworking woman. When I was nine/ten, she gave me (not sure if my parents paid or not- never asked) my first dog, who was my rock through various issues that come with a rough childhood. I was a kid and made mistakes, but I truly loved this dog and cared for her as best I could. She had to be put down about a year ago now due to age related health issues, and lived to the ripe old age of fifteen.\n\nMy BF and I are getting ready to move into a townhouse, and we'll be looking for an ESA for me for anxiety and depression issues, and as such I'm trying to get a dog that's under a year to make it easier with training. Here's where the issue comes in. I desperately want an Aussie again. The place we're going to has the backyard opening up into a park, and I'm working to keep to a strict schedule that would work with the high energy of an Aussie. Part of me fully believes in the \"adopt don't shop\" mindset, but the other part of me wants an Aussie again. I had thought of adopting from an Australian Shepherd rescue, but now I can't imagine telling this woman that gave me my first dog that I chose to get my next one from somewhere else. And honestly, with her skill in picking personalities of even puppies, I feel like she would be best for getting me a good match.\n\nThe compromise I came to was that once we're settled in and I've been able to faithfully stick to a schedule that would suit a high energy dog, I would go with whatever came up first- either she had a spare puppy that didn't get bought or a rescue Aussie that matched my needs came up. But in the end, if the rescue comes up first, AITA for getting a rescue instead of asking to buy a puppy from my aunt? I know she would save me a puppy from the next litter if I asked.",

      "description": "Basically last year after graduating High school I decided instead of going into college or the military, that I would be moving up to New York City for a gap year. My parents weren't very supportive of this decision and said that they wouldn't help me financially to move up there. I took it upon myself to work a fast food job to save enough money to move, and I did. I finally moved up, got a job, live in my own apartment (that I pay for), have a girlfriend, financial security, etc. \n\nA few months go by and it's Christmas time, my parents are nice enough to buy me a train ticket to come down and visit for a week. It was a great time, I see my friends, family, and I have an overall fun time altogether. That is until Christmas rolls around. Everybody was getting gifts except me, which didn't really make me sad, it's all about being around family that makes me happy. Finally at the end, I get a gift from my Mom and Step-dad. I was a bit surprised because I wasn't really expecting a gift. I open it and it's a book, titled \"Manual to Manhood.\" Inside there were instructions on everything that makes a man a man. How to change a flat, how to put on deodorant, how to pick up women, etc. Everything was dumbed down into two pages each, and the information in there were things I already knew how to do. I was a bit upset at the gift because I felt like my parents didn't think I was doing a good job or *manly* enough, or knew how to do anything. I didn't get into an angry fit, but they saw that I was visibly upset and thought that it was ungrateful that I didn't like their gift. \n\nEventually once I got back to New York I ended up tossing it because there was really nothing I could do with it. \nWas I just overreacting asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway as my friends who think I'm an asshole for this know my reddit account.\n\nSo for pretty much my entire life I've despised/hated work. I've never understood how anyone can enjoy it, having limited holidays per year, having to show up to a location or work remotely every day without fail. I remember as a child asking my dad when his summer holidays were and being confused/horrified that he didn't get any.\n\nThe funny thing is, I actually have a job I really enjoy.\n\nI'll get the part out of the way that I'm sure most people will call my an asshole for. I live in a country with strong labour laws, I have (for employment) very good annual leave/sick leave compared to the rest of the world. I have a job for a company that I believe is helping the world, I get a good wage and only have to work 40 hours a week. I enjoy what I do, I'm good at what I do, always get praise from management. My team is awesome and I'm good friends with a few of them, no working drama. Pretty sweet right?\n\nWell every day I still feel absolute dread that I have to wake up to an alarm. Realising that I'll be doing this for decades to come is horrifying to me. I've more than once thought about just killing myself to avoid it, not because I'm depressed, I'm not at all. We work so much of our lives and get so little time off in comparison. If I'm sick, or want to take a holiday, I have to inform my work, if I don't I get fired. If I quit my job I lose my house as I can't pay the mortgage. It doesn't help that I feel like I could do my weeks worth of work in about two days but I have to come in every day or I get fired (I have asked my manager for work from home days, that's really a no go and most jobs don't allow it, I've looked extensively). \n\nI legitimately stayed at University for three years longer than I should have just to get the four months off at the end of the year, I used to work multiple jobs during the year to save up enough so I wouldn't have to work over the four months off. That's pretty much impossible to do with a full time job, nobody wants someone who'll work less than 10 months a year.\n\nWhenever I share even the softest version of my view with people they freak the fuck out, talk about how I owe everything to the job, how I need to be a team player and just do it. When I tell people I'm strictly 9-5 and don't check emails or take calls out of hours they also freak out and tell me I'm letting my employer down. I keep this stuff to myself now.\n\nI wish I could be doing anything else. When I have time off I read books, go for walks, go for runs, try new hobbies, watch movies, do volunteer work (not forced to do so I enjoy it significantly more). \n\nSo, am I a huge asshole for hating the whole idea/structure of work?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for a couple years now and she and I dated around before we met. She still has some of the guys she’s dated and hooked up with on her IG which didn’t really bother me much until last night. \n\nSometimes I see her like one of their posts or something and it gets to me a little bit. I deleted all of my former hookups from my social media because I figured why still have them on there?\n\nEither way, last night she was showing me a picture she thought was funny on IG and when she did a dude she hooked up with before we met sent her a message. I didn’t say anything about it, just figured she’d tell me and I didn’t see the contents of the message. \n\nBut she didn’t mention it and seemed a little protective of her phone which made me suspicious. I didn’t go through her phone but I did mention it this morning and asked that she be more transparent. When she asked why I told her I saw the guy messaged her and it made me uncomfortable. In fact her still having dudes she’s hooked up with as IG friends made me uncomfortable. She got irritated and told me she’d delete them. I told her she didn’t have to do all that and now things seem awkward and I think she feels like I’m an asshole.\n\nI’m not sure if I’m coming off as controlling and I’m not sure why seeing that one message bothered me so much.\n\n\n\n",

My boyfriend worked for a business in our home country full time. This business is also in the uk so he continued to work for them when we moved to the uk however his days of work and hours have not been full time and he often goes a week or even two without work. Obviously this is not ideal and hes been looking for full time work. However its now February 2019 and he hasnt found another jobs. He has had 3 interviews and thats it. Im getting really frustrated and angry. We are both broke and to be truthful I feel hes not tried hard enough, for example hes only going for free career guidance next week after all these months. Plus I'm sick of getting up every morning and tiptoeing while he sleeps in. Hes smart and has a degree and I dont want him to neccessarily work in a low paid job and he says shops etc havent got back to him. But at this stage I dont really care if he does. Why am i working full time for shit money I didnt know there was a choice!?! I want to add he always has enough for rent and bills and doesnt borrow money so hes not relying on me but im just sick of us being broke.",

      "description": "My mom picked my daughter up (less than a year old) after a visit with her dad. She said DD smelled like smoke and that she has never smelled like smoke after picking her up from his house or with me. He and I both smoke. I only smoke outside, with the door shut -even before daughter- and he smokes in his apartment. I suspect he typically doesnt smoke in his apartment for the few hours that she is with him because she has never smelled like smoke before, even to my nonsmoker mom. So that leads me to believe he smoked inside this last visit.\n\nI 100% do not believe I have any right to ask him not to stop smoking completely in his own apartment. The only exception being when DD is there. We all know cigarettes are toxic AF (and I really shouldnt be smoking at all), especially for developing children. My stance is that its lazy and selfish as hell not to go outside. I did not say that to him, nor insinuate it.\n\nI explained that shed never smelled like smoke before and for DD's health, please dont smoke inside while shes with him. I dont want her developing breathing issues because of his (and my) choices. She does not have a choice so we shouldn't be making choices for her that harm her. \n\nHis response : he smoked a lot the night before but didnt while she was there and didnt really say either way if hed be sure to go outside to smoke while DD is there.\n\nI didnt say this to him, but I dont really believe him. Hes smoked a lot the night before (evidence on the table) I've dropped her off with a different outcome.\n\nSo here's the actual WIBTA question. He has not made any effort to get his car fixed (hed much rather be chauffeured around) and I usually take DD for visits, with my mom doing pickup if I have to work and ex's parents occassionally helping. \n\nWIBTA if I stopped driving her over there if DD continues to come home smelling like smoke? If he makes other arrangements for p/u and d/o, I likely wouldn't keep her from him, but its doubtful hed do that.\n\n\nWe do not have an official custody in place, so he gets her when he can, but usually *only* when its convenient (which sometimes leads to weeks between visits, it's gotten a little better though). He pays a small amount in child support, usually late. Other than that and the short visits, doesnt do anything to contribute to DD's care. He makes very few sacrifices for DD (I'd say none, with the exception of small CS), the least he can do is take it outside when shes with him for a couple of hours.  I drive her to support the father daughter relationship, but don't want to if hes going to smoke inside. \n\n\nTL;DR : cigarettes are bad and dad wants to smoke inside for the few hours he has our &lt;1 year old. I'm considering not driving her for the visits if he doesnt take it outside.\n\n",

Been blocked on WhatsApp, I've tried ringing won't connect so I presume he's also blocked my texts. Would I be out of order to turn up at his door to find out what's gone on",

      "description": "Fairly recently, I called my local Starbucks, asking some questions. The young man on the other end had a real grouchy attitude towards me the whole time and was very (seemingly deliberately) unhelpful, responding to each question with a snotty, “I don’t know.” Near the end of the conversation, I said the word, “Starbucks”, and he responded by saying, **“I don’t know what that is.”** Now just to be 100% clear: A **Starbucks** employee, employed by **Starbucks**, just told me that he *doesn’t know what* ***Starbucks*** *is.* He hung up on me not long after.\n\nIf I **had** to guess, I would say that he was just being a smart ass, not serious. But I couldn’t be certain. The next time I went to my local shop to get some work done on my laptop, I came across that employee (recognizable by his distinctive Southern accent). I found my way to his supervisor, and had a private discussion with her.\n\nI told her, in a very serious manner, that I am coming to her with a concern that the rude employee (who we’ll refer to as Jamie) might be in the early stages of developing some form of mental disability, such as early Alzheimer’s or Dementia. I tell her how during our conversation, he insisted profusely that he has no idea what the name of his own company is, which made her eyes grow as wide as saucers. I talked about how my aunt, who developed Alzheimer’s at a young age, similarly started randomly forgetting basic things like this, and how I’m concerned Jamie might be in the same boat. I told her that tactfully discussing Jamie’s mental health with him, giving him tests, or recommending doctors to him would be a helpful course of action. She seemed extremely concerned, and thanked me for letting her know.\n\nI saw Jamie called into the back by his supervisor, and he was gone for a good fifteen or twenty minutes. When he returned, his face was as red as a beet, and he looked embarrassed beyond the imagination. Later that day, when he served me, he angrily questioned me why I lied saying he was crazy, and I responded, “You told me you don’t know your own company’s name, and I took you at your word. I was just trying to help. What did you expect people to think about your mental state when you say something like that?” AITA for thinking and doing this?",

Tonight I was informed that another coworker, Sarah, was invited to come along.

She’s nice enough but exhausting as she talks constantly, interrupts you to talk about her own stuff, asks the same questions over and over, etc. In addition, while we used to have a friendlier rapport, in recent years she has distanced herself to the point that we no longer converse unless it is work related. \n\nI’m irritated that I wasn’t consulted on whether she could be invited, especially because it’s being held at my house.

She also brings up the fact that every time I tell her to be truthful, everything ends up going to shit like the one time she told her parents about our relationship and they made it very clear they did not like me during their holiday in my country where I was their host (which brought her almost to tears for the entire duration of that holiday).\n\nNow, I never forced her to listen to me and I was simply giving a suggestion and stating that if she were to be caught by the Australian authorities, it would be far worse. Nevertheless, she's crying that now more people will know she has a condition she was born with and is saying she should have never listened to my dumbass advice even though I assured her patient confidentiality was a thing. It doesn't help that the need for that specific medical checkup is written on her application unlike on her peers which only states a general medical checkup requirement.\n\nTL;DR AITA for telling my girlfriend to declare her chronic hepatitis condition on her visa application especially since she's super worried her visa will get declined and that everyone will know about it after she's been trying so hard to keep it a secret?",

She is 100% potty trained.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith about 30 minutes left in the flight I took my daughter to the bathroom one last time. I told her it was the last chance to go before we landed because we would need to sit with our belts on. So, we went, she did her business, and we went back to our seats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything was good until we were about to land and my daughter started saying she had to use the washroom again. I said she would need to wait until we landed because it was unsafe. Once we got on the ground we had to sit and wait for our gate. At this point our daughter started getting antsy saying she has to go \"so bad\". I decided that once the flight got to the gate I would take her and my husband could meet us at baggage. I was hoping people would understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, airports right... we continue to be delayed for another 10 or so minutes and the FA comes on to tell us that a few people had connections and asked people to remain in their seats until those people disembarked and then everyone else could go. At this point my kid is squirming uncontrollably, so I decided I would get up with the connection people and run her to the bathroom. We get to the gate and I get up (along with everyone else lol..). I kindly ask people if I can run past. People get out of the way and I ran off with her. Husband stayed on for our carry ons and with everyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe made it to the bathroom and daughter went. Was definitely not a false alarm. We went down to the baggage and got there as others from our flight were starting to come. We were one of the first. Husband was still not there so our row likely had not disembarked yet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after, a woman came up to me and started telling me it must be nice to push others out of the way instead of waiting my turn. \"I'll be lucky to get my luggage first\", and telling me that I was rude for disembarking before everyone else (we were the first off the plane). I honestly didn't know what to say, I was actually kind of shocked someone would act that way. She walked away and stood on the other side of the baggage claim throwing daggers at me. I was pretty embarrassed and a few other people seemed to give me \"looks\" as they noticed I was there before they were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I am wondering, AITA? ",

      "description": "Anonymous, since I think she's on here. Bear with me, this might get long but I'll try to only post the facts. \n\nAbout a year ago a girl I knew in high school (almost 15 years ago) friended me on Facebook. We only kind of knew each other through a school club but I figured sure, I'll add her. She started messaging me occasionally and it was nice to catch up, but I still consider us more of acquaintances than real friends.\n\nThis girl has a lot of drama. Her husband has lupus, she's got a myriad of medical issues (supposedly), she's constantly in-between jobs. At one point last year, shortly after I friended her on social media, she was doing a fund-raiser for something medical for her husband. Since I allot about $200 a month for charitable giving, I sent it to her, anonymously. I figured I could give money to someone in need that month instead of my usual organizations and yay, good karma and all that. (I also pointed her in the direction of state and government assistance programs, but IDK if she ever looked at them.)\n\nBut somehow she found out it was me. Since then, once or twice a month, she's asking me for money. Her furnace broke. She needs money to buy wood for their fireplace. She is in debilitating pain and her insurance doesn't cover the bills. She just needs $35 to cover food for the week or she won't be able to eat. Her car broke down. They sold their house in Texas and moved to Wyoming (who *does* that?) and the new house has more problems than they realized. You get the idea. At one point she even asked for like $2500 in startup capital for a bakery she plans to open...\n\nShe always promises she'll pay me back. I'm not that stupid. But since I already plan to spend $200 each month helping others, at first I figured it wasn't a big deal. Lately, however, I'm starting to think that it's just enabling her. The last time she asked for money I told her that $50 was all I could give her and that I can't be her ATM or bank, because even little amounts add up and I have my own family and kids to take care of. I told her I'm seriously done after this, that I wished her the best but I'm tapped out financially and emotionally and I'm just done.\n\nWell, guess who just got a message. She only needs $80 this time because she hasn't slept in 2 weeks and her husband is keeping her up because he's in pain and his disability check hasn't come in... I'm just so over it. Reddit, WIBTA if I just block her without saying anything? ",

I’m sitting in the airport playing on my phone minding my business when this adorable little toddler comes by and accidentally kicks my soda bottle over (cap was on, no harm no foul.) He immediately and profusely apologized and I assured him I wasn’t worried about it in the slightest, but he walked away through the terminal and said something along the lines of, “I’ll get you a replacement.” I tried to shout after him that that wasn’t necessary, but I guess he didn’t hear me. He showed back up with a soda and he tried to hand it to me, but I told him I couldn’t accept it because it honestly didn’t feel right accepting an apology for something that was so trivial. He looked sad that I didn’t accept it and asked if it was because it wasn’t the same flavor drink. I felt really bad instantly because it wasn’t about that at all. He then walked back to his family and that was the end of it. But I still feel pretty guilty for not accepting something he spent money on specifically for me.\n\nSo reddit, an I the asshole? Should I have just accepted the drink and smiled and thanked him?",

      "description": "So we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?",

      "description": "On Friday night I had a sleepover with my friends after going ice skating for my birthday. We had a blast but stayed up pretty late (2:30ish). I got about 5-5 &amp; 1/2 hours of sleep. I tried to take a small nap before dinner on Saturday to catch up on a little bit of sleep but my family was being very loud in the kitchen. I didn’t get mad because as it wasn’t time to be sleeping I didn’t expect them to walk on eggshells for me.\n\nSo I maybe got ~10 minutes extra. Then last night I went to bed at 11:30 and popped two melatonins. My family came up at 12:10 to get ready. I slept through them getting ready for bed even though the bathroom is right next to my room and their rooms surround mine. I was asleep by 11:40 and had been asleep half an hour before they burst into my room.\n\nSo they burst into my room and my dad goes “Hi, finfp!” And my sister trying to trick disoriented me goes “It’s time to leave for vacation!” As if it was actually next week. I immediately woke up to my family filing into my room and I yelled “No it’s not, get out!” \n\nAs I was now awake, and my family was still getting ready for bed, it was noisy in the upstairs and I have trouble sleeping (hence the melatonin) and sat in bed for about 10 minutes. My dad was yelling (not angrily, just being really loud when he spoke). So I yelled “please be quiet!” And my sister, trying to keep the joke going, said: “Finfp, it’s time for spring break, chill.” My dad said “finfp, settle down.” \n\nI was fuming at this point, as they had run into my room, knowing full well I was sleeping and woke me up, then got mad because I was trying to go back to sleep. I got up and ran into my dads room and yelled at him and then ran back into my room. He says I was too mouthy and that it was just a joke.",

      "description": "Background story: i'm an international student in Australia and i do bachelors of Business in IS, and I decided to take summer school to fasten up the process of getting rid of this shit. To make it easier, the story happens at only one subject (Project Quality and Management, or PQM) and sadly i'm the one that does not let shit slide without say something. Also, the lEcTuReR i'll be calling \"R\".\n\n\\-\n\nDear oh dear, I do regret this term. OMFG.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe unit itself has been poorly managed, as miscommunication from the first lecturer telling us that we wouldn't have midterms and leaving the institute on the fourth week, a third on the term. The following lecturer that assume greet us with a beautiful \"I don't know anything about this subject\" and my first reaction was saying \"then why are you here?\".\n\nPersonally speaking I don't like this guy, yet I wish it was only me not liking him. but we have several problems:\n\n* We had a major project coming up that we were meant to start at week 3. No information were given up until week 9, even though every class I was pretty much demanding info about it, in front of all students;\n* R couldn't bother to do much but read the slides whilst sit on his chair, with the arms crossed. But we all knew he came from  UOW (a prestigious university in NSW) as he loved to brag about it;\n* Students were deliberately coming late, or skipping classes, simply because we could read the slides ourselves. Mind you, Gov't will be on our asses and revoking our visas if we skip too many classes;\n* He was not even reading his own material, as we found material from other subject on his subfolder. Yes, we were meant to submit that for grades;\n* He was pretty much refusing using email to keep contact with students. \n* When questioned about the subject, answers were \"I don't know\", \"\\*insert 40 slides that don't answer the question\\*\" or \"help yourselves\";\n\nMultiple times I took this to the Academic Dean, informally, and enough was said that even a third of the students were to complain about him. With my emotions I happened to respond one of his emails (out of 3 he sent) and all my complaints kinda were not considered anymore as they deemed I was being too emotional, with the Dean herself saying so. When I questioned her about the choice of him being in the position, her answer was \"sadly we hadn't have a choice, but you should give him a chance, he sure feel leftover by you guys, specially by you\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBig project came in, with virtually no help me and my teammate did the work just to receive an \"excellent idea but not what I wanted\". And he didn't allowed us to see other presentations yet everyone saw ours, simply because we didn't submit before presenting. Note: there is no policy saying we have to submit before presenting, but we do have the right to fix before submitting. And he forced almost everyone to submit their work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven with my blood boilling, I asked nicely for the feedback that, between \"you can't answer simple questions\", learn how to do a presentation\" and \"I won't tell you\", his final answer were \"feel free to take to the Dean\", even when I mentioned his unethical move. Needless to say, my teammate is fuming, yet we will submit the project as ask the Dean for the feedback on tuesday, four days after the submission.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven all that, AITA to follow with formal complaints?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: student can't cope with lazy lecturer, lecturer is petty.",

      "description": "Just a little backstory as always my sister, her boyfriend along with me and my boyfriend  live together with my parents. My sister (when her boyfriend just moved in with her before mine moved in) remarked that we would be a perfect couple because we're both skinny (she is heavily overweight) . I started being cold towards him. When my boyfriend moved in I had issues with her walking in the room in front of my boyfriend in just her underwear and too small shirts that showed her well endowedness. I mentioned this to her boyfriend as I have a severe anxiety problem along with other issues and have trouble confronting people. He said he would deal with it she continued to do the same behavior claiming that \"she didn't care because she loved her body and what we thought didn't matter to her\" I'm speechless at this point. She hardly does anything around the house just sleeps all day and then will wash a dish or so and say she did the dishes or say she cleaned the room I did to our father telling him I sleep all day even though people living here vouch for me. She once bought a bottle of wine for thanksgiving with her boyfriends money and then was upset it was smaller than she remembered and then try to tell my dad I drank her whole bottle of wine and replaced it with a smaller bottle. (mind you I can't buy I'm underage for alcohol and me and my boyfriend did not have a penny to our name at this point in time) she has also taken several of mine and my boyfriends shirts or hoodies and worn them stretching them out  swearing they're hers or her boyfriends, I typically get two sizes up (I fit into a size s) because of reasons and my mother and family know this my mom bought me an extremely cute outfit in light colors to help \"boost my mood\" the shirt was a xxxl, my sister constantly grabs the shirt and says it must be hers because it's her size, we will have that argument every time she sees the shirt. Theres more but this is ridiculously long; My sisters boyfriend has a dog, I have a work in progress to potty train puppy, the family has two dogs. My dog was locked in the kitchen with me as I was cooking, my brother went in my room to find their dog in my room ears down and poop in my room bigger than my dogs and smaller than the families dogs. My boyfriend politely asked her to clean it up, She starts yelling at him, im in the kitchen with a sharp knife and I happen to have a sensory issue so loud noises and stuff can cause issues I ask for them to tone it down, they get louder at this point I proceed to almost cut my finger so I match in there mad and find out what's going on, I ask her to clean up the mess since we clean up our dogs mess and have cleaned up hers enough, she starts called me a bitch and a bunch of other stuff I go off since I'm back in the kitchen giving it right back to her my boyfriend and brother get scared she's gonna come hit me so they go wake up the boyfriend. It's kinda fuzzy from there but the boyfriend came down later and said aggressively \"don't worry we'll be gone by the first\" \n\n\n\nTL:DR- sister has no respect for boundaries and is so painfully lazy she almost got violent to get out of cleaning dog shit, and I want to cut her off even though my father does not; Am I the asshole?",

Some examples of this are:\n\n\"Why are you wearing your glasses?\"\n\n\"You're so lucky you don't have to wear glasses all the time...\"\n\n\"You're only supposed to wear them when you're doing homework you know.\"\n\nHow they're saying it is making me feel bad for wearing them (when I already do since they were expensive). Today, my dad said that I shouldnt be wearing them, and I got tired of it so I went to my room to cool off. He comes in later saying that it was only a joke and that he was being hard on me. I told him that my sister has been doing it ever since I got them, but he said the same thing for her. Whenever I make jokes with them like that, I immediately apologize and laugh to make sure I didnt hurt them, but they don't do that for me. My mom came in later and said that if I wear them all the time that I'll ruin my eyes, and that I should stop being so grumpy. ",

      "description": "Last February my ex assaulted me at work, he'd been previously verbally abusive but he crossed a line when he pushed me around our work's office and cornered me multiple times to yell at me while I was trying to close the store all because I wouldn't let him in while I was counting cash.\n\nOur friends are mutual friends, they've all seen the security footage from that night, heard the stories, held me when I cried even. Since then my mental health has been in turmoil which has definitely caused a lot of problems in our group. My recent meltdown had me sent to a behavioral health center and I dropped contact with all my friends for a couple months. \n\nI deeply want to apologize for dropping off the face of the earth and hurting them the way I have by causing problems that weren't even there in the first place. They're under no obligation to accept my apology but it eats me alive that they still hang out with my abusive ex but they've all blocked me off.\n\n Am I the asshole for feeling some type of way about this?",

      "description": "Title kinda sums it up, and I'm using a throwaway for privacy reasons. \n\nI met her my freshmen year of college at a house party where I drank far too much and woke up at her place, with little to no memory of the previous night. I'm gonna preface this by saying I'm by no means calling myself a perfect catch, or a highly sought after womanizer, but this girl is a little high on the weight scale and a little low on the overall attractiveness scale to be someone I'd pursue while sober. Long story short, even though she's not my cup of tea while sober, blackout me was more than willing to go home with her and be college kids for the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy awkward and hungover ass couldn't figure out a tactful way to dip out the next morning so we continued to wake up at noon, start drinking again, and make me question my standards again. After sobering up and getting home on Sunday, the two of us came to an agreement that young adults like to fuck around wile drunk, and that's the end of it. Trouble is she kept contacting me, assertively at first, but eventually easing off well after I told her we're done and I had started a serious relationship with a girl I actually liked. \n\nFast forward about a year and a half and I had tried to maintain a platonic communication with her despite her best efforts. I know the easiest thing would be to just block her #/Snapchat, but mixed in with untasteful nudes and drunken pleas to come over see and her were seriously concerning messages about depression and mental instability. Call it my fault or call it bad luck, but either way I seem to have a history of getting overly involved romantically with depressed, anxiety ridden, and/or bipolar women. I want to break any ties with her, but at the same time don't wanna be the trigger that sets off someone who's already claimed to be suicidal. \n\nIn case it wasn't already obvious, I'm not exactly a pillar of emotional stability either, and I've made the mistake of digging myself a deeper hole. Due to a mixture of post break-up loneliness, depression, and alcoholism, I've let my sad dick take control of my brain and slept with her. I'm not even attracted to her, and the fact that I'm too ashamed to confide in my friends about this situation is telling, but I just find myself caving in out of shear boredom almost. I think she's even catching on to the fact that I prefer not to have her around my place while others are over, and only see her when I'm feeling down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: Girl I had a one night stand with but carry little interest in still contacts me. Despite my lack of physical interest, and lack of compatibility with her, I occasionally sleep with her out of pity/ boredom/ loneliness/ or some combination. AITA for not just ripping the band-aid and cutting ties with her. I know using an emotionally unstable girl as a physical backup is shitty, but so is ghosting someone who's unstable and haven't been treating with the best respect. ",

TLDR at the end.\n\nIn my last post I was deemed to be an asshole about that (rightfully so), but I mentioned something that sparked some small side debate in the comments and even a damn private message. So now I must know if I'm the asshole for this too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said in the post\n\n\\&gt;I don’t want him to be fat, because I’m working hard not to be fat and I want a life partner with healthy habits.\n\nI am an obese woman. My goal weight is 175lbs. At this moment I am 140lbs overweight, I was originally 205lbs overweight before I started getting my shit together. And part of that can be attributed to moving out on my own and finally being able to decide what my diet is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe struggle has been real for me with this damned food. Its the bane of my existence, but everyone in my life is super encouraging and I love them to pieces for it, but sometimes I still lack motivation and WANT to make stupid choices, but I don't make them as often as I want because there's no terrible food around me and I don't have people constantly trying to go out to eat or eating junk food surrounding me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I don't want to reintroduce unhealthiness into my life when I know that food is always going to be a struggle for me. Therefore, I don't want a fat husband. I'm not talking about someone with some pudge. I mean I don't want an obese husband or even a thin husband with unhealthy eating habits. I want someone who is conscious of their health. If it's a bigger man, and he's dedicated to living a healthy life and losing weight, that's fine. So reddit... AITA for this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; AITA for wanting a husband who is healthy even though I am currently obese?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not trying to say that weight is a sole indicator of health but I do know that someone who is 300+lbs and eats fast food daily isn't healthy. And someone who is obese is generally not healthy. I also don't support the \"healthy at every size\" movement because you're not healthy at 400lbs and you cannot convince me otherwise.",

      "description": "I moved in to a new place about 5 months ago, and while moving in I was warned that my roommate's cat is bad with wires. He mentioned that he has destroyed a couple of wires in the past, but seemingly nothing that bad.  \n\nFour months into living there I was charging some wireless headphones in my room on the wall and was busy doing some other chores, so I wasn't near my room or really paying attention. The door was half-open. Now, the cat has never entered my room before and hasn't eaten anything of mine, however I get back from my chores and the cat has eaten through my very nice and brand new headphones.\n\nUpon seeing this I asked him to replace them ($180) since they *were* in my room and the fact that I use these things every day. Later on, he told me that this cat has eaten THREE of his pairs of the same headphones in the past, which leads me to believe he never really disciplined the cat after eating his own things. \n\nAm I the asshole for requesting that he pay me back despite him saying the cat is bad with wires?

I HAVE 2 DOGS.\n\nAnyways - my buddy who is renting a room from me works 2 jobs so he's only home late on the week nights and not AT ALL during the weekend when he works his night job. His full day off from both jobs is one day a week. Because he works so much, his 2 cats and his dog are here in his room alone A LOT. the cats are typically fine, but his dog is young and in a kennel. Up till recently he's been decent at spending his free time with them and I understand his schedule so my fiance and I help out letting the dog out to potty and such. \n\nLately however, my friend got a new girlfriend and now spends 90% of the time he's not at work with her... over the last few months on his days off he hasn't been here or he \"forgets to text me\" to ask me to let his dog out... I just have to figure out if he's gonna be home or not and deal with his dog accordingly - such was the case this morning. He should have been off work this morning and home by about 8 to let his dog out. He never showed. When I finished working I realized he wasn't home and texted him if I needed to let the dog out. He said he forgot to text me and ask.  No problem... except it's getting to be a problem. I go down to let his dog out... his cats dont have food or water. So let the dog out... let him play in the yard until I left to run errands.  Fed and watered the cats. Fed the fish.\n\nIt's now 10 hours after he should have been home and he's still not... if I had been out of town (which happens the beginning of most weeks for work) his dog would now have been in a kennel for 22hrs straight... I dont want him to not have a life, at the same time I didnt agree to take responsibility for his 3 animals. \n\nWIBTA If I tell him he needs to start spending more time with them or he needs to give them somebody who can? \n\nApologies in advance for any typos... mobile.

He’s been mad at me for not going out with him more than a decade ago and acts like I ruined his life by telling him no. He’s even convinced some other family members that I’m a shallow bully just because I’m not attracted to him. There are several family members who have taken his side and act like I hurt him on purpose and/or call me a race traitor.  Every time a relationship has ended for me in the last 14 years he has gotten all loud about how I should have gone with him when I had the chance. He still asks if I’m single and trash talks my significant other to this day. I have no patience for him and his nice guy shenanigans. Would I be the asshole if I told Ann that I won’t come to her wedding if Bill is there? \n\n",

If my friends tried to brush my hair I would ask them not to and I tell them how sensitive it is, and they would stop. \nGrowing up, whenever my mom brushed my hair, she would always pull and tug on it which made me not want my hair to be combed by her. But as I’ve grown up I just don’t like other people touching my hair anymore.\nSo I was doing the dishes and my mom randomly grabs my hair. I flinch away and ask her not to do that because I don’t like my hair being touched. This is when everything began. \nShe started bothering me nonstop about “why can’t I touch it?” And she keeps using the argument that ‘I’m your mother, Why can’t I touch it?’ And i told her it wasn’t personal, that I don’t like ANYBODY touching my hair and she said “but I’m not anybody! I’m your mother!” And i Shot back saying “fine, I don’t like when my mother touches my hair.” And she actually got offended. \nI mentioned it to my therapist and we compromised. She just wanted to be able to caress me, so she can do that with my hands or arms, but my hair is off limits. But even STILL she still brings it up and it makes me mad and she has the audacity to still touch my hair. She did it today in the car and i rose my voice saying that it’s pissing me off that she’s touching my hair when I’ve said NOT TO. She called me cruel, and said that she felt like it was personal and how would I like it if i couldn’t give her goodnight kisses anymore, and I said that I wouldn’t kiss her anymore then. And that concept is impossible to her. She said that it hurts her personally and I don’t understand how she could be hurt by this.\nAITA for not wanting my mom to touch my hair? ",

      "description": "When it comes to dating we all mod our photos, we all try to put the best version of ourself out there. I get that. But AITA for repeatedly calling out a friend for catfishing? She uses photos from a few years ago when she weighed less; 50-70 lbs.  less. first I asked questions: why? B/c she wants to “lose the weight before meeting” the person knowing that’s the version of herself she wants to be. How long do you talk to a potential date? MONTHS. How does that make you feel? How do you think it will make the other party feel? \n\nNext I did some research...ok I binged that catfish show and lurked on reddit...\n\nThe next time it came up I shared how negatively catfishing affects peoples’ lives. She was so dismissive to that (cuz she thinks she can get away with it ?) \n\nThen she made plans to meet this guy. I told her to at least do a video chat first. So did another close friend that is in the know. But the catfish gets so shady whenever we talk about the situation. I couldn’t get a straight answer but it seems like she did do a video chat and got rejected. Last time I asked how things were going she said she didn’t know if they were still meeting. Then she went silent about it. \n\nBecause she was still showing no remorse and wasn’t saying she learned a lesson I was carrying around a ball of feelings. Angry she doesn’t get why it’s wrong, sad that she is setting herself up for hurt and my instincts say “if she is ok with this, how will she manipulate you in the future?” I then got a call from this guy I have been dating and talked on the phone for hours (LDR) instead of going over to my friend’s place to watch a show. I blew her off and was rude about it saying I would be over in a minute (we r neighbors basically) but never showed up. Tbh I thought I sent a text to cancel with her but was distracted because of the butterflies this guy gives me. After I got off the phone I sent a shitty text To my friend though. From talking with this guy I really like it settled in me that I was NOT ok with someone I would call a friend, behaving this way in their 30’s. The words “No, Nooo, &amp; NOPE” all showed up in that text. \n\nThe thing is, her response was to say “we can talk about this when you’re not blackout drunk”. I wasn’t drunk. This is like the 3rd time she tells me I am drunk (&amp; haven’t been) when I drop a truth bomb. I set down my phone and waited till the morning. 7 am I send a block text clearly stating that what she is doing is 100% catfishing and it is wrong and not healthy. She is beautiful, really doesn’t even need to do this to herself. \n\nDid I draw a line in the sand that didn’t need to be there though? Is it a friend’s role to help patrol this kind of social behavior? She hasn’t contacted me since I sent the text yesterday. I’m pretty sure she is giving me the silent treatment. Could you be friends with a catfish? What, if anything would you do next? ",

      "description": "Hear me out.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together in a monogamous relationship for 3 years. I have fairly traditional values regarding relationships and a very broad definition of what I consider to be cheating or inappropriate behavior. Included in there is exposing ourselves to other people (obviously aside from medical shit or locker rooms) and especially without talking about it beforehand first, this was a dealbreaker we both agreed on. She has always known and seemingly shared my boundaries and we've never had any issues.\n\nAs a \"belated\" Christmas present, she presented me with an envelope of about a dozen photos. Each of these photos were of her naked in very suggestive poses. I thought it was great, and asked her how she managed to get such awesome results on her own. She then informs me that she didn't have them taken on her own, she went to a photographer.\n\nI'm absolutely livid. In my opinion, if someone told me \"I love my car, but I don't ever want you to do anything to it, if you do I'd be very upset\" and I went and customized their car anyway then called it a gift, they'd still have every right to be upset because slapping the label of \"gift\" on something doesn't diminish the fact you still did something you knew they'd be upset about. She keeps insisting she did it for me and I keep telling her outright I specifically told her that she knew I wasn't cool with that shit so I have no idea why she'd \"do it for me.\" I returned the money she said she spent on the shoot and communication has been very strained.\n\nAnd yes, I know that some people don't consider nudity a big deal around others. Great for you. I do, and apparently thought my girlfriend did too because for three years she agreed with me. I almost feel like she cheated, and I'm considering ending it.",

      "title": "AITA For Being Annoyed That My Boyfriend Swerved His Car Towards A Cat?",
      "description": "This happened last night.\n\nMyself and my boyfriend were driving home from a friends wedding party. I'd had 1 drink but mixed with my medication, drinks hit me a bit harder than they used to. I wasn't paralytic, but I was definitely not safe to drive.\n\nNow on the estate that I live on, we have a couple of suicidal cats who have a habit of darting through the road. I have told my boyfriend this repeatedly, but he likes to continue going up there at 90mp/h. Last night he wasn't going fast, which is lucky because one of the cats darted across the road. It was still a fair while away, just at the edge of our headlights and he was only going 20. The cat made it across our lane in good time so I thought I'd go ahead and open my mouth to say how I wasn't lying about the cats. Before I could finish the first word, he swerved the car towards the cat in the other lane as a joke.\n\nI was fucking furious.\n\nMaybe the drink had exaggerated my reaction, I will admit that, but as soon as he parked the car I just got out and walked up to my flat with him trailing a ways behind me. I went into the living room and he followed shortly. Now, you'd think I'd be asked if I was ok, or I would get an apology. Nope. I get a \"dude, what the fuck.\" It's at this point I know that it's either get into an argument or change the subject. So I just turned the TV on.\n\nBF: \"Are you actually serious?\"\n\nMe: \"Yep.\"\n\nBF: \"You're actually pissed off about that?\" (so he knew why I was mad)\n\nMe: \"Of course I'm fucking pissed! I'm always telling you about those cats but you still think it's a good idea to swerve into them! Even as a fucking joke, you should have had the sense to not do something so fucking stupid!\"\n\nIn his defense, I did shout first. I didn't start shouting because of what he did though. I started shouting because he knew why, but he didn't care enough to apologise. Had he done that, I would've calmed down. We keep on at the back and forth about how he's a reckless idiot and how I'm crying over nothing, he goes off to eat his food and I start playing some Overwatch and smoking some weed to calm myself down. He comes in afterwards and starts acting cute to try and get my attention and to get me to smile and forget about the whole thing. I was not ready to forgive him yet so I just ignored him and kept playing. Then he starts trash talking my gameplay, which is completely normal in our social circle, so he's still just trying to get me to forget about it. As his attempts continue to fail, he resigns to his fate and slumps next to me. But the things he said next are what really gets my goat. All of this shit is trivial and would've been over and done with in a night.\n\nBF: \"It's like I'm dealing with a fucking six year old.\"\n\nHe has a pattern of doing this shit in our arguments. Shifts the blame onto me and tries to make me feel guilty for being angry. It suddenly clicked when he said that and I started to notice the pattern and why I'm always the one crying at the end. \n\nMe: \"Are you fucking kidding me?! You can't even pretend you're not in the wrong here, you upset me and completely ignored it!\"\n\nBF: \"You have no reason to be upset! It was a joke and you know it! If anyone else had done it, you would have found absolutely hilarious but because it's me, you're pissed off. Cause everyone hates (name) cause it's funny.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh don't even fucking try to pull that shit, I would be pissed off if anyone did that, especially if I was in the car with them!\"\n\nAgain, we had a heated back and forth. This time about how I'm a fucking child and me just unable to comprehend how he can try and villainise me for being upset. It ended with me asking him to leave my flat (we don't live together) but he refused cause it was late and he had work in the morning. I told him sternly that he needs to shut up and leave me alone for the rest of the night or leave. He went to bed and I stayed up all night.\n\nI know it sounds like I've told this story in a very one-sided way, but I promise that there are no details omitted on either side as hard as it might be to believe. So what do you say? Am I the asshole?",

This has been going on for a while now, since the beginning I have been adamant on not helping them. However, since I live with them they told me I had to help or go pay rent. At this time, I work and pay for everything I want, I never ask them of anything. But I’m not financially stable to live on my own, so I helped (only paperwork etc). \nNow I reached an impasse. I’m being laid off from work, I wasn’t even supposed to know I’m getting laid off, and told them I’m going to do some job searching. But when I brought this up, they told me that I should help with the restaurant. The restaurant isn’t even close to opening, but I told them no. They got furious that I never want to help open the family restaurant. I told them that it could be theirs, they don’t have to include me in any legal matters if it does take off. I just told them I don’t want anything to do with it. This isn’t the first time we had fought over this before, but I got mad that they weren’t supportive over the news of me being laid off. And in the heat of the moment I told them I would rather move out than work in that restaurant. They all got upset and told me how I wouldn’t make it in the real world if I did that. Now that I’m jobless and having to rely on them again, am I the asshole for not wanting to help them? \n",

About half way through the night I realized she didn't get me anything. Now I'm not usually one to care about gifts but like it was our anniversary so I kinda expected for there to be at least something. To make it even worse for me, I waited a couple of days to see if maybe she was busy and didn't have time to get me one. However, once I found a way to bring it up, she said that she was sorry because she forgot. I got upset with this and I don't know if I'm being petty or just a materialistic douche bag.\n\nTL;DR - I got my girlfriend a necklace for our anniversary and she got me nothing because she forgot. Am I just being petty for being upset or do I have the right?",

      "description": "Essentially what happened was that my brother and I had a kerfuffle about my usage of vulgar language at home. Prior to the argument, I repeatedly called him 'stupid' and a few F-bombs as a joke. He would usually be able to take it and drop those F-bombs back at me.\n\nThis time it made him tick, and I don't know why. He told me to stop, and I told him that it was just a joke. Being an adamant person, I kept repeating my point, rephrasing it each time, and so did he. It escalated so quickly I couldn't recall in detail but it was until one point he just snapped and shouted at me while we had guests in the house. I spoke back, still in a normal tone, but he proceeded to leave the scene and destroy stuff in the background. I didn't bother turning behind because my mind was too busy thinking about what just happened, but I heard him kicking things around really loudly.\n\nWe made up somehow and things went smoothly for two months until now. He won't stop bothering me about how he said his leg still hurts from kicking the furniture on that day. Earlier before posting this we had a minor argument about how petty I was during the incident. Learning from the former incident, I forced myself to shut up to prevent the conversation from heating again.\n\nNow, I have no shame in admitting that I caused the situation by swearing in the first place, but knowing me and my adamance for so long, what was he expecting by bringing it up? That tantrum was also really avoidable honestly. \n\nThis has been bugging me the whole day and I really need the take on this. Thus, the title. ",

      "description": "Where I live, Adelaide, AU, year 11 exams start tomorrow. These are important to my family, who really like acting condescending and disappointed if I get less than an A-. They don’t matter at all and don’t even count towards my overall grade, but I still try hard. This is for two reasons:\n\n1. I still like doing well at school. I have a kind of unearned reputation as being ‘smart’ because I’m one of the few who actually try.\n\n2. I don’t wanna take the shit from my family for getting a B.\n\nSo, with exams beginning tomorrow, I need to study (I’m writing this in my 30min break after tea). Meanwhile, I still have the rest of my life moving around me.  This includes driving lessons, organising stuff with friends, chores, and dealing with my dads issues. That last one is the killer. I love him, and he needs someone to talk to about his problems, but it really can’t be me, especially right before exams. He has PTSD and life hasn’t treated him well. Most nights he’ll burst into my room without knocking and tell me something random from his past before leaving, only to come back in 10 minutes later to continue the story. It kills me because I love him and want to help, but I always have to try and subtly get him to stop because I have to work. It doesn’t ever solve the issue and I generally just end up having to catch up during school time during my lunch times and stuff. That’s not an option with exams, so I ended up telling him to “fuck off” on the third time he in in about an hour. He was really take aback and dinner was really awkward cis he was literally holding back tears and made sure he had a good shout at me over the incident.\n\nI really should have given some more obvious hints before bursting, but I’m kinda stressed and I’m just not sure anymore. What are you guys’ thoughts?",

      "description": "Hi all who decide to read. First time poster here in AITA, but I feel like I'm going crazy and need some insight.\n\nHeres some background:\n\nMy boyfriend(M23) and I(F22) have been together for over 4 years. Back in October 2018 we moved states and got an apartment with his childhood/best friend(M20s). Let's call him C. I've only met and sparsely spoke with C so most of my knowledge of him has been through my bf. Theyve been friends forever so I figured he'd be a decent dude.\n\nJump forward to us all living together. We have a kinda small 2 bed 1 bath apartment. My bf and I in one room and he in the other. The only downside is how small our kitchen is. There's hardly room for 2 people to be in there at once and we have like zero counterspace.\n\nAnyways, I soon realized that C is super fucking messy. Which I wouldn't really have a problem with if he cleaned up after himself like at all. Cause I'm a messy person too but I grew up in a household where if you made a mess, you cleaned it up as soon as you could. Common decency when living with other people right? \n\nThis situation happens almost everyday. Im usually the first up in the morning to drink coffee and read in peace. I also clean the kitchen almost every morning. And by that I mean: load the dishwasher, handwash pots and pans, wipe down the counters and stove top and sweep. It maybe takes 20 minutes. No big deal at all. That is until later that night C comes in and makes the biggest mess. I'm talking pots and pans left on the stove with burned food sitting in them, 10 different bottles of spices on the counters, burned food and stuff all over the stove stop and counters I just cleaned earlier. Plus half the sink is full. You get the picture.\n\nSo when the kitchen is like this and I want to make food or basically do anything, I literally have to clean all this shit up because our kitchen is that small.\n\nAfter the first month of this I was so done. My boyfriend could definitely tell how upset this made me and tried to do whatever he could to help. But what I want is C do be a damn adult and clean up after himself. Is that so much to ask for? Do I really have to ask him to clean his own messes? My bf and I do all the other cleaning in the apartment as well. We vacuum and clean the bathroom and take the garbage out.\n\nThis is turning into a rant but I wanted to give as much info as possible. Do you think I'm being unreasonable for wanting to live in a clean place? I'm so tired of cleaning up after him and it's come to the point where my bf literally has to tell him to clean but even then it's half assed and we clean again shortly after.\n\nWhat are your thoughts reddit? Please tell me if I'm in the wrong and just need to suck it up. I honestly have no idea at this point. Thanks for reading",

One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"",

She had her reasons, and I understood why it happened but it was still kind of out of the blue and it left me really hurt and insecure, and I made that clear to her. Recently, we've been talking again, and she mentioned she was driving up to my city (about 2 hours away from where she lives) for a hockey game. She wasn't going with anyone so I told her I would join her for old times sake, with the implication being that we were going as friends. I still have feelings for her and was going to try and use last night to rekindle something between us, but I've also been talking to other people since we broke up. So Sarah and I are at the game, and it's going fine, and I decide to take a picture of the view and send it to a female coworker who I have become friendly with since our breakup. This is someone who Sarah is aware of and was jealous/insecure about while we were dating. I never really talked with this person outside of work while Sarah and I were dating, out of respect for Sarah, and I only got her number after we had broken up. But Sarah sees that I'm sending her a picture and she flips out and wouldn't talk to me and ended up leaving early. We've been texting since and she told me that was a dickheaded move by me to text this person in front of her. AITA?",

      "description": "My wife and I recently moved to a small town in Pennsylvania, and we've always lived in cities prior to this. We just had two episodes in the past two months where random strangers lashed out at us in public for not letting them go first. She is Asian and I am white and we are in out thirties. She is getting self conscious that this may be happening because we are an interracial couple in a largely white community. I am wondering if there is just a greater expectation in small towns that younger people give older adults a wide berth and let them go first? \n\nThe first episode happened while we were leaving a restaurant. My wife was leaving through a glass door that opened out, and there was a women who looked about 65 years old on the other side. My wife went through first because the door opened out and then held it for the woman. The woman scolded her saying to \"learn some manners.\" I was several people behind, and it looked like my wife was there alone. I caught right up and asked the woman what happened. She told us, \"She should learn some manners and let me go first.\" I told her to lighten up, shrugged it off, and we left. \n\nThe second episode happened today. We were leaving a business while another woman also looking about 65 years old was walking up the path in the opposite direction to us. She was walking slowly as if she might have had arthritis or some other condition that made it difficult for her to get around. We were walking quickly and we cut diagonally in front of her to get to our car, passing about three feet in front of her. She was walking so slowly though that she did not have to slow down on account of us. In fact, if she were to turn towards the door she were headed for rather than walking straight down the right hand side of the sidewalk, she would have had an unobstructed path. She scoffed as we went by.  It was almost like a hiss. We looked back at her out of surprise, and she was glaring at us over her shoulder. \n\nIn all of our years living in various cities, while we have put up with our share of rudeness, we have never experienced anything like this. Is there some unwritten small town code that we should be giving older adults a wide birth and always let them go first? \n\nI like to think it might just be that these are nasty, self centered people who we encountered, or maybe we are just inconsiderate city people on the sidewalk, but I don't know. I know there are a fair share of people who are openly racist here. In my work it's not remarkable or uncommon to see people with nazi and white supremacist tattoos and I know there are some kkk members around here. Knowing that they are there is one thing, but somehow it would bother me more if that is why people have lashed out. ",

      "description": "So to preface this, I accidentally broke a SDCC mermaid mermicorno that belongs to my sister. It was given to her as a gift and she loves the thing. \nMe, my mom and sister just came back home from the movies. I had to use the bathroom for a bit when I hear my mom telling me through the door that I need to change the bucket water that we use to clean the dogs pee with. So after I get out I do as she asks. I empty out the bucket into the toilet, and flush it down. Here’s where the fuck up begins. I open the shower door of the bathtub to replace the water and close the door a little harder than expected. The bathroom is right next to my sisters room. Apparently I closed it hard enough that the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom shook a little and what was on the shelves fell. At first I’m totally unaware of what just happened, but then she starts banging the wall and crying her heart out. “You just destroyed my limited edition mermicorno!” , she says as I see that part of the tail had broken off. My mother rushes into the room to comfort her and I’m just standing by the doorway as I’m watching her sob some more, eventually I can’t take much more of it so I just leave. After a few more minutes of hearing her heart wrenching sobs, the more and more I feel like shit. My mom comes out of the room and gives me the most accusing look. Apparently she’s told me time and time again that I shouldn’t close the bathtub door so hard because the wall shakes, but I sincerely can’t remember them telling me this. I was replacing some dog pads at this point and I just lose it as I scream at the tops of my lungs explaining that I feel like shit over what I had just done. I just closed a door, how could I have known this would happen?! I didn’t want to break this priceless toy of hers. My mom tells me to go fuck myself. I tried doing some homework to try to focus my mind on something else but I just become sort of catatonic at this point. A few minutes later I hear my mom talking on the phone, telling whoever she was taking to that “I know he’s my son, but he’s a fucking piece of shit...” it trails of because I can’t and don’t want to hear the rest of it. I just left the apartment and I’m writing this to just get outside the house. I tried looking up her toy to try to find a replacement. It’s sold out everywhere and the one copy is available on eBay for 800 dollars. It was genuinely an accident, and I may have been careless, but I feel like an asshole anyway.",

He really wants to be in our friend group, though I don’t want him to for numerous reasons.\n\n\nHe is extremely annoying and says dead memes over and over again literally seconds after he said it the first time. He also pretends to be suicidal and uses it to manipulate people (at least that’s what I believe). He’ll also make “jokes” about “I’m gonna kill myself lololol”.  He says “Coochie” every single day, and makes my friend (who is a girl) very uncomfortable. Even after we tell him, please stop, he’ll literally scream it in someone else’s ear, still making her uncomfortable. Since we’re in the subject of uncomfortable, he touches her in ways that she tells me make her feel uncomfortable. No, he doesn’t rape her or anything, but like touching her back and jabbing her in the side very hard and forcibly. This is a game that me and her like to play where we’ll play punch each other back and forth, and he do jab each other’s sides sometimes, but he takes it to a new level. We think he likes her. He’s also the type of person to say “owo”  and think it’s hilarious. I tell him to stop, and he’ll call me a hypocrite about it and acts like a privileged brat.\n\n\nSome people think I’m being rude to him, and that I should just let him be friends with us, but I don’t want him to be.

      "description": "I'm at sixth form. An assembly finished and the teacher running it started to dismiss only the front row. I got up too early and this prompted him to yell at me to sit back down. The most I did was angrily tell him \"I heard you the first time\" (stupid twat doesn't understand the concept of redundancy because he gave me the same order twice in a row in direct succession. Either that or short-term memory loss, I guess). Beyond that, I failed to show more of a spine.\n\nHe then treated me condescendingly and I just did what he demanded because of my crippling inability to do the right thing and stand up for myself. I regret going along with his demands (it was partially because I was expecting him to have something else to say to me when he was done making me sit down, but then he didn't have anything else to talk to me about. I was probably going to tear into him in that case). Now I feel like shit... I'm 18, I'm too old to be letting others treat me wrong (because I have plenty of unpleasant stories involving that...). In all honesty, I'm hoping some other opportunity comes around for me to deny him what he wants and probably insult him too.\n\nReasons why his method of only allowing a few rows to go at a time is bull:\n\nA. It does little to nothing to prevent crowding compared to if we all left at once.\nB. It's unfair to let some go sooner than others, especially since he always does it in the same order.\nC. Everyone else bullies me (calling me a name I hate) so I feel I deserve to leave before them (and what's one extra person?).\n\n(Another action of his that serves as another indicator of how cuckoo and/or ego-stroking this person just might be: there was this other time where I once started to leave a room via one of the two doors, but he insisted I go back and leave through the other door.)",

      "description": "   So basically my boyfriend's car has been broken down for a few months. We've been saving to fix it, but it needs a lot of work.  Mine has become our main transportation for both of us and he's contributed 25% of the payment since we're using it only. I have no problem driving him around because he contributes to the payment, but his family is becoming an issue to me. For the record, I like his family, but they do not help him out in any way. His mother mainly loves to mooch for everything she can and never returns the favor. He's always bending over backwards to help her out and it's not been an issue, but it is now since we're using my car. \n\n   We always have to pick several members of his family up for any family events because hardly anyone has cars, which adds an extra 30 minute drive to the location. Last week his mother got dropped off at our work asking us to take her home after I had already told BF, \"No, I'm tired and want to go home already.\" So we had to drive an extra 20 minutes just to take her home after working an 11 hour shift. He says we have to because he pays part of my payment, but I feel like that doesn't cover his family's expenses and they're taking advantage of us. They never cover gas money or do anything for him/us. \n\n   I feel that if I still pay 75% of my payment on a car that's in my name then I should get the most say in where we go. I never had an issue when his car was working, but now I'm running the miles up on my car that I've put much more money into over the years than he has over the past few months. Also he's not on my insurance, so I have to do all the driving because he's not covered. We had a fight last night because I said I wasn't taking any family members anywhere else until they covered their expenses at least. I feel less like a part of the family and more of a taxi driver. He brought up the fact I help my family out when they need it, but I've always been compensated when I have and I feel as it's different because I've never seen a dime or any offer of helping us with anything from his side. \n\n  I've been told I'm being selfish because it's \"family\" but I feel like you still can't use people over and over again because you're related? So Am I the asshole for not wanting to help anymore? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Throwaway account due to activity on other subs.\n\n",

      "description": "Our dad mellowed out quite a bit after I was born but back when my brother Jeff was younger, he was a real prick, as Jeff would put it. \n\nJeff said Dad would knock him around when he drank (which was all the time), would constantly yell and berate both him and Mom, and was just an all around shitty human. \n\nI’m not sure what happened when I was born but dad mellowed out a lot after I was born. Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he’s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I’m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn’t entirely Jeff’s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn’t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with “that asshole’s” funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn’t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven’t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I’m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn’t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom’s sake?\n\n\n",

She ended up ghosting me.\n\nBasically, there was this girl who I became friends with during high school. As we grew closer together, I didn’t think much of it. We were friends, and nothing more.\n\nAs we talked more and got to know eachother more, we began to hang out more frequently and would watch Netflix together and hang out. After about two and a half years of being close friends, i began to develop feelings and wanted to have something more with her.\n\nI held back though, recognizing that this was an important friendship and not wanting to mess anything up. As time went by, she stared wanting to hang out more and I took that as a sign of her maybe sharing my interest. One night when we were hanging out, I told her how I was feeling, and she told me she didn’t feel the same way and I was okay with that. I tried to give her space, but realized that I couldn’t get over it due to the amount of time and effort I had invested into her. I went back and told her what was going on, which prompted her to call me crazy and ghost me...\nAITA, or am I justified in telling her the truth?",

I am already a little reluctant, as he has been caught multiple times for cheating, and has asked me to help him cheat multiple times too. I can't really risk us having the same homework so I agreed to explaining a couple questions without sharing anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI set the time, and place (my dorm for my continence) which he agreed to. Fast forward to the actual time and he does not show up. I normally get a little salty when things get late, and I get that it's an issue with me. However, 5 minutes in and he doesn't show up. I leave him a message, no reply. 15 minutes later, I tell him it's off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNormally, I think it's a pretty un-asshole thing. But given that I set the time and place both to my convenience (which he agreed to), I am a little uncertain.

      "description": "My SO lost a very close friend she grew up with in a traffic accident late 2017. Riding a bicycle she was run over by a large truck and died in hospital. The shock and grief was deepened by the fact she was pregnant. Her due date was to be two weeks earlier than that of our second daughter. My SO and her closest friend would have shared their experiences of their babies arrivals like they did so  much else. \n\nI commute to work by motorcycle and use earphones to listen to podcasts and speak with people while riding. I feel that it is no different to listening to music or speaking handsfree in a car. In my opinion visual checks of mirrors/over the shoulder are the only way to be 100% safe. \n\nShe wants me to stop using earphones and says that because she lost her friend like that I should be more willing to respect her wishes. AITA for refusing? The journey is 45 minutes and I enjoy listening to interesting podcasts. Why should I give up something I enjoy doing every day?\n\nFurther relevant info: I crashed the motorcycle last week due to a strong gust of wind blowing me sideways so that I was unable to avoid a curb. Apart from being unaware of the danger posed by wind I was riding safely and within the speed limits. I skinned my knee and elbow and was pretty shaken. The bike needed some minor repairs. My darling SO said I had behaved recklessly and brought up other examples of reckless behaviour such as a close call with a truck in India in 2013. The guy was driving like a maniac. I don’t think I am particularly reckless but I am certainly not as risk averse as some. ",

      "description": "Mom has had blood pressure problems the past days so our doctor made her monitor her pressure with some portable device today. She is supposed to go there tomorrow and turn it in to get the data analyzed.\n\nThere have been incidents before where she urged me to ride her to the ER at night because she wasn't feeling good, had some issues etc.\n\nMost of the times though it was nothing to worry about,she could leave after a quick examination.\nThe doctors give us a lecture in a roundabout way to not come to the ER at night if it can wait till tomorrow (not USA btw, we have public health care)\n\nJust like today. Same thing again. She comes to my room at night and says \"zsnes I'm not feeling too good my blood pressure is super high can you get me to the ER?\" \"Are you sure? Wait till tomorrow you have your appointment anyway with our own doctor\". She got kinda irritated and angrily told me it's fine,she'll ride the car herself. \"People get paralyzed from stuff like that you know\" she said.\n\nI just sighed and asked why she has to be like that. Anyway I still get up and reluctantly prepare to drive her (admittedly I was  annoyed and didn't hide it but I kept my mouth shut afterwards.\n\nSo we get to the hospital at like 1AM. After half an hour my mom comes out and asks me for her bag. She brought her own blood pressure machine with her and apparently needed it. I give it to her and follow her to the doctors room. The doctor tells me her blood levels are normal, no abnormalities. \n\nMy mom was kinda confused at this point and tried showing the doctor that her own machine showed a much higher and more dangerous value. \n\nTurns out the unit on my mom's device was a total different one than the regular ones, so she read the numbers totally wrong and assumed they were worse.\nDr. just told us to get a new machine and call a non emergency hotline first next time.\n\nSo we leave and my mom seems a little embarrassed, because she starts trying to explain how it was before and she did in fact feel bad. I tell her it's okay since I only want to get back to my bed at this point. \n\nAt home I want to remind her to make sure she differentiates between serious emergencies and regular \"I'm sick and not feeling good\" occasions. Because I do love my mom more than anything and I get worried just like this time. But because it happens more often I'm scared that I won't take her seriously if something worse might happen another time. Also to not burden hospital staff.\n\nShe got really upset and explained she did feel bad. I only told her she could have waited until the next morning, since there is a safe appointment anyway. In her mind that sounded like I was apparently only annoyed because I had to drive her (which isn't my issue) so she starts telling me I'm ungrateful and all the things she does for me get unnoticed. Both just went to bed after this\n\n\nWell then reddit: am I the asshole?",

But I gave her the password anyways since I know there’s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that’s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don’t really care that she’s found these things, but it’s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I’m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy.

Whenever they need help or to talk to me I will help them, but it still gets annoying.\n\nMy friends is a fairly normal person, fairly cute even and a good artist. But she comes from a broken home, as far as I’m aware her real dad left her and her step dad just doesn’t help her and her mom is a recovering alcoholic (who will probably go back to alcoholism, her Mom tried to quit multiple times) who constantly puts her down. Her Mom constantly insults friend for her minor imperfections to the point where she is afraid of telling her about any problems she has. \n\nMy friend constantly gets bullied in school and a lot of her friends are generally bad friends, they insult her a lot, act like huge hypocrites (criticizing friends great art and then saying friend couldn’t criticize her art for one of them.), and won’t try and help her with her problems.\n\nWhy she came to me with her problems, I don’t know, but she did. She started talking about situations where her mom yelled at her and getting panic attacks at school (and situations where those interlap) so of course I talked to her. Eventually I gave her my discord and told her to talk to me whenever she needed to.\n\nAt first it was fine, she talked about her problems and I helped, but then it got worse. She constantly talked about worse situations and I don’t know how to help, especially in some of the worse situations (she recently stabbed a kid with a pencil twice and then stabbed herself a bunch) and it’s honestly getting pretty draining. Am I the asshole for kind of getting sick of it all?",

      "description": "Let me start my saying my husband and I have a great relationship. Other than this small issue, everything else is perfect.\n\n My husband and I have been having issues with porn for a while now. I use to be completely fine with porn watching (as I occasionally watch it myself), until I learned the extent to which my husband watched it. He looked at it everyday/multiple times a day, saving hundreds and hundreds of pornographic images and or videos to his phone or laptop. He doesn’t jerk off to it, just endless amount of scrolling. What really got to me was the photos of girls that weren’t nude at all. Fully clothed women and some photos of just their faces. This created an insecurity on my end. It wasn’t a trust issue (I know he’d never cheat), it was more of personal insecurity thing (did he want me to look like those women?)\n\nIn one heated argument he ended up deleting his reddit app containing tons of porn to make me feel better (he hasn’t re-downloaded the app, although he still goes on reddit through the web browser). In another heated argument, I deleted the Instagram app on his phone since it was filled will half naked girls. I felt guilty after and told him to re-download it. He hasn’t since (but still looks at it through the web browser occasionally). \n\nThis wasn’t affecting our sex life at all and I know men watching porn is normal, so I didn’t want him to quit it completely. We came to a compromise of: he’s able to look and watch porn on his own time as long as he tried to lessen the amount he watched and didn’t save it onto his phone where I can see (we use each other’s phones frequently). \n\nI understand I may have some deep rooted insecurity issues from my former long term ex who cheated on me several times and manipulated me into thinking I was just being a “crazy suspicious girlfriend.” I’ve tried to become more accepting of my husbands porn watching, ex. watching porn with him and checking out sexy girls online to make me more comfortable of the fact. Everyone knows if you keep something taboo in a relationship it’s only going to get worse. \n\nNow to the fight we had the other day, he wanted to know if he could save animated pornographic images to his phone as they are a form of art to him. I told him I was still uncomfortable with him saving any type of porn to his phone (even if it’s animated). He got upset saying I restrict him from doing things he enjoys. \n\nThis hurt me and I felt bad he felt this way about me. AITA here?",

      "description": "Hi, I am a first year student at uni, going for a minor in film. This was my first film project with a partner and I was honestly excited to maybe make a friend from this. \n\nFirstly, we wrote the script together, but a lot of my inputs weren’t taken. I didn’t mind because I thought that her ideas were better and she was technically the director as assigned by the professor. Because I wasn’t the director, I tried to contribute in other ways, only to be ignored. I asked her if I could work the cameras or take a lead role in the film, both of which were denied as she had already casted her friends for those without telling me. Our professor allowed her to cast an upperclassmen to do most of the filming. We didn’t need any special mics for the project so I was really all out of jobs besides props and doing the storyboards.\n\nI did the storyboards well, and I already had some props prepared. We needed some wine bottles + glasses and other basic party things. I bought the party things, and my mom owns some fancy wine glasses and drinks a lot of wine so I was all set.\n\nYesterday my partner texts me saying that I don’t need to bring in the props. I thought she meant for today, as the scenes we were shooting didn’t require props.\n\nI come in and she tells me that the props are all handled as another one of her friends got them for her. I honestly felt really sad and frustrated, I got those props for the film and wanted badly to contribute, as I was her partner. I also felt lonely because I don’t have any friends in this school and she would constantly excitedly babble with her friends while I would try to contribute things to the conversation, but it was clear that this was an established friend group and I wasn’t very welcome.\n\nI told her that I was upset because I had gotten the props already, and that I didn’t have anything to do in this project. Her reaction was pretty flippant, assigning me the job of checking the time, as one of her actresses had to go to her job in an hour or so.\n\nI felt really hurt, This is supposed to be a partnership.

      "description": "I [M21] was at my friends [F20] house for a party. We were drinking, people were leaving until it was just me and her left. We were talking on the couch, started making food, and then she invited some friends she hasn’t seen in a while over. Three guys came over and as soon as they got there, one of the guys kept telling me how I need to “get out and go home because you know what’s going down.” I never met these guys before and thought they were just playing and being drunk until the big friend decked me and I went flying into the wall. The friend in the back started screaming what are you doing?? On the floor, clearly not in a good position to start a fight, I went to leave and the big friend pushed me out the door and I again went flying into the wall outside the apartment. Then went to my nearby friends place, and called the cops from my friends phone. I then went back because my shirt, wallet, keys, and phone were still at her place. Outside her door my shirts thrown in the middle of the hallway. I slowly open the door, and was told to get lost because “stuff was going down.” As I was walking down the hallway I hear, “Hey pussy want your stuff back?”. So I go back and they throw my stuff on the ground. I thought I could hear my friend crying/in distress in the room but I could also be mistaken. So then I called the cops, told them I thought there was a rape occurring at that address. They show up to knock on the door and there’s no answer. \n\nIt’s the morning after, I for whatever reason couldn’t get much sleep last night. Woke up to texts from a different friend told me that it was wrong of me to do that because my friend was underage drinking, that guy was her ex-boyfriend and everything was fine. \n\nHaven’t heard from the friend despite me texting her. AITA for calling the cops? How should I’ve handled the situation, I thought about taking the guys on (wasn’t sober myself) but it was 3 on 1 and I was in no state to fight given how drunk I was.

      "description": "Hello everyone, first time writing on here, so I hope you all can give me good advice. English isn’t my native language so I’m sorry if it’s not written grammarly correctly.\n\nI live in The Netherlands and I have a friend who we’ll call Ava. She’s been my friend for over 6 years and we’ve met in school. Last year, I took a break from our friendship because she got a new boyfriend who we will call Callum.\n\nSince January of 2019 we have started having contact again and we’ve been hanging out a lot. In the mean time she has got a new best friend named Jess who has a boyfriend named Tom.\n\nLast week I got a text from Ava saying “She fucked up”. She told me that Jess and Tom\nbroke up and she had kissed Tom. Jess and Callum figured out and got so mad that Callum broke up with Ava. Jess threatened Ava through texts and they haven’t seen each other since at school since they’re avoiding each other.\n\nShe only said she’d kissed with Tom but Callum and Jess are saying they had slept in bed together. I hung out with Ava last thursday and we talked a bit about it and Ava said she’d planned to break up with Callum and that she’d want a relationship with Tom. \n\nTwo days ago I talked to Callum to hear the full story and he send pictures of what he found (as evidence that Ava slept with Tom). I honestly don’t know who to believe and I feel like Ava only has me as her friend who supports her.\nEverytime I tried to confront Ava about what she did, she tries to get out of it by changing the subject. \n\nBut I honestly feel so bad for supporting her and I’m scared that Ava is lying to me and using me for her support at the moment.\n\nAm I the asshole for supporting her even though she’s the one who fucked up?\n\nTLDR; My friend Ava kissed (and maybe slept with) the ex boyfriend of her best friend and I’m basically supporting her because I pity her.\n",

      "description": "Ok, obviously sorry for formatting bc I'm on mobile, but i needed to get all of this off my chest. \n\nThe other day I walked up to my house after class with a couple of my friends, and there was a really nice car in our driveway. My family is middle class in my dad is shopping for a new car so I was wondering if it was his, but it was nothing like the one he was planning on getting. So anyway I look at it and all the plates are from Ohio ( I'm in southern Michigan) so I instantly knew it wasn't him after seeing that. I wasn't suspicious at first, just because he's been over at her house a couple of times because he's helping my dad designed the jeep that he wants to get. \n\nSo I walk inside and we have our mud room right next to the kitchen, and then through two doors hazard laundry room. The doors are the outdoorsy Style with big glass windows, I don't really know how else to describe them they're really old. But anyway there's curtains over them but you can still see through barely. Especially when it's sunny outside in the window in the room is shining through. Anyway I saw Two Silhouettes back there and instantly knew who it was. At first I was wondering what what's happening, but then I heard the sound of a bell p.m. put on. Now I'm a guy and I'm also really skinny so I could on a lot of belts in my days so I know what it sounds like😂😅 \n\nBut anyway I've been keeping it in for a couple of days, and I got really pissed off at her in an argument so I just told her that I knew, and next time I'll have to bring it to my dad. So I guess to rebuttal the question, am I the asshole for blackmailing my stepmom with the think that she's cheating on my dad?\n\nTldr: stepmom cheated on dad with their friend and now I'm blackmailing her essentially. \n\n",

      "description": "I have a group of girlfriends, most of which i have known since high school (about 20 years).  Recently (within the past year) I have been joining their group on social outings, birthday dinners, drinks, get togethers with the kids, etc.  At the beginning of November we all did a 5k together and went out to dinner that night.  Since then, I have been invited to ONE gathering, which included all the children and involved bringing food and gifts.  The rest of the ladies have gotten together at least six other times, including a New Year's gathering.  I have not been invited, and have seen multiple posts on fb about all the fun.  \n\nRecently one of the ladies posted about planning a trip and asking for recommendations.  I asked about the trip and she said I was welcome to come, giving me dates, hotels where they have reservations, etc.  I replied that I didn't know they were that far into the planning process and didn't want to intrude.  One of the ladies I am quite close to (exercising with her four days a week) and I told her I felt excluded.  She said they had planned the trip as a celebration of her upcoming divorce finalization (which she and I have discussed at length) and I SHOULD come and I shouldn't feel excluded.  I just dropped it at that time.  Two weeks later, same friends posting about an outing that I again wasn't invited to.  \n\nAt that point I unfriended them, thinking that they don't HAVE to invite me, and if I don't know about the outings then I won't feel excluded.  My closest friend texted me to ask why I unfriended them and I told her.  She said that they weren't intentionally excluding me and she didn't intend to hurt my feelings.  I told her I understood, and I didn't think she was doing anything wrong, I'm just protecting my feelings.  AITA for unfriending??\n\nTL;DR: my group of girlfriends keeps excluding me so I unfriended them so I wouldn't have to see what I'm missing. AITA??",

      "description": "So for backstory, I go to a homeschool co-op that meets once a week, and I'm only 13 so neither me nor my friends have cell phones with actual service. (Out phones are basically glorified Ipods.) \n\nMy mom and dad are very protective, and essentially keep me and my five siblings cooped up. Usually this would be fine, but for a major extravert seeing people other than family only once a week isn't near enough. All the kids but my oldest brother and sister, (19 and 17), aren't allowed on social media, and can't talk to *anyone* we don't know online, no public discord servers, no chat on games, no Reddit, YouTube, steam forums, et cetera. They also have a rule of no dating until 18.\n\n I eventually just gave up on no game chat because I'm an extrovert and it's painful not being able to talk to people. Making other people happy, telling them jokes, making them laugh, it's what makes me happy. So I started chatting in game. \n\nSo usually I go to bed and read on a Kindle tablet for a bit, but one night it was late and I was too tired to read. I started watching YouTube, and I loved it. I loved interacting in the comments, making jokes, just watching YouTubers. This lead me to discord servers, Reddit, online freinds, and webtoon. Overall, I've been pretty responsible with what I veiw online. There have been multiple times where my parents almost found out, but I just denied it because I'm a compulsive liar and kind of a pussycat when it comes to owning up. \n\nWhat makes this even worse is that I want to become a creator, making animations for YouTube, and illustrating for webtoon, but my parents obviously have a rule against that. I have a messed up sense of self worth, based on how many people know *of* me but don't *know* me. I want to make a difference outside of my friend group you know? Sooo, I've been drawing for a writer I met on webtoon behind their back. \n\nAnother thing about this that upsets me, there's a girl in my class who I think actually likes me, which is a first. (Up until now I haven't really been attractive to say the least, but I look better now.) and I really like her too. But if she ever asks me if I like her, I'll have to turn her down, because my parents wouldn't approve of it.\n\nTo be honest, I actually want my parents to find out at this point, but I can't bring myself to do it. And guys, this post actually isn't for self validation or anything, for the most part it's just to vent because I need to tell *someone.* I know that I'm at least a bit of an A-hole for it.",

      "description": "My niece is 10 years old, and steals from everybody. Not just little things either. A month ago she stole 180 dollars from my granddads wallet, before that it was a knife from the lockbox in my room, its been a long time thing. Shes had everything from a grounding to, to the police talking to her. Today I woke up and realised a necklace I bought my girlfriend for Christmas is gone. When I asked around about it everyone said \"oh I think I saw her hiding something\" or \"yeah she was wearing it but I didn't know it was yours\". Of course I dont go to her yet since shes in school. Instead I ask my sister if she knows where it is. Immediately I'm being yelled at. \"How do you know it was her!\", \"dont just get in my face and tell me my daughters a thief\", and my personal favorite \"your girlfriend didn't deserve it anyway\". I'm a very calm person for the most part, and I try really hard and manage to keep my composure. I'll have to go buy her a new gift now since I'll probably never find the necklace and now I cant stand being in the same room as my sister, but I feel like I'm the asshole for being upset about it all.\n\nTl;dr: my 10YO niece stole my girlfriends Christmas present, I got yelled at for asking about it, and now I'm upset.",

      "description": "A little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore?

We mostly use it to send each other memes or videos of each other drunk on the weekends for a laugh, but I would definitely say we have a crude to dark sense of humor and some of the stuff might be in poor taste. I wouldn’t say I have a “line” to be crossed, so to speak, on any of the jokes made. Until I found out I did. A mutual friend that had been added to the group recently, one who it wouldn’t bother me in the slightest if I never heard from again, decided a few months ago it would be funny to send some footage of what could be described as a hostage situation with a drug cartel I’m assuming. They had a man tied up with a bag over his head and they were slicing into his torso with a knife. I’m talking like you can see the fat under his skin type slicing. Since this is Snapchat the video plays automatically when you open it so I had no choice whether I saw it or not. I’ll never get that image out of my head, this man was being tortured. So I pretty much said that if this is what the group chat was going to turn in to then they should let me know so I can leave, I would’ve preferred to have not seen that. It was met with some pretty heavy backlash, things like “you’re being a baby” “you have a weak stomach” things like that. I got in a big argument with everyone, it seemed *insane* to me that I was the one being looked at like an asshole and weak for saying I would leave the group over that and didn’t want to see it. My friends like to act like nothing bothers them or grosses them out (maybe it’s true, I don’t know), I don’t think they’re bad people. Whatever. It blew over, haven’t had anything like that since. Fast forward to yesterday and they were talking about some gross skin related stuff, which is more tame, but I still think is gross. A reasonable thing to find disgusting I think. So I literally just sent a picture of a grossed out face in response and it blew up again “what are you gonna leave the group? Does your tummy hurt?”. I explained that it’s not the same thing and we got in an argument that eventually ended. This all happened early in the morning, so when the member who sent the torture video before read the argument he sent the video **again** just to be an asshole. I acted like it didn’t bother me this time because I had already seen it, but I thought that was so disrespectful. Everyone else is acting like I’m the asshole for making a big deal out of not wanting to see things like that, but I think any normal person wouldn’t want to see videos like that. I feel like it’s crazy for me to be seen as the one in the wrong here. ",

      "description": "Im working for a big company in europe which basically sells shitty cheap stuff. The stores are constantly understaffed so they have to do lots of sending their employees around to cover shifts or \"situations\". \"Situations\" can be everything from having like having 30 pallets which need to be dismantled as they are brimful with packages filled with ther stuff we sell. Other \"situations\" were like when we had rats because our big deliverer couldnt keep his storehouses in check.\nAtm we have the first \"situation\".\nPeople are working overhours to get it fixed. Yesterday i had a 9 hour shift and today was my free day. My boss asked wheter I could help out today and I said no. Im workin there as a part time but most of the time they demand extra hours for you because the workload needs to be handled. \nToday my boss called and asked me to help out in another store. Sleepdrunkenly I agreed and after finding out i need like 2 hours to travel with by public means of transport for 5 hours work twice next week I went into the store and asked wheter I could switch with someone who has a car. \nI got screamed at by one coworker which was very unprofessional imo and my boss immediatly put on an annoyed face and commented how its life experience and he traveled far more for far less hours.\nThen he told me I my workforce is like 50 percent max and Im just a \"freeloader\" who wants his hours and his healthcare quoting me from a few months ago. \nThen he told me he never even complained that I come to work \"high\" in the mornings ( which is not true. I have very bad sleeping habits and I use weed in the evening to relax) \nHe argued my illness ( Morbus Crohn ) is something I always cry about and that I have 0 Teamspirit and every other coworker is better than me and showing more will to work. \nHe told me if my illness is true im not able to work this job and should get a job in an office ( thats actually something i really would like tbh).\nI asked him why hes not firing me if hes so disappointed in me and he argued that he cant simply find someone to fill the spot with. \nAfterwards we stopped discussing and I went into the store to grab a sheet of paper and wrote my termination. \nIm mentally and physically done and yet I feel bad for leaving as a lot of work is before them and my landlord is my friend and I need to find a new job quickly but apprently im a shit worker. My landlord told me he could understand me and that I shouldnt apologize to him but I dont wanna use my friendship status for extras. \nSo AITA for quitting on the spot after being told what I was told only because I wanted to not travel far for little hours which would have been extra hours anyway. \nIm really unsure wheter im just a big baby and should man up or wheter I stood my ground and left b4 worse fallouts could have happened.\nI really desire to into a clinic for mental health right now tbh.",

Rather than have the service at his church it was hers, we wrote it off as her wanting to be surrounded by friends so we didn’t protest. She then cut his first wife my mom’s mother from the list of people he would be joining in heaven, choosing to include someone that he had never met to be included over his first wife. In addition to the sleight of people the how was cruel they had her niece do a passage instead of my uncle, his son, who loves scripture. Finally we looked at the program and they took every chance they could to write us out as if we didn’t care. No mention of my father or uncle as pallbearers or my mother’s eulogy but hey at least I got recognized as a pallbearer. After that we went to the lung afterwards and they cut us from talking with the rest of her family putting all of his original family tables away where they had to set up when we arrived despite their being cutlery up other places. Following that I decided to take every opportunity to sever ties including boycotting the annual trip up to there for thanksgiving.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Background: We've been together for ten years, been married for the past five. (We're in our late twenties, early thirties.)\nMy in-laws disliked me from day one, trying to make it work with them never had the effect my husband and I had hoped for. There have been times they didn't even talk to her son, two to three years in total (petty reasons). My husband always stands up for me, so that's never been an issue between us.\n\nA couple of weeks ago they asked him how we handle the \"dog problem\" when we're going on vacation. He told them how it is: we always take him with us, usually hiking and car camping.\n\nA few days go by and my husband tells me his dad invited him on a trip to the US, he'll let him pick all the places he wants to go, he'll pay for everything.\nWe're from Europe and money is a little tight so it's a big thing. \n\nPart of me now wishes my husband had said no, since they had first asked about the both of us...and their \"solution\" is to invite him only instead of finding something suitable for our situation?\n\nNow for the stupid part:\nI wouldn't even have wanted them to pay for anything anyway, I would've probably declined any offer. We don't get along, I am simply not the woman they would've wanted for their son.\nThey weren't there when their son needed them, he had to take a student loan (which we're still paying off) because his dad didn't feel it was his obligation to support his son who's the first academic in his family. My in-laws aren't filthy rich but they're quite well-off. It's their money and they shall do with it whatever they please. \nOffering my husband a trip that'll cost them a couple of thousand Euros after they have just recently re-established the connection (after a year of silence, see above) just gives me a weird feeling, besides being kind of hurt because he accepted without hesitation.\n\nHis mom has been spoiling him ever since they're in touch again, too. She sent him several three-figure amounts of money for Christmas, his birthday etc. It's a little much and unusual. \nI'm all for loving parents but I'm afraid they might hold it against him some day.\nHis whole family is messed up because of money - e.g. his dad and uncles don't talk anymore because of their dad's heritage.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to be thrilled about the whole thing?\n\n\n\nTl; dr: My usually cheap in-laws invited my husband to an expensive trip to the U.S. and I'm having a hard time feeling happy for him.",

      "description": "Bit of backstory.\n\nMy wife’s family are the definition of toxic. They’re self centered, self serving, low intelligence, hate speech spewing. “Family\nOver everything” because they heard it in a movie once, garbage people.\n\nAfter 10 longyears I’ve finally made her see the toxicity that these people really are and visits have become scarce. \n\nThey all revolve around “grams house”. And gram has been sick for the last 8 months. Triple-bypass, lungsfilling up with fluid and so on. Gram is obviously dying.\n\nNow Gram for the most part is a good person, she raised the 6 kids that have caused all the toxicity but I’ll let that go. \n\nSo we got a call last night that gram is most likely not going to live thru the next 2 days. My personal opinion is good. Let her die, she’s 95 years old and still babysits 4 kids that these scumbags just dump on her because they don’t wanna be bothered. She’s still paying for her genuinely medically diagnosed lunatic daughter living in the house. And her absolutely vile human being of a son who just mooches. And every time he’s threatened to be thrown out, he just holds onto the “mom won’t let you” card. And he wins. \n\nNow I’m sitting in the hospital waiting room, my wife is in the icu with her grandmother, and she’s found out that her mother and uncle have decided gram should die at home. But they’re not telling anyone. \n\nMind you the 29 year old grandson who’s given up his whole life to take care of his grandmother lives there as well. Pays his own way and has taken care of gram, crazy daughter (his mom) and scumbag son (uncle) his whole life.  He’s supposed to get the house after she dies. But if she dies in the house he’ll have to disclose it to every potential buyer (we live in a state with that law), have to clean up the mess, and have to deal with his crazy mother losing her shit because she saw her mother dead. \n\nBut thru all this, I just don’t give a fuck. I’m here for my wife because she needs support, but\nEven that is hard to muster sometimes. Most of\nThe support she needs is to deal with her scum bag family. I told her that the second I see her being dragged into drama, I’m physically pulling her out of it and we’re leaving. \n\nTL:DR - wife’s grandma is dying and I genuinely don’t care\n\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "My neighbor (62), and long time family friend, is dying of stage 4 bone cancer. He is a confirmed bachelor, and is living in the house he grew up in.  Both of his parents passed in that house, and he would like to go the same way.  Normally, there would be no problem with this.  There are home heath aids for a reason, and I dont mind taking food over to him semi-regularly.  However, his home I recently learned, is not fit for human habitation. \n\nNo, you're thinking, but OP if he's been a family friend since before you were born how were you never in his house before? Well, because cats and I like breathing. But seriously, he never hosted gatherings and when extra folding chairs or the like were needed he would go over and get them and bring them back. He's a super private person and has always been well groomed and presentable.\n\nHis health took a turn for the for the worse about a year and a half ago when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Chemo weakend him but he kept going. ~5 mo ago he got the news that it spread all through his body in the form of bone (and I think lymph node) cancer.  Stage 4. He doesn't have much medical background and doesn't want to know, but I don't think he has more than a month or three left. He can barely hold a conversation much less go upstairs to his bedroom without being out of breath.  He'll fight to the end. \n\nHerein lies the problem: I always knew he had a lot of stuff, he would talk about it but I didn't realize how bad it was. I found out how bad when I dropped of food and he couldn't get up out of bed to put it away himself. The kitchen sink doesn't drain, there was a water leak in the upstairs bath and now there is two inches of mold hanging from the downstairs bathroom ceiling, the bathroom likely hasn't been cleaned in years with shit all over the toilet. He doesn't take the garbage out and there's even mold on the egg shells. I ended up nauseous and bordering on an asthma attack after being in there for 2min. There are paths to get through the rooms but they are narrow - I'm sure a fire marshal would have a fit. I'm concerned about his basic hygiene at this point. When I saw all this it was 6:30pm and he admitted he hadn't been out of bed or eaten yet that day.\n\nWere he not dying, I wouldn't hesitate to call the county and get him help for the hoarding.  But since he is, which is more important: his mental health or what physical health he has left? A week in the hospital in December yeilded anxiety attacks from being separated from his stuff.  So, would I be the asshole for calling and getting him sent to a county home for the short remainder of his life? Or do I leave him to die in peace in his filth?",

I have a fairly small group of people who're even aware about it being today, and most of them were fine with it being just another day. Hell, acknowledging the fact and wishing well for it was fine by me, and they were treating it as such. We did, however, have one or two dissenters. \"Oh, but today has to be special,\" and shit like that. I can appreciate the sentiment once or twice, but with how often they kept pressing it, it was pissing me off a bit. In the end, I did go off on them to a degree, simply saying something along the lines of, \"Look, if the person whose birthday it is wants it to be nothing special, is anyone else really in a position to say 'no, you can't have that?'\" This simply led to shock and one of the dudes who was fine with the original plan calling me a dick for bringing that up.\n\nI know in hindsight this sounds petty as hell and not unlike a call for validation, but the response I got from everyone involved has me wondering whether or not this genuinely was a bit of a dick move.",

      "description": "So I Was going to a small party event filled with old white people. A dinner party basically but without dinner. As we were walking up to their house I was kinda nervous cause I’m bad with social interaction and as I was walking to the door I noticed the door was open. I live in Georgia so most people don’t have screen doors or glass doors in front of their actual doors. I assumed that I could just walk through and so I stepped normally into their house and I learned the hard way that their was a pane of glass on hinges in front of their open door. So I walked straight through it, broke my glasses, got 3 small shards of glass stuck in my hand and shoulder, got a massive cut on my head from the glass from my eyeglasses, and may have gotten a small concussion.\n\nWhile as the hosts came rushing over and I was apologizing/crying instead of asking how the bleeding teenager was doing they said “Our door!” \n\nWeird flex but...it’s fine I guess\n\nAfter about 10 seconds they turned to me and instead of apologizing or asking how I was doing they said “why did you break it” I responded with “sorry I didn’t see it” it was pitch black out, foggy, the door was a solid pane of glass with a clear frame, and they must’ve used a lot of windex. So instead of getting me ynow a bandaid or some ice they immediately told us how much the door is and expected us to replace it for them. \n\nMy mom responded with “sure *host name* but could we get *my name* inside first he has a huge gash on his forehead” and they freaked out saying I was fine and that the door was the bigger issue here.\n\nWell we went home after about 10 minutes of me standing there at the party in awkward silence cause I clearly had glass in my forehead and we decided to just leave unannounced so we could ynow make sure I wasn’t seriously injured, and once we got home, took the shards of glass out, and made sure I was okay, we got an angry phone call from the host. I don’t remember the exact words but I remember the gist \n\n“BLAH BLAH BLAH *insert privileged white person problem* YOU BROKE OUR DOOR AND RUINED OUR PARTY BLAH BLAH BLAH THE PARTY HAD TO BE CANCELED BECAUSE OF YOU *insert standard 58 year old white person overdramatification* YOUR SON IS NO LONGER ALLOWED AT OUR HOUSE BLAH BLAH BOOK CLUB IS CANCELED”\n\nSo now not just these people but my parents also hate me cause they think I did it deliberately to get the party cut short since I didn’t want to go. Despite how many times I’ve told them it was an accident they’re super mad at me, didn’t invite me out to dinner with them, and are acting like I’m a huge asshole. Am I? I thought it was just an accident but everyone else is convinced otherwise. What do I do?",

      "description": "Jim (30 M) and I (28M) and I have known eachother since we were kids. He’s struggled with his mental health over the years, and I’ve always tried to be understanding and helpful, make allowances, be there for him etc. Because of his MH being a little unstable, he has never been my go to person for support, but I am definitely his. We were best friends all through our teenage years and well into our twenties.\n\nFor context- Jim failed out of college due to his MH, whereas I graduated and got a job in tech. My company is currently paying for me to get my masters over the next two years. He works for a small business doing admin at a 9-5 job.  I work very long hours. To add to that, with the studying at the moment, I’m dead in the water, I have no free days, most hours in my day are preplanned and filled with work or general life admin. Jim seems to have a lot more time on his hands, and was always a “night in” kinda guy so spends most evenings / weekends with his girlfriend watching tv. I honestly wish I had that kind of leisure time right now.\n\nCrux of the matter is, through a hectic schedule and lack of sleep I’ve slipped up a couple times with contact. Just a couple of phone calls, he’ll call for a catch up, I’ll be busy and tell him I’ll give him a call tomorrow, and then I forget.\n\nHe’s now sent me a very long letter, explaining that he feels my priorities in life are skewed, that I have no time for him, that my job and my degree aren’t an excuse and I should put more stock in the friendship, and respect his time a little more, as he’s been waiting around for me to call him and I then don’t. Had it been just that I’d have understood that he was a little frustrated and let it go.\n\nHe then goes on to call me a bad friend, to claim that our friendship has been very one sided for a long time, he doesn’t feel he knows me because the best friend he knows would never treat him like this.\n\nThis just feels...ridiculous to me. I’ve supported him through so much, never asking for anything in return, for years and years, and now I don’t have as much time on my hands, he seems to have forgotten everything I’ve ever done for him. Friends make allowances for eachother when the other is in a tough spot, and I’m struggling with stress and various other problems at the moment yet he seems to just want to make it about himself. \n\nI’m so hurt by his accusations, which I really think are unfounded. He questions my character. He seems incapable of sympathy for my work situation, in fact he seems to blame me for working a good job and wanting to better myself by getting my masters. I have honestly just hit a wall now where I can’t imagine being friends with him after this. Maybe it’s the stress I don’t know. Would I be the asshole to cut him out of my life?\n",

Other than that, we worked 50/50 (this is a desk job with two \"stations\", and I let her run the easy side for practice).\n\nAnyway, I want to send an email to the higher ups to defend myself and explain, but the only thing stopping me is that I haven't been accused of anything (management really liked how I did things and I got a great review) and I don't think my input will have much effect on if she gets the job permanently or not.\n\nI'm just super pissed, rightfully so imo, that she would try and blame me for her shortcomings, and I don't know if it would be an unnecessary (asshole) move to bring details to light with higher ups to defend myself.

      "description": " I haven’t been home in over two years, because my parents effectively disowned me (26F). They banned me from seeing a guy they didn’t approve of-but I did it anyway. The guy they disapproved of had a charge from college which is now gone and worked out. Yes, I have seen all documentation and talked with lawyer. The charge is gone, but parents refuse to meet him. \n\nAt the time, I was taking care of property they owned. No rent, but they didn’t support me financially. They told me I had to leave, or break up with him. So I moved out. Que the threatening phone calls, nasty emails and retracted invites home. \n\nI still called, sent bday and Christmas presents, and tried to interact. No phone calls were answered or acknowledged. No phone calls on any holiday. \n\nNow 2 years later and they are trying to reconnect. There was never an apology, only snide comments how I never visit or call home. Mom pretends like everything is fine when we talk,  Dad is trying. I love them, but after over 2 years I don’t want to visit/call pretend everything’s normal! They have always stated my partner will never be welcome in their home.  They are manipulative and vindictive-the fact that they didn’t get their way (us breaking up) has never happened before. My siblings think I should just move on-one siblings on my side but the others side with parents ( still dependent). \n\nSo, am I the asshole for not caring to reconnect? I don’t want to placate them after the past few years of threats, name calling and family manipulation. ",

      "description": "I've been working here for 2 years, it was the first job out of college. I was offered $10,000 less than what I wanted but he said if I did a good job I'd be making that much in no time. Fast forward to today and, despite the 'amazing reviews' and huge increase in responsibility, I'm only making $2,000 more.\n\nI'm very underpaid for my profession and area by about $20,000. I ended up finding a place that wanted to pay me $20,000 more plus much better benefits than my current job. Last week I gave my two weeks and I've been feeling like crap because my boss said I ruined his trip and now he has to work instead of relax. \n\nI wasn't given much time to sign my offer letter and my boss takes long 2-4 week vacations at least 1 every 3 months. I do feel bad about the timing but I can't pass at an opportunity to provide better for my family. My wife has been thinking about going back to school for a year and this will let her take less hours and attend classes.\n\nAnother issue, I am the only one in the company that does my specific job. He will have to find someone ASAP to fill the spot and I can see how that would be really inconvenient. I view this as a management mistake more than my fault but I'd love your opinion. If I am the only one who can do my job and you are severely underpaying me and 1 employee leaving can halt your whole company then I think it's on you and not the employee.\n\n**TLDR:** I quit while my boss was backpacking through Europe. I'm the only employee that could do my job. Despite glowing reviews I never got the pay I wanted from this employer. I quit for a $20,000 increase and to help my family's future. \n\n\n",

      "description": "My friend and I are playing Apex Legends. Sometime during our session one of his friends logs on so we have a full squad. I’ve never played with this person before so like with anyone I’ve not met, I avoid displaying my full personality because I don’t want to upset them or annoy them. This is something I assume a good amount of people do when meeting new people.\n\nAnyways, during our squad session, we’re dropping into heavily contested areas where the gear / guns are good.  What that means is that there will be a lot more squads also in that area trying to get a gun and to secure the area. Because of this, there’s a heavy emphasize on getting a gun quickly so you can fight.\n\nOn this one particular match, his friend and I drop into the same house and I (because I have no gun yet) run to a ‘golden’ weapon (this means it’s fully modded). At the same time, so was also his friend (who already had a gun). I ended up getting it first which he openly complained about through comms, which irritated me. \n\nAs a way of conveying my anger, I had the ability to heal him and chose not to (deployable healing drone - he had no meds). We lost the match, and he continued openly complaining about me. But not directly to me, in the third person, AS I’m listening (he knows this). I’ve had this happen to me before IRL and felt triggered, so I left discord which my friend noticed and said, “nice rage”.\n\nI don’t view this as raging, but rather not having to listen to someone that’s being rude IMO. I told this to my friend and he just repeated the same crap again. His friend made further comments to me in attempt to communicate with me in-game such as, “we can win if we work together you white prick”. I muted him there as well and told my friend I thought his friend was an asshole and that I didn’t need to listen to his crap.\n\nSo here we are now, days later my friend and I are playing and he leaves to go play with his friend. That ends our session, so I leave to go back to my room say I’m obviously not welcome here (this subject still triggers me) to which he replies, “ maybe if you dont rage”.\n\nSo, AITA, or is my friend and his friend? \n\nSorry for errors, on phone.",

      "description": "This was several years ago, back in high school junior year. My first ever relationship, which stretched for seven months (probably far too long), had recently ended, and I wasn't taking it as well as I'd have liked. I had a hard time facing and spending time with my ex, and pretty much went into radio silence with both her and our group of mutual friends. One such friend had known me since sixth grade, and to this day I still don't blame him for how things ended up happening and still call him one of my best friends.\n\nSo basically, this friend, I'll call him Jay, and I ended up sharing a class together... I think it was Chemistry? Well, somewhere along the line, my ex, who I'll call Dee, ended up dating him. He actually told me he'd had feelings for her since middle school, when I'd hardly known her at all (we met in Sophomore year). Due to her schedule of taking college classes and high school classes, she'd have several \"Filler\" periods at school where she was free to go anywhere she pleased within the school. \n\nShe chose to visit Jay, and would often sit with him, talk to him, simple things like that. They were obviously never physically intimate in class, no kissing or even really holding hands, but her presence there always just... bothered me. To put it to words, I guess it felt like hammering in the fact that I had failed to keep her interest, the fact that I hadn't made enough of an effort to spend more time with her. I think I was comparing how our relationship had been with her current relationship with Jay. We were... lukewarm, only saw each other for sparse dates, often without very good conversation, and exactly zero physical intimacy. Yet here they were, able to make time and talk to each other fluidly and easily. I'd even seen them in the common area once when they both had a free period, just talking and holding each other.\n\nSo after a while of this, I decided to take things into my own hands. After class I pulled the teacher aside and asked him to keep Dee from visiting the class again. I didn't want him to tell her that I was the one who requested it, but I feel like she knew anyways. Thinking about it now I feel so petty about having done that, like I should have just let it roll over my shoulders. I let my jealousy and low self-esteem get in the way of her happiness.\n\nI don't know how aware she was about how I felt about her and Jay's relationship, and I never outwardly told her. I sort of made up and broke radio silence near the end of senior year, but it was never the same, and I haven't spoken with her once since graduation. She and Jay ended up splitting up, and I have spoken to Jay since, even visited him when I was back home.",

      "description": "So a bit of background: I (32F) have a very good career in the healthcare field. I work long 12 hour shifts out of town, so I'm gone for roughly 3-4 days a week for 15 hours a day because of commuting. My fiancee (28F) is only working part time right now at a coffee shop, roughly 20 hours a week or so for the past year while she finished up college courses. She just was accepted in nursing school and starts soon. Because of this, I mostly pay for our rent. We live comfortably thanks to my pay but I am not saving up much. She helps with groceries and the like, but that's the extent of this. I'm okay with this since I don't expect her to help out much financially. I want her to finish school so we both have careers and have the life that we want.\n\nOn my days that I work, she frequently and almost always goes downtown to our city's bar scene. She meets up with her friends for beers and stays out very late drinking. Her friends never went to college or pursued anything, so going out and drinking is what they normally do. Now, normally she does have a few (I'm guessing around 3-4) but there are a few nights where she's gotten drunk, much to my annoyance. Not only that, I think it's a total waste of money. She's not making much so why waste it on $7 beers? My annoyance is only compounded by the fact that I want to buy a house, start a family and move on with my life, not spend my weekends at bars or taking care of a drunk.\n\nI guess this is where my question comes in. AITA if I disapprove of her choices while I'm away? She is very much a social butterfly, I understand this, but it irritates me that here I am working long ass hours to keep a roof over our head while she is out drinking with her buddies.",

      "description": "Sorry in advance for the long post.\n\nMy sister and I are less than 4 years apart, but she seems to get handed things that I worked my ass off to earn.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n\\-I worked extremely hard and graduated from high school as salutatorian (i.e. I was second in my class). In the process, I became close with a lot of my teachers. When my sister started attending the same high school, these teachers practically let her get away with murder. My sister not only enjoyed the attention, but seemed to think that she deserved it. She lost friends because this smugness.\n\n\\-I started working and saving up for a car since I was 16 because my parents believed that if I wanted a car so badly that I should earn it. A few years  after buying the car, I was looking to upgrade, and wanted to sell my old car. My parents insisted that I give the old car to my sister. For free. What the actual fuck. \n\n\\-I attended an Ivy League school that LOVES \"legacy students\" (i.e. relatives/descendants of people who went to said school). I didn't have any sort of legacy status (first generation) when I was applying to colleges, but my sister did when she applied to my alma mater. She got in. I was SHOCKED because her grades and EC's are mediocre at best, not something a legacy status can easily overcome. I asked a friend who worked in admissions, and was told that they considered my sister an \"investment\" because I was an active undergrad (won national awards, very involved in campus leadership, etc) and now an active alum. Once, when she was acting all high and mighty and bragged about getting into the college by \"working hard,\" I let this fact slip and she accused me of lying and being jealous.\n\nI've tried talking to her, but she gets very argumentative and whines about how I just can't be happy for her. I've also tried to talk to my parents about this, but they come up with bullshit excuses. My favorites are \"It's your responsibility as the older sibling to help out as much as possible\" and \"We treat you differently because, when we die, you will have had 4 more years with us than she will.\" \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for resenting my sister? I'm pissed off at my parents too for enabling her, but she's the one acting like an entitled brat. Maybe I'm missing something from her/their perspective?",

      "description": "Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nMy husband and I have been married about a year and a half and together for 4. He is currently 29 and I am 26. My husband has quite a large friend group that I have met over the years. We have pretty close relationships with several of his friends and others that we have maintained a more of an aquantaince relationship with. Due to us living in the same area he grew up in, most of these relationships were from his younger/college years.\n\nAbout a month ago we were at a party for one of his friends that he went to high school/college with. The party itself was fine and everyone was very nice. Most of the people there I had not met yet so he went and introduced me to a bunch of his olds friends. We ended up talking with one couple in particular for a majority of the time and they seemed really nice and nothing felt out of place or weird. My husband and the other husband said we should all get together sometime to hang out.\n\nThis weekend we finally had dinner with them this past weekend. Nothing overly weird or awful happened but I kept noticing the wife giving my husband odd looks and looking vaguely uncomfortable when we were talking one on one and making offhand comments that alluded to her knowing my husband better than me which I didn't pick up at the time but when I thought about it later on that night it seemed like weird things to say. \n\nSo, Sunday night I come out and ask my husband if they maybe had dated during high school/college. He said no, you know I didn't really date much at this time (he has told me previously that he slept around with pretty much anyone and didn't seriously date until he was 23). Naturally I ask if they have had a relationship outside of dating and he explains that he had a pretty steady physical relationship that continued for about 4 years when she moved for a new job.\n\nAt that time I no longer felt the need/want to continue hanging out with this couple. My husband got confused and wanted to know what was wrong. I explained that I didn't want us to maintain a relationship with someone he had been intimate for so long with. He thought that was dumb and made a comment to the fact that she didn't seem to have an issue with it. I argued that based off of her reaction, she possibly did have an issue with it. I also said that I was surprised her husband even wanted us to hang out, and that is when my husband said that he doesn't think her husband actually knows about their relationship. \n\nThis snowballed into a huge fight and I said that it wasn't up for discussion and he called me crazy and insecure for assuming anything would happen between the 2 of them now. AITA?\n\nTldr: hang out with a couple my husband went to school with, found out later that he slept with the wife and I no longer want us to maintain a relationship with them. ",

      "description": "I commute daily through one of the busy train stations in the United States,  Penn. Station in New York. The station is a large public space that is warm during the winter, which means that many homeless people sleep there during the winter. While some of these people are there to get a cheap meal, or sleep, or use the bathroom, some are also there to solicit kind donations from commuters. \n\nTo be clear, I have problem with giving people money if they truly need it, but since I in the station every day, I have noticed some suspect pan-handlers who I think are exploiting people's  goodwill. I see some of these people tell the same sob story everyday such as being short for a fare to get home. I see people give them the money that exceeds covering the alleged fare, and they proceed to walk up to someone else and tell them the same story. I have also been confronted by someone asking for change, only to look down at his feet and notice that he was wearing $200 shoes! When these people walk into the train car that I'm sitting in, I want to warn people that these people are disingenuous and that they should save their money for the ACTUAL homeless people populating the station, or instead of giving money, buy them a meal or the train ticket they are asking for. \n\nNaturally, I'm concerned that I will come off as an asshole that is inconsiderate to the plight of the homeless. There is also the possibility that my suspicions could sometimes be wrong. So, would I be an asshole to call out suspected disingenuous pan-handlers begging in a crowd? ",

      "description": "So first, some backstory.\n\nDuring my sophomore year in high school I met this girl (who we'll call Sarah) and we hit it off quite well. We developed feelings for each other and we kept on talking until the last day of summer break when she told me she didn't like me anymore. I was heartbroken for months, but then I met this other girl (who we'll call Anna) who helped me out of that dark place, and I then realized I started to have feelings for her and as it turns out they were mutual but she was not allowed to date so we just kept it on the down low for about a year, but I found she was a bit emotionally unavailable, so I explained that I craved more affection and emotion and broke up with her basically. So at this point we are in Senior year and not long after that one of me and Anna's mutual friends (who we'll call Sally) said that she liked me, and I saw that as a means of getting the things I craved so I decided I was down but she changed her mind at the last minute and we never became a thing. So Anna found out about that and was even more hurt than she already was (she had been having breakdowns in the middle of class and stuff like that according to yet another friend who is not important to the rest of the story, to which I replied \"where was that emotion when I needed it?\", but I digress) because it was as if I had never cared about her in the first place which really wasn't the case. I felt so bad and I really wanted to repair our relationship, but then Sarah comes back and explains that the reason she had told me she no longer liked me was just because past relationship trauma from her middle school years made her go into panic mode and she did not want to leave herself vulnerable again, but her feelings for me never truly went away, and what made her come back was that she actually tried being with a different guy but the guy ended up getting back with his ex without even telling Sarah about it so Sarah, now knowing how I felt originally, went back to me to apologize and wanted to try us again but for real this time. We wanted to wait until the whole thing with Anna and Sally blew over before we became official, but they ended up finding out because Sally was actually Sarah's best friend and I was texting Sarah but Sally had her phone at the time taking pictures for snapchat. So Anna is even more upset at me now and so is Sally because now it's like I never cared about either of them. I feel absolutely horrible that I caused all of this, I really never intended for any of this to turn out the way it did. I used to look at guys who were players in disgust but now I am just disgusted at myself that I became one of them. Sarah and I just decided to become official since there's really nothing to lose now but I am still trying to forgive myself. I was being so stupid. This series of events (which I'll call The Crisis to refer to it later) was my first real experience with relationship drama and I'm trying to take as many lessons from it as possible, better I learn now than later right? But anyways, now for the actual story. \n\nSo I was texting Sarah and she told me that one of our mutual friends (who we'll call Chris) had been mean to her after Anna and Sally interrupted a conversation she was having with a mutual friend of me, Sarah, Anna, and Sally (who we'll call Aaron). Sarah had a theory that Sally was trying to steal away their mutual friends from before The Crisis, which would explain the interruption but the facts are unclear. It is no secret that Chris liked Anna so it would make sense if Chris was simply putting on a show for Anna so I decided to confront Chris even though Sarah said it was okay. I texted him saying \"Were you mean to Sarah to put a show on for Anna?\" and he explained that he didn't mean to make Sarah feel bad, he thought that was just their banter because they were being jokingly mean to each other just that morning. I was satisfied, I just wanted to know what happened after all, and that was supposed to be the end of it but turns out Chris had screenshotted the conversation and I assume showed it to Anna, making fun of me for thinking his act was a show for her. Anna probably told Sally about it because Sally somehow found out and texted me saying that she did not even talk to Aaron to begin with and that I should keep her name out of my mouth. She was acting like I was spreading rumors or something but I literally only spoke to Chris who was involved anyway. But what confused me is that she claimed she didn't talk to Aaron so I asked Chris about it since he saw the whole thing and he confirmed that Sarah was talking to Aaron when Anna and Sally came and interrupted the conversation. I asked him for permission to use that as proof and when he said yes I screenshotted what he said and showed it to Sally to which she replied that all she did was call Aaron's name and then Aaron started talking to Anna. I was pretty sure that still counts as interrupting the conversation but I thought this whole situation was extremely petty so I just let her have the last word and let that be the end of it. I then told Sarah what had happened and she got so upset with me. She kept saying that I should've dropped it when she said it was okay and that it was none of my business. She didn't talk to me for like a day after that and in the meantime I was talking to Chris about the whole situation and we both agreed that neither of us had the intention of escalating the situation to this height. When Sarah finally did explain why she got so upset, she explained that she did not want Sally to hate her any more than she already did, she did not want to poke the bear so to speak. As I previously explained they were best friends before The Crisis, and I guess she still wanted to find a way to remain that way but that confuses me because she knew that trying to be with me in the first place would mean losing her, so I assumed she was prepared for that and thought I was worth it. I explained to her that I don't think she can have the both of us at the same time and that I don't want her to go on a wild goose chase for Sally. I just think this whole situation was extremely petty and honestly should not have even happened. \n\nThis is a long one so thanks if you read the whole thing, but without further ado: AITA?",

      "description": "Basically I moved home after some years living abroad and I’ve been hanging out with people from my hometown. Most of the people from my hometown are pretty lame but there’s this one guy who is chill and woke. We hung out a few months ago and it was fun. \n\nAnyway, I was hanging out with some other people later and found out that a couple of years ago, this guy killed someone by accident – he was driving drunk and ran over a person who was killed on the spot. And in order to escape punishment, he fled the country for a few years. (I live in a country where it’s easy to get away with crime if you’re from a rich family). \n\nSo basically this changed my whole opinion about this guy. He seemed like a nice person and I liked spending time with him. But I can’t stop thinking about the accident. I don’t know how to feel. I hate judging people for their past actions but I can’t stop thinking about the victim and their family. If I was the one who killed someone, I would’ve gone to prison and paid for my crime. But then again, I was never in that position so I don’t know how I really would have handled the situation. \n\nAnyway he texted me recently and asked me why I was ignoring him. I don’t think he is a bad person but I feel weird about hanging out with him. AITA for ignoring him?",

      "description": "Mobile user please excuse formatting:\n\nSo a friend of mine that I met at university this semester has been going out with this guy for about a month now. He has had rumors going around about how he gets girls drunk so he can make advances on them and is generally a terrible guy. He has forgotten to pick her up before and yelled at her while she cried and didn’t want to talk to him because he forgot. Basically he’s scum of the earth. I’m not sure if she actually knows about the rumors going around or realizes how terrible he is for her but she does complain about him to me and says how they might break up soon. \n\nAnyways, tonight I sent her a simple selfie Snapchat intending to start a conversation and instead got a picture of her boyfriends smug smile. He went into her phone to respond to me because he is clearly intimidated by my recent presence in her life. I decided to send a message basically calling him out and asking if he took advantage of any girls/ got girls drunk recently.\n\n\nThe reason this rumor is believed to be true is because my girlfriend knows a couple girls that had a thing with this guy and have told her about how horrible he is. He asked his previous girlfriend to “take a break” only to have her walk in on him having sex with another girl. Even though this was just a rumor, he replied with a video of him screaming at the phone over and over saying:\n\n“WTF DID YOU JUST SAY!”\n\nMy first thought was if someone accused me of something like this and they weren’t true accusations, why would he respond in such an angry and defensive manner. She has told me about his anger issues and how he yells at her almost daily, so I really hate this guy.\n\nI know this was an immature thing to say but he is actually emotionally abusing my friend and yells at her while she cries. He then blocked me on her phone and I was supposed to get a ride home from her from the airport tomorrow. I do have her phone number however. Along with wondering AITA, should I even bother talking to her or just get another ride? I’m not sure if she would be upset with me or him and don’t know if continuing to try to reach her while she is with her boyfriend is the best idea for me or her.\n\nThank you for any responses in advance.\n\n",

      "description": "Yesterday I went to a well known Asian fast food chain that my college has on campus. \n\nThere was a very overweight girl in front of me in line and we both ordered the same exact thing. \n\nI glanced over at her portion sizes as we were both getting ready to pay and noticed that the guy working there gave her literally double the portion sizes he gave me- like I’ve been to this restaurant before and he gave me 5 pieces of orange chicken while the other girl got at least double that and we paid the same exact amount. \n\nI gave the guy a dirty look, but didn’t say anything. \n\nI’ve had this happen to me before at the same restaurant and it’s really starting to piss me off because I’m paying the same as other people and getting less food than them. It’s not like I’m rude to the people working there when I’m ordering there either. \n\nI’m a girl who is 5’5 130 lbs and look a lot smaller than I weigh because of how I carry the weight, so I assume that the guy working there just assumed I wouldn’t have as great an appetite and therefore would be okay with smaller portion sizes. \n\nIk how reddit feels about overweight people and for me this isn’t about the girl and her weight or eating habits. She’s allowed to eat whatever the fuck she wants to and I’m not going to criticize her for that. \n\nMy issue is more with the people working there being unfair with the portion sizes they give me. I feel like everyone should get the same portion sizes, regardless of how big or small you are, since we’re all paying the same amount of money for food. \n\nAITA? ",

We are getting married next month and when discussing buying wedding rings he said he didn’t need one because he didn’t have a finger for it to go on. Now, he still had his right hand. I said I had always assumed that he would just wear it on his other hand, but he said as his father didn’t wear a ring he didn’t see how it was important. I suggested wearing the ring on a chain around his neck, he said he isn’t into jewellery (this is very true, he owns none).\nThis upsets me a lot. I don’t believe he has ill intentions, he dotes on me and would never be unfaithful to me. I’ve even had strangers in clubs/bars come up to me and tell me how adorable he is because they started conversations with him and he just immediately starts talking about me but thanks them for their interest.

      "description": "I’m currently a university student studying in (x) town and my ex is an ex-student who now works in the same town. I’m most likely moving to another town to pursue a masters degree at a more competitive university. \n\nSo my now ex-girlfriend broke up with me a couple of weeks ago citing the main reason(and only reason then described) as wanting to end the relationship now, rather than later so it would be easier when I leave after the summer break. I was completely fine with this, and I didn’t want to ask anymore questions, as she was extremely emotional and since I still did(and to a certain extent still do) care for her I chose to not pursue the subject. \n\nA couple of weeks later, I message her asking how things are and that I’m sorry and disappointed in how the relationship ended, and that I was wondering if there was any possibility of considering maybe a long-distance relationship. However, she did a complete 180 in terms of both personality and reason-wise, pretty unemotionally telling me that she ‘liked’ me a lot, but that the main reason was actually due to a personality clash which hadn’t been apparent during the relationship (at least, in my eyes. I’d asked her numerous times during the relationship about this issue and she consistently replied that there was nothing wrong). \n\nThis didn’t really set well with me as for the two weeks after the breakup I was beating myself up for not having made a bigger effort to try to talk her out of it, as well as believing that she still wanted to be in a relationship with me but purely believed that long distance would not work. I’ve also heard gossip from others who see her fairly often of her and another guy getting fairly close which honestly bums me out a bit, seeing as I couldn’t even fathom settling down with another woman for a while. I understand that everyone moves on at different paces, but seeing as we’re in a relatively close-knit friend group it seems a little insensitive. \n\nSo AITA for feeling annoyed/a little betrayed by her actions?

I didn't use the word ''Beta'' to demean anyone, or insult anyone, **my following statements were all in relation to MYSELF:**\n\nI met with some friends recently (two guys and two girls, all aged 24). I've known them for 3 years, and we were talking about what we've been up to lately.\n\nNow in the last several weeks, I got a new job (a better one than my previous, higher paying), I got laid with 3 different girls and I increased my lifts at the gym, as well as setting a new record for my mileage (I do running as well).\n\nSo I'm really on a winning streak in life. And during the convo, while I was drunk, I just said flat out **''I am an Alpha male. That's why I'm able to do what I am doing. There are winners and losers in life, and I am a winner. I am an Alpha male and I fully believe that.**\n\nMy friends looked confused and one of them called me a fucking prick for talking like that. Now just to clarify, I'm not a RedPiller and I don't view those forums, but I DO believe in Alpha males (not Beta males though or Omega). I believe there are Alpha's and non-Alpha, and I am an Alpha male.\n\nSo when I sobered up I sort of realized what I said, but rather than just apologize for talking like that I doubled down when my friend brought up the ''weird'' things I was saying, I said being drunk doesn't change anything, I still am an Alpha male and that's what I believe, AITA?",

      "description": "Backstory:  I've never been the most socially skilled person, heck you could say I'm bad at it. When growing up I only ever really interacted with a small handful of people, so I'm usually a little lacking on social cues. I've also had an irrational fear that my friends never really cared about me, and just kinda showed they did to be nice or look good or something. I know it's stupid and I know they do actually care, but it's just something my mind likes to tell me every once in a while. It’s usually a problem and I can ignore it. I’ve had the same group of friends for about 8 years, and for the past year and a half we’ve been getting together weekly to play games and hang out. \n\nThis happened in August. One of the guys from the group, I’ll call him John, was telling my fiance about how he thinks I’m a jerk and he’s not close to me or anything, and hasn’t been since we’ve started our weekly hang out. Saying I just make fun of him all the time. TBF we all usually joke with each other a lot, though if someone goes too far we say something. He never once told me I was taking it too far or that he felt disrespected, and I had no idea that he felt that way. He would just act the way he always did around me. We got together as a group to talk about it and when I heard it really hit me hard. Not only that what I thought was just joking between friends was actually hurtful, but also that for over a year he was basically lying to me, pretending like we were still friends. I actually broke down in front of my friends from that. I tried apologizing and saying that I never meant it like that and that I cared for him, but that I felt betrayed as I trusted my friends to be able to talk to me about anything. Like I said, I’ve always had the fear that my friends don’t really care, then boom it kinda happened. He didn’t really accept my apology and didn’t think I deserved one in return, saying that I was completely in the wrong and he did nothing bad. Nothing really got resolved and we just tried to move on from there, but he no longer showed up for game night. \n\nA couple weeks ago another one of my friends started going off in our group chat that I was being a jerk to John and that I was excluding him from everything and basically abusing him and had no room to ask for an apology. I was at work when this was all going on but when I went through it on my break I almost had a panic attack, and brought back those old fears. I have done nothing to exclude John from our group or anything to attack him. It’s been a rough couple weeks since then, and it’s been on my mind the entire time. I’ve already tried to apologize once and it was rejected, plus he doesn’t really care about how I was hurt. AITA for wanting an apology after I was hurt or am I the one who is completely to blame for this?\n\nTL;DR: My friend thinks I’m bullying him and hides it for over a year, then doesn’t feel bad when my feelings are hurt.",

      "description": "So for context, me, my best friend, and ex were all friends from high school before me and him started dating. They were never very close before, but me and my bestie have been best friends for years. After over a year, I have finally cut all contact with my incredibly emotionally abusive ex. \n\nSo going back in time a little bit, towards the end of our relationship it had got to the point where I would have a breakdown almost every day due to his constant bullying about basically everything I did. Right after we broke up, he got kicked out of his house, and left to move in with his mom about an hour away. I fucked up a few times and let him come back and live with me when he would text saying he was in town and had no place to stay. But, this is when him and my bestie started getting really close. When I would tell him he had to leave my house, he would go stay at hers. \n\nDuring this time the emotional abuse never stopped, so I stopped hanging out with my bestie as often and then not at all. Eventually, I basically told her to make him leave at the expense of feeling like a controlling bitch. I don't want to control her friendships, but she also knows how much this person has hurt me, and doesn't seem to care. She still texts him constantly and it's making me irrationally angry with her. I just don't feel as close with her anymore because of it. Also he has admitted to having a crush on her.\n\nI know how petty this may seem, but I feel betrayed by her continuing to be friends with somebody who hurt me so much and so deeply. Also, I've told her the specifics of what he would do to me and she always says that's so disgusting, he's horrible, etc, but she still is so friendly to him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: best friend constantly texts and chats with my emotionally abusive ex who has a crush on her, even though me and him no longer speak.",

      "description": "So I (19M) have this group of friends of about 4 of us. We're somewhat close but we all have other friend groups. About 2 or 3 months back a girl in the group (we'll call her Sarah) had a bad breakup with her at the time boyfriend. We had never really met the dude but he seemed chill. However apparently they had a pretty big falling out. We never really got the details but she did mention she felt like he had used her for sex, so after this we obviously took her side and agreed not to really talk to this guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, since then sometimes I'll be eating at our school's dining hall (we're all college freshmen living in dorms) with some friends, some from the group, and some other people, but not including Sarah, and her ex will just come by and sit with us. I guess he remembers us and feels like he knows us well enough to eat with us, or he's friends with someone else who's currently sitting with us. Even though we never really knew him, I'm okay with him being there. I don't think this guy has many friends and I would feel bad telling him to leave or getting up and moving myself, and in any case I don't really mind since he doesn't talk with us much. I (and anyone else from the group who's there) just sort of tolerate him but never initiate conversations directly with him. Also this has only happened like three times max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, apparently Sarah saw us sitting with him a few times and felt a bit betrayed. She has since asked us to not let him eat around us. I explained that we don't really tell him he can or can't since he just sits down without asking, and flat out telling him he has to move seems unnecessarily rude. Plus it's not like we ever see this guy outside those three or so times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand where she's coming from, considering it's her ex who we agreed never to be friends with, but at the same time I feel like it's a bit much to ask that we purposefully be a dick to him. The way she sees it, it's what he deserves, but even though we're her friends, we just don't dislike him enough to do that. Maybe because it's been a while since it all happened, or maybe because we never really saw the breakup go down.",

      "description": " \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nI dated a guy, let’s call him Dave, for about 10 months. Dave and I had a lot of problems. He had an aversion to commitment, so we never put a label on things. He was constantly drunk, unmotivated, and by month 6, we were both extremely unhappy. He was unemployed out of college, and would not apply for any jobs he saw as below him, like waiting tables. It came out that his dad cheated on his mom. There was a lot going on for him and he seemed to cling to the relationship for stability. \n\nIt’s important to note here that Dave and I were friends for 2 years before we dated, and he helped me through quite a bit. So every time I expressed how deeply unhappy I was, he’d beg for two more weeks, insistent that whatever job he’d just applied for would definitely come through and things would get better when he was working, and every time I backed off and agreed to two more weeks. That went on for months before I finally called it off. I developed an attraction to our mutual friend, but out of respect for my quasi-relationship, completely cut contact with said guy as soon as I noticed the attraction. This is important for later.\n\nCome to find out, he lied to me about graduating school. He actually failed out, and that’s why no jobs were working out. I’m still pretty angry about this. He had to have known every time he begged for two more weeks that, if he was refusing to apply to jobs that were “below” him, that he wasn’t going to get a job at all. It was an awful relationship. \n\nSo, remember that friend? Let’s call him Bruce. Bruce and I reconnected after I broke up with Dave. IMPORTANT: 1) I did not meet Bruce THROUGH Dave. I met them independently at the same time about 3 years ago. 2) Bruce and Dave are not particularly close, they were in the same fraternity of 70-some guys, but ran in mostly different circles, with very little overlap. 3) Nothing ever happened between Bruce and I while I was dating Dave, I just noticed I had a crush and stopped talking to or hanging out with Bruce. \n\nBruce and I started dating 3 months after my breakup with Dave. I am incredibly happy, it’s a much better fit and a much healthier relationship. However, some of my shared friends with Dave have been quite cruel, and I ran into Dave at a bar a few weeks ago and he yelled at me quite a bit, stuff about violating “girl code” and this that and the other. \n\nI don’t think I did anything wrong, but I’m on the verge of losing friends over this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Dating my ex's friend, but I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. Friends aren't happy about it. AITA?",

      "description": "Here's a bit of backstory. I work as one of the IT managers for CompanyName in Mexico. 90% of my job requires of me to be in constant communication with our US office, therefore I am fully bilingual, and have a barely noticeable accent. As such, one of my co-workers, whom I didn't really speak with before, asked me to teach her English, so she could improve her own skills set. Apparently, she walked by my office one morning while I was on the phone, and I had left my door open. (irrelevant, but I have been an ESL teacher before)\n\nI agreed to do so, and our first class was to be on a Monday, 1 hour before my shift started. The night before, I spent a good hour and a half preparing a class for her. My daily commute is 2 hours to work, 2 hours back, so being at the office 1 hour earlier was a bit rough, but I am all for people wanting to better themselves, so I didn't mind it. Except she didn't show up. No call, no show.\n\nWhen she finally messaged me throughout the day, she apologized for oversleeping, and re-scheduled me for the next day, at the same time. She showed up 40 minutes late. The next two days she didn't schedule anything with me, and on the last day of the week, she finally showed up on time. This pattern has repeated as a mixed bag for about 7 months. I've gotten to the point of just not showing up whenever I think she won't show up either, and whenever I misjudge it, and she shows up but I don't, I apologize for oversleeping and carry on. I guess it is important to note I am not charging her for it. She stopped scheduling me all together about 4 months ago, but we've kept in touch and I guess we've become office friends. I try not to message her much while at work, or on our personal time. Every other week I'll send her a meme or a bad dad joke I found, but that's about it. She replies in kind. She's confided in me a few of her personal issues, and even made a few passes at me, all of which I blew off and ignored, since I know she has a boyfriend. A couple of months ago, she called me to vent after her breakup.\n\nLast week, she asked me again to help her with her English, and I agreed, but told her that if she was not constant and dedicated to it, there would be no way to improve or learn. She said she was 100% on board with that, and she wanted to start as soon as possible, but she didn't want to do it at the office anymore. She said she'd rather do it over the weekend at some Starbucks or w/e. She said that Sunday (today) would work for her, and we settled on that.\n\nYesterday, at around 1pm I asked her to confirm if we were still on for Sunday. She didn't reply, and I assumed Sunday was off, so I stayed up with my friends all nightp playing videogames. Today, at around 11am, she replied. It started off with her apologizing for not replying to me, then confirming the time and place for today. By noon when I finally got up, I replied, and told her I'd see her then. I asked if she wanted to grab a bite after, and she didn't reply, though the message was read.\n\nAbout 1 hour before we were to meet, she calls me, and cancels on me. Apparently she had JUST rolled her ankle and was on her way to the ER because she \"couldn't even see straight\". I offered to catch up with her at the ER, and she declined.\n\nWIBTA if I just made our relationship as \"coworkers\" only? That is to say, no contact unless it is work related? I feel she is now trying to use me to get her ex jealous or some other shitty deal I want no part of, on top of me being sick of investing time into helping her, when she very clearly has no interest. I don't understand why she'd ask me for help, schedule me, even assist a few classes, and continue to spontaneously cancel. Am I being petty?",

However, it’s clearly on my side so I would be the only one who would get blamed and even so, they’re only allowed to do “plain sight” inspections of our rooms so they’d never find it anyways. She told me I’m not respecting her boundaries because it’s her room too, but I feel like she’s overreacting because they’re no way she could get implicated in the rare chance it was found. AITA for thinking my roommate is overreacting because of the occasional beer or weed I keep on my side of the room in my drawer?",

      "description": "So I have English class my first period of the day and I REALLY don't feel like talking to anyone that early in the morning (7:00am), but there's this guy that sits nearby me that just repeatedly tries to make conversation with me. I'm usually wearing headphones so I can avoid him talking to me, but he always just taps on my desk so I can help him with something (look at his essay, help him understand an assignment, etc.). I usually just respond to him very dry and with as little words as possible, put my headphones back in and do my work. \n\nThis has been going on for weeks now and the guy STILL  won't stop talking to me. So flashback to last Friday, our teacher tells us to get into pairs for an upcoming project and lo and behold I have to work with this dude because everyone else pairs up immediately. Of course I do the same thing I've been doing for weeks and he says something along the lines of \"I think it's rude that\" and he stops himself before he finishes. I'm assuming it was probably gonna be about how I've been talking to him the past few weeks or something.\n\nAITA for not wanting to talk to this guy even though I feel like I've clearly expressed that fact?",

      "description": "My father is physically disabled and mentally ill. He's a hoarder to a **profound** degree and has basically ruined my parent's property because of his problem. I'm not here to shit on my dad. I mean, I hate what he has done and I resent him for it but I feel that getting mad at a mentally ill person is like getting mad at a hurricane or a flash flood for destroying your home. Pointless.\n\nMy sisters and I have tried on repeated occasions to help my dad and mom by confronting my dad, offering to find solutions and even committing time to cleaning up the mess in an attempt to take control of this difficult situation. Nothing has worked. I feel terrible for my 72 y'old mom who has basically resigned herself to waiting for my father to die before she can move on from the situation.\n\n**My older** brother told all of his friends about my dad and constantly complains to his girlfriend and therapist about how he was traumatized by my family. I hate him for doing this because he aired all of our private family bullshit. I mean, a therapist I can understand, but strangers? His therapist, or so he claims, told him to cut all of us out of his life. Which he did and has officially proclaimed to everyone how he has walked away from the situation and anyone who stays \"is a gaslit fool\" ... He attempts to maintain a connection with two of my sisters but I told him that I never want to see him again for ditching the rest of us with this problem.\n\n**My younger** brother was \"helping out\" by selling some of my dad's junk (old generators, a couple of cars, some paintings) and it added up to quite a lot after awhile. My dad might be crazy but he is fair. His deal was that we would always split the profits 50/50 after expenses. My brother on the other hand sold my dad's stuff, gave him money for what my dad paid for it and pocketed the rest. This came to like $15,000. Then he split town a couple weeks later and told me, \"this mess is not my problem and that I owe you nothing.\" My dad's frame of reference is so fucked he thought he made out on this deal. Smh.\n\nI told this brother that he was a horrible piece of shit and that I never want to speak to him again either.\n\nI could stand my brothers just walking away from the situation and having the decency to keep quiet about it but any communique ends with them regarding me for being \"the asshole that stayed\". Their words. This hurts. So uncool. So selfish of them. \n\nI find the entire mess extremely tiring and humiliating. I often can't sleep at night when I dwell on this shit... how I lost two brothers. How my am I going to get rid of the mess? How can I afford to? How could they pull this shit on me after all we went through together?\n\nI just always thought that family was supposed to stick together no matter what and I feel so devastated and abandoned that my brothers would betray me and my sisters like that. I would have done anything for them- or am I the asshole? Please tell me if I am.",

      "description": "This might seem like a r/Iamverysmart post. But let me start by saying that I'm one of the bright students in our class. And I intentionally show off my marks to my school mates for attention.\n\n\nI'm 17, male. I don't have any friends. I'm extremely shy and introverted so it's actually my fault for being alone, I don't blame anyone else. I go to school, sit in my seat till the class ends and get out as soon as I can.\n\nI'm not good at anything which might attract others. I can't play sports because I have some medical problems, I'm not good at any arts or any skill. I spend my day in my room studying/watching football (soccer if you are an American)/playing football simulation games/browsing Reddit. I suck at everything.\n\nThe only good thing, or the \"so called\" good thing about me is that I'm very good at studies. I get very good marks in exam. I'm not even intelligent, I just have a great memory (the only thing I can brag about) so I can remember stuffs pretty quick and for a long time. Then I puke the information on the paper and get good marks.\n\nI wait the whole year for the time of the result. After the result I try to bring up conversations about it as much as I can. It's not like I go to people and say \"oh hey look, I got X% in this and Y% in that!\" It's not like that. I'll try to bring up conversations about the subject, and the someone might ask me about my percentage and I'll tell them like it's not a big deal.\n\nI do it for attention, nothing else. I'm totally aware of the broken education system and I know that some percentage doesn't show our true potential. But this is the only time people appreciate me, give me attention and don't ignore me like I don't exist. I seek validation, I don't know if it's normal or not but I like when people tell me that I'm good at something and this is the only time it happens.\n\n\nNow go ahead Reddit! Use your moral Philosophy on this poor soul!",

      "description": "So, I was in a 5 year long relationship with my ex. We were in college together and then we got jobs in different places. We decided we could meet once every 2-3 months and be in a long distance and after one year would try to get jobs in a common city. Everything was going well for the first 3-4 months. We met whenever we can. Then she tells me that she wants a break so she could focus on her job. Out of nowhere, this came. She told me that it'd take just a few weeks because she was working on something important. She told me the details, so I was convinced and decided to give her some space. After that, i went to meet her, we had a happy time and I thought everything would be good again, but when i reached back she told me that she kissed some colleague of hers who is like 9-10 years older than her and she was guilty, so she didn't tell me. I had a hard time digesting it and I broke up with her. There were many other factors as when she was at home after work she wanted full attention from me but when she went out with her friends for days, she didn't even call me once. I felt it was a shitty relationship. I told her that I don't want this relationship, and she told me can we be friends atleast and I said no to that too. I have decided to cut off all ties with her but a part of me wants to go back to her. Help me out guys!\n\nSo, AITA for breaking up with her.",

Some of them stock things that I'd like to buy at reasonable prices. \n\nI have three conflicts:\n\n1. A lot of the stuff is probably stolen (I assume?);\n\n2. The people who pawn the items get ripped off badly - one place charged 350% interest for a loan secured against the goods; and\n\n3. Buying something there feels like I'm contributing to a morally bad industry. \n\nWhat's the rule here? WIBTA for contributing to the industry?

My boyfriend(M31) and I share a room (F22). The bed is in the middle: one side is his and one side is mine. I am not the cleanest person and I can admit that. I’ll have some trash or junk, but will usually clean it within the week. I don’t walk on his side of the room but when you walk in the door, you can clearly see his mess. \n\nHe has piles of clothes, bags, other shit that takes up most of his side of the room. It looks so messy and it *never* gets clean. I have asked him a couple of times to clean it up and he gets mad at me. He complains that he doesn’t have enough space to store his stuff, so I suggest we go through clothes together and see what we can donate but he refuses. He gets so frustrated and then refuses to talk about it. \n\nI have brought it up a couple of times but at this point, he just sulks and nothing comes from it.

(Translation: I don't want to screw my own kids over with my cursed genetics.)\n\nBecause of this, my mother's side of the family will consider me as the 'black sheep', and will attempt to convince to change my mind.\n\nI have explained on multiple occasions that I don't want my future children to have to go through the same or worse mental issues that I already go through. Nor do I want them to have the possibilities of cancer, addiction, or nervous system issues. Overall, I don't want my kids going through the same or worse hereditary problems that I'm already facing.\n\nHere's a conversation that I've had to go through with just my mother about this.\n\nMom - \"You know I want some grandkids sometime in my lifetime.\"\n\nMe - \"Yes, and if I have kids, they'll most likely be adopted.\"\n\nMom - \"You don't want to have kids of your own?\"\n\nMe - \"No.\"\n\nMom - \"Why?\"\n\nMe - \"Because I don't want to curse them with my genes.\"\n\nMom - \"You're not going to carry on the family bloodline? Well... will you at least carry on the family name?\"\n\nMe - \"Maybe.\"\n\nMom - \"What do you mean 'maybe'?\"\n\nMe - \"Meaning, I might not have that name by the time I get around to having kids.\"\n\nMom - \"What? How?\"\n\nMe - \"I might change my name when I... IF I ever get married. Or I might legally change my name later in life.\"\n\nMom - \"NO! YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE FAMILY NAME! DO YOU REALIZE HOW DISAPPOINTED YOUR GRANDFATHER WILL BE IF YOU DIDN'T CARRY ON THE FAMILY NAME?!\"\n\nMe - \"Um... more reason to change it.\"\n\nMom - \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE TO CARRY ON THE FAMILY NAME!\"\n\nMe - \"Actually... can't your aunt's kid do that too? They can do that if it means so much. I'm not willing to breed just to carry on a family name that holds standards that I don't agree with.\"\n\nAnd that's when I ended the conversation.\n\nBut, am I the asshole for making such a choice? I know I made that choice early in life, but I'd personally rather be safe than sorry.\n\nI'd like to know y'alls thoughts on the matter.",

We’ve spent weeks discussing only that subject ad nauseam and she will just break up with him and then proceed to get back together with him the next day. She keeps telling me and showing me proof that he has cheated, lied and been emotionally abusive, and honestly I personally believe that she should break up with him. However the problem is that when they are together she’ll agree with me but when they aren’t then she will take my opposition as a challenge, telling me I don’t know anything about them when she herself showed me what was happening. After months of only discussing this I’m honestly sick of it at this point and I refuse to talk about it. I see that she needs support but she keeps pushing me away and honestly I don’t know if I should keep trying or if giving up is the right thing. I just hate being told I’m a bad person just because I don’t think and will ever think they should get back together and I’m sick of discussing it.",

      "description": "My Landlord's mother who owns our rental property that we rent month to month just passed away. My wife feels we(I) should start asking around for new rental properties to move into if they choose to sell the house and we need to move. She feels it is just a matter of time before the house gets sold and we should use this time now to look. It is not even on the market yet, but she is assuming that they will want to sell the house and will want to put it on the market before summer and only give us the required 30 days notice. \n\nI, on the other hand, think this is an overreaction. They have never mentioned anything about selling the house when she passes, and even hinted at the opposite when we brought it up before moving in. Also, we live in a small community, and asking around for properties might eventually get back to the landlord, who might find it insulting that we think he's gonna kick us out soon. Not to mention I am already searching for a job in a new area and we are planning to move in the summer. It's hard enough to look for a job and then a house after that, but to look for one now only to move again in 4 months? \n\nThe landlord is a probate attorney who is giving us this house at a steal because he wants someone here to maintain it, but also because he is worried about family fights with his siblings about the house. Our relationship with our landlords is closer than normal, since we went to church together while we were renting. We were also invited to their daughter's wedding shower and have had them for dinner. It's way too early to talk to them directly as this only happened yesterday.\n\nWe have \"compromised\" to me only looking online for a few weeks before I start talking to people directly, whether we have gotten notice or not.

We will call that guy N. Recently N started dating a girl outside of our friend group. No one has any sort of problem with her, she's certainly a nice person and fun to hang out with. \n\nThe only thing is, everyone else in our group is single. So even when there are 6 other people besides N and his gf, we all end up feeling like third wheels, and kind of bummed out. \n\nDon't get me wrong, she's fun to have around, and like I said, no one has anything against her. But would I be an asshole if I asked him not to bring her next time we hang out? I've talked with one other guy in our group, and he agrees that it's awkward when they're doing couple-y things while the rest of us are hanging around, sort of like they're rubbing it in (which they certainly are **not**. It just feels that way because the rest of us are single.). I wouldn't be asking him to never bring her along anywhere, just maybe request that next time we hang out he doesn't bring her.\n\nAlso I just wanted to say- I don't think he's an asshole for bringing her along, and I don't think he'd be an asshole if he said no. He just wants to spend time with her, and that's fine. Hell, I've even done the same thing myself, but eventually realized how I may be making others feel and stopped inviting her every time. I'm just wanting to know if *I* would be an asshole if I did this. ",

      "description": "So I'm currently in a graduate program and got assigned to a group of 3 people (including myself) for a semester long project. In general, this group's communications... are severely lacking. For part 1 of the project I did the vast majority of the work, with the other two only making comments and edits to the document.  \n\n\nPart 2 is now due tomorrow night at midnight. We've had over a month to work on this and had met early in the month to discuss how to get it done, since this isn't something to get done in day or two. However, all three of us are super slammed. For example, I'm in 5 graduate level classes and actively interviewing at a company across the country (read I had a trip in the middle of this) and the other two work full-time and attend full time (3 graduate level classes). So all three of us just kept pushing off this project.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as I got back from my job interview trip, I tried to rally the troop's because now we only have 4 days left. One person sends a bunch of potential references (which has been very helpful) and the other has put some notes to consolidate potential ideas. This morning I sent out an e-mail saying effectively, \"Hey guys, we have two days, we have 13-18 pages to write. I've broken it down into sections, here's your sections, let's start getting going on it.\"    \n\n\nI split the work out to me- 60%, person 1- 30%, person 2 -10% based on how my gut tells me they'll actually get done. Since this morning, person 1 did reach out and say \"Ok, but I have another assignment due, so I'll work on it after.\" (Note:  I also have this assignment due and it should only take about 2 hours to complete...) That was now 8 hours ago and there's been no movement on their parts and this person is across the country, so their day is now pretty much shot. Person 2 has not responded since they put the references two days ago.   \n\n\nSo WITBA if I tell let my professor know that at this point, I've done the vast majority of the work for one and from what it seems that I will be the sole author of Part 2? I totally own that I also dropped the ball and let it to the last minute along with my teammates, but I'm now the only one trying to remedy this. ",

      "title": "AITA for asking a guy how big his dick is after he asks how much I weigh?",
      "description": "So there's this guy in our friend group who asked me out on a date. Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?",

      "description": "This is more of a lighter post than some of the others, but I just had a weird interaction with my next door neighbor and I need to know if I'd be a creep or otherwise leaning into an awkward situation at the expense of another person's comfort.\n\nMy apartment complex just got new dryers that don't have timers on them, so to be sure that I didn't leave a finished load of laundry longer than necessary I went down early to wait for it to finish. As I'm waiting, my next door neighbor, with whom I've never interacted before, came in to get her laundry from another dryer. The laundry room is directly below her apartment, and I had a belt in the dryer, so I apologized if she could hear it clanging around from her apartment. She said she couldn't hear it, and then apologized for any noise she makes while Twitch streaming, which I never hear anyways.\n\nI saw this as a conversational opportunity to find out what sort of games she streams and politely ask if she'd be willing to share her username, which she did. Sounds fine, right? Here's the thing, though: while she was picking up her clothes, she informed me that she had to clean all of her clothes, and in fact she was dressed in just a night gown. I think she may have found the situation uncomfortable and only told me her Twitch username out of politeness, but I kind of want to be a friendly neighbor and genuinely support her channel, especially since women tend to be harassed on Twitch. I'm happily taken and have zero desire to be anything other than a good neighbor to this girl. WIBTA if I followed her on Twitch in spite of our awkward encounter, or am I reading too much into this?",

We both started at the same time and a higher position has opened up but I opted not to apply for it because I want my coworker to have it.\n\nI'm trying to be vague for anonymity's sake but the promotion is similar to paralegal or CPA work (basically it requires being knowledgeable about a legal code) vs our current general secretarial duties.\n\nI have no children, no debt, no alimony; I rent and all of my bills are paid on time every month. As well, another promotion or transfer will open up within 12-18 months anyways. I'm past my probation and in a union so I'm in it for the long haul. \n\nMy coworker is a single mom and she could really use the extra money and would be excellent at the position. \n\nI am objectively better qualified though. I have more relevant experience, I've scored higher on the aptitude tests, I study the legal code in my free time, I have more commendations/performance awards, and even though I don't get paid to, when my current workload allows me to I voluntarily train for the higher position and assist the people that currently do it.\n\nMy coworker has some training/knowledge just from being in the same field but far less. She goes above and beyond plenty often as well but almost certainly only because of my example.\n\nIf I went for the position against her, I would get it. Frankly I have a better work ethic and our supervisors passive-aggressively use me as an example for of the attitude they want from other employees. I've worked shitty jobs for years and I give 120% here because it's the best job I've ever had.\n\nIt's completely platonic but we're not just work friends, we really bonded outside of the job. My sister babysits her kid, we hang out outside of work, we talk/text daily, and I'm literally her medical emergency contact.\n\nSo she was offended when I told her I wasn't applying for the promotion, would reject it when offered to me, and would instead recommend her because I wanted her to have it saying \"you need it more than I do\"\n\nWe had a short chat about it and she feels like I'm just taking pity on her and while that's technically true, does that make me an asshole?",

In fact, the first week we met she talked about relationship problems. All relationships have problems, right? That was not a big deal.\n\nEver since we’ve met we’ve become very close. We just finished watching Hill House together and we always talk to each other about very personal problems.\n\nCut to last week - I get a tearful call from her asking if she can come over because she “needed to rant”. That’s fine - this has happened before, and it usually involves her being upset at coworkers or small stuff with her boyfriend. This time, she was in tears telling me about how her boyfriend sexually assaulted her. Twice. She no longer felt safe around him, and she didn’t know what to do.\n\nI calmed her down and told her she needs to have a serious conversation with him about what happened and leave him. He’s had a history of being super clingy, and he’ll get upset with her if she doesn’t have sex with him.\n\nShe told him that she doesn’t want to speak to him for a week, and he agrees. He ends up leaving his job “sick” last week, and since he doesn’t have a car, she was the only one to pick him up - he basically forced her to pick him up. In the car he starts bawling his eyes out and hysterically says he’d die without her. This whole week he has messaged her (even did it 50 times in 10 minutes) blaming her, getting angry at her, swearing, talking about jealousy of us (we don’t see each other TOO much outside of work). He was bothering her for days, interrupting her at University and continuously crying and blaming her for the sexual assault he committed.\n\nI texted her last night after she left my house (we watched the last episode of Hill House) and told her that the relationship seemed abusive and he was manipulating her. She got super upset and said “well what if I stay with him and I’m happy? He’s going to change.” Among a couple other things.\n\nI really just want to make sure she’s safe.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr - Close friend’s boyfriend sexually assaulted and verbally abused her among other controlling methods and I told her that he was manipulating her.",

Sometimes I also feel I am one of the main people keeping him together.\n\nAm I the asshole for even considering this? ",

      "description": "Context: I don't know how it works in other places, but I am in California and you have to pick a pediatrician before birth. So, you don't really know a lot about your needs before you pick. I picked a highly-rated pediatrician (recommended by my OB). I gave birth to an infant with minor issues, so we go to the doctor a lot. \n\nAround the time I gave birth, the pediatrician sold his practice and there were a lot of changes. Email, online appointments and an after-hours advice nurse phone line were discontinued and we were told they would come back once the system switched, but it hasn't in over a year. As a result of everything needing to be conducted by phone, there are long holds every time I call their office...a simple appointment change for a vaccine can take me 30 minutes on the phone. The doctors do not offer call-backs with advice or answers to simple questions -- everything requires an appointment, which is expensive ($150-$270). The front office is also disorganized and once lost our vaccination records. They frequently leave me voicemails reminding me of \"Emily's\" appointment (Not my daughter's name at all!) and call her \"Emily\" in the office (the doctor doesn't do this, just his staff). Recently, there was a change in nurses. The new nurse didn't have a lot of experience. She gave my baby the first of 3 vaccines and got freaked out by the crying and told me, \"I can't do this. I can't do this.\" I told her okay, then we have to get another nurse to do the rest. She said no, she will get fired and then tried to give my baby the 2nd shot and I refused to let her. I made a small scene and insisted the more senior nurse administer the rest of the vaccines. The office staff acted like I'm the Asshole. I complained directly to the doctor and he understood but said he no longer manages his nurses since he sold his practice. He said he would tell my complaint to her manager. AITA on this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was frustrated and tried another ped. who had a lab, advice nurse, email, etc. I met with her and did not like her at all. I felt she was dismissive and her style was more rigid than my laid-back former pediatrician. She was also 45 minutes late to our appointment and when I asked the office staff why it was taking so long (sitting in a room full of people with the flu with an infant) they said she was on a personal phone call!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I decided to go back to my former ped.  However, when I called to make my appointment the receptionist, opening her chart (which every office can see everywhere) saw we went somewhere else and told me I am high-maintenance and I \"keep jumping around.\" She said that she will have to ask the pediatrician if he wants to \"take me back.\" I don't see how she can say I keep jumping around when I have only been to 2 pediatricians. Maybe she is referring to when my doctor was on vacation and he scheduled us with his partner. AITA? Is it really not okay to try out new pediatricians?",

      "description": "I have a friend who we'll call Craig. We're relatively good friends (at least I think so), and they often help me with my problems. Craig has an SO who we'll call Kenny; Kenny and I had a falling out in the past and haven't interacted much since then, but what few interactions we have had seem a bit more friendly now. \n\nCraig and Kenny are both (very skilled) artists and writers, and Craig has given me advice on my own writing in the past. Another friend of mine, Brian, recently gave me some money as a gift. I decided I wanted to use it to commission some art from Craig and Kenny, and contacted Craig asking about it. They seemed happy and grateful, and said they'd talk to Kenny about it, but Kenny was sick at the time and so it took a while to get a response. A few days ago, I told Craig what I'd like the art to be of, and they responded, again, they'd check with Kenny to see if that art fit the money I could pay, though it would only be a sketch. I haven't heard from Craig about it again, though that is partly my fault because I didn't bring it up in conversation after that. \n\nJust today, I found another artist on Tumblr. They take commissions as well, and will do more for the same price. I'm considering commissioning them instead, but I would feel bad for canceling on Craig and Kenny when I already told them I'd be buying from them. \n\n**TL;DR Have artist friend, get money, want to commission him and his boyfriend, tell them that, don't hear back about it for a while, find another artist and want to commission them.**",

      "description": "She finished her 5th divorce two years ago, and for these two years she keeps asking me questions that also insult me.\n\n “How did you get a man at 30 with kids? It’s because you’re so skinny.” \n\n“Do I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha”\n\n“You has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.”\n\n“Did you only talk about sex with them?!”\n\nFor two years I’ve brushed off the insults, and replied: “ You’re in a small town” or “focus on yourself , and someone special will come around”\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time “How did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don’t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can’t I get anyone?”\n\nI replied honestly and said: “ You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It’s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.”\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I’m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I’m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I’m entitled and don’t understand what she’s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I’m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She’s not going through anything that major. She’s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I’m stuck with my mouth shut, and I’m mad at everyone because I’m not privileged or entitled at all- I’ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? ",

      "title": "AITA for giving my younger brother advice on how to get with girls?",
      "description": "I (21M) am in my final year of university. My younger brother (16M), let's call Jack, is in high school. He's at that age where he wants to start talking to girls. Truth is, he's struggling, at least from what he's told me. \n\nHe isn't even bad looking, but he's not happy that he keeps getting treated like...a bit of a bitch I guess, from his his own words. He's not respected, and is viewed as friend zone (not even friend zone, more like 'bitch zone', lol). \n\nHe's too nice, effeminate and has no backbone. When he wants to 'get with' a girl, he starts talking to her as he would a friend but comes across as too nice. He'd be a great friend, for sure, but that's now what *he* wants. He wants to be hooking up with girls like his friends are doing at parties.\n\nHe came to me for help, and pleaded me to help. Now I am 5 years his senior, but I've slept with quite a lot of girls while at uni, again, uni is different, but it's pretty clear that my brother looks up to me for this. I gave him some core advice:\n\n- Stop being nice. From now on, you are not a nice guy. I don't care if you have to do a 180 and act like a douchebag, even that is better than being a nice boy. No more nice guy means no more mr effeminate bitch boy. He has to be more masculine (masculinity = good).\n\n- No more talking to girls like friends. You are being dishonest when wanting to befriend girls. You don't even want female friends (and you don't need them, you have male friends). From now on, if a girl tries talking to you, be disinterested and be aloof\n\n- When this works, many girls WILL be attracted to you. Don't get into a relationship, you can do that shit in your 30s. If you want sex, have sex, and then don't text them after\n\n- Main advice: **Don't listen to girls advice, INCLUDING my older sister's advice (26F), we will call her Georgia. Georgia has given him advice on girls and said ''You need to be nice, respectful and considerate, that's all you need''. Obviously this advice has proven useless. I told my younger bro that basically...girls just want a guy who ''gets it'', obviously asking a woman for advice she will give you the wrong advice (unknowingly) because they want the guy to ''just get it''**\n\nNow my bro has implemented my advice and he has slept with 1 girl so far and gotten a blow job from another. Some of the people at school were initially resistant to his new personality, but I said he had to force it. And now after a short while...he got laid, they are now ''re adjusting'' to the new him, and not the bitch boy.\n\nNow the main conflict here is that my sister Georgia knows what I told him and shouted at me saying I am ''filling his mind with crap'' and that I'm a douchebag, but then I said to my sister back ''You don't even care about the kid...he came to you for advice and you gave him half assed crap''. She then told me to fuck off. I don't know why she reacted so strongly, lol, she gave him shit advice. AITA?",

      "description": "So he had a son from a previous marriage. She has a few of her own from previous relationships. They’ve faced fertility issues and now have the go ahead from the doc that after an expensive surgery on her uterus that they can try for their own. \nThe son has been abused before dad had custody and faces issues that he obviously needs therapy for. The whole family (including FIL) taunt and bully the poor kid. The step siblings are vicious. He escaped one abusive situation for a whole new one. I don’t blame the kid for wanting to avoid them and be in his own world. \nBIL and SIL are into drugs (the life ruining kind) and think that medical marijuana is the cure for everything.  She doesn’t believe in therapy or modern medicine (anti vaxx).  He’s got anger issues and problems from his own father being abusive - ones his wife won’t allow him to get therapy for or take meds. He can be scary when upset or high and has threatened to kill family members. \nI haven’t expressed these opinions with my husband (BIL’s brother). But I just don’t see why they should bring another kid into the world if they can’t even properly treat the kid who badly needs help.  Or think it’s okay to do drugs an act like they aren’t in their thirties and parents. \nAlso they can’t afford the surgery (which I get - insurance where we live is shit in general for women who want to have babies) but my husband and I have bailed out other family members financially because they just choose to make shitty decisions. Legit shit decisions and feel like they’re entitled to our money to fix it.  She started a online fund and pushing the whole “Christmas is for giving” line. \nI just can’t tell if I’m a monster for thinking maybe it’s not the best choice to bring a baby into that mess. I feel terrible for her fertility issues and wouldn’t wish them on anyone, but...I worry for that child’s future well being. ",

      "description": "This is going to be a long post but please stick with me, I've been pondering this over in my head and it'd help to get an opinion. I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year now and there have been a string of issues that make me feel like or relationship will only ever be temporary.  This is mostly due to her sexual views which contrast mine.  She is much more open to sex but stays monogamous to me since I am less liberal about it.  She has made clear though that if we are separated, she still needs physical contact.  Which brings me to the incident...\n\nLast summer we were separated for 2 months due to working in different places.  We agreed before hand that if she did anything with someone else, we would follow boundaries and she'd tell me beforehand.  She did not do anything for 7 weeks but then at a party, she got cuddly with a co-worker and they ended up exchanging oral.  Pretty much they cuddled, he fingered her and she blew him.  Though this bothered me immensely, what hurt me the most was that I was trying to contact her through the party and she never responded until afterwards when she told me she did this with another guy.  It was honestly the worst I've ever felt.\n\nWe talked about it and she claimed she didn't consider it sex so she didn't know she should have checked up with me.  But what bothered me was she was outright ignoring me and I saw it as an act of cheating.  However I buried these insecurities and have been with her for another 4 months with no problems.\n\nBut I still think about this a lot and I could never see myself spending my life with her because of it.  There's a chance we'll be separated again this summer and I am wondering if it would be an asshole move to give her the option of staying 100% monogamous or breaking up.  Maybe I'm looking for more general advice but I could only think of this sub.  Thanks for the feedback.\n\nTLDR: girlfriend did something id consider cheating.  Wondering if I'd be an asshole to give her an ultimatum of staying 100% monogamous or breaking up",

We've basically moved on by this point, and have forgiven each other for past mistakes and what not.\n\nIt wasn't long till she mentioned becoming physical again, and really pushed the idea onto me. She said I was being a dickhead and such for not wanting to do so, and how none of us have a significant other so it shouldn't matter till she eventually threatened to cut me off all together, so i reluctantly agreed because I still want to have this person in my life ya know? Despite agreeing and doing stuff, I'm still heavily conflicted about this and even mention it to her sometimes, but I'm met with the same response.\n\nAm i the asshole for initially rejecting this idea, and for continuing to have this doubt?",

      "description": "This happened a few weeks ago, but I should preface the situation by adding some context. \n\nSo in my neighborhood there is an open area we let our dogs play unleashed. Most of these dogs are 50 lbs or more but my dog is a little over 20. There has never been an issue with my dog's smaller size, and the other dogs have been great with him. My dog is a little annoying when he barks/howls (beagle) but only does it when he's playing, it is sometimes ear piercing, but when he gets too wild I pull him aside and give him a little \"timeout\" because I know it can get annoying for other dog owners, but they say it isn't that bad.\n\nWhen I do have my dog on a leash, he wears a harness, this apparently was an open invitation to said neighbor to pick him up by the harness. The first time I didn't say anything, the second time I told him not to do that, and the third time he did it is when I lost my patience. Now to describe this guy, he's on the Board at my HOA. He's a little arrogant, he always has to be right, always trashing on neighbors and dishing their issues, stuff like that. He's a little older than the average age of people who let their dogs play, we're in our late 20s-mid thirties, this guy is in his 50s. We don't hate him but more or less we tolerate him.\n\nWell during this situation, there was about 5 of us out there with our dogs, my dog was howling and I tried to calm him down a bit, once I let him go the Board member picked him up off the ground by harness and yelled at him and called him a little shit. I walked over, grabbed my dog, and told him to never touch my dog again. I got in his face and asked what the fuck his problem was. I never shoved/touched him, but I let it be known I do not appreciate my dog being treated like that, I will discipline my own dog. I would never treat anyone else's dog like that unless he was attacking another dog or another person (which my dog never would, any sign of aggression from another dog he just rolls over on his back wagging his tail).\n\nBM tries to play off the situation as he was \"just playing around\" and I told him no one else here would ever do that to my dog, and I would never do that to theirs. He tried to make me out like I was the asshole, like I'm the dick for getting mad at him for doing that even after I told him not to. He consistently disrespects others and thinks he's untouchable because he knows people don't want to start shit with board members. I don't know if he's that arrogant and just doesn't give a fuck, or actually that disconnected from reality where he can do whatever he wants without repercussions. \n\nAm I the asshole for getting angry and pissed off at him? To reiterate, I never threatened him or touched him, just dropped a lot of F bombs in his face.",

      "description": "Some background: My husband and I generally have a loving happy relationship. We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn’t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can’t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me “I’m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I’m a piece of shit.” I’m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven’t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "This is so dumb, but you wouldn't believe the impact it has had on my family. \n\nI'm 19, I have twin girls who are now three years old. I'm a university student living with my boyfriend of four years in a small apartment, with two small rescue dogs. We don't have a whole lot of money, but we can live comfortably as long as we don't waste our money. Because of this, when me and my partner decided to get a dog last year, we chose adoption over buying a puppy (there were a few reasons along with money, such as wanting to rehome an unfortunate dog and also, we wanted to have a slightly older dog that was more adjusted to kids). We went to the shelter and found two beautiful boston terrier girls. They are both two years old and sisters, like my daughters were at the time, they had been around kids in their first home and really seemed perfect, so we got both of them. They are amazing and we love them so much, the kids love them and the dogs are really well behaved. \n\nBecause we have a two bedroom apartment and not a whole lot of space/money, my boyfriend and I donated and sold the baby clothes as the girls grew out of them, keeping only the sentimental pieces. However, we fell a little bit behind somewhere and ended up sorting through quite a lot of 0-6 month clothes that we left at the back of a closet. Now, my sister in law has recently found out she's pregnant. Her and her husband are really well off and had a son a few years ago who was dressed head to toe in designer clothes from birth. I didn't think they'd struggle for clothes. My boyfriend suggested we could give the clothes to his sister when she found out she's pregnant at a family meal, where my SIL was in attendance, but everyone sort of laughed it off so I thought nothing more about it. \n\nFast forward a month or so, we finally get round to sorting the baby clothes. My husband and I had bought the dogs some matching sweaters setting us back £20, so I had the grand idea to start cutting and sewing the clothes into dog sweaters and onesies for them to sleep in through the winter. My boyfriend thought this was a great idea, the girls loved seeing the dogs in their old clothes and it was super cute. I posted pics of them on instagram, and basically got a snarky text from my sister in law about how she'd have to be buying a new wardrobe then. I took it as a joke, and sent her a few more pictures of the dogs thinking she was being silly, and she kicked off. MIL started kicking off too. Next thing I know, my SIL is posting on Facebook marketplace asking for cheap/free baby clothes. \n\nSo, AITA for assuming my SIL would buy her own baby clothes when she didn't seem too pleased to have mine/dressed her first baby fully designer? As far as I know they haven't had a change in income, but am I wrong for assuming?",

Now I know this isn't a huge deal so every time she did it I would shrug her off or say something witty making her look childish or foolish.\n\nBut today she said my name I reluctantly turned around fully expecting to get flipped off but instead she said \"I'm sorry\" and nothing else, however I was weary of her apology for she's done things like this in the past and not really meant it. So I responded rather suspiciously \"OK we'll see how it goes\"\n\nThen she ran off crying for a couple minutes and then came back in the class and then shot daggers at me for the rest of class am I the asshole?

      "description": "Context: we are both students and my flatmates mum lives about 40 minutes away and the past few months my flatmate has decided to just stay there for most of the week, staying at our flat on average 2 nights per week. \n\n\nSince she has started doing this she hasn’t paid any bills, ie gas and electric, and up until now it was annoying me but I hadn’t said anything. I lost my bank card and I’m waiting on a replacement so I text her this morning saying “can you put gas in and I’ll transfer you money”. She sent back a cheeky text about how she doesn’t use it and so shouldn’t have to pay for it etc. Firstly, I didn’t expect her to pay, I was genuinely asking because I don’t have a bank card right now. Secondly, I only agreed to live with her, and to the rent prices (which are too high for me) on the pretence we would share bills?\n\n\nRegardless of if she’s here or not, the bills stay relatively the same, give or take a few pound on hot water. So now I’m paying all of that on top of £500 rent. \n\n\nLuckily for her, her mum pays her rent and her car payments, she also gets 500 in student loans every month. Whereas I have to pay all my bills myself, with half the amount of student loans and a part time, minimum wage job. \n\n\nAITA for expecting her to pay bills for a place she’s essentially not living in?\n\n\n\n",

My dad has been very strict as of late, not letting me and my sister go places that we he previously let us go to before, putting a time restriction on my phone, restricted youtube videos, getting angry when he has to take me places and actually come home when i have to go.  So yea he is very hard to converse with or try to voice an opposing opinion to. So when he heard that i was skipping a few assignments and handing them in later to keep up with my job which is important to me seeing how i rarely get out of the house, and we barely ever have money to spare. (or so my dad always tells me)  He got furious and said that i was being dishonest breaking our \"Healthy Relationship\" and threatened to take away my jobs if i didn't stick to his schedule.  my mom said that my jobs are good for me and was fine with me handing in assignments late, but there agreement stated that my dad was in charge of our schoolwork. and now he get's pissed every time i snap at him and continues to threaten to take things away  (my phone, computer, etc) so now i have to pretend to be cool with him so he doesn't blow up in my face again.\n\nTL;DR\n\n AITA for hating my dad because he threatens to have me fired because i hand in assignments late",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my friend to interact with the homeless around me?",
      "description": "I (F22) have a friend (M21) who is extremely Christian. He is conservative and proud of his American South heritage. I’m the opposite and this is not a big deal for me, but this is important later. He is strong to the point that he’s cocky about it. He has a lot of personal issues that people call him out on, and this has caused his friends to realize that he cannot accept that he is wrong. However, he is still a pretty good person.\n\nI am not strong and I don’t know what would happen if I was in a threatening physical situation. I was also raised near NYC. My father was a police officer and has always told me that, for my own safety, I should never engage with anyone on the street. You never know what might happen. Last year, I was in a situation with my male friend and my boyfriend that involved a homeless person approaching us and targeting me. He started cursing at me and the situation could have gotten physical had my boyfriend not driven away. After we were safe, I told them that this is why we should not engage with homeless people. I get that not all of them are dangerous, but I do not want to be involved as I am scared of what might happen. My boyfriend agreed with me and respects my wishes. My friend, however, laughed and said that he’s going to do whatever he wants if I’m there or not.\n\nFlash forward a few months. Said friend and I go on a class trip to a city in Europe. While we are there, he insists on engaging with every single homeless person he meets. He even goes to ATMs to withdraw money, exchanges information with them, and does whatever they ask. I told him that this made me uncomfortable, and he told me that I should just keep walking by myself if I didn’t want to do that with him.\n\nI told him that I’m concerned for his safety as well as my own; we’re in a foreign country and we have no means of defending ourselves. It’s one thing if we’re home, but this doesn’t seem safe. He claims that he can defend himself and that it’s his duty as a Christian to give to every homeless person. He claims that he has never had a bad experience, so nothing could happen with these people. He also implied that I am not a good Christian because of this. It got so bad that one of the people he gave money to saw him on a street again, called him out by his first name, and asked for even more.\n\nI am not against helping the homeless, but you can’t know what might happen. This is why I do not engage with anyone I encounter. I’d rather be safe and help by volunteering at a shelter. I’m not asking him to stop, but if we’re hanging out and I can’t leave, I would prefer if he did not do it because I do not feel safe. We’ve been in situations where this has backfired, but he simply does not listen. I’m guessing that some people are just going to tell me to leave the situation when he does this, but in most cases I am unable to do so. I also don’t want to just not hang out with him, as this does not happen often and he’s still my friend. AITA?",

I didn’t realize it was a joke at the time and it escalated.

      "description": "So my husband is currently unemployed, but is going to school full-time. He does 2 classes online and one in person once per week. I work 40 hrs a week sometimes 60 because we are understaffed. I also work mostly 12 hour shifts so I am exhausted when I get home. We have no children, just a nearly 2yo dog. I've asked my husband once before to do more around the house than what he currently does. It caused a pretty big argument because he thought I was insinuating that he did nothing. He doesn't really cook real meals, and he only pretty much does the basic chores like the dishes (but doesn't put them away, he leaves them in the dishwasher), sometimes does the laundry, dog care, trash, and will vacuum every once in a while. Lately with me working so much I've been wanting him to do more around the house. He never dusts, mops, sweeps, wipes down countertops or anything else besides what I mentioned up there. He probably plays video games for at least 6 hours a day as well. Some more background: when I first moved in with him, I did most of the cleaning and some cooking and un/underemployed at the time. Am I the asshole for wanting him to do more around the house? Am I expecting to much from him? I've been going back and forth about talking about it with him because I'm afraid I'll upset him again.",

      "description": "Some background, my sister is 18 years older than me so I wasn’t out of diapers before she got married and started having kids, making me an aunt relatively early. I love her kids with my entire life and I work very hard to make sure they never go without anything they need. Sometime last year she had asked me if I could take her two oldest children (teenagers at the time) to live with me so that they can attend a better school district. I immediately accepted, (even though I was only 21 at the time I had moved out at an early age and had managed to rent a house so I can accommodate two people). Everything was great, my niece and nephew are a joy to have around and they were old enough were i didn’t have to worry about cooking or cleaning up after them too much. \n\nThe problem started about a month after them staying over, although I rent a home, I do not own it, I do not have “house” money, I work hard and budget well and never live beyond my means because if I didn’t I would not be able to afford it and she knew that but she did not offer to help with her kids expenses at ALL. She never offered to help pay for food, toiletries or anything else they might need. I lived on my own, $30 worth of groceries could last me a week and half but $80 of food could be done within five days with two teenagers!! And I knew that bringing it up to her again would only cause a fight and the last thing I wanted to do was to make the kids think they were causing any issues. They are not the problem, they gotta eat, they need clothes etc, I was just disturbed that she wouldn’t help me knowing that I was taking them in as a favor to her and that I am not making a lot of money.\n\nI worked two jobs at that point to be able to cover all the expenses. I’m not gonna lie, being a 21 year old girl responsible for two teenagers, all the bills of the house, plus maintenance of the house (mowing the lawn, taking out the trash, cleaning the bathrooms) and two full time jobs, it was getting to me and I smoked weed in my free time to help me relax. Weed has never interfered with my work ethic or with my responsibilities. Ive never called off or missed bills due to lack of money spent on drugs so it shook me to my core when my sister found out I was smoking and immediately went to my landlord to try and kick me out. She said she didn’t want me around her (grown) kids because I was going to get them addicted and show them to be lazy and bummy, I completely shut her out after that. I don’t talk to her when I see her at family events anymore and I live my life for the most part like I don’t have a sister. I still am in close contact with my niece and nephews and I see them rather frequently but it’s almost always in secret which feels shitty and like I’m missing out on a closer relationship with them because of her views.

This also meant that we needed to get the other employee on board with picking up some shifts which, at the time, she had no problem with. Now it’s four days after the diagnosis and the confirmed stepping up for coverage conversation and the second employee needs to take three days off to “go out of state”. I am the manager of that store and all shift changes need to go through me and everyone knows this. She text my husband telling him she needed those days off. He runs two other businesses and simply did not reply because 1. He is not her manager and 2. He did not find her excuse for her time off to be justified after just having that conversation and not being notified of the time off then. I called her the next day to see what she needed the time off for but before I could even ask her she said she was busy and needed to go. I was watching her on the cameras and it was not busy. Now it is a week later, the week of the time needed off, and she text me (Hasn’t text me in 2 weeks) saying that because I did not give her an answer to get her license fixed she no longer needs the time off because flights are too expensive. How should I respond? I feel like an ass hole but I also feel like that she’s trying to make me feel that way. \n\nTLDR: after my employee offered to pick up shifts for her coworker with cancer she asked her non manager for 3 days off and avoided her actual manager then the week of vacation told the actual manager she no longer needs time off because the manager took too long to respond.

When we first started dating he invited me very often and it kind of went away. He then just started letting me after the shows happened. I brought this up to him and expressed that I really got into his shows and would like to know. A little bit of background here I am not a social person at all and he is so this is the only time I got out at all. Anyways fast forward a few weeks and it happens again when he stops telling me about his shows and even going out to a bar after the shows and telling me a few days later about those nights. Well now to today we made plans and I had text him twice asking him what he was doing tonight and told me he had to work at the gym after seeing me that’s all. He then sneaks in a conversation he has a show and I ask him it’s too late for me to go but why he forgot to tell me if I has asked him about tonight already. I honestly don’t feel he’s hiding it or purposeful doesn’t want to invite me. I approached it in a nicely manner and he broke up with me:/ so AITA for asking to be invited to my bf’s shows? ",

      "description": "I am a graduate student in a 8-person seminar. There are two undergrads in the course, one of whom is very overconfident and rude. We have debates during the class and he gets offended when people disagree with him (even though everyone is constantly disagreeing with each other). He also regularly makes references to the rich and powerful people he/ his family knows. When he speaks, classmates often look at each other and roll their eyes.\n\nToday in class, the professor asked a discussion question and multiple people raised their hands, including him. The discussion progressed, and he was one of the last people to be called on. He berated the professor for calling on him last and said he no longer had anything to say since so much time had passed. He and the professor were having a back and forth. I interrupted to tell him \"I think you're being disrespectful to the professor.\" He said \"no, I'm not\" and continued arguing with the prof.\n\nThe class continued and the subject moved on. He continued to participate, but I felt very guilty for confronting him and was quiet. It wasn't something I planned to do; it slipped out. I'm actually normally a quiet person, but I have been trying to speak up in class (in general) and intervene when I see people being bullied (the latter part referring more to instances outside of the classroom).\n\nAfter class, I apologized to the professor for intervening on his behalf. He said that it was ok and that he is used to people being harsh with him and it doesn't bother him (he is a very gentle and reserved guy). Other classmates came up to me and also told me they were thankful I said something. However, I feel guilty for the confrontation and wish I had said something to him in private. I wanted to apologize to him for calling him out, but he left the classroom before I did.\n\nTL,DR: Arrogant classmate started being rude towards a professor, I interrupted and said he was being disrespectful in front of the whole class. I feel guilty about this, but other classmates told me I did the right thing.\n\nAITA for telling a classmate he was being disrespectful to a prof in front of the whole class?\n\nAlso, should I email him to apologize for the confrontation? Or wait until next class to say something in person? Or just do nothing/ not blow it up further?",

I gathered evidence of the situation and presented it to the company they worked for, and he got fired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince his disappearance from the public eye, people having been starting to ask questions about where he went and why he isn’t working in the media anymore. Dozens of comments on Facebook and Twitter pages of the media organization he was a part of have gone unanswered by his former employers, as this has been a pretty hush hush issue for them. Dozens of phone calls from locals asking about where he went, all given bullshit responses, such as “he’s on leave.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be fair, the media company isn't trying to \"cover up\" that this happened, they just aren't addressing it publicly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I address this in a public forum and tell everyone the truth about what a monster this guy is, am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really don't think people like this guy, Bill Cosby, and Harvey Weinstein deserve to quietly lose their jobs and ride off into the sunset.",

Tonight I snapped at my mother, I’ll admit I was disrespectful and said a few words that were for the sake of being hurtful. I realize this was uncalled for and I regret how I acted but I still think that it wasn’t uncalled for. To give a bit of history over the past 2 years my (former) stepfather was outed as a meth addict and alcoholic and after a series of nasty events their relationship ended in divorce. Ever since then our family has of course gone through lots of emotional trauma. My mother started drinking before their separation and hasn’t stopped since. I’ve tried talking to her about it but it never really goes anywhere. On a personal level her drinking gives me anxiety, it reminds me of when my stepdad was still around and she drinks heavily on weekends. I suppose I just have no idea how to deal with this situation. The longer it goes on the more resentful I get and I gets into my head to blame her even though I know what she’s going through is worse than what I am. This turned into a bit of a rant and the more I type the more I think I should’ve taken this to r/confessions but it’s typed out. \n\nTl;dr I don’t treat my mother with respect when she drinks",

      "description": "This recently came up in a discussion between myself and my girlfriend, and is currently a hypothetical situation. For context, I am M27, she is F26, and parents M/F late fifties.\n\nWe live in a high cost of living area and my girlfriend has always lived in apartments with roommates. Her parents live out of state, and when they've visited in the past, she's let them stay at her place to be closer, and to save money. Whenever this has happened, she's given them her bed, opting to sleep on a couch or extra mattress herself.\n\nWe're in the process of moving in together (into a 1br) and will be sharing a bed and bedroom. Recently, the topic of her parents visiting came up, and at some point during this conversation it came out that she would want to give them our bed and bedroom, and have us sleep on the couch or an air mattress in the living room.\n\nThis had honestly not occurred to me and I said that I wasn't comfortable with that. Turns out we both have strong feelings about this but are both struggling to articulate why.\n\nIn listening to my girlfriend, I've learned that she views it as an essential part of being a good host to go the extra mile for your guest's comfort, potentially even sacrificing your own. She especially doesn't like the idea of having people who are a little older in anything but an actual bed (especially her parents). It sounds like a respect thing for her, and how she was raised.\n\nMy point of view is that while I'm very supportive of her parents visiting and want them to come, and want to host them in our home and make arrangements for their comfort, I'm just not comfortable giving up my bed to them. To me my bed is a very private and personal place for only me and my GF. Letting someone sleep there, especially with me in the other room, would feel weird to me, putting aside some practical matters like it would make having personal space in my home and getting to my clothes more difficult and honestly, a little awkward. I guess I just have some possessive weirdness around beds!\n\nMy proposed compromise is to invest in a really good air mattress and bedding so that we can still comfortably put them up in our place and they won't have to get a hotel, but she is not that enthusiastic about this solution. She really wants them to have our bed.\n\nThis hasn't really caused a rift between us, but I've been surprised at how strong our opinions are on this, leading me to second guess myself and wonder if I'm just being unreasonable. So, AITA?",

I was kinda pissed since this isn’t the first time he pushed his workload onto me but I kept it to myself.

      "title": "AITA for ignoring my mom when she asks if she can have some of the food we’re cooking?",
      "description": "My BF and I like to make food together, usually dinner.  Growing up, I’ve always been accustomed to cooking for like 7 people even when it’s just me and him. \n\nAnyway, he and I live in my grandparents home with them, my mother, and my baby brother (18). As far as I can remember, I have never made food for solely myself. if I’m in a regular mood as soon as it’s done I make the rounds and personally tell everyone in the house that the food is ready, but I generally ignore them when they ask what it is because I cannot cook without the whole house coming to investigate, so they KNOW what it is. When I’m in a bad mood or tired I make the food, get my plate, and head to my room. Usually a few minutes later I’ll hear them serving themselves and eating. No big deal. \n\nNever have I said “hey were are just making food for ourselves” or anything similar UNLESS it’s food that I’m taking to a potluck then I will let them know why I am making the dish. \n\nSo, every couple months my mom starts to look for fights with me. When I was younger we used to argue constantly, that was our relationship. But now that I’m older I just don’t care to argue as much. When she’s looking for a fight and I’m cooking one of the things she’ll do is ask “are we allowed to eat? / can I have some?” And I always ignore this question because I think it is unnecessary.  Usually that feeds the fire and she makes sure to tell my brother something along the lines of “here I’ll give you money to go get something to eat” or “are you hungry? This is just for them”\n\nSo, when it gets to this point, am I the asshole for ignoring my mom when she asks this? For me, it’s obvious that when I cook I make for everyone.  The only reason I’m asking is because she used my laptop a few weeks ago, and I saw a FB conversation she had with a friend saying that I was selfish for not letting them have some of the dinner I made so much of. \n\n",

      "description": "So I'm not sure how much detail to put here but mandatory I'm on mobile so sorry for any format issues. TL:DR at bottom\n\nI am late 20's and have just moved back in with my parents to save for a house. I've got a pretty low paid job, but should be able to save up enough in a year, maybe year and a half. Anyway, I am struggling to adapt to living back home with my parents as it is. I moved out over 10 years ago to go to uni, get a job get on with life etc. I moved away from my home town 10  years ago so moving home back has been strange. However, I have great friends from school who I'm still close with, but unfortunately don't see as much as I like, (no-ones fault, most are just married/kids/busy lives) so I spend quite a bit of time at home.\n\nGrowing up there were/are no major issues. They are essentially good people no abuse or anything like that. I do have some issues regarding privacy though, for example before going away on holiday as a teenager my dad once went through my luggage (can't remember why, just that it led to an argument.). Also they do slightly irritating things like knocking on the bathroom door when I'm in the shower/toilet telling me they've made me a cup of tea.\n\nI have on several occasions asked my parents, mainly dad to please ask before using my things. For example my car (which I bought, pay insurance for etc). This morning I woke up/came downstairs about 9:30 to dad walking in the the door explaining he took my car to get my radio fixed at a local store. I was literally planning on doing this today, and was using it as a reason for me to get dressed/ready so I could go into town and carry out some other tasks. But it just threw my whole day off and I lost all motivation to even get dressed (I'm also diagnosed with depression, so I try and set myself tasks to help me get up at the weekend). He noticed my mood was off, and asked what was the matter and I explained how it makes me feel as if my opinions don't matter if anything I say seems to be ignored.\n\nGo to this evening, dad comes in and said a neighbour is just borrowing my jump leads (which I keep in my car). Note, he's not asking IF someone can borrow them. Just that they ARE. I mean the answer would obviously be yes, if he'd asked, but he didn't. And considering the conversation we had literally earlier today I just loose all fight and don't see any point in bringing it up anymore. I have had the same conversation both parents so many times before.\n\nMy question is I am the asshole for getting irritated at my dad for taking my car and other things even when it's sometimes to do something useful (like fix the radio) when I have explicitly asked him not too several times?\n\nI think I am a bit sensitive about my car as well (it's not new or anything) because it's the only thing outside of the house that I can really call mine. And I love driving it to work.\n\n\nDL:DR I am the asshole for over reacting when my dad helps me out and takes my car without asking me first.",

      "description": "My girlfriend chatted me, asked if I was up and I told her yes, but I would be going to sleep soon. \n\nShe drove over to my place unannounced and tried opening my door without knocking or anything (normally unlocked if I’m chilling in the living room). This freaked me the hell out and I got up to hold the door shut before she said it was her. I opened the door and she said she just wanted a hug but invited herself in and tried to make herself comfortable. I explained to her that I was tired and going to bed, but she wanted to hug and cuddle and all that, and I just wasn’t in the mood. \n\nShe got a little upset when I told her to give me a heads up, or to ask permission before showing up at my front door like that. \n\nI told her that, 1. I like my alone time, I don’t know why but I just do, especially when it’s late and I had a longer day. 2. The way she surprised me scared the hell out of me. She told me to get used to it, and I had to explain those points a few times for her to agree not to just show up randomly. \n\nShe wasn’t mad at me, but it made her upset/sad. I feel bad, I have always felt this way with every girlfriend though. I’m a bit of an introvert and need a heads-up before hanging out with anyone. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Sorry for anything odd in the formatting or spelling, I'm on Mobil. \nSo to start off, my mom's friend had a baby, and since my mom's friend has been in my life pretty much my whole life, I consider her my aunt and consider the baby my cousin. I've wanted to be a mom my whole life but right now, I'm only 17 (just turned 17 a few weeks ago) and need to focus on school and working my part time job to save up for my first apartment, so I don't know that much about caring for babies. One day, my mom's friend, let's call her E, comes up to me and says, \"Hey - my name- wanna make a quick few bucks?\" I say yes because I was running low on money and I didn't want to have to dip into my savings to help my mom pay rent. (She's a single mom who can't work because if she works her medical will be revoked and each bottle of insulin she need to survive is around $300, so we're basicly able to pay for rent, food, and that's it, and sometimes things come up to where we might be late for rent) E tells me that she wants to take my mom out  and that I need to watch her baby for two hours and that she will be back here to get her at exactly midnight. E told me that she'll put the baby down to sleep before she leaves and I thought \"this should be easy\" by the time 2:00 am rolls around I'm having an extreme panic attack because the baby is crying and I don't know what's wrong (Not the greatest with kids and don't know that much on how to care for them, remember?) I've tried calling my mom 20 times and left 15 voicemails, and tried calling E a few times but it just went straight to voicemail. At 2:30 ish, E comes and gets the baby and leaves. The next day, I hear both E and her boyfriend calling me stupid and irresponsible for not knowing how to take care of a baby like they did when at my age they were already parents and were forced to know those things. Now when I talk to either E or her boyfriend they act like I'm a huge incontinence on everything. The reason I couldn't get should of my mom was because her phone was in her purse inside the bar while my mom was outside yelling at E to go home to get her baby. If you have any questions about the night ask, but am I and my mom the assholes here?",

      "description": "First of all, my hearing is absolute garbage so I usually don't know when I'm talking loud or listening to things too loud. \n\nRight before my dorm was closing for the holidays I found a note attatched to the wall across form my door. My roomate said that I listened to stuff too loud in my room, that he absolutely hates it when I bring my phone into the kitchen while listening to a video (I cover the speakers as I walk by my roomate's room) and I rarely have my phone at over half volume. He explained that I keep him up at night when talking on discord or listening to an audio book before going to sleep (unless I'm sleeping in the same room as someone I prefer not to wear headphones when I go to sleep). He then goes on to complain about how \"entitled\" I am because of the noise I make.\n\nI understand these problems, but the thing is, this is the first time I'm hearing this. He writes how this has been going on for months but he never said anything about it, showed no expression at all, frankly he barely talked to me. \nI would have gladly turned down the volume on stuff, or talk quieter but I had no idea it was even an issue. I have another roomate but he hasn't said anything about my noise and talks to me fairly often. \nThere have been 3 instances where my roomate has told me to be quiet and they have all been in the late afternoon/early evening and I immediatly quiet down. The last 2-3 days there was some banging on the wall but whenever I asked if anyone was there I got no response, which my half awake ass lead me to believe that he developed some sleep disorder where when he moves he hits stuff (my brother does this so I thought this may be it). Turns out it was him trying to make me be quiet. \n\nShortly after I came back out of my room the note was gone and I assume he doesn't know I read it.\n\nTL;DR: AITA for making my roomate leave due to my above average noise level without him even telling me if there was an issue?",

      "description": "This is incredibly long and I apologize. I just tried to get as much information out as possible for the fairest verdict.\n\nWhile we were going through the process of putting our  house up for sale, some friends wanted to rent it. We talked about it for a bit, and decided to offer to let them rent the house off of us for just the mortgage price -- without us making any money from the deal.\n\nOne thing led to another and the friends ended up moving in early. We're still not due to move until the summer, but they moved in back in January. We agreed to let them, and only charged rent -- no utilities since we have decent jobs, trying to be nice,\n\nThroughout their staying here (at the time of this writing it's been a little over two months), one came to us asking if she could get a dog. We own three dogs ourselves, so we really didn't see the harm. My wife and I have 3 medium-sized dogs so it was surprising when she got a very large Husky.\n\nThis dog is huge. The door to her room is now scratched all-to-pieces where the dog wants to be out. The dog also destroyed the backyard and the screen on our back window. I will admit that some of it was probably from my dogs as well. They're not entirely innocent.\n\nMy other friend felt as if she was incredibly lonely. Not having a pet, she requested if she could get an animal. She wanted a cat and we declined because my wife is allergic to cats. After a while of discussion she ended up talking us into it. Honestly, my wife and I are pushovers.\n\nI work from home. Saying that, I'm home a huge portion of the day. Our friends are at college or just out hanging out with their other friends until 11:30-12. So, everyday we sit at home all day having to hear the cat's cry all day nonstop. Neither of us can show it attention seeing as how she's allergic and I would have to scrub down/change clothes anytime I came in contact with it.\n\nHusky friend has also had her boyfriend staying here for the entire month. He doesn't really do anything. He's just living here using up the utilities that my wife and I are paying for. Initially when it was brought to my attention that he was coming, it was for the weekend. I feel like this is slightly unfair to my wife and myself since we're having to spend even more money on utilities.\n\nMy wife and I are still the ones buying the toiletries, dish soap, laundry detergent, pretty much any consumable used in the house. They do buy their own food but I'm stuck doing their dishes and cleaning up after them in the kitchen. I can't say they dirty up the communal areas much. Their rooms are absolutely disgusting and  foul-odors are coming from them.\n\nTL;DR: My friends moved in, got a dog and a cat. Dog tears things up and cat constantly meows to the point my wife and I are staying insanely stressed. Recently discovered wife is pregnant so the stress is extra not good.\n\nI really want a fair outside opinion.",

He never tells me until after he gets them and I am always the one who ends up taking care of them. The one pet I have actually wanted, a Bengal cat, he traded off without my permission because he wanted a Playstation. Every time he gets a pet he says he'll take care of it but he doesn't. If I didn't, they would die. I have confronted and outright argued with him about this but he seems to think all you need to do to take care of a pet is feed them.\n\nHe got a guinea pig recently and when he told me about it, I was furious. He told me it didn't matter what I wanted because it was his money and he can do whatever he wants. This is yet another pet I will have to take care of. So, AITA for getting upset about this?",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my sick wife?",
      "description": "Backstory:  Started dating at 17.  A month later she tried to break up with me while I thought things were going well.  I drove to her house in the middle of the night to find out what she was so upset about.  Turns out that she was pregnant.  We had only started having sex a couple of weeks prior.  My naive dumb ass asked if it was mine and of course it turns out she's pregnant by one of the biggest losers in school, her ex-boyfriend whom she dumped after realizing what a piece of shit he was.  \n\n(Side note, this dude has 4 kids;  my step-daughter, her half-brother (adopted by a new awesome father), a child with down syndrome whom he had with this 40+yo wife who died in a car accident, and another girl who got pregnant and ran to Washington state to get away from him.)\n\nI digress.  The entire pregnancy was a nightmare.  The father would stir up drama every chance he got and caused nothing but problems.  Tried to fight me at the NICU she was in for 3 months as she was born 2 months early, started rumors at school, confronted me, etc.  My father-in-law sat us both down and gave us this talk:  \"Life is about pussy. . .\" basically made us shake hands and agree to be gentleman.  That didn't last long as he started stalking us.  Also, while it was his weekend with the baby, we would see him at the mall by himself or with friends and no baby.  When asked, of course his parents were watching her.  Fast forward many years of compulsive lying and general neglect, HE CALLS CPS...ON US.  Told his doctor we were putting cigarettes out on her which was in no shape or form true in any way.  She's a \"picker\" and had picked some bug bites or whatever and of course when you pick your wounds they look worse.  She still does it today.  We decided after all the drama and all the pain he's caused our beloved daughter that he didn't deserve to see her anymore.  The child support payments stopped immediately.  It's now been 7 years without a single payment, but this isn't about him. \n\nMy wife is a type 1 diabetic with multiple complications as a result of her not taking care of herself.  We have struggled to get her on any kind of insurance or coverage that would help her with her diabetes.  While I was in the Army, she had Tricare which was awesome and even left us with 6 months of supplies after the fact which was a life saver.  Her complications go from being like 90% blind (maybe worse, eye appointment upcoming) - can't read the big E on the eye chart to missing toes to nerve damage to diabetic gastroparesis.  We are days apart (age 31) and she's suffering badly.  Now, all that being said, she doesn't check her blood sugar regularly, doesn't take insulin properly, prefers to have a blood sugar &gt;200 as opposed to 100-200 where it's supposed to be because being \"low\" feels so much worse than a blood sugar high.  Food?  Psh.  Anything fried or covered in sugar is her favorite.  Donuts, french fries, burgers, anything sweet that isn't chocolate.  I KNOW I don't help.  My diet sucks, I eat fast food constantly and I'm a little overweight and I love the sweets too.  Here's the difference:  I know I eat like shit and I want to change it.  I've made several attempts to change my diet and excersize more only to fail over and over again.  I've managed to stick to a \"low-carb, high vegetable, low-fat\" diet for a few weeks at a time, during which she is AWFUL.  Complains constantly, never stops talking about ice cream or gummy bears.  When we were short on time one evening, I said \"Hey, I'm going to burger king to get a salad...do you want one?\" - trying to at least nudge her in the general right direction.  'No, get me the triple double bacon with cheese and extra fries with a giant diet coke'.  I've tried this HUNDREDS of times to convince her to eat right.  Here's the thing, she's beautiful, gorgeous and FAR from fat.  I'm not trying to get her to eat right so she'll lose weight, I'm trying to get her to eat right to save her fucking life.  We've accumulated probably over $1,000,000 in hospital bills due to 9-10 emergency room visits a year.  When she gets sick, they usually keep her in the hospital at least a week and the recovery at home can be 2-4 weeks at which point the cycle starts over again where she's getting sick in that timeframe and right back in the hospital with an infection, DKA, gastroparesis symptoms, etc.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe started couples counseling last year but it only lasted a couple of months.  I started therapy and seeing a medications-provider (pyschiatrist) at the same time.  I have VA care so I can use all the healthcare options they have available including couples counseling but it does not include my wife's personal care.  During counseling last year (\\~May 2018) our counselor asked to give our relationship 2 more months during counseling.  We did all kinds of \"homework\" like remembering how we felt when we were first together and all this emotional stuff, but, I don't think she understood(the therapist).  I LOVE my wife.  Deeply, strongly and faithfully.  I've never been unfaithful and I tell her everything.  She's the only person in the world I can literally be myself around and she won't hate me for it, at least that's how I feel.  But, I don't know if I explained everything right or what, but, my problems with my wife are tangible REAL problems, not emotional ones.  It was always difficult to get her in the mood for sex but now that she's been sick(3 years now), it's stopped pretty much completely.  When it DOES happen, it's awful for both of us.  I know that sex isn't everything so I've looked past that.  I've asked her at least 1,000 times to do any of the following:  A)  Get a job, go to work, do something.  B)  Apply for college, go back to school, get some student loans, etc.  C)  Apply for disability.  If you're too sick to work, then you must be disabled.  With disability and/or a job comes health insurance, with health insurance you can see the doctors you need to see.  With doctors comes the inevitable healthier lifestyle and therefore positive changes in her health.  I gave the counselor the two months she asked for and I thought HARD about my relationship for months, I'm still thinking about it.  That August, I told my wife that I had made my decision and I wanted to separate.  I told her that I wanted our daughter to finish 6th grade before we split up the family.  She just started middle school and is in band for the first time and she's really been struggling to find herself this year.  I love our daughter as much as I love my wife.  I have asked and begged and pleaded my wife not to take her away from me like we did her biological father.  She swears she's going to let me continue being her \"dad\" forever.  I have every intention of taking care of her until I'm incapable of doing so.  Here's the dad thing too - we've lost 2 babies to miscarriage and had 1 early pregnancy loss during our 10+year relationship.  I have no biological children and that bothers me a lot.  She knows and we've NEVER used protection, birth control, nor have I ever really pulled out.  We know that we SHOULDN'T have more children because it would endanger her life but she wanted to give me a child and I wanted to give her one.  Fortunately, now, that never happened.  It now appears that we will never conceive a child of our own nor will she ever DO ANYTHING with her life nor will she ever be able to drive herself again nor will she be able to take care of her own daughter by herself.  In the last 2 years she's missed Halloween, Christmas, first period, Thanksgiving...and more that I can't think of, because she was in the hospital.    \n\n\nI don't blame her for being a diabetic, I don't blame her for all of the things that \"just happened\" to her.  I DO, however, blame her for her poor choices in taking care of herself.  I DO blame her for NOT CARING ENOUGH about her own life to get herself right for our daughter.  I have a small glimmer of hope, less than 1% chance, that she'll let our daughter stay with me when we separate.  I gave her almost an entire year to figure something out and here we are, 3 months away from the date that was set and she's WORSE now than last year instead of better.    \n\n\nTL;DR:  Type 1 diabetic wife doesn't take care of herself, has serious complications from it, has no intentions of fixing anything or getting healthier and has been quoted as saying \"I just want to get her to 18\" (our daughter).  I'm letting her stay with me and I'm still taking care of her until May when we \"separate\" - probably followed by divorce.    \n\n\nAITA?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is really hard for me to post because I have anxiety really bad and I think everyone is going to be angry at me.  I'm not a bad person, just in a bad situation and I don't see any other solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for telling my roommate not to patronize me?",
      "description": "Things have been weirdly tense in my apartment as of late. I share it with three roommates; we are all undergrads. I thought I wasn’t a part of the tension until now.\n\nOne of my roommates, H, has been sort of annoying about cleaning. She is a clean freak except doesn’t clean her stuff up to the same standard she holds others to. Stuff like leaving banana peels, dirty dishes, and other trash on the counter, but getting mad about the trash not being taken out or the floors not being swept. As a result, we’ve made a chore chart of sorts to determine who does what when. \n\nImportantly for this, I am almost never at the apartment except to sleep and shower, as I work 30 hours a week along with going to class. I pretty much never use dishes, and when I do I clean them up immediately. In the conversation with the chore chart, it was pointed out that this means I don’t have to do as much stuff in the kitchen, which was reflected in our chart. In this conversation it was also acknowledged that nobody had any problems with me.\n\nTonight, one of my roomies, B, sent a text in our groupchat (it’s hard for all of us to talk in person because of schedules) about laudry. It was a salty text, which I get because she works long hours and H is loud and wakes her up a lot. \n\nIn this conversation, I said if anyone has a grievance they should “call me out”. I meant this in the colloquial sense, but could have phrased it better.\n\nH took it literally. At the end of a message saying she wanted to work everything out and get rid of the tension, she says this: “also @(my name), if you could do the dishes or sweep or take out the trash every now and then that would help.” I took this as patronizing, as we had already discussed our roles regarding chores and I have been doing my jobs.\n\nI responded: “H, i understand your concern and will work to be better, however i’ve been following the chart for cleaning and i don’t even use dishes more than once every two weeks. i want to emphasize that i am just as invested as you all are in making sure there isn’t tension.  things have been really tense in the apartment lately and to be completely honest i’m kind of confused as to why. that being said, please tell me if you have anything you think i need to work on. however, H, i really don’t appreciate being literally @‘ed when it comes to something like this. i may be misinterpreting as it is easy to do via text, but that sounded super patronizing.” \n\nH gets offended by this and then says I shouldn’t be offended by communication when I just said I was open to being “called out”.  She then continued by saying that she doesn’t get what the big deal is and that she doesn’t feel comfortable in her own\n\n I’m upset because I wasn’t under the impression I had said anything wrong, but H’s response has me feeling like I have. I kind of feel like I’m being gaslit by H.\n\nThat being said, am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So I was in a library at my university trying to finish a fairly large term paper that was due the next day. Needless to say, I was stressed. I chose this particular library because it's out of the way and is probably the quietest library on campus.\n\nI had been there for about an hour when I hear a pretty loud belch from a few seats away. \"Kinda rude\", I think to myself, but I continue on with my work. Maybe 20 seconds later I hear another loud, obnoxious burp. This continues for probably 10 minutes. Every 10-30 seconds this guy 10 feet away from me lets out of these sonic boom burps that ricochet off the walls and shelves in the library. I look around and make eye contact with a girl who is sitting even closer to him. She has a pleading look in her eye that is telling me I HAVE to say something. I decide its time to take action.\n\nI get up and go over to this guy and stand next to him and say, \"excuse me\". He has headphones in which makes it much more awkward because now I have to wait for him to notice me and take the headphones out. I say \"excuse me\" again a bit louder, and he pulls them out. \"Hey man, do you think you could keep it down?\" I say in the most non-confrontational tone I can muster. His response still haunts me... \" I have a disease. I can't control it.\" Oh shit. I must have said sorry ten times as I back-pedalled away.\n\nAITA?\n\nI mean, if he knows he has a condition that causes him to be loud and disruptive, he could excuse himself from the library until the episode passes... right??\n\nOr should I have just kept my mouth shut?",

      "description": "I’m a 19 year old college (UK) student and live with my dad. I do the dishes, and when my girlfriend comes, she tries to help. However, I have quite a particular way of loading the dishwasher in order to make it as efficient as possible, and make everything fit. When my girlfriend “helps”, she just randomly stacks stuff. I said to her that she can help if she wants, but if she could try to do it the same way as me, or I would rather do it myself.\n\nWhen she didn’t do it the same as me, I asked her to sit down and let me do it. My dad got angry and told me to stop being a dick, and my girlfriend got annoyed. I’m just trying to do the dishes the way that I like to! I appreciate her help but I would rather do it myself in the way that I like than it all be messy. AITA?",

So I'm going to omit some of it to make it comply with rules.\n\nSo tonight someone that I considered a friend came around for some drinks. After a couple I went to bed because I have work early.\n\nShe had previously kissed this friend (whilst drinking, never sober) and I was somewhat paranoid, so I when it went quiet I got paranoid and sneakily poked my head around the corner and it turned out my gut was right and they were kissing. So I confronted them there and then, I told him to fuck off and told her that we wouldn't be hanging out/seeing him again.\n\nShe ran outside to 'check that he wasn't driving' because he was drunk. I didn't know but she took a razer...\n\n(hopefully that's vague enough to avoid being deleted, sorry mods if it isn't but it's kind of a important point)\n\nI go to the medicine cabinet to get medical supplies (trained first aider) and she sprints out the door, and manages to lose me around a corner.\n\nAt this point I had no idea what to do so I rang the police, who found her 30mins later about half a mile away and decide to Baker act her. I didn't get to see her before they took her away.\n\nI feel like an asshole for doing this and I'm scared she's going to hate me when they release her. ",

I don't mind touches on my arm or hugs when greeting, but she'll touch my face, grab my waist, grab my hand just randomly when we're walking etc. I finally had enough yesterday when she rubbed my thigh when we were talking and sitting next to each other waiting before class and I was like \"can you not touch me so much goddamn\". Now I know that sounds kind of rude when writing it out but I said it with a jokey voice so it didn't sound that bad (but I was serious). She was like \"oh really\" in a jokey voice and kept touching me. And I was like \"no but for real though I don't really like being touched that much\" and she was like \"oh okay\" and stopped. But I feel like it kinda made our friendship weird because she's been acting kind of distant ever since...so I don't know if I could have expressed it better or something..\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I've included my mom on my cell phone service and she has an s8. All I hear is how it's too big, it changes things around when she hasn't done anything and she hates it. She asked to upgrade to a new, smaller phone. It wasn't time for an upgrade my mom's phone but my daughter kindly decided to downgrade hers, so we could trade it in on an upgrade for my mom. After my mom did a lot of research and went to the store to try them all, she decided on the s9. \n\nI bought the s9, switched all her stuff over and she freaked out because some of her messages were missing. Not the messages to her, but her replies to them. Freaked. Then eventually made her peace with it, kind of. Between taxes and activation, I'm into this phone $75, not including the monthly payments. I'm poor, she has plenty of money. \n\nOne week later, she hates the phone. I explained that it's running Pie, and the s8 would be getting the same software within days, but she wanted to switch back. Fine. Cheaper for me. She agrees to pay the restocking fee for the returned phone.\n\nI'm in the process of switching it back, transferring and restoring pics, music and all. It takes forever. I don't mind doing it, but she's irritated beyond all hell. \"Ugh. Why does it take so long? Why is it missing? Why is it doubling up on things?\"\n\nI explain, just wait for it to finish, it may be missing a few things but all your pics and music will be there. If there are duplicates, I'll fix it.\n\nBut she keeps bitching. \"I'll just take it to the store next time!\" Fine, but don't get pissed at me for helping you with it.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I told her she needs to get her own phone service? I'm honestly tired of dealing with it, her change of mind, her complaining about it. I feel responsible when any of it goes wrong. I don't mind helping her with it, but I'm tired of the guilt that comes along if something breaks or goes missing. She can more than afford her own service, adding her to my plan was just a way to pay her back for the things she helps me with financially.",

      "title": "AITA For voting to fire the CTO of my startup 2 months before his vesting cliff?",
      "description": "For those who dont know a vesting cliff is basically the moment a startup founder receives a portion of his equity. Like lets say you started a company with someone, but you didnt know them that well, youd give them equity gradually after theyve been with the company awhile. That way they dont just claim ownership and then leave the first week without contributing.\n\nIn this case the CTO of my company had a vesting schedule of 4 years, with his cliff at 1 year. So this means if he is with the company a year, he immediately receives 25% of his equity. So if his equity is 20%, he receives 5% ownership right there. Then for the next 3 years he gets equity every month, gradually until he gets all of it after 4 years. Thats how its supposed to work.\n\nNow, if you dont make it to the cliff for whatever reason, you get nothing.\n\nSo now that that is explained, I am the COO of a startup headed into series a funding. The CTO is someone whose been with the company for 10 months. The issue is, he doesnt have much in the way of qualifications or education. I mean he is educated but theres nothing special or unique on his resume besides one small project before us and our project.\n\nThe investment group interested in funding us is trying to free up as much equity as possible, so theyre looking to trim the fat and prevent issues down the line. We are of the opinion that they want a superstar genius as CTO. The CEO of my company, along with the CVO both met with me to discuss cutting the CTO loose before his cliff.\n\nHe would basically leave with nothing after 10 months of work. They asked for my input and I recommended firing him and replacing him with someone with a wider skillset and a better pedigree.\n\nI am the one who broke the news. He did not take it well obviously as we did basically deny him potentially millions of dollars down the line and a high paying job to boot. He also lost any claim on his prior work, naturally.\n\nAITA? Should I have kept him through his cliff?",

The trip sounded awesome and we wanted to bring as many nice people abroad as we could. So we decided to invite a girl from our class (we knew she had a bf, but neither of us have a romantic interest in her). \n\nA little side-note: me and my friend had gotten ibto trouble with her bf earlier this year, because he didn't want us to be around her, to talk to her or to even greet her, needless to say, we were surprised, because he normally was very confident in himself. Also, this friday he caught us laughing and talking and he told her that he will ,,Talk\" to us.\n\nSo here we are, sitting at a coffe shop, when I get a message from her telling that she can't come because her bf didn't want us to spend time with her. This made me super pissed off and , even if my friend didn't show it, I could tell that he was kinda dissapointed too. We started talking shit about how insecure he was and how she needs to find someone who lets her have guy friends. We plan on discussing this with her on next monday.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry in advance for the long post. \n\nI graduated for college in December. Since then, I've job hunting and studying to become an engineer in training (EIT) by taking the FE exam. Honestly, studying at home is always a challenge as it's myself, parents, and two brothers (both over 30) in a one bedroom apartment so I normally go to the library or somewhere else for a more productive environment. \n\nSince I'm back home, whenever I go out in the evening I send my mom a detailed text message of where I'm going and what time I'll be vack by. Latest I've ever gotten in the house was 1:30am the one night I was at a concert.\n\nSo fast forward to start of this week, I'm working part time at the government agency where I had an internship with and more than 2 weeks out from FE exam and feeling good about it. I was an RA during college and a few of my old residents invite me to see their play production at the local campus on Thursday. I think that's a cool thing to do after work and text my mom letting her know.\n\nI get home. My mom calls me into her room and my dad is already there. She begins by saying \"Your father and I received your request and we don't think it's in your interest to go because you need to focus on your exam.\"\n\nNow my parents are Carribean immigrants, so any questioning or refusal of their authority is concerned taboo/punishable by death. But for me I draw the life at being told living my life is a \"request.\" This is also one of three times this month I've gone out after work or in the evening.\n\nI explain where I'm coming from and all that. They don't want to hear to. So I'm like \"Alright. I'm going regardless.\" \n\nThey look at me with disgust and give me the silent treatment the rest of the week. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, right?\n\nReddit...AITA?\n\n\n\n",

I live in a house with 4 other roommates (all early 20’s) we all have our own rooms, and for the most part get along well. However, one of our housemates gets very passive aggressive about things. He will get mad at us for being awake at 10:30 PM on the weekends playing music, come angrily address us all if one pan is in the sink for more than 30 minutes, and even took away the speaker we all chipped in on because “we were using it irresponsibly”. \n\nSo the last two weeks he has been meal prepping each week and storing his meals in Tupperware. We each have only a little bit of space in the fridge, and have used the same shelves/drawers since September. He has been putting his food in the one drawer I use, and I have mentioned it to him twice. So yesterday I went to put away my groceries and his food was once again in my drawer. I had enough, so I took his food and left it out on the counter. It spoiled and he was extremely upset with me and got two other of our roommates to call me out on it. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA? Is he?

      "description": "To start out with, she did have the best friend title and I had it for her, but we are very different and fit better in different cliques so we've both agreed that it's okay to go different ways like that. This decision was made about a year ago when I started dating a guy and found a small friend group I really loved. \n\n       Fast forward to now, she and I have two classes together so we hang out during them like normal. However, whenever I bring up conversation about things I'm interested in or currently working on at the moment (we're both artistic and love trying new medias) she kinda of gives half-assed responses. I get that talking about certain things with no shared interests can kinda be dull, but maybe I'm wrong in thinking she should at least try to sound anything but bored or annoyed? \n\n        Anyway, this isn't just some topics. Every morning now when we see each other, whatever convo we have, if it's something I'm talking about she just gives off this annoyed look. \n\n  I also go to her for advice occasionally, because I have like two friends that are girls while the rest of my friend group are guys. So I go to her for advice on girl stuff, or just life advice because she can be really keen on giving good advice. \n   \n  For the past few months though, when I go to her she again responds with an annoyed tone. She says 'I don't know' or 'Dont ask me' for everything. I get not knowing what to say but when it's said like I'm being an annoyance it pushes me away. \n\n She comes to me for advice too, which I'm fine with. I try to answer with my honest opinion and what I believe is the best advice from my POV. We're both seniors in highschool, adulthood is around the corner. The two of us have matured, however she acts very childish if the advice is not what she wants to hear. She proceeds to get annoyed and just end our conversation right then and there.  \n\n When she's talking about her projects and current happenings I try my best to actively listen and engage with her. But lately I'm not feeling it. If she can't return an small interest in my life hapenings then I just feel that I should distant myself from her, especially after we graduate. I feel like I am working for a good friendship with her while she couldn't care less if I was there or not. I feel like this relationship isn't worth pursuing anymore if it's not mutual. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way and thinking about cutting ties? \n\nTdlr: Friend of 5 years doesn't seem to put effort into our friendship anymore and it comes of that she's wants attention from me but not a mutual friendship. AITA for wanting to cut ties? \n\n\nEdit: So I brought it up and she kinda just tosses the subject to the side like normal. However, she seems to be treating me differently. While it's not all the time, she is listening more and generally being interested in what I conversate with her. She's not completely done with showing indifference and annoyance but I have noticed a difference, which is what I could ask for for a start. \n\n ",

      "description": "*This is quite a long story*\nDisclaimers :on mobile,throwaway cause I'm\nparanoid, English isn't my first language.\nThis happened few months ago.\nbackstory : in my country military service is mandatory unless you have some sort of medical condition. If you do,you can choose to volunteer to service the country in any other way. My service was very new : 6-7 LGBT roommates in 1 apparent volunteering in different schools by day and working with LGBT youth organisation in the afternoon.\nIn my first year I loved working at the school,the teachers were great and the students and I had great connection.I learned a lot about the special education world and wanted to go to uni for it once my service was done.\nI did not like working for the organisation at all. I liked working with the youth and help them in any way I can,but the people responsible for it were completely unprofessional and went as far as cancelling a seminar I worked on for months a month before it was due.\nWe have one person who represents the organisation,she was horrible. and another person(V) who is responsible for the school project- she was a sweetheart.\n\nThe story itself :\nThis was in the beginning of my second year,I was frustrated with the organisation but stayed because I loved working at the school. Some roomates left and V found some new ones,we all got along great for a while,had so many laughs and I genuinely thought it's gonna be a great year.\nUntil a month later when a girl called Z joined the apartment.\nI knew her from before and I heard she did volunteer only at the organisation with roommates who also worked there and none of them got along with her,but I gave her a fair chance and tried my best to make her feel welcome.\nIt wasn't long until she started getting on people's nerves.stated picking on others because they weren't vegan,kept suggesting they try it and convince them that they're wrong for eating meat - not respecting them telling her to stop.\nShe also kept intervening in other roomate's business.   I didn't show up for an organisation seminar because of my medical condition and she made a whole fuss about it because \" we are one apartment and should represent the same things,and if you don't like the organisation,why aren't you leaving??\" I told her I like the education part but she kept asking me this until we had a fight where I told her its none of her business why im here and i was here before her.\nIt went like this for the whole year,other roomates decided to stop talking with her altogether because she was constantly trying to boss them around,we couldn't tell non PC jokes to each other without her triggering and fighting with us,she tried to force people and tell them their mental problems because \"it will bring us closer\" and was just an overall bitch to everyone who disagreed with her.I once told my friend a joke with the word \" butch\" in it and Z heard it-so she went around telling my friends that I'm a misogynist..it cost me in a loss of some friends.\na whole year of being policed at your house wasn't fun,she was always looking for a way for her to \"educate\"us which came across as very condescending - I don't need her lectures about how horrible I am for eating meat and not caring about the organisation. She never helped us clean and always left dirty dishes around the house- when we brought them to her room and left it there she cried and told us she will complain to V (V knew she was problematic but couldn't kick her out)\n\nSo,the big fight :\nWe were supposed to clean the apartment,I came home early and it was only her there. I wanted to rest because I has a rough day,I asked her id she wanted to help me clean some stuff &amp; wash the floor  and she agreed.\nWhen I put some stuff in the other room,she decided that \"because I put them in an angry way, I'm mad at her so she won't help me\"\nAfter a whole year of hearing this kind of bs from her I've had enough,I yelled at her that she tries to be a victim and she went to her room.\nI started to wash the floor by myself and she came back and just sat in the living room full of water not even trying to help.\nI asked her \" why are you such a bitch?\" \nShe started screaming - calling me disgusting but I yelled back \" no shut the fuck up alredy,this is why no one in your last apartment liked you,and everyone here hates you and I can't wait until you leave and I won't have to see your ugly face again you fucking bitch!\" \nand I stormed off leaving the floor wet.\nI did end up apologizing because I was harsh on her,it was just frustrating to always be criticised in your  house and not being able to make it stop despite asking.\n\nSo Reddit..AITA for what I said to her\n\n",

But around the same time I reached out to a close friend and he and a couple other friends have really been my crutch to get through this. One of these friends and I have recently gotten into a relationship and I’ve really bonded with him. He means a lot to me and he’s constantly worrying about how I am. \n\nWell yesterday I came home, and I had some faint hickeys along my neck. Nothing too obvious but still there. My mom flipped and went off on me about how I claim to believe in God but then do things that are inappropriate. She asked if I was sexually active (which I am not) and how I can claim to be chaste when I’m with my boyfriend. She eventually said I was not allowed to visit his house and if he wanted to see me he would have to come to my house, because I obviously can’t control myself around him.\n\nI’ve really been struggling with loneliness, my appetite and grief and I feel that if I let my mom control my relationship like this I could fall into a deep depression. These boys mean everything to me and while I don’t want to hurt my mom, I feel like she is going too far. I know she worries and she herself is struggling, but this doesn’t excuse her behavior. \nAITA for putting myself first? WIBTA for ignoring her and doing what I feel is right for me?",

      "description": "I should preface this post by saying this incident happened several years ago back when I was in college, but my feelings on the matter have remained consistent over the years, so I think it is still relevant enough to share. \n\nBack in college, I was at a house party with mutual friends. One of my friends, Ryan, must have just gotten an “A” on his political science 101 paper because he was very eager to discuss some recent political hot topics. Not normally a great line of conversation for a casual Friday night, but everyone taking part pretty much had the same liberal-leaning ideology, so it was mostly just everyone nodding and agreeing with one another. \n\nAt one point, the conversation came to illegal Mexican immigrants and how our country should deal with this. I don’t remember how the conversation got to this point, but I said that I am emphatic towards Mexican immigrants, but the least they should do is try and learn English if they want to immigrate here. \n\nRyan and several other mutual friends got fucking PISSED!\n\nThey were railing into me about how “English isn’t the national language of America” and how “I shouldn’t annihilate their cultural identity.” I was so confused because I have zero problem with Mexican immigrants who can’t speak English. IMO, they are always welcome to speak whatever language they want, in public or private, but I just think it is arrogant and displays a high degree of entitlement (especially coming from those seeking out help and a big lifestyle change) if you think the country you’re moving to should adjust their behavior for you. If I wanted to move to Japan, you would be sure my first course of action is picking up Rosetta Stone instead of getting pissy that my English language skills aren’t working well in Tokyo. \n\nAm I the asshole for thinking this way?

      "description": "I moved into a 6 person house in July of last year. Getting another 5 people together was proving really difficult because a couple of people were very noncommittal. One guy dropped out and a girl, let’s call her Anna, said her friend would want to live with us. Her friend, Emma, moved in at the start of July with Anna, but Emma hadn’t yet signed on officially or paid the deposit (Anna had). Then suddenly both of them turned round and ditched the house citing some bullshit reasoning and decided to live in a two person flat on their own. We then scrambled to find new housemates, one of who had to pay for the first months rent even though she hasn’t lived in the house in July because Emma never committed. \n\nThat was all a massive hassle for all of us and meant that I lost out on some paid work in the summer because I had to be at this house to sort out new tenants rather than in my hometown. I was very happy to set all that aside until the other day I asked who’s boxes of clothes have been stored under the table in the living room. I had assumed they were my housemate’s but it turns out they belong to Emma and she has not been to pick them up. A couple of us have reached out to her on social media to ask her about what she wants to do with all her stuff but she doesn’t reply. I want to get rid of the stuff because it takes up lots of space but I’m not sure what to do with it. So WIBTA if I sold this girl’s stuff? \n\n\n",

He is the oldest of 7 kids and takes on the 'big brother' role.  My boyfriend, we'll call him B, has asked me to let his brother move in with us again and I don't want him to.  Here's the backstory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the 4 1/2 years of us being together, we have had 3 siblings live with us.  Sibling 1 lived with us for 6 months.  Sibling 2 lived with us for 8 months, got kicked out, he talked me into letting her come back and she stayed another 6 months.  Sibling 3 stayed with us for 4 months and was doing his parole with us, is back in prison now and is wanting to complete his house arrest/parole with us.  Last time sibling 3 stayed with us it was horrible for me- he was manipulative, lying, had no respect for our property and even tried to break B and I up, broke all the house rules, tried sneaking in his gfs all the time...etc.  It was an awful situation for everyone, it was always a fight with him and it seemed never-ending.  Now B says that he feels bad for me and how I was feeling during that time and swears this time will be different and he'll put his foot down etc etc- but I have a pretty good understanding of his personality by now- Sibling 3 is the way he is and I don't feel like having to parent a grown man (he's 28)  just so he doesn't throw a temper tantrum. Countless instances have happened and I do not feel the need to list every single one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhenever I bring up that I would be miserable with him living there B says that yeah it's awful but no one else will take him, since he burned bridges with everyone, and I don't understand because I am not from a big family.  Then he goes on to say that he would feel responsible if he went back to jail and someone needs to look after him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am about to graduate next year and would love to have a life with just me and B, without his siblings living there and the headache that they bring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to say that he's grown and responsible for his own actions/life?

      "description": "Throwaway here.\nThis might be long so bear with me. I'm a recovering alcoholic. I relapsed at the end of last year and I'm struggling. I also pay 100% of our rent, utilities and 80% of our groceries. This will make sense later. \nMy GF's best friend and her husband invited my GF, our two small children and I to a trip over memorial day weekend. The husband is a big drinker but I figured if it was just us and them it wouldn't be too big of a deal. They just had a baby. I did expect them to drink but I didn't think it would be everyone getting sloppy. Well my GF told me after we accepted the invite that two of the husbands friends and his parents are going. They are all big drinkers. I've heard stories about their family get togethers and they sound a lot like when I would drink, everyone gets sloppy and behaves obnoxiously. Had I known they were going initially I would have declined. For a few days I was trying to find a way to tell my gf I didn't want to go but couldn't. I am a bit ashamed honestly. Well a few days go by and my gf mentioned to me that her BFF and her were excited we were all going. My gf then says \"I'm getting wasted so you'll have to babysit me and the kids\". I told her I wasn't going to do that. She became confrontational and said why wouldn't you take care of the kids. I explained how I feel. That she withheld info and has put me in a vulnerable position and that I wasn't going. She could leave the kids with me or take them, whatever she wanted. She said I was being dramatic. I slept on the couch and we've barely spoken. She texted me saying since im not going I  need to take the Friday before off so she can ride with them.  Im not going to. It would put a financial burden on me, since I'm the breadwinner at home and pay most of our bills. This was also not discussed when we first talked about going or I would have said no. WIBTA for not taking that Friday off? She probably won't be able to go because now she's planning on riding with them and they leave Friday.",

I was upset about being the butt of a joke and expressed that I didn’t like it, she than said that I was overreacting. \n\nShe than started to have a go at me about many things from the past such as how I asked her to pay me back like she promised too even though I knew she was saving to go on a trip overseas, how I had spoken to her old friends even though she asked me not too (I still feel bad about this one) and how I had ‘ditched her’ at the park to get to my train or else I would have missed it. \n\nI started to become really overwhelmed and said I didn’t want to talk about this until tomorrow face to face so we could figure it out properly.\n\nShe said that if I stopped texting it would be unfair as she would be left worried and that would cause her anxiety, I once again said that it was making my anxiety really bad and that I needed to step back too. I explained that arguing was getting us no where and it was the best thing for both of us to stop. I also told her not to be worried as we would sort it out and that it wasn’t the end of the world, we could figure it out tomorrow.\n\nAfter I sent that, I didn’t open Instagram until this morning. When I opened my phone, I got messages saying I was a terrible friend leaving her alone and that her grandmother was sick and I hurt ignored her.\n\nI can’t help but feel like an asshole, I know she has anxiety just like me and I feel like it was selfish to just place my self and my mental health above hers.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Allow me to explain. My sister is married with two kids but apparently she was talking to an ex of hers about a year ago. Well his girlfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out because they were talking about how she's not 100% happy in her marriage and how he was going to come through and see her while he was on his haul. He's a truck driver. Anyway she got into it with his girlfriend and I understand that she lives in a remote area but she could find better things to do with her time then stirring up drama with other people.\n\nShe's saying someone shared screenshots with her ex's girlfriend about stuff that she was saying. I told her to talk to me about something else that she had posted about on Facebook last night while I said that she could. Then she comments I would suspend I need to know that you're not the one that was sharing the screenshots with his girlfriend. I said first of all I would never do that and secondly it hurts me that you would think I would do that to you because you're family.\n\nWhat I really wanted to say to her was well maybe if you stop stirring up drama you wouldn't have these problems. If you know that a man is attached then leave him alone ex or not. Especially because he's an ex. I feel that she has nothing better to do but the spend her days engaged in bullshit and drama with other people. I can totally understand her ex's girlfriend being upset. \n\nBut yet she seems to think that she's not in the wrong here. First of all I feel like she is doing stuff behind her husband's back that she wouldn't want him knowing about it and secondly she's holding her ex's girlfriend responsible when in reality it's her fault. Also, I'm not too happy because it seems like she's not spending enough time worried about her kids and instead is worried about what everyone on Facebook is doing. Stop worrying about that Facebook drama and start spending more time with your kids.\n\nMy niece is four and I suspect that she may be autistic. It seems like not enough is being done to help her. I mean I don't know because she lives two hours away but from what I'm hearing from other family members and what she's posting on Facebook she's not addressing this like she should be. I'm just pissed off that she would even accuse me of doing something like that when this is her fault. Would I be the asshole if I told her that this whole thing is her fault and that she needs to stop talking to her ex especially when she's married and knows that he's with someone else?",

      "description": "TL;DR: I was bitter and sarcastic to my friends and they collectively decided I no longer belonged in the friend group.\n\nA lot of shit has happened in the past few days, but I'll try to summarise it as best I can.\n\nPretty much I have trust issues and my best friend was my first real friend. I also was \"friends\" with a few other people who they knew. According to them in the past, I had really helped a few of them, even apparently saving the life of one of them (planned suicide). The problem is, I have a lot of serious issues with depression and suicide myself and so many times I could be a bit of a downer, but I never tried to complain about my problems to them, and I always avoided telling them about my past and my struggles. This is where it gets complicated.\n\nI'll split this into a few parts for each person.\n\nMy best friend, who we'll call Apple. I met Apple about a year ago, and we gradually became best friends. Apple was the first person I trusted in a long time and my first real friend. We helped eachother in times of need and I think gave everything I could to help make them feel better. However, as of late I imagine I have been rather judgemental, due to my own personal struggles. It was frustrating and confusing to see my \"friends\" getting better and happier and me still being the same person, lonely and self-destructive. Of course, I didn't tell anyone this, but when Apple told me they had a date, I may have reacted in an... unfavourable way. I didn't say anything inherently rude, but I think I came off as a little salty and jealous. Shortly after this, Apple asked me what was wrong , and I told them it was none of their business. For a solid three minutes, and 13 messages, they probed and probed, not taking no for an answer. Eventually they said \"fine, if I'm no good to you, I'll just leave.\" My response was \"Okay, have a nice night, sleep well, and enjoy your date.\" I then went to bed. Apparently Apple wasn't actually being serious, and me being my Asperger's self, I completely misread that and made them feel rejected.\n\nNow, we'll talk about Melon (don't worry, this will all tie in at the end). Melon was a girl who previously had feelings for me that were not reciprocated, however, I feel I was always nice to her. According to her, I saved her life, and I also listened to her story and gave her a lot of support, and told her I would always be there to help her. She said the same about me, talking about how much she would always care about me. She proceeds to forcibly demand I tell her my past and my story, and says she won't judge me. A few days later, I have a Multiple Personality Disorder episode where one of the people inside of my head comes to the outside, and says some very eery (but again, not inherently bad) poetry type stuff. Later I apologise for the episode and say it won't happen again. She makes a post on her story which my anxiety tells me is about me, so I ask if it's me she's talking about. She gives a reply something like \"My life doesn't revolve around you,\" and my response is a sarcastic jab, \"It's called anxiety, and it eats you from the inside out, not that you'd know anything about mental illness, would you?\" This is weeks after I help her figure out she's bipolar. Admittedly, it was very insensitive for me to say, but these people became friends with me knowing I was sarcastic and bitter. I literally warned them.\n\nPretty much, she flips out because of this, and proceeds to call me insane and unstable for having Dissociative Identity Disorder, calls me \"pity-seeking\" (keep in mind she dragged my story out of me) and insults me in other ways too. She gets Apple and both decide that they don't wanna be my friends anymore. They tell me I never did anything for them and that I'm a terrible person and never loved them.\n\nHere comes Carrot. Carrot is someone who I was somewhat close to, and friends with both Melon and Apple. In the middle of the night, while these people's stories are lighting up with a hangout I wasn't invited to, she messages me telling me to back off from her friends. I'm like \"are you kidding? lol.\" and she tells me I killed her friend group and tore them down. \n\nEnter Rutabaga, Carrot's best friend. We almost had a relationship, but we decided to wait. Carrot tells me Rutabaga has no respect for me because I hurt her friends. I now have 4 people who are telling me I was never a friend to any of them, including the only person I truly trusted, Apple.\n\nWhen I show Carrot screenshots of chats showing that I was being prodded at and insulted, she denied it and continued to give no reason as to why they all hated me, just that I ruined everyone's mood and brought them all down. This makes me feel really guilty.\n\nTo end the story, they all left me and took another friend with them, Kumquat. When I commented under a post of Rutabaga's saying \"Nice aesthetic, I like it,\" Kumquat replied saying \"thank u, next\" to which Melon replied \"HAHHAA 😂\". in the end of this all, I feel really ridiculed and as though I can't trust anyone anymore, BUT I also feel like maybe it was all justified?\n\nAITA for making my friends feel like I'm cold, even though they knew that's who I was? It hurts, but was I the antagonist all along?\n\nThanks for the advice,\nBanana",

      "description": "This is a sticky situation, I'll try my best to explain it...\n\nHigh school prom is in three weeks, and ever since the beginning of the year, there's this one girl I've been wanting to ask to prom. Back in October, the two of us (person I want to ask) were good friends, nothing to think too hard about. One of my close friends told me I should \"focus on her,\" since we're both encouraging friends. And so things stared going smoothly for the first few months. But both her and I became busy with school, and as college applications + side projects subtly piled up, we gradually kinda stopped talking to each other. Not entirely, but we used to talk everyday not that long ago... I'll just say there is definitely some awkward wall between us, not sure how else to explain this\n\nI know I've been irresponsible as a friend and all that stuff, so I've been trying my best to patch things up with her in February/March. My initial problem was that I wasn't sure if she would want to go with me, since things had gone kinda out of hand.\n\nBut the real problem happened this week on a hiking trip with friends. The same close friend casually asked me if I wanted to go to prom. Now, literally back in early February, the two of us were talking about potential prom dates at a birthday party. We had both told each other who we wanted to ask, and at the time they were obviously different people. Let's call my \"date\" person A and my close friend's date person B. \n\nDuring our hiking hangout(about two months after the birthday party), my close friend tells me person B has a boyfriend, and that he wanted to ask person A. I couldn't get myself to say anything to his face right then and there, but I have texted him over this. He gave a couple of inconsiderate excuses, and now, despite asking again to have a calm discussion over this, he's been ghosting me :/\n\nNow a third friend told me that my close friend had told him that \"oh, I think OP and person A havent talked in forever.\" This is true to some extent, and I feel godawful about it because it is lowkey true. although I can't do much over being busy and stressed over college.\n\nMy close friend has told me that he assumed I moved on from person A, which I just find really frustrating. I would have told him if \"things weren't going well,\" since we were friends and all, but I guess not. I'm not really sure what to do, it seems like he is going to ask her without really confronting me about it first (kind of a scumbag move, but rn whats more important is the end result)\n\nFirst of all, AITA?\n\nSecond, would it be reasonable to ask my close friend to all go together as a group of friends, but neither of ask person A? I don't really expect to end up asking person A anymore with this knowledge, which means I won't be asking anyone else...",

      "description": "Important context this happened about 4 years ago,  almost 9 years ago my wife and I lost our child due to being stillborn and we haven't tried having kids since. Fast forward to the event I'm making a trip with my wife to pick up my brother from the airport. He is in a sour mood from the flight and apparently he just didn't have a great time. He then starts ranting about how much drama is in his life and that not everything needs to pertain to me and my wife which is a point he brought up. I'm lost on his tirade and just stayed silent because it's not the first time he has done things like this, idling while he digs anything and everything as 'ammo'. Then he gets to the point he wanted to say that I need to get over my daughter deaths. \"You need to get over your dead daughter and go fuck yourself\". This has me beyond angry, but my wife isn't paying attention while she is currently driving. I of course repsond telling him to go fuck himself and his response is to reach in the front seat and attempt to punch me. This ends with me lunging into the backseat at 70mph down the highway choking my brother out. Wife stomps the brakes and pulls me off him. The rest of the car ride was quiet. \n\nSo now my family is super pissed it's been years since I've even talked to him and they want me to to make up with him since he is willing to appologize for doing \"Nothing\", he told everyone that I just attacked him with no reason. They want us to be able to spend time together doing Christmas and Thanksgiving and want to invite us both. So Am I the Asshole my family thinks I am?",

      "description": "Me and some of my friends were at a garage party just hanging out playing some pool and there was another group of guys we didn’t really know but we were talking to having a good time with and one of my “friends” (what i’m guessing) was trying to look cool in front of them and every time i’d do something he’d make fun of me (I do a lot of random dumb shit at party’s trying to make it interesting) and the funny thing was, was that the other group of guys thought i was funny they were laughing along with me and we were having a good time, idk if that made my friend jealous or what not. so than throughout the night same thing went on and than we were starting to leave, (it should be noted i didn’t drive anyone to this party and wasn’t planning on driving anyone home, i live just down the street) one of my friend lives a 30min walk away so i offered to drive him but he declined so I was like “alright guys i’m gunna head out” my “friend” that was being a dick was like “ya drive me home” I told him no and that I wasn’t driving him home, he lives on my street (which is MAYBE a 5min walk). When he went in to get his jacket I got in my car and went home, he than texted me saying something like “wow dude what the hell you’re a fucking dick” and than he deleted and unfollowed me from all social media. this all happened last summer and I have yet to talk to him since. It was a long time coming, he would always make me the butt of jokes to put himself higher.\n\nTL;DR / Moral of the story\nAITA for not driving my friend from a party that was being not a nice person towards me (he lives a 5min walk away)",

      "description": "This happened a few semesters ago, but I've been wondering about it ever since.\n\nDuring finals week, I went to use the restroom, and I noticed someone had hidden a textbook behind the garbage bin. Presumable to cheat during their exams. So, since nobody was there, I just put the book in my bag, and brought it home.\n\n\nMy reasoning is, the only reason why somebody would leave a textbook near a trash can is:\n\n1) Because they wanted to throw it away, which in that case, I have no qualm in taking the book.\n\nor\n\n2) Because they were using it to cheat on their finals.... which honestly, that's on you. Don't leave stuff lying on the floor if you don't want people to take it. Besides, you really shouldn't be cheating in college, it isn't fair to others who actually bother to put in the effort to study.\n\n\n\n\nThis wasn't like a basic 101 class textbook, this was a big beefy, 300 level class... so the person cheating, was cheating for a test in their Major. And if you have to cheat to pass in your major, then you're in the wrong major (and probably shouldn't even be in college).\n",

The things she has done and is still willing to do for her family are honestly heroic and without her I don't know where I would be now. \n\nThat being said, my (maternal) grandmother is flagrantly and blatantly racist; whether someone is Hispanic, Black, Asian, or just all around non-White, she shamelessly has something negatively racial to say about them. She openly says \"sp*c\", \"ch*nk\", and \"n*gger\" (censored for politeness) out loud and in my presence, seeming not to care that I can be described as two of those things. \n\nAn example: when I last saw her, we were driving through town and passed by clearly labelled Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean restaurants. Unprovoked she said, \"These fucking ch*inks are taking over, filling the place up with their shit and not paying rent\" and I just said \"Nana, none of those restaurants were Chinese, you can't say that.\" She responded to this by doubling down, saying that all Asians are the same. An anecdote my mother has told me is that when I was an infant, a Black man approached his car, parked next to my mother's, and my grandmother called him the n word. \n\nI go to school several States away and use that as an opportunity to avoid contacting my grandmother because her racism deeply hurts me, especially when she targets people in my ethnic groups. A couple weeks ago, my mother and I got into a heated argument because I said I was no longer going to tolerate my grandmother's comments or behavior. She said I needed to have respect for my grandmother and put my issues with her aside and contact her. \n\nAITA for not wanting to speak with her? ",

      "description": "I had a hard time wording this, so I'll explain better here. Her and I have been talking for months now. She's been a close friend of mine for a very long time, but she was in a relationship for a couple of years and I kept a respectable distance because her boyfriend was crazy. She would reach out to me once in a blue moon to tell me she hated him and felt \"stuck\" within her situation. She would go on to do this until she finally broke up with him. \n\nFast forward to when she told me they had broke up, we started hanging out again.  I knew that she liked me but also knew she needed space because she was freshly out of the relationship. I let her make the \"cues\" first before I made any moves. It started with her cuddling me, then we moved on to kissing, and it got to us touching each other mildly sexually. This was, so far, the limit. She doesn't want sex, any form of it. Of course this is fine with me, although it has been going on for about a month now, and she'll initiate some sexual teasing, which will arouse me, but then she will just stop and refuse sex with me. I'm a man who respects sexual boundaries but it kinda drives me nuts (no pun intended.)  Well after seeing her all this time, I realized it is I who has mostly hit her up to hang out together. I have received some good morning texts from her, and she'll usually text me back when I message her, so I feel like I'm overreacting. But, I hung out with her two days ago and she was really tired from work, so I told her I would leave so she could get some rest. After that, I decided I would wait for her to text me, because I have texted her first for the past week or two. She hasn't messaged me and it just feels like she isn't as enthused as she was at first?  I feel like an asshole just having these feelings and I think it's because she is having problems coping with her last relationship, but I'm just rattled about it and I don't know if giving up is a fair option. \n\nI just can't tell if she really likes me or if she's using me to fill a personal void from her past relationship. Please give it to me straight Reddit, and feel free to AMA. ",

      "description": "I was never really a cat person.  I grew up with dogs and personally prefer them over cats.  I got my cat kind of through an ex.  She lives in a small city with a lot of stray cats and used to leave food outside for them, she knew their personalities and would name a few of them.  As I was leaving her place one night one of the cats approached me.  She got super excited because that one had always been super timid and stayed away from everyone.  But it started rubbing up against me, letting me pet her, letting me hold her, etc.  The ex basically talked me into taking the thing home with me, which I did because the cat had some kind of connection with me.\n\nThat week I brought her to the vet, got her shots, got her spayed, and got medicine for fleas and worms.  She was also very thin when I got her, so I made sure she had good food and occasionally wet food.  It's been over two years now and I am just completely apathetic to this animal.  Look I have been a good pet owner.  She goes to the vet regularly, I buy her toys and play with her, I even bought her a 6' tall cat perch thing that she likes a lot.  Her litterbox is always clean, she always has good food (never bought the super cheap stuff), and I make sure to spend time giving her attention.  But I just have no emotional connection to this animal.\n\nI've always been an animal lover too, people that abuse animals make me fucking sick and I still can't watch My Dog Skip.  But I'm also just tired of being tied to this animal.  I'm tired of sweeping cat litter, and getting rid of the odors, of cat hair and things getting knocked off tables.  I'm really just tired of taking care of an animal I feel nothing towards.  I honestly think if I had an animal that I actually loved, I wouldn't have a problem doing any of this.\n\nThere's also a part of me that thinks she would probably be better someplace where the owner actually loves her.  But I'm also pretty sure the cat has already bonded with me pretty closely, and she's still very timid around anyone else.  So I'm not sure if giving her up wouldn't even be best for the cat at this point.  I was going to give her up within a few months of getting her, but felt super guilty about it and decided not to.  So here I am again, questioning my judgement.",

Lately, she’s been coming over, which I don’t have a problem with, but it’s the fact that she stays until 3-5 in the morning. She sometimes even falls asleep in the bed...lol. My boyfriend doesn’t say anything because it seems like he doesn’t care that much, but I kind of do. I want to tell her that she kind of overstays and gets too comfortable but I don’t want to seem rude about it. I don’t know, would I be an asshole for saying something or should I just consult my boyfriend first because after all, it is his room? ",

We're making out while heading up to my room and she whispers in my ear \"I want you to fuck my ass\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow i'm not sure about most guys (which is why i'm on here asking) but to me fuck my ass sounds like she wants butt stuff, I wasn't sure at that point so when we get to my room, starting tearing off each others clothes and making out in my head I still wasn't going to attempt butt stuff since I guess the vulva is located very near the ass when in doggy so she could be using short hand. When she gets into position however she moans \"fuck my ass, yes fuck my ass\" and that was enough for drunk horny me to be convinced so I went for the poop chute. Immediately she yelped and says stop so i stop immediately since I'm not a rapist and jump of the bed and she's screaming at me over how retarded i have to be to fuck the wrong hole. I told her I thought she was telling me to fuck her asshole when she was saying fuck my ass and she called me autistic for taking it literally. I get a little testy and say it's not that common to say \"fuck my ass\" as something meaning regular sex and why she couldn't just say fuck my pussy instead and that made her really mad so she got dressed while yelling at me claiming I did it on purpose and left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's in the same program as me so I'm kinda worried she's going to start going around telling other girls and maybe my friends that I tried to fuck the wrong hole on purpose but honestly I just thought she meant asshole when she said \"fuck my ass\". Am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "So, I have this client/ friendly acquaintance / borderline friend that, for the past two months, has been trying to schedule a dinner between six or eight people (all busy professionals).  Understandably, it's difficult trying to coordinate the schedules of a bunch of busy people, but I feel like I've reached my wit's end with the bi-weekly string of text messages and emails with new proposed dates because someone can't make it, or a restaurant is booked, or whatever.  It's gotten to the point that she's throwing around dates in March and April, and this coordination has been going on since October.\n\nI really just want to be able to say \"No, I'm not interested in having dinner with you at an expensive restaurant an hour from my home on a date certain two months from now.\"  But I can't because we send each other business somewhat regularly, and we've done work for each other's businesses too.\n\nI'm getting pretty annoyed by now because (1) I have no idea what I'm going to be doing in two months.  There are millions of things that could come up that would take priority over a friendly/professional/networking dinner.  (2)  She keeps suggesting high end restaurants that I really have no interest in going to.  Sure, we can all afford it, but I really have no interest in paying $150+ for me and my wife to put on a tie and drive an hour to sit uncomfortably at a white table cloth dinner with a waiter that comes around with a crumb scraper.  (3)  I have no idea if I'm going to be paying for myself, if the bill is going to be split between all of us, or if her business is paying for it.  I definitely don't want to sign up for splitting a massive bill with some of the other boozy invitees.  (4)  I would be much more inclined to attend if she said \"I'm having a BBQ at my house on this date, a bunch of people are invited, come if you can make it!\"  I just don't feel right making a commitment two months out, and I don't want to feel like I'm obligated to go to this thing if she keeps moving around the schedule to make sure I'm free on that date.  (5)  If she wants to be friends, let's be friends and do friend stuff.  If she wants to do professional networking, set up something professional.  But I can't stand this constant blurred line between the professional and personal relationship that she's trying to ride.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to commit to a dinner with someone who sends me business?  Is she the asshole for expecting commitment so far out?",

      "description": "My SO wanted an outfit matching a particular dress code for an upcoming LARP (live action role play). It was a Friday evening and the LARP was scheduled for the next evening, and the dress code was pretty simple (pants &amp; long sleeve shirt, no collar). The dress code was 100% optional and only intended as a means of getting into character. The LARP only had about 20 people in it, and it wasn’t any official event or anything, just something to do for fun.\n\nMy partner drove me to the thrift store to help choose a shirt, which again, could have been almost anything, and was totally optional. We didn’t check the hours beforehand, and when we got there, we noticed that the store closed at 6. It was 5:46. \n\nAs a rule, I try not to enter a store less than 30 minutes before closing. I know retail workers are generally expected to have the store closed and cleaned by closing time, and I don’t want to be a dick to retail employees who need to close the cash register. Whenever I’m with someone who wants to enter a store that close to closing, I am super apologetic and try to make sure we leave as soon as possible. My partner knows this.\n\nMy SO, who is a retail worker, insists that the store is open, so customers can still be there, and that the employees just have to deal with it. \n\nWe went inside, and the cashier, the only worker, informed us that the store closed in 5 minutes. My partner made a remark towards me that she was rushing us out early and was annoyed by that, insisting that we had time. \n\nI looked through the dvds while my SO looked for shirts. I thought my SO could handle finding a shirt alone, and figured I was around for consulting if necessary but didn’t need to help look. Meanwhile, the cashier was getting more and more annoyed. A couple more people walked in, and she informed them that the store was closing soon.\n\nSO keeps asking my opinion on every shirt and then rejecting every single one. I say to just pick one so we can leave. SO tries on a couple, can’t decide, and keeps putting them on the rejected clothing rack. I see something I want and decide to buy it, go up to the cashier and pay for my item, apologizing for being there so close to closing. Cashier, visibly annoyed, says nothing. \n\nMy SO comes out of the dressing room a but later, pays and reminds me to pay for my item. I say I already paid for it, like 10 minutes ago. I get a snarky response and my SO gets upset at me for rushing us and being annoyed that it took so long. We leave the store and my SO points out that we weren’t even the last ones to enter or leave the store. I say I don’t feel comfortable being in a store that close to closing.\n\nThe cashier was clearly rude here and shouldn’t have been rushing us, but I think she was perfectly justified in wanting us out sooner. I think we were assholes just for being in the store, but was I the asshole for getting upset that my partner took so long?",

      "description": "As far back as I can remember, my dad wasn't content if he didn't inflict pain on most things that were small, defenseless and weak. Specifically, my siblings and I. This is basically your typical abusive household where I couldn't even so much as bat an eye and before I knew it, I was a recipient to a backhand square to the face. I firmly believe that my father derived some sort of pleasure or satisfaction by making us and my mother feel inferior and truly undeserving of anything else good in this world. I wasn't exactly deprived but what I did have, was mostly provided by mother that made a living off of scamming people. As far as what she did to sustain us, that is a story for a different day. As time went on, he never actually improved and it got worse. My mom became a literal punching bag for him. My mom was never defiant and besides trying to stand up for herself from time to time, she was pretty docile, for the most part.  I've gathered from most of my uncles and aunts that being raised by my grandparents on my dads side was hard in every sense of the word. They each can recollect a time when they have been subjected to an indiscriminate amount of hatred. When my father would recall memories from his upbringing I would view this from a very empathetic point of view. My father would remember times during his upbringing where he sustained multiple beatings and punishment that felt truly unwarranted. I would like to make it a known fact that I too, have a child of my own. I have never laid a finger on her and as far as I am concerned, I am a firm believer that you can discipline your kids without the need for violence. I should have probably prefaced with this but I am a second generation Mexican-American and living under an abusive household in my culture, is pretty common.  Common in my eyes but not acceptable. I would be more than happy to reveal more details about how shitty it was to grow up in a home where walking on eggshells seemed less of a punishment than what actually took place where I grew up --DM me. Let's fast forward to 8 years later and I get the news that my father is getting deported to Mexico because he is being accused of sodomy, rape and countless other charges by a woman whom he had married after my mother. I have wondered for a while now if the charges against my father were actually true or if he had pissed off his wife to the point where she felt like the only way out was to press charges and get him arrested seemed like the only viable option. Either way, he is currently back in his native country and barely making ends meet. I feel like I need to address the nightmares where I dream of beating up my father and  it varies from dream to dream. In some dreams I beat him to a pulp with my fists  and in other dreams I am bludgeoning with a huge, blunt object to the point where he is almost unrecognizable. I do not wish to have these dreams but they come about, subconsciously. I have researched dream interpretation sites and all of them, for the most part, insist that hatred and resentment on this level, pretty much affirms what I have been feeling all this time. My father has lived in these states well over 20 years so he doesn't know much else. Since his recent deportation, he has had to assimilate and re-adjust to an environment he has not been a part of for a very long time. Because of this, I am receiving a lot of pressure from both my siblings and my relatives to provide for him in a way that would allow for his sustainability. I do not wish for advice. I have adopted a pretty firm stance that I will not provide any support. I have lingered on this topic for far too long. I have never been close to my father and at this interval, I don't care for it much anymore. Would I be so heartless as to say that I don't care whether he lived or died? I am pretty strategic, along with my partner about where most of finances go and cutting into what we currently have going on, would not allow for an additional expense, especially when dealing with another human being. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So a girl I went to HS with has a degree in journalism, and is now going back to school for her bachelor's in nursing. She's in her second year, and just posted asking for almost $3000 to go to Peru to give medical care to locals. I'm not exactly sure what kind of care a person with no medical experience and only in their second year of school can provide, and all I can think is that it's just one of those \"mission trips\" that are vaguely disguised crowd funded vacations. I wouldn't say anything since it's not my business, but am I the asshole for thinking that's all her \"mission\" trip is? She talked heavily about how it's a \"spiritual\" journey. What does that actually mean when you're supposed to be giving health services to people who cant afford it? Of course any good that's done of it is great, but I mean how useful can she actually be on this trip?",

      "description": "(My english isn't the greatest, sorry!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I've got myself into a mess of a situation. To start off, I was 17m, my girlfriend was 18f. We'll call her dirt. So, I had just started up another year of school. And already from the last year, I've had my own circle of friends. Consisting of 3 males, including myself. And 3 females. A balanced group, a few of them; dirt in particular, I've never really paid much attention to, and didn't really care about them as much as the others as they always had their own flaws that annoyed me. Now me, being decently young back then, didn't really ever have a girlfriend before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to my shock, only about 2 months after knowing dirt. The messenger of our group, we'll call her mike, so mike, had just received a little gossip on dirt's recent crush, which just so happened to be me. At the end of the day, mike told me about it. I was mind blown, confused, dumbfounded. Basically a surge of emotions rolling around screaming what the hell is going on?? But I made up my mind. I wanted to try having a girlfriend, and so I did. The first few months went smoothly, she was so kind, and i was kind straight back. And the time we spent was fun. I couldn't have really asked for more. Then, at the end of the school year; my parents decided they'd like to finish my education by homeschooling me. Naturally, being myself. I agreed on a whim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until later when I looked into it more, that I realized I wouldn't be able to see dirt anymore. So our relationship would become long distance from now on.  So we went our separate ways, still together. But not in real life. In the first 3 months, I was hit with a heavy depression by this fact. I wouldn't leave my room for hours and i stopped caring about things. And to make things worse, when I finally recovered. She changed, she was like a different person almost. It was subtle but I could tell. At the time i had no clue and blissfully passed it off, but looking back now the signs were clear and I had the chance to run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is when it started, no longer theoretically being in moderation by me, she was free to do as she wished. And as such, she could change her priorities. So she started caring less, as dumb as I was, even I saw this coming. But the thing is, there was so much more to it. even now I don't know the half of what she did behind my back. She started being friends with my sister, and she started ERPing as well, (which stands for Erotic Role Playing) Of course at the time I had no clue she did this as I trusted her enough to not have to look on her social medias, otherwise I would have immediately ditched her for cheating.  And after this, started the deception and lies, she would lie to me. I would want to confront her about things she's been doing that don't really sit well in a relationship. But every time, she would pass it off. Then talk to my sister,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm not just being jealous here, she genuinely cared about my sister more than I. And I wasn't to happy as you could imagine, as that's not how this works. Multiple times i confronted her, to not avail. But, in the end started to grow knowledgeable. I realized that my issues can't be solved by no means that i've tried. And that I need to end it. She's showed all the unspoken and implied signs of a manipulative psychopath. So how would i go about this? At the time, I was still my too nice for my own good gullible self, I couldn't simply end it by talking to her about it, even on a whim. \n\nSo out of ideas, and approaching the 2 year mark for our realtionship, I decided, if I'm too weak to end it. I'll just get her to end it for me. So, I did the thing that annoyed her the most. Surpassing her, every time she tried to speak something factual, I would correct it, and the thing is, it was super easy, she's not the brightest so almost everything she said would have a bottom line or different answer. Eventually, she had enough and we finally broke up. There's more to this experience, but this is all that's relevant to the title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in all in all, I simply want to know Am i the asshole for doing what I did? And did i need to do it that way? Or were there better choices here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: 17m, 18f girlfriend started off nice and happy, moved on to be a pyscho, discovered things about her.\n\nDecided to try and end it, not good enough to end it, so i let her do it for me by getting her to a point where she was sick of me.",

      "description": "So a little background, me and my boyfriend were looking into renting our first home in about 3 weeks. The area we are looking in has next to nothing available for what we need. Fenced yard, updated, pets allowed, in our price range, etc. And I mean we scoured the entire state almost looking for something. Well I finally found something! Super cute, reasonable, everything we needed! I'm super excited at this point.\n\nWell I get back and my boyfriend tells me his family is going to buy us a house and we are going to rent it from them/pay it off in the meantime. I get it's a great opportunity but it bothers me a lot. And he got incredibly angry at me for not being super excited.\n\n-First; we arent married and in no way is this \"our\" house. It's his and this really makes him angry that I look at it like this. My parents are in no way involved. HIS parents are gifting this to him. \n-Second; I didnt want my first home I ever buy/help buy to go like this. I really like working for something (building up a down payment) and really feeling accomplished and achieved afterwards. It really steals that from me. He doesnt really understand because hes never saved up to buy anything. \n-Third; It bothers me my parents arent at all involved. My mother is a realtor and I really wanted both parties involved but more of a side line. Not a middle man acting as a decision maker. It makes it less enjoyable. His parents are going to dictate what we want. \nFourth; This is very stressful having such little time and little money they are giving us. I didnt want a super old home as our plan was to purchase pretty high when we were ready. But I feel accepting this offer would mean we would have to live in it for a good portion of our lives. We are still fairly young. I didnt want to be looking at school districts to make sure my kid will be going to a good school.\n\nThis is all very overwhelming and just way to much. I just want to do things the old fashioned way. Did I deserve getting such a intense response for not being excited and just meh about it? AITA? \n",

      "title": "AITA for not taking my friend's side in an argument?",
      "description": "I am currently a freshman in university, and so far I have gotten along well with a select group of friends, which I will refer to as friends A, B, C, D, and E.  I live in the same dormitory as A, B, and C.  At the beginning of the school year, A and B got into a really heated conflict/argument, and it ended up becoming pretty personal, with A getting so mad as to yell at B that she was a \"disgusting person,\" and the 2 have been avoiding each other ever since.  I personally did not see what the conflict was about, and although the 2 kept avoiding each other, I would still regularly hang out with both of them individually and try to avoid talking about it with either group.  Ultimately, C, D, and E all took to the side of B (some of them had witnessed the conflict and some of them had not), and I decided that I could not fairly judge who to take sides with so I decided to remained neutral.\n\nFlash forward to a few days ago, and I have been hanging out with A fairly often, and A really only hangs out with me.  I am still friends with B, C, D, and E, and we still regularly hang out and go out together, but I spend a lot more of my free time with A.  One night, after me and A came back from a party and were both fairly drunk, we ran into B, C, D, and E.  A stayed fairly quiet when we saw them while I started to make conversation with them.  As I was wrapping up the conversation and about to leave, A loudly made several rude remarks to B and walked off.  Later that night I heard B, C, D, and E talking in B's room about how shitty of a person A is.  They kept calling him names and attacking his character, while also mentioning that I have shitty taste in friends and that they don't understand how I keep hanging out with A.  I did feel bad about this, as I know A much better than they do, and although A can come off as a bit arrogant and brash (he was featured on a pretty highly up voted post on r/iamverysmart), A has opened up a lot to me about some shit that he's gone through and I don't think it's fair to just call him a shitty person like they were.\n\nA ends up coming into my room, mad that they are talking shit about him, and proceeds to rant about them to me, attacking the character of not only B, but C, D, and E as well.  A then complains that, in this conflict he has no one on his side, and that I should stand up for him and defend him because we are supposed to be friends.  He acknowledges that I didn't want to take sides in this conflict, as I never join in while they talk shit about him, and as I always try to avoid talking about it- but A argued that I should be more assertive and defensive of his character to my other friends when they start talking about him.  I continued to refuse to take either side, and said that he should respect my wishes to stay out of it, especially since I have to see B and C all the time.  He then accused me of only liking him because he has connections to fraternities around campus and could thus get me into parties.  At this point, I was pretty fed up with him for saying that and I just told him to leave my room if he thinks that little of our friendship.\n\nAfter some reflection, I feel like I definitely could have handled the situation better, and at least made a promise to A to defend his character if I were ever around while they are talking shit about A.  I have reasoned that doing this isn't necessarily me taking a side, as long as I start to defend B's character whenever A talks shit.  Maybe I should start being a better friend in general.\n\nAm I the Asshole for not defending A?",

      "description": "I didn't originally think this was a problem, but I saw the judgement on another post on this sub and thought I'd ask.\n\nI don't often get hit on when I'm out, but it's happened a couple of times that someone will stop me when I'm out and about, start a conversation and ask for my number. I try not to assume that a guy is just out for my number when they start talking to me, or assume that they must be looking for something. If they do ask for my number I tend to give it to them and block them later, because I don't like the potential for confrontation. I've had some guys be ~really~ persistent when I say no, and it gets uncomfortable.\n\nSo a little while ago, I was walking to class and this guy T starts talking to me. He says he wants to get to know someone on campus as he's just visiting, so I tell him he has about 30 seconds as I'm almost at my lecture and don't want to be late. At the end of this conversation he calls me gorgeous and asks for my number, and I give it to him. He sends me a message later in the day and I respond saying I'm flattered, but I have a boyfriend. He never responded to that, which was the intended effect.\n\nI always tell my boyfriend about these little events and it's never been weird, but I can't help but feel a little icky about it. I don't know if I need to be more forceful about saying no.",

      "description": "So for the last few years I've been struggling with depression. I used to be very vocal about it, posting about how I wished for death's embrace on public platforms and sharing depression memes/posts. These days though, I've been doing better since I started getting professional help and making lifestyle changes (like cutting out depression and suicide jokes from my social media feeds) months ago.\n\nI have friends who also have depression. We've been friends even before I started getting help, and we still talk though not as often as we used to. I try my best to support them during their episodes since they're either unwilling or unable to get help due to lack of time, money, or just the belief that it won't get them anywhere.\n\nSometimes though, it feels weirdly suffocating to talk to them. The dynamic we have just isn't the same and there are times when I feel like my mind's going back to a bad place when suicide gets brought up. I want to help them but the ways that worked for me either don't work for them or they're unwilling/unable to try, so I just don't know what to do and end up feeling helpless as well.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to slowly distance myself from them because of this? I care about them but at the same time I just can't handle the heaviness of depression talk with them anymore, and it feels like we get nowhere when we talk about their problems. We don't really have much keeping us together other than the ranting and venting because we don't really have much in common other than being depressed.\n",

She's not introverted, but rarely goes to anyone other than me to talk / hang out)\n - Still lives with her parents\n - Want's to start her own art company rather than pursuing a job after college \n  - Has severe depression and anxiety issues\n\nI:\n  - Have a full time job, and applied for jobs constantly throughout college \n  - Have an active social life with twenty or so friends I talk to or spend time with regularly\n  - Own a car and rent my own apartment, paying for everything I have without any assistance of my parents \n\nI don't mean to say \"I'm doing great and she's not\", I'm just offering my perspective on our \"preparedness\" for life. It's no judgement on her character, I assure you.\n  \nWhen talking about the future for the several years we've been dating, I've expressed that it's important that she have some plan for her future, or at least prepare for it. I don't expect her to be just like me, I'd just like to know that she's putting in her fair share of the burden if we were to get married. However, whenever we talk about this, she gets very upset with me. Recently I brought up her career goals and she had a panic attack claiming that she had to choose between marrying me or following her dream of being an artist. I didn't press the matter, as this happens when we talk about most things, be it sex or anything else I'm having thoughts about. \n\nI'm the primary source of income in our relationship, paying for everything from food to clothes to heating to driving her everywhere, but am just not comfortable being the emotional and financial backbone of our relationship for the rest of our lives. It's so draining. Am I the asshole for asking her to be more independent? I would even accept some sort of assurance that she's thinking about those things. When I think about proposing, my chest starts to hurt because I'm so nervous that I'll be miserable, being her caretaker for the rest of my life. I'm in the constant state of wondering if I'm an asshole or she's just lazy, but I'm so critical of myself that I always blame me.\n ",

About 6 weeks ago I met a girl on a certain subreddit and we hit it off pretty well very quickly. For two weeks we discussed back and forth our kinks, our interests, and generally grew closer. After that, we decided to be exclusive, which were words she used explicitly when I asked. Things went fine for several weeks until a few days ago when, amidst a severe bout of anxiety, I got suspicious for admittedly no good reason, and decided to check for her on the subreddit. I found her, with a post only hours old, and just like that, all my attraction to her faded. I told her I knew, and immediately blocked her everywhere we communicate. I have zero misgivings about that. \n\nBut she's still posting recognizable personals on that subreddit, and I'm wondering if I'd be the asshole if I left comments warning other guys that while she says she's strictly monogamous, she's really just going to be looking for others on the side.

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my sister to get a pet pig?",
      "description": "So this story is a few years old at this point, and therefore resolved, however whenever I think back to it, I always feel like I was the only sane one in my family, so I'm going to put this out there and see what the unbiased people of the internet think. \n\nRelevant backstory:\nI was about to start [rigorous graduate degree program] in a state far away from my family just as my sister was graduating from college. She decided to move in with me after graduation with the goal of also preparing to apply for [rigorous graduate degree program] at some point. It is also important to know that the house we would both be living in was purchased as an investment property by our parents (we're very fortunate for all they're able/willing to do for us). We would also be living with a roommate who was one of my classmates, as well as my cat. Finally, it is important to note that while my sister is not a complete train wreck of a human, she is certainly not known for being the most responsible or tidy. \n\nSo right after my sister graduated, she was living at home with my parents for a few months while she prepared to move down to where I was living. During this time she decided that she wanted to get a pet mini pig after meeting a friend's and falling in love. I immediately gave my parents numerous reasons why that was a bad idea:\n1. pigs are notorious for being too smart for their own good, i.e. you might have to end up baby proofing your house if you have one\n2. no one had any reason to think that my sister was responsible enough to handle a pet pig, and since she planned on moving in with me, the pig would then become my responsibility, which I didn't find fair, especially considering what was going on in my life at the time\n3. even though I'm her sister and my parents were our landlords, we also had a paying tenant, who nobody thought to get permission from. In my experience during college, pets were only allowed if all of the roommates consented, and I thought that was still important in this instance. \n4. We didn't know how a pig would potentially get along with my cat, who I had had for over 3 years at that point \n5. My sister was in an inherently transitional point in her life at the time, and was not able to predict where she would likely be in 1, 3, or 5 years, and therefore it seemed irresponsible to get a pet that would likely be very difficult to bring along with her while she figured out her life. \n\nDespite all of these points, my parents insisted that my sister be allowed to \"make her own mistakes\". I pointed out that this was ridiculous, because my sister had no money and my parents were planning on bankrolling this \"mistake\", but that too fell on deaf ears. So, ultimately my sister gets what she wants, a little baby mini pig.\n\nI have to say, the pig was actually adorable and sweet. She got along with my parent's cats and dog well, and was really not too much trouble like I had predicted. HOWEVER it was still not sustainable for a few reasons:\n1. pigs can be litter box trained, but you cannot use kitty litter, because they are pigs, and therefore will eat it, and which point it will clump up in their stomach and they could die. Therefore they had to use sawdust, which does fuck all to mask the potent odor of pig waste, and needs to be completely changed out daily. \n2. the pig absolutely refused to walk on asphalt or anything that wasn't smooth. Because of this, her hooves began to grow out of control, and taking her to a vet was not really a viable option due to...\n3. her size. She didn't stay \"mini\" for long. I don't have a final weight, but just know in the short time my family had her, she got pretty freaking big\n\nSo as to the resolution for the story, which I suppose isn't as sad as I might have predicted, my sister ended up moving in with me sans pet pig. This was because, as I said from the beginning, the pig was too much work and responsibility for her. This meant my parents (AKA my mom) were now responsible for her. However, due to the overgrown hoof issue, which to my mom's credit, she did try to work on to no avail, they ultimately had to surrender the pig to a farm, which conveniently backs up to their backyard. However she did not stay there permanently, and was eventually moved to some other farm in the area. According to my mom, we would be welcome to visit her whenever we like, but no one has. I don't know what the future holds for this pig though. Will she die of old age on a farm? I find that unlikely, but who knows. \n\nAs for anyone who might be wondering why my parents ever even entertained this idea, I'm still pretty confused about it too, but I think part of it is that my parents have always considered my little sister very sensitive, which is not untrue, however because of this, they tend to treat her with kid gloves. I personally think this has only made the problem worse and kind of stunted her maturity. I would like to note however that I love my sister very much and despite our differences I have considered her my best friend throughout all of this. \n\nAnyways, thanks to anyone who read all of this!

Recently me and my dad moved to a different city to live with his girlfriend, and my mum still lives in our previous city. My dad was going to move in with his girlfriend whether I came with him or not. But if I didn't come with him, I'd have nowhere to sleep (my mums house has three bedrooms and all are taken) So knowing this, I decided to move with him. I asked my dad if he would drive me down to see my mum this weekend but he said he can't afford it. I understand this but before we moved here he had enough money to constantly drive here and see his girlfriend. I can't get a train as I'm broke (my dad keeps my money in his bank account for some reason and I'm pretty sure he's spent it this month as everytime I ask for it he says I can't have it) and I can't drive myself as i'm 16.\n\nI want to see my mother regularly as, well, she's my mother and I have the right to see her. I don't believe my dad when he says he can't afford to drive me there (It's an hour away) because he was able to drive here weekly for months and months. We didnt have to hire a van to move either since my dads friend with a van kindly helped us, so the move wasn't expensive at all. We even sold the majority of our belongings before we moved since we didn't have room for it all. Because of all of this I feel like he's lying to me so he doesn't have to drive me down to see her.

      "description": "I was walking around the campus about a month ago when I noticed my girlfriend bullying a disabled 12 year old. He had Down's Syndrome, so she was calling him names and hitting him in the head and shit. I was so pissed at her that I just went up to her and asked the child to go and report it to the principal and the next moment I just said that I was done with the relationship and walked off. What makes me ask if i am the asshole is that she apologized a couple of times and said that the boy was apparently \"acting\" to have Down's Syndrome. I highly doubt that he's acting, but still. AITA?\n\n\nP.S. We are both 13 and in 8th Grade. ",

Today after 4 straight days of FaceTime requests 2x a day (often after the 7PM bed time) I had enough and texted my Mom and Dad. \n\nMe: Facetime is wednesdays.   [daughter] is sleeping.\n\nMom:  What does this mean? When did  we get an allocation of time to see our grand daughter. Can we reserve a time to discuss this. If I seem pissy, I am.\n\nMe:  We are trying to keep it together here with colds and a fussy baby and dont need you calling everyday.   We had already said we would do facetime on wednesdays.   I dont want to have to get ready for nightly invites into my home and repeat phonecalls when we are busy trying to live our lives.   What is there to discuss?   [wife] and I get 0 waking moments of just us, we are constantly entertaining the baby, and I really dont need to explain myself or my need for some privacy in my own home.\n\n\nAITA, and if I’m not, what is an appropriate step/boundaries?

I don't need £20's worth and so asked him to put in £10 so we can just divvy it up. He immediately said yes, despite the fact that that is almost exactly the same amount as the concert.

      "description": "I made a post about this in another subreddit, so this is mostly copy and pasted from that. The core of my problem is at the end, if you want to skip there. \n\n​\n\nI'm in this online community where we talk over discord. I've met some of my best friends there, including my best friend who I've known for almost 4 years now, and although we do have some drama, it's worth it because I really truly love these people.\n\n​\n\nThe most recent drama happened when I found out the aforementioned friend had made a private group chat with some of my other close friends. Of course I was hurt - why wouldn't they want me there? The real problem though, was that I had to kind of push him to tell me, because I suspected it and if I didn't know for sure, my mind would have gone to a very dark place and assumed the worst. See, I have anxiety, which means that I have a tendency to get very paranoid and assume the worst of a situation is true, especially in situations like this, where I think there might be people doing things without me, especially very close friends like this. But, to make things worse, I later found out that he hadn't told me the full truth about this group chat. I won't say specifically, but the important part is that he left out some crucial details about what they were doing in the chat. I found this out from a different friend who was also in the group.\n\n​\n\nThis really hurt me. I thought I could trust my friend. I would have trusted him with anything. I understand why he held back, cause he knew it would hurt me, but being lied to hurts so much worse. I hate being left in the dark. When there's important information about me that I don't know, I tend to panic and overreact, because of my anxiety, and the only real thing that helps is getting some solid, concrete facts. So now that I know he doesn't want to tell me the whole truth in certain situations, I find it harder to trust him.\n\n​\n\nSo here's the real conflict: I now trust him less, and I know he's inclined to do things behind my back, without me. However, he feels like me asking about these things is an invasion of his privacy. Of course I believe he has a right to privacy, and I also know he has a right to do whatever with whoever he wants, however much it may hurt me. I feel conflicted though. As I mentioned, when I'm in the dark I panic, so I go to him and ask him if he's doing things without me, which he feels is an invasion of his privacy. But I don't know what else to do. Not knowing is so much more painful. I don't know how to respect his privacy but also be aware of what's going on. \n\n​\n\nI've never felt so conflicted. I feel like a real asshole for invading his privacy and for not feeling like I can trust him as much now. I feel like maybe I'm a bad friend for not trying to understand his side enough or something... I'm having trouble making sense out of this situation entirely.",

I wasn't given a response until October. The paperwork and HR processing took a while, so I only just started working officially a couple of weeks ago. Now, this job I have taken has almost no room for growth and is not the career that I see myself committing to (I had to take it due to circumstances that would preclude me from other job options should I not take this job and get licensed). I aspire to seek a career in research and academia. In an effort to pursue my goals, I applied to PhD programs in December. I did not disclose this to my employers for several reasons: I had still not begun working, there were several problems with HR that threatened my recruitment, so there was a chance I wasn't going to work there anyways, and I did not know the HR processing would take so long, so I thought that if I were to be hired, I would have been able to work for a while before having to leave. The ultimate reason why I did not feel the need to tell them was that never in my wildest dreams did I think I would get accepted. I was applying to a competitive program, in a great school, in a highly sought out location. I honestly did not think I would get in. I was sure I would be rejected, which would give me another year to work with this company. (FYI the reason for thinking I wouldn't get in was not that I was a poor candidate, but rather that I have tendencies for severe underestimation, belittlement, and self deprecation. This is something I am trying hard to improve in myself). But guess what? I GOT IN!!!!! I recently received word that the program was impressed with me and they offered me admission. While I am overjoyed with having the opportunity to achieve my goals, the matter with the job that I just joined is weighing me down. I feel guilty that I will be leaving right after joining them. I hate to give people a bad impression of myself, and I worry that they will think I accepted their offer knowing I would leave so soon just so I can save money until I need to go. The hiring process takes forever, and I feel bad knowing that they'll have to undergo it again so soon right after hiring me. They are extremely understaffed and everyone on the team constantly tells me what a relief my joining was, as it is going to lighten the load a little. I have to tell them soon that I will be leaving them in a couple of months, and I have no idea how I will approach the issue and what I should say. In this country's work culture, people usually hold onto their jobs tightly. It is practically unheard of for someone to quit so soon after being hired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for taking the job, knowing that there was a chance, no matter how small I thought it was, that I would need to quit right after starting? Regardless of your judgment of me, can you advise me on what I should say when I need to quit?",

If it's one of these two things, I hold the door open for them.\n\nThis one time, there was someone behind me that I've never seen before. They weren't holding a key fob, they were just walking behind me. I opened the door and made no effort to hold the door for them. If this was a public place, I wouldn't have an issue holding it open for them. This person got incredibly mad at me, practically yelling how unbelievably rude I was. It made for an interesting elevator ride up.\n\nI've also lived in a building that had underground parking. There's a large sign that says \"please wait until the gate closes before driving off\". I feel like this is so people who don't live in the building can't gain access. Isn't this the same thing?",

      "description": "just got my ear talked off by my mom, i swear all my aunts are the reason my family's all deaf. i flew out to florida over christmas to visit some extended family there - my cousin (my ate mimi), her parents, and her 3 y/o daughter . my mom flew out from california to visit, and my cousin's younger sister came to move their from the philippines. yeah, my family's complicated.\n\nanyways, my ate mimi's husband passed away from brain cancer a week before christmas, making her a widow at 36 sand my niece fatherless. my ate's a strong lady, but she still cried a few times talking about him and everyone was in a grave mood. we all came to comfort her so she and her daughter weren't alone for christmas.\n\nunfortunately, i came out to them transgender earlier this year, so this was my first time seeing any of my family since i was 12, and i come from a family of asian conservative christians. the only thing they know about trans people is that their pastor said it was a sin and the drag queens that sometimes walked the street back home. i didn't want to come in the first place because it was bad timing, but my mom bought the tickets and guilted me into it. \n\nso yeah, i was the elephant in the room. called by the right name, but treated at an arm's length. the only person who talked to me without looking visibly uncomfortable was my cousins' daughter june, who absolutely adores me. she's an only child and probably pretty lonely, so she would always drag me off to play with her. i spent most of christmas upstairs either avoiding human interaction or hanging out with the kid while my family would have ear-wrenchingly loud conversations in rapid filipino. they're like a pack of hyenas when they get together.\n\ni went out with them and all, but i was pretty quiet and minded my own. i didn't want to make a big deal out of my being there because in my eyes it wasn't really my place. i know my family will take a long time getting used to my transition because to them it's a shock, and right now my ate mimi's going through the hardest time of her life. i was trying to mind my own and sort of save it for later because i knew that a. my presence made everything more complicated, and b. if i was too involved with the family them asking about my transition and all was inevitable, and i wanted to avoid that. i'm flying to the philippines in the summer and want to lay out everything there.\n\nwell, it's january now. my mom called me up, and my ears are still ringing. 'how dare you be such a recluse! you haven't seen your family in half a decade and you spent the whole christmas avoiding us! you know we're all worried about you ever since you were hospitalized! i spent $500 on your plane ticket and i barely even saw you!' etc. she's livid and in her eyes i'm a brat child for not being a part of the family. i tried to explain to her why and even offered to pay her back for the plane ticket but she only got angrier and said 'that's no excuse! i told them not to talk about it, they wouldn't have said anything!' \n\nso, my head hurts, and i feel like an ungrateful jerk. so reddit, am i the asshole?",

      "description": "Hello Redditors.\n\nBefore I begin, I know the post sounds very misleading in many ways. 1. It sounds like an abusive boyfriend not letting me break up with him, 2. It sounds like the typical rom-com cliche: \"I am too messed up, we can't be together\". While they are not true, it is kinda the second one.\n\nI am going through some really tough times now. The depression I thought I beat has returned with a vengeance, along with anxiety and constant, constant suicidal tendencies. I don't really feel safe in my own mind and body. I know I need help, and I'm looking for it incessantly.\n\nNow, my boyfriend. He is one gem of a person. Has stood with me through ALL OF IT. Every single panic attack, suicide attempt, everything. He keeps reassuring me that I make him happy, and he is not affected by all of this. But I can't believe him. I feel like a burden, a liability, a very unstable person who is making this relationship toxic. I feel like I'm burdening a beautiful, positive, near-perfect guy with undue stress. Yes, a good relationship should see through good and bad times, but I feel like I've become incapable of doing normal, human things, and I don't want to be around him and infect his surroundings with my mental issues.\n\nSo, I ask him to leave me. Every now and then. I'm okay, well-balanced and peaceful for a few days, but again I find some reason to shout at him, and ask him to leave. I still feel like that's what we should do. Every time this happens, he sees through it, and sticks with me, solid. He says we can face anything together, and that I am not a burden. \n\nI used to think I'm doing this for his own good, but now I just feel shitty for playing with his feelings and going back and forth, though he says I'm not. So, am I the asshole here?\n\nP.S.: I am definitely not looking for validation. Please don't say that. I'm going through incredible mental torment.\n\nTL;DR: My mental issues make me yell at my boyfriend, asking him to leave me constantly, now I feel like an indecisive asshole. AITA?",

      "description": "Hey all. I'm maybe half a year into gym culture and not sure what the appropriate response to my situation was. I genuinely want everyone at the gym to have a fair and welcome time, and to follow whatever the social norms there are.\n\nHowever, today I am across a situation I'm unsure about. For context, I workout in an apartment building gym that has a decent selection of lifting equipment (rack, barbell, short barbell, curl bar, etc), but just one of each thing. Everyone using the facility generally shuffles around as needed, waiting for equipment or working in. It's particularly hard to handle benching and squatting simultaneously, as we have just the one rack we can use.\n\nToday I came across someone who had each barbell and the rack loaded, along with a handful of other things. Only this person and myself were in the room. I was immediately annoyed and asked this guy if he was using \"all of these\", and he said \"yeah.\" I asked how many sets he had left on the rack, and he said \"idk, about 30 minutes.\" He was clearly using each piece of equipment in a cycle, such that he'd do one set with one bar, take a rest, then do another set on another, take a rest, and ultimately use the rack maybe once every 10 minutes. Since the rack was set up at a bench height and I was planning on squatting, I asked the guy if he could focus on his benching sets so that I could use it sooner to squat (to avoid having to fully unload, rerack, repeat if we worked in). He immediately went on the defensive, saying \"you just got here and now you're telling me how to work out?! Wait your turn or work in\" I said \"you can't just use all the equipment like that, nobody does this\". Eventually after some arguing, he tells me to use the rack anyway, but put everything back \"exactly as it was\" whenever he came by. This sucks, but I had limited time so I went along with it.\n\nBetween sets he could talk to me about how people are reasonable and will let you work in if you don't show up with an aggressive stance like I did. I try to explain that my issue was that he's using every piece of lifting gear, and making everyone work in with him instead of focusing on his sets. He reiterates that I have no right to tell him how to work out. I eventually finish my sets and leave, though at this point we've both calmed down and exchanged names, for gentlemen's sake.\n\nMy feeling going into this was that forcing everyone to work in with you in a small gym instead of doing exercises one at a time was selfish, and I've never seen this before. Otoh, the dude has a point that I barged in and interrupted his workout and asked him to do it differently so that I could do sets without having to adjust the rack constantly or wait half an hour for him to finish. I'm not sure what the right gym culture is here.\n\ntl;dr: Guy at gym uses every piece of equipment on a cycle, I ask him to focus on his rack sets, he tells me to stop telling him how to workout.

      "description": "Beatrice and I have been friends since, well, forever. I don’t remember a life without her. In 7th and 8th grade we were best friends, attached at the hip. \n\nFreshman year we went to different high schools l, she developed anorexia and I developed depression. We didn’t talk for maybe two years because of wrongs we had both done. We started talking a little more frequently (and occasionally seeing each other) the last two years of high school. \n\nBetween our senior year and freshman year of college, I noticed she was really active politically with a side I do not agree with. I mean sure, she’s worn political attire before but it started to bother me. When Kavanaugh was elected to his position, she posted a picture of her TV screen (that showed him) with a caption that was literally just: “👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻”. As a survivor of sexual assault, that really hurt. \n\nI hadn’t talked to her at all the first semester of college. But two weeks ago, she made a social media post: her friend had died. I met this friend (Yolanda) once and followed her on Instagram. She was newly engaged and Beatrice and Yolanda met at an impatient anorexia recovery place. She was obviously crushed. I text Beatrice and ask if she wanted company, because of course I would want to be there for someone despite our differences. She declined but I brought over a pint of her favorite ice cream anyway and left.\n\nA few days ago she invited me to her house, which was supposed to be today. I was supposed to go over at 6pm. Well I got hit with a bunch of responsibilities/feelings really quickly: I have an awful family situation going on with an abusive mother, in danger of losing my health insurance, my new glasses aren’t the correct prescription, etc. I got home and it was too overwhelming for me. So, crying into my pillow I decided to cancel. Here is the conversation:\n\nMe: “I’m really overwhelmed tonight can I come over another time? 😭😭”\n\nBeatrice: “ugh ok- i wish i would’ve known earlier cause my friend wanted me to spend the night in *a town thats 45 minutes away* tonight”\n\nHer response sounded extremely apathetic to me. How would I know to plan my breakdown earlier in the day? I responded:\n\nMe: “I'm sorry that I had to cancel last minute, it happens sometimes. I just ask for your understanding that I had a lot going on” and she just ignored the text. \n\nSo overall, to me she’s turned into a really callous person. I was truly sorry to cancel on her last minute but it was only 5:50pm, she still could’ve gone and hung out with another friend. \n\nBut, AITA for wanting to call it quits over what is primarily political?",

This background is important for the situation. \nSo, our startup is having its first “offline” event ever tomorrow and it’s in my location. Even though my role has nothing to do with marketing, i passively accepted the organization of this event as I’m the only one located here. However, given my sparse knowledge of marketing I asked my marketing colleagues again and again over email: this is what I’m doing, please tell me if I’ve unchecked any boxes. No response on that account. So I continue doing what I’d outlined for the event .. \nSo, last week, a week before the event the marketing person tells me that we should have company logoized items in the gift bag. I was like- ok this a lil late in the game to tell me about this but fine I’ll get it done if I can. And I did. \n\nNow today, while the event is tomorrow, the person asks me if I can arrange a photographer. Please note that a photographer was not on my list as I thought we were streaming the event live from my device and apparently we re not doing that anymore. So when she asked me I said no, it’s too late I don’t have the bandwidth to research and call photographers for tomorrow. \n\nI think she got pissed, but I asked them so many times to see if anything else needs to be arranged. When I pointed it out, apparently it occurred to them today. \nAm I at fault?? ",

      "title": "AITA for getting mad at my friend for suggesting I clean my room?",
      "description": "I'm a college student living in a dorm room. The room is supposed to be a shared room between two people, but my roommate moved out last semester so I have the entire space to myself.\n\nBecause I'm fortunate enough to have a room to myself, my friend--we'll call her G--and I often hang out in my space after class; we have a lot of the same classes so it's nice to be able to study together whenever we want without bothering other people. I fully enjoy having G in my room and consider her an awesome and respectable friend, but lately she's been getting on my case about cleaning my space and it's beginning to get annoying.\n\nI'll be the first to admit I'm a slob; my room is by no means clean, and ever since I've had the room to myself I've taken a few liberties with the space. There's a pretty fair amount of stuff on the floor, and I recently did laundry so my clothes are sitting out in the open on the spare bed (this includes some of my underwear, but it's all folded neatly into little rolls so you can't really tell what they are). I also have dirty dishes lying around everywhere, and both my desk and the spare desk are fairly cluttered with stuff that I've left and not bothered to pick up. To be completely frank, it's gotten to the point where most open surfaces have begun to lose their functionality simply because of the sheer amount of stuff lying about on them that I'm too lazy to move.\n\nMy room is very messy, but it's not unlivable for me. I'm not even against cleaning it, but I absolutely hate that G is the one telling me to do it. She's not my mother, so I really don't feel like she has the right to tell me what to do, and anyway it's my room. If she's uncomfortable with the clutter then she doesn't have to come over--even though i honestly think my room is the best location for our study sessions because of its convenience, I would be perfectly content to meet up in her room or in the common areas of the dorm if my room is too messy for her to handle. I actually plan to clean it soon, but I want to do it on my own time and by my own volition, not because someone else told me to do so.\n\nEven so, G is in my room a lot, and I know it's probably extremely uncomfortable for her to sit around in my filth (although I do try to keep her favorite spot, a little sitting area under my bed, reasonably clean). The more she nags me, though, the less I want to do anything about the clutter. Would I be an asshole to tell her to keep out of my business, even though she's partially affected? I can tell that she's also as frustrated as I am about the situation, but I don't think I'm in the wrong to want autonomy in my own space that she's under no obligation to share with me.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Hey guys!  Recently my(26) half sister sister (36)  let me stay with her and her husband and two sons (5, 12) because I was having issues with my boyfriend and his mom. I wasn't raised with my sister, we grew up in separate foster homes so we aren't super close. I was surprised she invited me to live with her especially after I raised concerns about me living with kids. I'm diagnosed as bipolar II and I was worried about my mental stability around children. She said her kids are usually busy she has a large house and no one would bother me and she really wanted me to come.  This was slightly before Xmas and she invited our mom to stay with her for the holidays. I haven't talked  to our mother in over 5 years because her new husband used to secretly film me in the bathroom when I was a child. I told my mother about this before I left for college and showed her the grocery bag full of DVDs he made and she wasn't surprised because she knew had a sex addiction (I had no clue about). I stopped talking to her because she wanted me to thank this man for money they were sending me during college I refused and told them don't send me shit anymore. I dropped out of school beginning of sophomore year shortly after being diagnosed as bipolar and have been supporting myself ever since. \n\nI had no issue with our mom coming by for the holidays but I did not want to be there. My sister said our mom would only be there a day or so and I could hide in my room but I decided to go visit my boyfriend until the new year. I could tell this upset my sister but I got every one small gifts for the holidays so they knew I was thinking of them but I needed to take care of me. I return and everyone including the kids are being super cold to me. I would be starting CNA school soon so I just hid away in my room. I came back on Tuesday and school started the following Monday.  My classes are 6:30am - 3pm with a minimum 2hr bus ride sometimes 4hours for off site clinical hours so I'm away most of the day and I study at night. I start to sense the house being annoyed that I'm not spending time with them but honestly I'm busy and exhausted and have poor social skills. So I withdraw more and they start to slam doors and play music loud to make their presence known and I get anxious and stay in my room. I stop eating I stop going out to the kitchen. I stop drinking water so I don't have to leave to pee. They get louder outside the door so I just put in head phones and try to tune out hidden meanings in songs they play and words they say.  Also my sister confessed to me that her husband was nasty to her while she was pregnant with his child which makes me not trusting of him at all. And I'm still studying and waking up early. I truly am busy but I don't know what to say to anyone and I feel like my movements are being tracked so I stay even more silent and secluded. I'm super nice and say hello when I do see anyone in the halls or kitchen but my sister sees this as me being fake. I have 3 more weeks of the class and everyone's behavior is becoming more aggressive and dismissive and I feel like the asshole but AITAH for feeling more at peace on my own locked my room?",

      "description": "A bit of backstory: I am an verbal abuse victim who has had to put up with years of \"walking on eggshells\" with my stepmother and her mom. I also have autism, which makes it harder for me to know what to do in social situations; it also means that I don't have very good spacial awareness and sometimes get caught in my own world, not very aware of anything going on outside of whatever I'm doing (in this case, reading). Having chosen to live with my mother and not my stepmom when I turned 18 (about 10 days ago), I've been doing much better with my anxiety, because my stepmom isn't around anymore. But this situation just set it off again.\n\nSo this morning I was taking the subway to my percussion ensemble rehearsal. I was sitting next to one of the doors and had put my backpack in front of me. There was another man across from me with a big cart in the aisle. A woman with a walker was sitting a few seats down from him.\n\nAbout fifteen or twenty minutes into the ride, I'm engrossed in my Stephen King book, and the woman gets up to get off. Her walker hits my backpack (I believe that was what happened), and some of her things fall off of it. I move back, trying to give her room but also thinking she has the situation under control.\n\nThen as she's getting off I hear her say something about how I'm a rude boy--- \"or girl, I can't even tell what you are---\" (I'm a trans girl but I look like a boy), \"you see a handicapped woman and you can't even move out of the way or help her.\"\n\nI look up, startled, and immediately try to make room for her, be courteous, but she picks up her things and goes on muttering to herself about me even after she's off the train. She never makes eye contact with me this whole time, by the way.\n\n I move my seat and begin hyperventilating/possibly having a panic attack, idk perhaps I was overreacting but one of my biggest anxiety triggers is messing up in public, especially with people I don't know. \n\nI just ... I don't know. There wasn't much room with the other guy's cart right there, and it did happen right in front of me, but sometimes I just ... there are situations where I don't think quickly enough. It also didn't seem as if I could have helped her pick the stuff up, with the angle we were at --- I think the walker was blocking it, I don't fricking remember the details. It was just something that made me really upset. I think it may have been my first actual panic attack; my anxiety isn't as bad lately, but this just set it off. Like, obviously she was handicapped and I should have been more considerate of that, but I wasn't blatantly ignoring it. Heck, I've spent time in a wheelchair myself. I've used walkers. *I know how it is.*\n\nI wish I could just apologize to her. But she's gone and she obviously thinks I'm a horrible person.",

He's always been an avid gamer and I like games on occasion too, though I don't have much time for them with the kids and such.\nI stay at home with our four kids because, with our son's extensive medical needs, it's not feasible for us to both work while keeping up with his (sometimes 3-5 a week) appointments and any caregiver he has needs to be strong enough to lift him in case of emergencies or falls (he has cerebral palsy). \nSO works a 9-5 job in IT, but brags frequently about how he has time to \"dick around\" (his words, not mine) and work is boring.\nWhen he comes home, he is usually around the family for an hour or so, then he goes to his computer (upstairs) to play Path of Exile, sometimes for 4-5 hours at a time.\nI don't mind caring for the kids and I take pride in doing all the cooking and cleaning, but I get really lonely and the kids barely get to see their dad. It would be nice if he'd read a story or take them to go get ice cream or whatever, but he'd rather be playing games than anything.\nHe's stopped fishing, going out with friends, and any hobby besides gaming.\nI've tried to ask if he's feeling stressed and I've watched for symptoms of depression, but I'm getting nowhere.\nWIBTA if I just told him I'd rather he limit his gaming to later evening or a certain number of hours a day? I feel like he's a grown man and should have autonomy, but I'm concerned he's missing sleep and avoiding other activities that might be more emotionally healthy.\nI've tried having him bring his stuff to the family common areas, but it just ends up back upstairs.

      "description": "On mobile, so, sorry for any mistakes. We're both college students. I'm a pretty good research writer/summary writer. He struggles when it comes to writing, so I usually help him out when I have time/when he asks me. He has to write a body paragraph for an summary essay tonight. Fine, easy peasy. \n\nHe starts off writing the body as a intro paragraph, so I tell him that it doesn't sound right and I offer to write it together. We start from scratch, have the article he needs to summarize in front of us, and start typing together. I tell him what points from the article I think are relevant and need to go in the first body paragraph. He agrees with me. We start making sentences, the tension starts to get a bit high because he misinterprets a part of the text, telling me I'm wrong when I know I'm right. (Shirley IS an average student, he thought she was suppose to be a struggling student). Mid-way through the paragraph he kinda sighs and tells me that \"I'm making it [the paragraph] difficult for him to understand.\" So I said okay then, write your own paragraph they way you'd like to write it, and if you have any questions, ask Professor Google. \n\nHe gets upsets and says I'm making his statement bigger than it is, and to please help continue helping him. I refuse and tell him that since my help is not being appreciate/criticized, then I guess he should do it himself. I refused to help for the rest of the night, and I think I might be reluctant to help him again. \n\nTL;DR: I helped SO with a body paragraph and I felt like he was ungrateful, so I told him Google could tutor him.

      "description": "For context. I’m 17, I live in Australia, recently graduated high school and got an offer from the University of Adelaide. I wanted to defer, but my father vehemently denied me that right. \n\nFor even more context that led up to what my father said. Over the past three and a half years, I got put into a boarding school I didn’t really like, but put up with regardless. I’ve never really had a healthy relationship with my father, as I’m always terrified of his volatile temper, and he was almost never willing to spend time with me as a child. However, he did work to provide me and my family with a comfortable life. At that boarding school, I was overwhelmed with the workload I had to face since I never had to study to get top grades (I only went to international schools before), and asking teachers and friends for help has always been extremely uncomfortable for me. This in turn led to my studies not being great, and me getting a very average ATAR of 61.70. However, I was still able to get into the course I wanted.\n\n\nNow, I haven’t been the best child, but I was never the worst. I had never gotten detention, had never handed in a late assignment, and had never gotten into trouble with teachers. The worst thing I had done at school was not ask teachers for help and not put in as much effort as I should have. The worst thing I did to my parents was steal some money from their credit card, which is awful as is - however, I don’t think it warranted my father telling me to kill myself. He constantly tells me that I wasted three and a half years of my life, that he wasted money on getting me tuition, and that I put him and my mother under stress that no other parent has to face. He also claims I’m the reason they’re so close to divorce. He also sometimes calls me an useless moron and that I’m the most lazy and awful person he’s ever known. A few days ago, I fucked up researching housing costs for my university, and he lost it. He proceeded to yell all of the above at me, and then said, without paraphrasing, “A few months ago you told the bloody counsellors that you wanted to kill yourself? Well maybe you should have killed yourself then, it would have been easier on all of us.” I started crying really badly and he yelled at me asking why the fuck I was crying and I said through tears that he told me to\nKill myself, and he said “You’re goddamn right, you don’t deserve to live anymore, go hang yourself tomorrow.” The next day my mom told me I should feel guilty because I hurt my dad so much and that I should feel bad for making him say those things, and that I should look past it. Again, the extent to which I “hurt” my parents was listed above. A few days later I got my acceptance letter, and two days later I told my parents I wanted to defer. My dad lost it again, asking me who the fuck I am to have the arrogance to defer, and that I should be taking this god-given gift and studying hard, rather than fucking deferring, and that I should go fuck myself.\n\n\nSorry if this is a rambling mess, I’m on mobile and don’t really know how to format. I believe I’ve covered everything on both sides, so please let me know if clarification is needed. I really want to run away from my parents and start over, but because I’m 17 my father is still controlling me and forcing me to start university immediately. I feel bad because I have done some things that are wrong, but I don’t feel they’ve warranted what’s been said to me. In short - am I the asshole here?\n\n",

      "description": "A group of four women at my office are unnecessarily rude to me. I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she’s jealous since I’m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that’s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I’ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, “Oh just a little piece won’t hurt.” I’m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I’ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it’s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.",

      "description": "So this happened last week when we were skiing. Before we went I was hunting around for my ski socks (basically very long, very thick socks if you don't know), asking my girlfriend to tell me if she'd seen any of them because I was sure I had more, but couldn't manage to get together 6 pairs (1 for each day). She said she hadn't seen any. Anyway, I didn't have time to buy more, so I figured I would either re-use them or buy more out there. \n\nOn day 2, I see in my girlfriend's suitcase that she's packed what looks like the missing pairs of my ski socks. I'm instantly annoyed by this, because she has solved her problem of not having enough ski socks and just passed it on to me. I ask her - \"are those mine?\", and she says, \"you left them at my house so I took them\". We kind of leave it there.\n\nCome day 5 when I have run out of clean socks, I go into her suitcase while she's in the shower, and put on my damn socks. She comes out of the shower, starts getting changed and is soon hunting around for some socks. She eventually notices them on my feet, and me with a big shit-eating grin. I foolishly thought this would be funny, we'd have a laugh about her obvious theft, and she'd go buy some more for herself. NOPE.\n\nShe gets very upset that I've put her in this position, that I've just taken the socks she was planning on wearing, and am expecting her to buy more or just wear an old pair twice. She gets really mad about it. I say she can just go buy more, but she says the shop socks aren't as good, and isn't happy about this. So I say \"what, you think I should buy more? They're my socks!\" to which she says \"yes, but I packed them!\". She seems really mad about it so to smooth things over, I let her have the socks, and I go buy more myself on the way to the lifts. They aren't as good as my old socks. Girlfriend is still annoyed about this at the end of the day, although she's calmed down now. Like, I get that she packed them and was planning on wearing them, and I took them, but I can't help but feel I've been fucked over here. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": " So I've been with my gffor 4 months now. Things went pretty well at the start but we don't see each other much since we live on opposite side of the city. Problems only started happening recently and mostly only because I have been thinking about breaking up. We never really had too much in common: we're both studying similar majors in uni (that's how I met her); we're from different backgrounds and cultures; and smaller insignificant things like she doesn't eat fruit at all and I love fruit, she doesn't exercise and I like to keep fit, she a chocolate connoisseur and I'm not a sweet tooth, different music and film tastes, etc. But we agreed that didn't matter too much since it didn't really affect how we felt towards each other.\n\nTo give some context, she used to be very into me and wanted to spent time together. Now it seems that only I'm initiating to make plans, meet up and talk, which we don't really do more than once a week. I understand a lot of this strain comes from uni now that the semester's commenced but I sort of feel forgotten and pretty dissatisfied in general that she's not really putting too much effort into the relationship. This feeling isn't based on any empirical evidence; she always tells me that she likes me and has always talked us out of it; but it is based on her attraction to me relative to the past.\n\nWe both agreed before uni began that we would see each other Friday evenings after class and occasionally have dinner out. First week was great spending time together, didn't have dinner. Second week was rough; I felt she was a little cold to me for some reason and I ended up trying to break things off again. She talked me out of it, I ended up reconsidering, opening up to her about how I felt and explained that she needed to improve her communication (not the first time she's told me and not the first time I've told her). We went out for dinner after. Now this is the third week. Last night (Thursday), she invited me to sleep over at her place (parents present) on Friday night. I said I was feeling under the weather and was probably better if I didn't. Come Friday I'm excited to finally spend some time with my gf after a busy week and she tells me that she's spending the evening with her sister. No notice, no apology for surprising me with her sudden plans (she did apologise for \"making me feel sad\" but that's not the point). I've been feeling disrespected like this for a while now.\n\nOf course this one event doesn't encapsulate the whole situation but I do feel like there's been this problem for a while now. I know she's feeling stressed in uni and that's probably what's taking the toll on her to justify her behaviour recently. I don't think it's due to any fault in her character but I feel like she doesn't understand me. I've tried to be honest to her about but it always feels like my words are falling on deaf ears. So I guess this is a bit of a cry for help: would I be an asshole if I were to end things like this now?",

      "description": "This is a bit of a long story but will try to make it as brief as possible.   \n\n\nI dated a guy for 9 months back in 2016. He was from a town 3hrs away and so we didn't see each other through the week, only on weekends when he came to stay with me (I was a lowly student, he had a job and could afford the weekly train fare). We talked non-stop, texts, photos and video chats. So it was heartbreaking for me when he suddenly stopped responding for 5 days. He wasn't on fb/insta but I remembered him mentioning twitter competitions. Queue super sleuth mode.  \nMy super desperate self trawled through every account under his name until I found him...he was alive and tweeting since he went AWOL. Trawled through his tweets and I found one mentioning 'his gf' with another user @'d... she had her insta linked to her twitter and so I fell face first into this strangers wonderful shiny documented 3yr relationship with my bf. It was absolutely horrifying, I cried for days.   \n\n\nMy friends talked me out of contacting this girl, I sent him one last, long, explosive message and 'moved on'. It's coming up to 3yrs now and I have the most wonderful loving partner, I am genuinely happy with my life. But I still get this sick feeling when ex's come up in conversation, that I never tried to warn this poor girl. It came up again last night and I caved and looked at her insta this morning (we share the same first name so it's a name I'm not likely to forget) - they're still together, bought a house together, a dog, engaged, celebrating 6yrs together.   \n\n\nWIBTA for telling her? I just need to know if I'm doing the right thing by leaving it when my heart sometimes says I'm not.  The level of sneakiness on his part always made me feel like I was not the first. My partner is ambivalent. Thoughts?? ",

      "description": "I recently discovered this subreddit and have spent hours reading it; I love it and I'm ready to accept my judgment on this one. This took place over a decade ago and it's baffled me a handful of times since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn middle school, I was on the 7th grade girls volleyball team. I was a frumpy, awkward kid, and not very athletic or coordinated, but I did a sport every season because my parents thought it was good for me and the middle school teams didn't cut. I wasn't really friends with anyone on the team except one other girl. We had a few after school games with other middle schools nearby, and they ended at about dinner time. Most parents didn't go to games, except for those who volunteered to drive the team, so after the game ended we would call our parents to tell them they could pick us up. We probably sat around 15-25 minutes waiting for parents to get there. My mom would always pack me a snack, usually a handful of pretzels or crackers in a sandwich bag, and maybe like an individual serving of jello to eat while waiting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe'd all be starving by the end of the game since we were growing teens and all that, so I'd pull out my snacks and eat them. The other girls on the team started saying that it was super rude of me to eat in front of them when they didn't have anything to eat. Like, multiple comments about how rude I was while I was eating my snacks. I didn't think I should have to share the small snack my mom packed me with seven or eight other girls, so I declined to share except with my one friend on the team. Like I said, it wasn't much to share. This happened at every game, so when I think back on it I think that they could've packed a snack at least for the later games, but they never did. When I did other sports in middle school this never came up; maybe because the games were scheduled differently or because sometimes some adults organized team snacks for us?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, was I the asshole? At the time I didn't really think much about it bc I was happy and eating and I thought it was their problem they were hungry for not being prepared. Not sure if it matters but most of the team were white girls who were super good friends with each other, and then me and my friend were both non-white and not really friends with the other girls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My (M20) girlfriend (F20) and I have been together for 6 months. We are in college. We go out to eat at local restaurants a couple of times a month to get away from the repitition of dining hall food. Financially I am much better off than her. I get lots of money from family, I dont spend a lot, and my parents pay for everything when I am home so I have a lot saved. She has more expenses and is going abroad this summer so as a result does not try to spend a lot of money. As a result I almost always pay when we go out to eat. I am fine with this. I love her and I understand why it is difficult for her to pay. (For the record I know that if I asked her to split the check she would.) \n\nThis has been a small issue for a while but on Saturday it got a bit bigger when we went out to eat, and that is how much I tip. To be clear, I do not tip small. Usually around 15%, perhaps smaller if the waiter does something blatantly to hurt service. That is how much my dad tips, thats what I grew up on. My girlfriend's family tips large amounts, around 20% sometimes higher. On Saturday we went to a local restaurant. I tipped around 13%, namely because the waiter was socializing with another table (I could hear their conversation) while we had been waiting for a while to order dessert. She got angry with me because I was not being generous enough.\n\nI feel that because I am paying (which I am happy to do) she has no right to criticize how much I tip. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for forcing my close friend out as a business partner?",
      "description": "AITA here? I feel like I know the answer to this, but knowing what others think helps. TLDR at the end.\n\nI have this friend, John, whom I've been friends with for about 20 years. I talked with a mutual friend of ours, Tom, recently. Tom, who is also a current customer of mine (John brought him to the business) said that John had some sort of break down at his most recent job waiting tables. He kept oversleeping and was missing/coming in late for shifts, so he went on work disability for stress.\n\nTom said that John blames me for this because after all he did for the business, I forced him out as a partner. I didn't get into specifics with Tom, so I just told him it was either end the partnership or close the business down. Shutting down would cause my customers a good amount of harm because there's a chance they'd incur additional expenses with reconfiguring their current equipment. At the very least, it would be a pain in the ass to switch.\n\nI initially started this business with $40k of my own money. John had no money, but he promised to handle weekly system maintenance, and customer support. I would handle sales &amp; marketing and operations, and we would split onboarding new customers. At the right time, I would get my initial $40k back plus a reasonable % return based on profits. Everything else we would split 50/50 since we split the workload 50/50.\n\nJohn brought Tom and one other business as customers. I was going through a horrible divorce (to the point where my ex was filing false police reports in an effort to get full custody), and I wasn't bringing in new customers like I needed to. \n\nJohn floated the company anywhere from $20-$200 for several months to keep checks from bouncing. All told, his floats totaled about $4k. When I got back on track, I paid John back by giving him a bigger percentage of the fees we charged from onboarding new customers until he was square.\n\nWhile he was floating the company money, I noticed that John wasn't handling customer support or system maintenance. He wouldn't log into the system for weeks or months at a time, if at all. If customers contacted us for support, he immediately asked me for help. He would say he didn't know the system as well as I did, so after helping him (and the customer) I gave him the resources I studied to learn the system for him to study. He continued to ask me for help every time a customer called, and admitted he hadn't studied anything when I asked him. \n\nIt was a choice between enabling him and helping the customer or potentially losing business. Admittedly, I got upset with him after one incident in which he blew up my phone while I was meeting with a potential client. When I didn't answer, he called the client's office explaining that there was a support emergency and he needed me. He called right when I was explaining to said potential client how stable and reliable our systems were, and how we had enough personnel to handle any problems they had.\n\nAfter this incident, there were two or three other times where upset customers were calling me directly saying they had sent emails and left voicemail messages several days ago without a response. I would confront John about this, and he said he had responded and left messages, but they never got back to him. He would then immediately contact them with me present and tell the customer he left messages. The customer would then second-guess themselves, and John would end up handling the issue.\n\nAbout a year after I straightened out my personal issues and after he had been paid back, he was still slacking on his share of work. After another of these complaints, I checked the company email logs. The customer had sent an email that was forwarded to John. However, John had never responded. The only thing I couldn't tell was if John had called the customer or used his personal email address. I then checked the system, and maintenance hadn't been done at that point for about 9 months. I took screenshots and copied logs to document everything.\n\nI took him to lunch and brought up the subject, and I said that I felt like I was doing about 98% of the work but only getting paid 50%. It was taking time away from finding new business, and delaying getting my $40k plus return back as we agreed. John acknowledged I was doing the majority of the work and that he had been slacking, but he said that he floated the company when I was having personal problems. He also said (and I quote), \"And how about all of the customers I brought in?\"\n\nI reminded him that the company paid him back while I haven't gotten anything beyond distributions. I also said, \"You mean Customer A and Customer B? One who's your best friend from high school?\" I then proposed two options. 1) we end the partnership now, become competitors, and keep the customers we each brought on. 2) I temporarily take an 80% share, and give back 5% per month to him for every month that he meets work milestones. He could even start the milestone list and be in charge of editing it until we finally agreed on it.\n\nJohn proceeded to comment that both choices were unfair, and countered with me getting 60%. I said to John that since he acknowledged I was doing about 98% of the work, did he honestly think that I should only get 60% of the profits, and would he agree to that if the roles were reversed? He then said he was only agreeing to option 2 out of our friendship. I wrote up an agreement, we both signed it, and he promised to get the milestone list together in a week.\n\nTwo months later, after asking multiple times for the milestone list, and John either saying \"next week\" or not responding, I got a call from our biggest customer. They had called and emailed three days in a row and nobody returned their call. They called because their service was not working consistently, but now it wasn't working at all. I logged into the system and saw the problem. The particular server's script that clears cache files stopped working, and disk space was almost out. Deleted the cache, rebooted the system, customer's working again.\n\nI checked the system logfiles, and John hadn't logged into the system one time since we switched to the 80/20 agreement. I immediately texted him to call me regarding something urgent about our biggest customer. He called me the next day.\n\nI told him what happened with our customer and that I handled it. He expressed relief and said, \"I wish they had called sooner.\" I said, \"speaking of which, I have something to show you.\" I texted him the screenshots of the system logs, email logs, and call logs, and the list of cache files on the server. I explained that this was what the problem was, and luckily, it was a quick fix. John then said that he couldn't see exactly what caused the problem.\n\nI said that he hadn't logged into the system in over two months. I also said that log screenshots showed that the customer had called and emailed, but they got no response. It also showed that the calls forwarded to his phone. I then said that things weren't working out, and we can't be business partners anymore. If he wanted the business he needed to buy me out of my $40k plus 80%, or I could cut a check for his 20% share so he'd be out. Either way, he needed to decide in 7 days, or I would hire an attorney to figure it all out. I said that I hoped we could still be friends, but I would understand if he didn't want that. John gets very upset, says some words that I don't remember, and hangs up on me.\n\nHe texted me the next day saying he was giving up his 20%, and he didn't want any money. He said he valued friendship over the business, unlike me, and that this was all my plan to steal the business from him.\n\nI saved the texts until I sent him an agreement to relinquish his shares and he signed it. Recently, John texted me randomly, saying that he couldn't believe how I could do this to his friend and how he stuck by my side. I said that I felt the same about him: how could a friend promise to do his share of the business but not do any of it? He then responded that I was a dick. I deleted the texts and blocked his number because fuck him.\n\nTLDR: I invest $40k to start a business, close friend invests $0 but promises to do half the work plus allow me to get back my $40k plus return. He floats the company about $4k while I go through personal problems, but stops doing his share of the work even when he gets paid back. I confront him the first time and he agrees to a 20% share, but still doesn't step up to do work. We almost lose our biggest customer, I confront him again and end the partnership. He calls me a dick.",

Don’t treat your grandmother like that” \nThe girl was probably shocked that a stranger intervened but that somehow stopped the little fit she was throwing.\n\nI know it’s not my place to tell off someone else kid but I’m the oldest of 5 kids so I’m pretty used to telling the young ones off when their behavior becomes unsavory.

      "description": "So, me and my partner have been together for 10 years. We have two children together, and we have always had shared finances with a shared bank account. This is because I have been the breadwinner up until this year while she has stayed home with the kids. \n\nWe have had lots of arguments over money, she thinks I'm too controlling because I like to budget and don't want anything spent unless it has been budgeted. (Too often mid month she would bring up some expense that she failed to mention until the last minute, leaving me having to adjust the budget, which frustrated me.)\nWe were using budgeting software, and once or twice a month we would sit down and try and budget together. This would usually end in an argument about me trying to control where the money went, even though I was trying my hardest to get input from her. A typical comment would be \"why are you asking me, you'll just do what you want anyway\".\n\nSkip to now, and because our youngest has started at daycare, she has been able to get part-time work. She has set up her own account and is keeping her money there where I can't see it, and doesn't think it's reasonable for me to want it in the joint account. My thinking is that with this extra income in the monthly budget, we can pay off our debts faster, or save up for a holiday etc but we should make the decision together. She wants to save it herself in a separate account so she can see the fruits of her labor (my wording). She says she won't be selfish with it but needs it to feel better about working and missing out on seeing the kids etc. \n\nAnyway I don't really know how other couples with families combine or separate their finances, so thought I'd see what Reddit thinks.

      "description": "So my fiance and I have been renting an apartment for the past three years.  About six months ago, new tenants moved in directly above our apartment and it has been a nightmare for us ever since.  The couple has a toddler who constantly runs back and forth (with his shoes on) in their apartment right above where our bed is located.  He also plays with some mysterious toy that he seems to throw directly onto the ground and it continues to bounce for eternity (we have hypothesized that its some kind of wooden ball or something).  Also the parents are constantly walking around with their shoes on and its pretty loud.  I wouldn't mind except it happens past 11pm and also around 630am.  It has come to the point where I started banging a broom on the ceiling to let them know they are being too loud.  They stop for a while and then it continues.  The main issue is I cannot sleep with all this noise.  I am thinking about going upstairs and asking them politely to shut the fuck up.  I never understood how people can walk in their homes with their shoes on anyway.  They walk around all day outside, stepping on all kinds of stuff (dirty sidewalks, animals poop, bacteria, germs, etc) and then they walk on their floors with the same shoes.  I don't get it.  But anyway, AITA for being upset about this and should I say something to them? FYI:  we have been looking to purchase a home for the past year so we do plan on moving out asap. ",

      "description": "I have been vegan for about 12 years now, and every year my feelings towards the cause grow stronger.  It really upsets me when I see people eating meat/animal products.  It's gotten to the point where I actually go to therapy to help me cope with my feelings about the meat industry.  \n\nI have a loving family and a great group of 5 friends who I've known for almost 20 years.  They all know how strongly I feel about veganism, yet they still manage to tease me about it from time to time, even though I've told multiple times that I don't appreciate any jokes revolving around my dietary choices and lifestyle.  I know they don't actually mean to offend me, but these comments still really hurt (example - my friend's and I were at a food court eating lunch, and one of them mockingly said to me, \"mmmm, look at these delicious animal bones\" as he poured gravy on his fried chicken.)  It's been the same these past 12 years, and I'm starting to get sick of it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really starting to get pissed off with the choices that the people closest to me are making, and it's affecting my psychological health and state of mind.  Every time I see a loved one eating meat, I can't help but think they are a heartless scumbag (though I would never say that to their face).  I'm not here to debate whether eating meat is right or wrong, but to me, eating meat is akin to murder, and I can't keep spending my leisure time with people who are committing acts that make me want to vomit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy therapist ran the idea of cutting these people out of my life, and I'm starting to seriously consider it.  The thought of not being able to see these people anymore makes me sick, but not as sick as watching them participate in the lifestyle choices they make.  I have not made a decision yet, but I'm strongly considering cutting them out, so that I can live with a healthier state of mind.  AITA?",

      "description": "I am 29 F and work fee-for-service at $20/hr. This means my hours worked does not equal my hours paid, and that my income also fluctuates as I am needed. However, I typically work all day Mon-Thurs, and do light paperwork Friday mornings. I work from home a good amount, too. \n\nI also do vast majority of care-taking for our son, cook all of our meals, most of the cleaning, plus I help my husband with his business, and run my own little side hustles to make extra income.\n\nMy husband is self employed so his income fluctuates as well. He often works long, strange hours but is pursuing a career he loves after years of us barely scraping by to support his dream. This, trash, and occasionally picking up our son from after-school are his core responsibilities. \n\nHe pays all our rent/utilities, a little under $2k per month. That is the extent of his bills. His family pays his phone/car bills for him and also paid off all his student loans a couple years ago. I pay our groceries, supplies for the house, and whatever our son needs. On top of that I have my phone, auto insurance, student loan bills. $800-1200 per month depending on what I can afford. \n\nEvery. Single. Time that we argue, he throws in my face that he pays for my living expenses and says I “contribute nothing”. I am far from lazy and work hard, but no I don’t earn as much as him, and Its fair to say he is a harder worker than me. He really never stops even at night, whereas after the day is over I like to wind down. I am pretty much in the highest paid position for my field/education/experience, and I don’t want to change fields because I am eligible for licensing soon if I stick with it. I also want to note that our rent is really expensive because he insisted we move here, even though I warned him I didn’t think I could afford it while also paying off my student debt and contributing to a savings account, which was important to me. We both really live “paycheck to paycheck” now, though.\n\nHe keeps insisting that I’m the jerk and I basically should always do whatever he says because he supports me. Where I think he is being unreasonable that we should split all the household bills evenly if 1) I have higher personal bills which are necessary, non-luxuries 2) I do more for our home/child 3) I earn less than him per hour. \n\nTl;dr self-employed husband works long hours, makes more money than me, and has less personal bills due to family help, but is mad that we don’t split our household bills evenly for a home I warned him I couldn’t afford. I want to keep my current job because I like it and it’s good for my long term career goals, and honestly don’t think I could make more anyway. I try to make up for it in non-monetary ways like doing almost all cooking, cleaning, and child raising. AITA?\n\n\n\n",

Here’s some examples: \n\nShe had four clown fish (salt water fish, which are generally pretty tough to take care of for a new timer). I told her to start small, with fresh water minnows or something. She wasn’t having it and got the clown fish. She ended up putting FOUR TIMES the amount of salt in their water. When I told her to fix the water, she just said “they’re tough little guys :-)”.  Yeah no they all died. \n\nFast forward a year, and she wants to get TWO Quaker Parrots - note about them, they are extremely social and need to be socialized all the time. Otherwise, they legit get depressed and die. \n\nI told her not to get those parrots. They live 30 years, and we’re in our mid-twenties and she wants kids. She won’t have time for them. Yeah, of course she doesn’t listen to me and buys two $400 birds. \n\nShe has them for months at most, and they end up HATING her. She gives them to some random pet shop without a second thought. \n\nThrough all this, she’s playing up the sympathy card HARD CORE. Crying to me or anyone who’ll listen about how sad she is about her pets dying or how much she misses her birds. \n\nI finally told her that it was her fault all that shit was happening, for not doing research, or straight up ignoring my advice and being recklessly negligent. Obviously she got upset. AITA? ",

      "description": "This happened in the last couple years but I am still bothered by the results.   \n\n\nI have a great relationship with my husband and his immediate family.   My mother in law (Theresa) in particular is a classy and really fantastic person.  She loves me very much and frequently says she is glad her son found me.   \n\n\nMy mother in law has a sister, my husband aunt (we will call her Betty).  Betty and Theresa had a falling out years ago. Betty rather painfully cut out Theresa and my husband from her life.  Betty loved my husband dearly but didn't want a relationship with her sister so she cut them off entirely.  This falling out was related to hard feelings of competition between the sisters and then resentments about their mother's estate. Theresa doesn't have other family so this hurt everyone.  My husband was a child and it hurt that his loved aunt wouldn't see him.   \n\n\nMany years later Betty is getting married to Clara. Clara is a lovely woman and wants to help Betty get back together with her family.   Everyone reconciles and we start going to Betty and Clara's home once a month for a \"family game night\". While things are reconciled, they are still tense. Betty has a pretty volatile personality with some temper issues. Theresa still feels cautious and hurt. My husband wants things to work, but mostly for his mothers sake.  People usually like me because I am a pleasant people-pleasing sort of woman. Clara loves me but Betty treats me from the start as an outsider.  Betty is a staunch conservative who is ex-military.  (Ironic because she is a lesbian right?)  My husband and I are liberal. My husband is much more liberal than I am and has made me more liberal than ever.   While we rarely discuss politics, it comes up in the course of the kind of games we are all playing together.  Each time Betty gets mad about our viewpoints it becomes obvious that she blames those viewpoints on me ... not her darling nephew, my husband.   \n\n\nFast forward to 2 years of family game nights. Things are tense. Betty doesn't like me and it is obvious. I am an approval seeker so I handle this by becoming very quiet and not participating as much. I have social anxiety and this tension made it terrible. I will be honest.  I didn't want to go any longer.  My husband and I had arguments over it. I would say that she didn't like me.  He would say that is just how she is.  I would talk about tone of voice, body language and facial expressions.  He would not see those things. I wanted his mother to have the relationship she craved with her sister and I wanted him to be able to see his aunt.  I felt guilty and yet hated being forced into these monthly interactions.  I went anyway and isolated myself at these events more and more. I didn't ignore anyone but I stopped being my gregarious friendly self and would stay off in a corner alone on my phone.   \n\n\nWe are expected to RSVP for game nights.  Two times over the 2 years ... I RSVP late. This infuriates Betty. My husband doesn't face book.   The first time the late RSVP happens he tells her that it shouldn't be my job to do this anyway.  He would prefer to do this over the phone with her.  She refuses and insists on using face book and states that it should be my job to manage our social engagements because I am the woman.   \n\n\nThe second time I didn't RSVP fast enough she could see that I had seen the invite ( I was too busy to respond when I opened it and then forgot for a week).   When she lost her temper again at me.  She never talked to me if she could help it so she vented this rage to my husband and I heard of the problem second hand. I told my husband that since the schedule had changed I was having a harder time keeping track of the dates.  I apologized and RSVPed and messaged her to tell her I had forgotten. My husband, making an assumption, thought this meant I hadn't seen the RSVP at all and told his aunt that is why I missed it. She lost her mind.  She said to my MIL that I am a terrible person. She felt that I lied to my husband and I was a bad partner.  She could tell that I had seen it because face book told her it was viewed. She knew that I was deliberately ignoring her and then lying to my husband to say I had not seen it! She thought that I was disrespectful to not RSVP and she never liked me.  My mother in law started to defend me.  She told her that I was a trustworthy and really good partner for her son.  She explained that Betty really had not gotten to know me like she had.  She said that a couple missed RSVPs in 2 years was no big deal.   \n\n\nThe fight between them escalated with Theresa defending me.  My husband and I were told and I said that I wouldn't stop them from seeing her but I no longer would go under any circumstances. My MIL said that she wouldn't go either and my husband said the same. I told them both that I didn't intend to stop them from seeing Betty.   Even though they each had issues with her ... Betty was much nicer to them than she ever was to me and I felt that each had a bit of a relationship with her they liked.   They said that if I wasn't going, they weren't and agreed that Betty was unreasonable.   \n\n\nI still feel guilty.   I got what I really wanted ... which was to not go there any more and deal with this unpleasant aunt-in law.   However, I watched a budding reconnection between sisters get destroyed. My MIL still misses her sister though she directs all of her anger at Betty, not me.   I feel terrible for being the point of contention that made this attempt to reconnect fail.  I feel like if I had been able to get along better with Betty, perhaps not reacted by withdrawing ... perhaps I could have made this relationship better.   \n\n\nTLDR: AITA for failing to make this relationship strong enough to work and being the point of break up of the relationship between my MIL and her sister? My aunt-in-law is a difficult person to get along with, but if it had not been for this conflict she would still be interacting with her sister and my husband. ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to reconnect with a friend I don't like?",
      "description": "Recently, a friend from some years ago reached out to me to try to reconnect. I, in effect, said no.\n\nThough I think I had genuinely liked him when I first met him, at some point I was just tolerating him. He tended to annoy me, but I didn't want to be mean, so I said nothing. I also never thought he was a bad person by any means, so I'd have felt guilty pushing him away.\n\nWhen he asked to reconnect, I remembered the toleration. That I didn't _really_ like him, but kept being friends for his sake. I said no partially because I don't like him a ton but also largely because I think that that was a toxic situation for him to be in, and didn't want to allow it to happen again. He's a good person and deserves to be with friends who like him for who he is.\n\nOf course, it's easy to point out that I could just learn to like him for who he is, solving the issue outright. But I'm not sure if it's fair for anyone to tell me (or me to tell myself) that I _ought_ to like someone--I either do or I don't. As my dad once said, \"it's not your job to be anyone's friend.\" And I'd rather, for both parties' sake, make it clear which way it is--either we can be genuine friends, or not. No toxic in-between that breeds uncertainty and insecurity. I hate being in that situation and would prefer a clear answer, so I will give a clear answer to others.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that I _am not_ reconnecting and accepting him for who he is seems to be some evidence towards the fact that it wouldn't be a good idea to try; that it would crash and burn because I'm not quite an accepting enough person yet. But perhaps this is just me making excuses.\n\nIATA regarding what happened in the past; I should have gone one way or the other. But AITA now?",

      "description": "To start things off my dad has not been a consistent part of my life. He drinks himself till he’s blackout drunk and is the kind of person that would say he’s going to pick me up and would leave me waiting on him. My mother raised me until I was 9 and when she passed away my father gave up custody of me to my aunt and uncle; my mother wanted me to live with them before she passed. He drifted in and out of my life going to jail multiple times and when he seemed to be doing well he’d fuck up his life drink and get violent with his SO. About two years ago he re-entered my life and the first time I saw him in over 3 years he was blackout drunk with my older brother driving him around. He then would message me on Facebook with deadens conversations that went no where ie. “how are you?” “I’m good”. He would send me various messages and got to the point where he’d send weird photos one of which was a nsfw woman that had be burned. \n\nWith all of this context he recently started called my phone number, I’m not sure how he got it again. And would ask how I’m doing; more dead end conversations. I would ignore his calls if it were slightly inconvenient for me to pick up and wouldn’t bother calling back. \n\nMost recently he helped me out. My cars clutch had given out on me and he called me the same day and I told him about it. He offered to fix it if I get the parts. And so he does and was working on it in the rain. He does the job in two days and I get a newfound respect for him. Money was not mentioned by me or him. That following weekend he asks if I wish to go to a baby shower with him I agree to go and on the way there he has me stop asks me for $5 and goes around a corner and buys alcohol without my direct knowledge. He proceeds to drink to the point where he’d doze off. We arrive at the party and I meet some extended family where most people that know him are fully aware that he’s drunk. The situation is extremely uncomfortable for me and I’m forced to babysit him and take him home afterward. \n\nAt this point the little respect I had for the man is crushed and I’m contemplating blocking his number as he calls me every two days to check on me sometimes sober most times drunk. I don’t like being pestered and understand his loneliness but I can’t bring my self to really care for him right now. I’m dealing with my own mental health issues and I honestly feel I’d be better off never seeing him again. \n\nTLDR; my deadbeat alcoholic dad helped me out of a bind and then proceeded to loose my newfound respect of him by having me give him money to buy alcohol and then having me baby sit him.",

      "description": "The title doesn't really explain it well. Sorry. Anyways, I'm 13 and my sister is 12. We live pretty close to Taco Bell, its a 1 hour walk there and back. She's not allowed to go there by herself because she's pretty short/small, and immature for her age. So we walk there, whatever. We pay for our drinks and food. She doesn't get any food because shes not sure if she has enough money to pay for it, so we leave. \n\nAbout a minute after leaving she says \"I wanna go back to get food.\" I say no, but later say I don't care, because she usually bails out if I don't go with her. She starts walking back to Taco Bell and its about 30 seconds before I realized she actually thought she was going to get food, I would keep walking without her, and she would walk home herself. Of course I stormed into that Taco Bell and mini-yelled at her (not loud enough so everybody could hear, but three people did.) I got angry at her and left.  I waited for five minutes outside so she could get her food. \n\nI walked in front of her the whole time, keeping my distance, because, you know what? If she wants to walk home by herself, she's gonna walk home by herself. I still made sure she wasnt getting too close to the road, but that's it. I know what I did was petty. \n\nWhen we got home, she was calling me stupid for complaining that she made me wait and I called her stupid for thinking that I was going to let her walk home by herself, and, I dunno, die? The roads are super slippery and that's why we aren't at school right now. \n\nTo be honest, I'm expecting either everyone's the asshole or I'm the asshole. Using a throwaway account.\n\nTLDR; My sister refused to listen to me, so I yelled at her in front of three other strangers, and I forced her to walk home by herself (which she wanted to do). We both called each other stupid and she's offended that I'm still mad at her. I also locked her out of the house for two minuets lol. We're 13 and 12.",

      "description": "\\[Throwaway\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiance(29M) and I(28F) are getting married at a music festival that has overnight camping. We invited a few close friends and a married couple that we'll call A(30M) and B(29F). It's a fair amount of money to go so we offered to buy everyone's tickets if they pay for their camping slots. (Camping slots are sold as 4-person tents so each person would pay for one quarter of a tent. Tickets are more expensive than camping slots.) Because it's a big decision and the festival does not do refunds, we gave them about 6 months to decide. After that, we got everyone's money who said yes and purchased everything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA month later (6 months ago now), B separated from A. (It's a situation where she has grown a lot and he has been very stagnant, relying heavily on her for emotional support.) In that time, we've tried to figure out if she is still coming or what we should do. At first, she hadn't decided and then she stopped responding. Our wedding is now 2 months away and we told her we are just going forward as if she's not coming. She called us pretty much immediately to say sorry and that she's not coming. She didn't say anything about money. Weeks later she called and said that she just signed a new lease, lost her job, and needs her camping money back. We told her that it's already been spent, but that we'll re-ask the few people who originally said no and if any change their minds she can get her money back. Well, none of them did, so we told her sorry and left it at that. She responded that she'll just try to sell her ticket instead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, the ticket is not hers to sell. We bought them, so if anyone should resell it for money it should be us. Both she and us are out money. Why should she then get money back and not us? I feel bad that she lost her job and is most likely getting divorced, but she made a commitment and backed out so she needs to deal. We haven't responded yet, but if I say no, WIBTA?",

      "description": "Sorry in advance, I'm on mobile.\n\nAnyway, a little backstory is that I'm currently in school. That's it. So, I frequently bring my Nintendo Switch to school and this one kid is always the first to jump on it to play smash with me. You may be thinking he just wants to be your friend. But, no. He is very good at smash and everytime he beats me gets obnoxious about it. The one time I beat him he has a little temper tantrum. So earlier today I'm playing and he comes up. Now, earlier that day he said he wasn't feeling good. So, I was tired of him just being overall obnoxious and annoying so I said when he came up to me, \"you're not feeling good so you probably shouldn't play today. That was my subtle hint of I don't wanna play with you. So then he calls me an asshole and asks why it's only him. This is because other kids play by the way. So I said \"I dont wanna play with you today.\" So I'm thinking he probably got the hint but then he calls me a dick and just throwing a tantrum. So after a couple of minutes of that I just say \"Can you please leave, I just dont enjoy playing with you cuz you obnoxious.\" Then he freaks out and puts his head in his arms at his desk. Later, I felt bad about and really would like to know AITA?",

      "description": "Me (21F) and my ex boyfriend (21M) had been in a steady relationship for a little under a year, about 11 months. Over the last 6 months, he's been getting increasingly distant and I was starting to feel neglected. Not his fault, he had school and work and stuff. So I brought it up to him, and we worked out a compromise: we'd set aside time for each other once a week, even if it was just a simple phone call. \n\nAt first, we kept to it, making sure we spent time together at least once a week, and if we could afford the time then obviously we'd spend more time together. \n\nBut his new semester started, and it wasn't kind to him. He had a full schedule on most weekdays, but that meant one or two weekdays would be free per week. But he doesn't set aside time for me. I understand that he's busy, but once a week is really the least I can go in terms of maintaining a relationship. \n\nSo I bring it up. He calls me unreasonable for asking him to spend time with him at 2am. Alright, but I was trying to point out the larger issue of him not spending time with me, not saying we should spend time now. So I try and tell him, and he ignores me.\n\nHe's ignored me after fights, or if I bring up something he doesn't particularly like, so it's normal. Another \"rule\" we have is that we don't let fights go on for more than 24 hours. Partly because I have pretty severe anxiety and I need to talk things out to make them right, but also because he needs time to process what happened. So we came to a compromise, within 24 hours we would reach out and contact each other.\n\nBut after 36 hours, he hasn't responded. So I sent him a long message telling him that I didn't feel like continuing the relationship with him, because I date for marriage and I can't marry someone who is not willing to spend time with me at least once a week.\n\nIt wasn't just the spending time aspect, I think. It was how we negotiated those rules for him to break them. I was really trying to come to a compromise with those rules, like spending time together once a week and talking after a fight after 24 hours, because I really do need to spend time with someone to maintain a relationship and I really do need to talk after a fight to reassure myself, but he just disregarded those even though I'd talked to him before.\n\nSo, AITA?

I don't personally really need the furniture, and have told her she can donate it, but she really wants me to have it and is pressuring me into picking a place now.  Am I wrong for wanting to wait for a better place? Things turn over a lot but there's nothing great right at this moment.

Some really bad stuff has been happening lately and I've been feeling really down so my nana suggested a day to ourselves to make me feel better. \nUsually my nana and I watch my sisters on a Wednesday so we asked my Papa to watch them for a few hours and he said that's fine but not for my sister L, (L has always been a bit of a brat since she started hanging with the horrible wee girls who made fun of my youngest sisters autism) \nL threw a fit she said if she can't come she is going to her friends and tried to leave the house my poor nana had to lock the door, she came in and threw water all over my room and then threw slime at me and it went everywhere and I had to do all the cleaning. (Also she knows I hate slime and can't touch it cause it's freaks me out what is one of the perks of me having Aspergers)\n\nToday she pushed me over the edge when I realized I got my period and it hit hard, blood was running right into my jeans so I rushed to the toilet but L pushed past me so I tried stopping her and said \"L stop I'm on my period and I'm bleeding through\" she looked at me laughed, Locked the bathroom door then said \"but I'm already in\" she proceeded to take as long as she could in the toilet, probably about 10 minutes. By the time she was out blood was all over my white jeans and I was fuming.\nSo I got a pad went and changed my underwear, changed my jeans for leggings. \nMy bloody jeans where Inside out so the blood was alot more visible I took them, went into L's room then did a perfect throw from the door to smack in her face. She looked shocked for a second, looked at me then looked at what hit her then screamed, like those movie scenes screams where wine glasses explode she also started crying and mom came in thinking she fell or something and then shouted at me although I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nDo you think I went a bit far?",

Maybe the bartender made a simple mistake, it happens but I do want that cocktail so I ordered again hoping that this time was right, the waiter takes the orders and the menù back and we kept chatting, I said joking to my friends that if there's coke again in my cocktail I'll send it back.\n\nFF to when the bartender was making our cocktails again and here it is, he is pouring coke in my drink, again, so when the waiter comes in I gently ask to change my cocktail since it is not properly done, so the waiter goes speaking to the bartender which replies that he does cocktails like they are written in the menù if I wanted my own twist I should've said it earlier.\n\nSince I don't want to make too much of a scene I said that most probably I was wrong and didn't read the menù carefully enough (but I was 101% sure I read it carefully) so I said that I'll accept my cocktail like it is, if in the menù there's coke and not sprite, so I'll ask for another menù since the waiter took ours earlier when he took the orders to double check. And Yes I was right from the beginning the cocktail is made how I said, and on the menù in that bar is written like i recalled.\n\nIn the end the waiter apologized and changed my cocktail making a little joke saying this time it will be exactly like I was supposed to receive it  and after that he offered us a round of free shots.\n\nI felt really bad while my friends started poking at me saying the next drink will contain spit and that probably the bartender was fired (which for the record he wasn't) but after that I felt really bad, I'm no Gordon Ramsey shitting on everything unless is perfect and was actually my first time sending something back, so in the end AITA?",

      "description": "Hey there, dudes!\n \nThis story is a doozie.\n\nSo, about a week ago, I went to a school acting convention. I’m apart of my school’s Thespian program. This was an overnight trip and we stayed there for three days. The trip was pretty fun until the last day. I had missed lunch so, I was upset with myself. I was in the lunch hall and I shoved a chair a bit (keep in mind, I suffer from Bipolar Disorder so my temper can flare up at times, but I’m much better at dealing with it now). I didn’t shove it too hard and I was ready to leave the cafeteria and head off to my next workshop. All of a sudden, this lady with rectangular frame glasses and starts yelling at me. I’ll name her GF (grey fury).\n\nGF: *storms up to me* Hey! You’re making an ass out of yourself! You’re a stupid ass!\n\nSide note: I don’t deal well with being repeatedly followed and confronted because my Bipolar disorder makes me afraid of other people. The best thing for me to do when agitated is to leave and de-escalate things.\n\nMe: This has nothing to do with you. Leave me alone, please!\n\nAt this point, she got even more indignant and followed me around more.\n\nGF: I’m not the one making an ass out of myself! You are! You look absolutely stupid and ridiculous right now!\n\nI had had it. I was so scared, mad, and anxious. I finally stood up for myself.\n\nME: *Yelling, visibly upset* Leave me the hell alone, bitch! What the actual fuck do you not understand about that?!\n\nGF tries to get closer.\n\nME: GO TO HELL, YOU OLD HAG! LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE!\n\nI ran to the bathroom, shut myself in, and cried until my teacher found me. I came out of the bathroom and he asked me what had happened. I told him the whole story and luckily, my teacher is pretty awesome and was totally supportive. He’s like another father to me. He asked me if I knew who she was but, I didn’t. She didn’t work at the convention because she didn’t have a convention name tag, like all employees and attendees were required to wear. I don’t even think she worked at the university.\n\nAfter that, we went to the closing ceremony. After we left the ceremony, I see the crazy woman again. She gives me this dirty look and I flipped her off. Do I regret flipping her off? Hell no. I’m not confrontational and I don’t have a mean bone in my body but the way she treated me was abhorrent. When I got home, I told my parents what happened and they were horrified that an old lady, who was more than old enough to know better, was yelling and cussing at a child with mental problems for no reason.\n\nTLDR: I gently shove chair at convention, crazy old woman cusses me out and follows me, I tell her to go to hell, run away, she follows me around an hour later, and I flip her off.",

      "description": "Mother's Day in the UK is on the 31st of this month. In preparation I brought her gift well ahead of time (last week). Earlier tonight my sister saw the gift I had brought my Mum and scoffed at its price. I've brought my Mum a large Galaxy smooth chocolate bar (one of her favourite types of chocolate) for £2.50. \n\nMy sister exclaimed that since I have a full time job I should have spent more on my Mum's present. She is still in college and works part time and said she at least spent £10 on her. I believe she got her a piece of clothing. My Dad was listening in on the conversation and appeared to agree with my sister on the subject.\n\nFor Christmas it was the opposite story, I spent £12 on a cardigan for my Mum whilst my sister spent around £4 on something (I've forgotten what). I didn't care about the price then as it was the most thoughtful gift I could think of at the time. If a gift is worth getting I'll pay the price for it, but I don't see it necessary to spend lots for the sake of it. \n\nMother's Day is yet another day a year which for me has been ruined by capitalism, they're is nothing special about the 31st of March. We are just told that it is and that if we don't buy our Mum something we are wrong. For me the day is about spending time with your Mum and a gift is a nice cherry on top. A present is meant to be a show of love and be thoughtful, not something you feel like you have to do and that the less you spend=the less you love them.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking like this? Should I get a second present to bump up the amount I spent? Or is it just capitalism propaganda ruining what's meant to be a day of showing your love?",

      "description": "Anon account cause Boyfriend reads reddit.\n\nI’m currently 34 weeks pregnant and a VERY light sleeper. That combination alone causes me to lose precious hours of sleep. Our 7 month old Kitty wakes up around 3/4/5 am and runs around under our bed and zips in and out of our bedroom. She drags noisy toys into the room. Boyfriend sleeps through all of this. I began to turn into a curmudgeon because I just can’t get a solid night’s rest.\n\n I suggest she needs to sleep outside of the bedroom. He wants her to keep sleeping with us but he offers to get up in the night and put her out of the room. He doesn’t wake up when she plays. I ALWAYS ended up being the one to wake up and put the cat out of our bedroom.\n\nI start to wake up to piles of dirt on the floor around my beloved plants. She ends up killing one of them. Boyfriend does nothing. I reprimand the cat. Boyfriend also lets cat climb on the counters, tables, splash in the toilet, claw at carpets, etc. WITHOUT reprimanding her. He just kind of laughs and goes “she’s a cat”. My logic is “sure, she’s a cat but she also needs to be trained.” \n\nThis leads me to do a bit of scholarly internet research about training cats. I learn about parasites, fungal infections, bacterial infections, protozoal infections, and so on. (I understand the risks are EXTREMELY low for catching diseases from cats) I’ve always been a little grossed out by her putting her cat asshole on pillows but this pushes my concern over the edge for germs. We’ve already had to scoop her up and take her to the bathroom to wash squished shit off her paw. My BIGGEST concern is that I’m due in about a month and a half and everything I’ve read says do NOT let your cats sleep in bed with your babies. The cats can unknowingly suffocate a helpless infant. We will have a bassinet and some nights I will be cosleeping because I will breast feed but this is IT, folks. I say no more cat in the bed, PERIOD. My line is drawn because my baby’s safety is my number one concern. \n\n He begins to heavily advocate to have the cat in the bed, based solely on the fact that she won’t feel like a part of the family if she isn’t in the bed. I remind him that I can’t sleep through the night. I remind him that I don’t want cat shit and kitty litter in the bed. I even tell him that she can’t sleep in the bed with baby around so she needs to be broken of the habit NOW before baby comes so she won’t blame him for her eviction. All he cares about is her being comfortable. \n\nSoooo, am I the asshole for not wanting the cat to sleep in our bed anymore?",

      "description": "I’ve [F26] been friends with this person [F25] since we were 13. She is a great friend in terms of being there to listen. Her family and her have always been poor. Her mother has never been a good role model - keeping publicly abusive relationships, drinking constantly and not being there for her daughter. Her family life over all has always been hard.  She has dealt with depression and anxiety her whole life.\n\nMy friend has never been able to keep a job more than a couple months since high school. She just quits randomly. I’ve paid thousands of dollars for her over the years in the form of rent, food and entertainment so that she can enjoy nights out with our friend group. \n\nShe has two children who she sees every other week because her and the dad are separated. When she doesn’t have the kids, she goes on drinking benders. During these, she will start shit with her family members and boyfriends causing huge fights. She just got a DUI a couple months ago and is now on probation but is refusing to stop drinking or doing drugs.\n\nShe has wanted to kill herself for years, and has acted on it tens of times. She will blow up everyone’s phones saying she is taking a bottle of pills and then not answer anyone’s calls. This was start her loved ones leaving responsibilities like work, racing around town while in tears trying to find her and getting the cops involved. Last episode she had called me for the first time saying she was going to kill herself which sent me into a panic and i had to go track her down in a crying panic thinking my friend would be dead by the time I got there. Every time is has turned out she didn’t actually take pills and she was saying/doing crazy shit cause she had been drinking. I have stopped inviting her out with new people because she will show up wasted and embarrass me.\n\nI was already distancing myself a bit because I couldn’t emotionally deal with the chaos, but the last straw was when I foolishly let her borrow a few hundred dollars. She had a new job and seemed to be doing well, so I told her yes but I needed it back in two weeks. She promised me she’d have the money back to me “100%”. She said she needed help because her kids’ dad fucked her over on daycare. Turns out she quit that job the day prior (after 1 week of being there) and that she actually needed that money for rent. She told me all of this a week later and genuinely didn’t seem to realize that her story was much different than what she told me before. That deadline is now three months ago. She has brought up paying me back once. She got another job a couple weeks ago and I heard from a friend she already quit it.\n\nShe’s had a history of dating physically and mentally abusive men. Yesterday I get a call from her mom asking if I’d seen her because she hadn’t come home. I say no and automatically know what this is about. The night prior she had texted me bragging how she cheated on her boyfriend. This boyfriend has blatantly said to our group of friends that he’s not afraid to beat a woman. I knew he was evil. Turns out her sister told him that she had cheated on him, he drove to her house, broke in, smashed her phone and beat her. She now has bruises all over her and is (hopefully) getting a restraining order. I was not surprised at all, I told my friend he’d beat her one day and my friend (who is also one of her bfs) didn’t believe me. He is an overly-obvious abusive person. Yelling at her constantly in front of strangers, acting crazy all of the time.\n\nIn summary, I’m caught up because I have suffered from crippling anxiety and depression but it’s never brought this type of destruction onto everyone around me or myself. It seems at this point she’s choosing all of these awful things to happen to her at this point. (Besides being beat obviously). Blatantly self-sabotaging. Which I know can be from mental illness. Where do you draw the line blaming it on mental illness? I don’t want to be dragged into this anymore. I care about her and her wellbeing but it’s been 10 years of this chaos. \n\nSomething happens every week. And every week either she or her mom will call me to talk about it, thinking that I need to be informed of what happened. The same shit that always happens. Nothing ever changes, and in fact gets worse every year. It brings a lot of stress onto to me and has ruined a lot of days for me, crying, leaving social setting to go make sure she’s okay or sitting around in anxiety over how she’s doing.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to stay friends but not wanting to hear or be dragged into her mess?",

      "description": "Hey AITA, I'm finally able to post here after an intense moral debate with my friends, SO, and self.\n\nContext:\n\nIt's 3 AM in the morning, and a group of friends (3) and I are in my apartment after a board games session and are getting into beds/sleeping bags, my roommate is sleeping. One of them is quiet, the other speaks loudly but turns it down when asked to, and the last one is a guy who thinks he can do whatever he pleases. This last guy has been kind of an AH the entire night (and for a day or two), doing shitty and resentful comments, and it kinda got to my nerves so I asked all of them to keep it down, please. This guy keeps arguing with loud guy, after telling me he will not pay back the food we ordered (he's kinda on a tight budget also), and had told me before he doesn't give a shitty about my roommate.\n\nThen, the pivotal moment.\n\nI calmly told him to shut up, that he is really annoying and I'm losing my patience, so I'm considering kicking him out. He then said \"lol you can't do that\", to which I replied \"wanna see?\" So I open the door and tell him to go ahead twice. If he did, I would've given him another chance.\n\nHe then complied and went to sleep.\n\nThen, the day after, everyone is mad at me for doing that, telling me I overreacted, and that it is a shitty thing to do.\n\nHis arguments particularly are that he values \"loyalty\" and he wasn't even responsible for the volume of the conversation.  Loud guy hasn't given me his opinion, but obnoxious guy says that he also thinks I am the asshole. Quiet guy says I'm totally the asshole, that kicking out a friend is a really shitty thing to do, especially to friends; that if he's resentful, he could be going through rough times and I should support him, not kick him out. SO thinks I'm NTA because I didn't effectively kick him out, and that I shouldn't put up with him; friends or not, he's being disrespectful and obnoxious.\n\nI'm really annoyed by this situation and no one satisfies my moral discomfort. I'd really like to hear your thoughts/critics/analysis on this and if possible to give me advice on what to do.\n\nThank you very much in advance, and sorry if bad English, it not first tongue.",

My wife and I have both had a rough couple of weeks with work and tensions finally got the better of us and we got into a stupid, unimportant disagreement about home decorating in which both of us acted like assholes and got entirely too upset over such a dumb topic. \n\nAs this was later in the night, she ended up telling me she was so upset with me that she didn't want to share a bed with me. This is the first time this has happened, so I asked her to come talk to me so we didn't end the night angry at eachother and because I felt like something else was wrong. She got even more upset and clarified that she thinks I should sleep downstairs tonight. I told her no, i wasn't going to sleep downstairs and I wanted to talk to her and she got mad at me and accused me of not listening to her.\n\nI said I'm not going to be sent downstairs in my own home, and if shes that upset with me and refuses to talk it out then she can go sleep downstairs or in the guest room because I don't have any problem sharing a bed with her. She spent the next thirty minutes yelling about how she doesn't want me in \"her\" bed, to which I reiterated that it's not her bed, it's our bed and im not the one trying to kick her out of it. she eventually came to bed.\n\nWe've since talked about it and realized it was blown completely out of proportion and caused by the added stress in our lives, and made a lot of resolutions to communicate better and make time for eachother. However, she's still mildly pissed that I wouldn't just sleep downstairs when she asked, and I still think it's unfair to make your partner leave their own bed instead of either talking or doing it yourself if you're the one who needs space.\n\nI think we were both shitty here, but settle this for us.

For this reason she's had trouble getting a date for prom. \n\nNow she has a massive crush on the actor Ben hardy. When I was over my friends house she asked me if I could share her message on social media for him to go to prom with her. I responded with sure, but I added. \"I wish you best of luck but the odds of this happening are very low\".  This is where the trouble begins. She calls me an ass for saying that and I reply \"it's not like you're gonna die from having dwarfism\" \nYour life won't be ruined by not having this guy be your date. Both her and my friend are calling me an asshole for doing this \n\nSo reddit AITA\n",

      "description": "Every couple of weeks my family (me, husband, 5 year old and 1 year old) will drive about 40 minutes to the big, new grocery store to do a large shopping trip. We’ve made it a routine to have lunch/dinner at Culver’s afterwards as a treat.  Now, I like Culver’s, albeit not quite as much as husband and 5 year old do. Also, I am not a picky eater - in fact, I’m almost always the one making food sacrifices for those two, who *are* extremely picky. Which is ok!  However, today I just did NOT want to eat at Culver’s. At all. It literally sounded gross to me. I’m getting over being sick, and greasy fast food was not appealing in the slightest. Since I knew everyone else was looking forward to it, I figured I’d order a sandwich from the sandwich place next door while checking out our groceries, and we’d swing by there to pick it up on our way out. We’d go eat at Culver’s, and I could just eat my sandwich on the drive home.\n\nHowever, my husband did not like this. He said I should have just “compromised”, and eaten at Culver’s anyways so we could eat as a family. He said he felt rushed because I was just “sitting there staring at him” (which I was absolutely not, in fact I was busy keeping the very crabby nap deprived toddler happy and fed, which was actually easier to do while not trying to eat myself at the same time!). He also claimed it was “weird” that I ate my sandwich by myself on the ride home. \n\nPersonally, I thought I WAS compromising by going with what everyone else wanted to eat while still having food that I actually found appealing, from elsewhere.  I felt like he was blowing it out of proportion - not that this was a huge fight or anything, just a minor disagreement, but imo it didn’t even need to be that. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?  Should I have sucked it up and eaten something unappetizing to me?",

      "title": "AITA for helping a newer coworker learn parts of his job?",
      "description": "So, I was a cashier at a restaurant for a while and i recently quit right before Christmas. I worked there for a total of 5 months and during my time there we underwent significant changes in leadership and staff, so most of the people I worked with had quit or been fired by my third month there including several managers and the general manager that hired me. As a result I was switched to a completely different shift and had to work with a bunch of trainees and new employees. \nOne of the major changes made at the restaurant was the opening of a new position called the cleaning captain. His job was basically just to keep the restaurant clean. He had worked under the new GM for around 2 years at a different restaurant franchise (very important detail), so she recruited him to work at our store. \nInitially I had no problems working with the guy, his position alleviated a lot of my responsibilities, so I was given other tasks. Because I had already been trained on the proper ways to do some of these tasks by the District manager (who supervised the store during the management change for about a month, and changed up the protocols for a lot of things) I offered to help him learn the right ways to do things like cleaning windows and bathrooms (which the DM was very strict about). \n\n*I chose to help him because i saw that he wasn't receiving proper training, and was basically being thrown in the pool and told to swim by the new GM, who was a rookie herself.*\n\nSo, after i showed him how to do them properly a few weeks later i noticed that he would slack on doing them (they were supposed to be done every morning) and I would remind him to do them, so he doesn't get chewed out by the GM. I personally would want someone to do that for me, but he started to take it as me bullying him (this is important). So, i stopped reminding him unless I needed to. \n\nFast forward a couple of weeks and we're short staffed because the morning shift manager quit, the morning cashier was fired along with the morning fryer. So, i was put into the position as the opening shift cashier and prep. He was also forced to take on two postions as the cleaning captain and prep helper. \n\nSo, up until then we remained cordial and we would joke around along with the new morning manager and the fry cook. The three of them were way older than me. I'm 18, the morning manager was 37, the fry cook was 27, and the cleaning captain was 38. We would toss around insults and jokes, and they would complain about their struggles in life. \nI would avoid talking about the heavy stuff and  would join in on the jokes, but every time I would join in he'd act like it was a big problem and make it seem like I was picking on him. The only time that i actually picked on him was when I joked about how dumb it looked when he kept the cardboard in his hat.  Other than that I only ever added on to group banter and it was never one sided. \n\nWhen we worked he still insisted that i was picking on him if showed him the proper way to do things , or if I asked him to help me with something. A lot of the stuff being asked of him was outside of his position, but it wasnt me asking him to do it. I  only tried to show him how to get things done more effectively, but he would still whine and complain about me picking on him. I have a low tolerance for whiners and I refuse to be antagonized, so I would defend myself. It got to the point where every time i said anything to him he would make it an arguement.  \n\nI'll admit that I'm not the most sensitive or patient person, so I  tried to explain to him that I'm not trying to pick on him. I was only trying to do my job and help him with his because when he messed up or took too long doing something it would throw off my work and would add to my work load.\nHe didn't take that well and would call me a disrespectful little girl. I don't understand how I  was being disrespectful, or why he felt like he deserved to be treared better because of his age. \n\nAbout a week or so later the confrontation got worse. He would purposely be in my way to irritate me, he constantly accused me of purposely making messes that he had to clean, and he would snap on me if I tried to get him to do his job more effectively and stop making me work harder than neccessary. \nAt some point he started talking trash about me to other coworkers and trying to ruin my image, refusing to help me with things like lifting boxes that were too heavy for me and getting supplies during the lunch rush, and he once told me that he wished his daughter (who died about 6 years ago and was 5 or so years older than me) was still alive so she could beat me up. \n\nThe final straw came when he out right yelled at me because I tried to show him how to fry something faster after waiting on him to get done for almost 20 minutes, so I could do what i had to do before the lunch rush started (I was the only cashier and I also fried chips and stuff, but I couldn't do both during the rush). Later that same day he yelled at me for telling him that he needed to hurry and leave the kitchen instead of lollygagging trying to steal food out of uniform after his shift, because the DM was on her way and would fire him and yell at all of us if she saw him like that. \n\nAfter this incident, I talked to my parents about it and they told me that tbe best thing to do was to go to the GM about it or her boss. I would have gone to the manager that was over our shift first, but she saw everything as it happened and even after I showed clear signs of distress and I told her it bothered me, she never did anything to resolve the issue. She always laughed it of and I found out later that she assumed that we had known each other for a long time and were playing (even though I clearly told her that the way he treated me bothered me). \n\nSo, I told the GM and she got defensive and accused me of being bossy and took his side because she knew him longer and \"he wasn't know for acting like this\". She completely dismissed everything I said, and her solution to the problem was to just have us ignore each other. EVEN THOUGH HIS JOB DIRECTLY AFFECTED MINE. \n\nThe next week my hours were immediately cut in half and i was given fewer days to work, while his never changed. Her excuse when I quit, because it's a waste of time to work 3 hours and day for 2 days a week, as that we weren't bring in enough money and they had to decrease hours. That were BS, because there were part timers with more hours than me. \n\nTL;DR: I was accused of bullying because I wanted to help a newer employee be more efficient. \n\n\n",

      "description": "I'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n",

I told them I will definitely own up to the problem if I did it, but that as far as I know I have absolutely done it per instructions and would like to be led through it again.No word on when they plan to show me where I went wrong.\n\n Then today, a coworker comes to bring me an invoice. I tell him to put it in my mailbox and I will put it in. Jokingly he responds \"Who gave you a mailbox?\" Then the other person in the office responds that it is still trail and error. I, trying to bring back the light tone, say \"A little less error everyday.\" Then they respond \" if you say so.\" COMPLETELY SERIOUSLY.\n\nLater, while doing my original duties I was hired for, the office manager comes to tell me I need to pay better attention because the same person from the office found I mis-filed an invoice in the K folder when it belongs in the L folder....(seriously they got stuck together)...and that they now are going through all of the to be paid invoices to make sure I didn't mess up again and it's a whole bunch more work for them.\n\nI just don't know if I am a super crappy employee or if I have a crappy job.\n  \n\n\n",

      "description": "Posting this on behalf of a friend. This happened a few months ago. \n\nI’m in college and I started getting with a girl who I met through a friend. When we first kissed, we had been hanging out for a majority of the day; we were definitely “cuddly” and flirty to the point where it felt like we were dating, which is something I wasn’t really comfortable with. As I was leaving her room that night, she was the one to lean in first. I was a bit taken aback because I hadn’t really known her for that long — so I told her after we kissed that I wanted to take things slowly. She says ok, everything’s fine, we make out again a day or so later.\n\nNow here’s what happened. I’m in class the next week a day before my birthday, and I get a text from her while my phone is off (I usually have it off in class). She knows what class it is and where. When I get back to my room, I turn on my phone and I see the missed messages from her saying that she would be outside my classroom’s building waiting until my class ended with cookies she baked me for my birthday. For the record, I didn’t see her waiting outside the building when I left.\n\nI know you may be thinking: that’s so nice of her, how cute, etc… but I honestly felt like it was weird. I have been in relationships before and this sort of stuff didn’t happen too often, let alone in the first week. Then this girl who I haven’t known for more than a week or so tells me she’s waiting outside with cookies she’s made me as if it’s a promposal.\n\nAnyways, I text her saying I’m sorry for not seeing her messages before and that I was busy, and she responds that its okay. But the whole incident gives me weird vibes — from the way she was acting she definitely made it seem like we were dating. After this incident, I mostly stopped talking to her, and didn’t continue hanging out with her until the whole thing fizzled out. I could definitely tell she was trying to keep things going, but the encounter put me off.\n\nAm I an asshole for ghosting her?",

      "description": "This is kind of a long story. But years ago, I met this girl and hit it off.  We talked about all kinds of things- our life experiences, plans for future, hobbies, and eventually sexual things. Soon though she had to go back to her own city,  so nothing really happened between us.(we didn't start to openly talk about sexual things until after this fact.)\n\nWe talked about things like our kinks, what we like, sometimes talk about whether or not we managed to get lucky, etc.\n\nLost contact with her over for a couple of years when I got into a serious relationship. After it ended early this year, I got back in touch with her to see if there was still some thing there. We tried a couple times to meet, and finally narrowed down a time for me to fly to her city. I checked in with her multiple times before I jumped on booking a trip and place to stay. Leading up to the month, she started sexting me heavier than usual. (Vids, dirty talk, etc)\n\nThe day before I was set to fly though, we talked about the phone and I could tell something was off. We talked about it, and she ended up wanting to cancel at the 11th hour. I respected that decision, but I had some airline credits I wanted to spend that would expire soon from my breakup. And there were places I wanted to check out in this city, so fuck it. C'est la vie.\n\nI knew she was into me though, and I was into her. But there was never anu discussion about what we are or exclusivity.  So I ended up hooking up with people I met at some classy lounges I really liked, and I told her about them when we talked about how my trip was going. She started making replies shorter. I could tell, tried to talk about it, but she kept blowing me off. (Again, we had history about talking times we got lucky. Nothing specific, but still.) So I just enjoyed the rest of my vacation.\n\nWell couple weeks later I reached ou to try to talk to her again,  to talk things out. Didn't work out, she wanted to stop talking, and she threw a couple of insults towards me. One of which was aimed about the fact that I hooked up with random people, which I never kept from her in the past.\n\nI personally think I dodged a bullet, especially since she aimed to insult something she never had a problem before in the past. But yeah, AITA for hooking up with other women knowing how she'd feel? Throwaway account.",

      "title": "AITA for stealing over 4K USD from my abusive parents?",
      "description": " \n\nBasically title. Over the last two years, I’ve stolen over four thousand USD from my parents. This is because they have been emotionally abusing me for the last five years of my life (I’m sixteen now). My parents constantly belittle and criticize me for arbitrary things that I do. They’ve controlled my social life with my friends and tried to isolate me as much as they can. They listen in on the few phone calls I get and keep me from visiting my friends (many of whom I have lost contact with due to the five years of isolation). They have even pulled me out of the public schooling system and have chosen to ‘homeschool’ me (in reality, they don’t teach me anything). \n\nMy dad is always extremely aggressive towards me and lacks any sort of empathy for me. He used to be a good father, but he became a nightmare soon after my grandmother died. He tries to intimidate me constantly. He destroys the things I buy with my own money. Just last month, he took away a tablet that I recently bought with my own money that I earned working as a fast-food cashier. \n\nMeanwhile, my mom shows clear signs of being a narcissist. She constantly acts superior to me and refuses to acknowledge any of my feelings. Whenever I talk to her, she always ignores what I’m trying to say and constantly berates me for “not being good enough.”\n\nAs a result, I’ve resorted to playing video games as an outlet. At this point, my games are the only things that matter to me anymore. They’re an escape from the horrible life my parents create for me. \n\nI hate them. They think they’re the smartest people in the world, but they don’t know anything. They expect so much from me when they give me nothing. I want to run away from home soon. I would need to steal some more money in order for me to survive, but I’d do anything to get away from them.\n\nThe reason I’ve been stealing the money is to get back at them. Honestly, my parents have made my life a living hell, and I hardly want to wake up in the mornings. They always call me a spoiled brat whenever I play any video games. They’re always trying to take away my one joy in life, so I figured I would take away the only thing they seem to care about. Over the past year or so, I’ve been taking money from my parents and spending it all on in-game purchases and electronic devices. At the time, I thought it was only fair since they abused me and took away a lot of my stuff.\n\nBut still, a part of me feels a bit guilty. I know I’m being too generous considering my parents’ awful behavior, but I still feel like taking the money might have been wrong. Dad was really close to my grandma. He used to be nice before my grandma died. Mom’s been getting in a lot of fights with dad too. Sometimes, I wonder if maybe I’m doing something to deserve this.\n\nThat’s the full story, I guess.

      "description": "So my fiancee and I have been together roughly 5 years.  We are getting married at the end of this year, which all of the plans are well in motion for.  That being said, our sex life has significantly dropped off, and I feel myself becoming less interested in her sexually and attracted to other women.  Let me be clear, I would never act on these feelings because I do love my fiancee, but I am beyond frustrated at this point.  I have talked to her about the fact that I am tired of being the constant initiator, and if I don't, then just nothing happens. And I mean months, not just a week or two.  She always apologizes and says she understands and she'll be better.  Which might lead to a handjob or sex once or twice over the course of the next couple of weeks, then just back to nothing.  It's not that she ever really turns me down, she just seems so uninterested when anything happens.  She swears that she loves having sex with me and reaches the finish line every time we are intimate, but her actions and body language says otherwise.  \n\nOn top of it, I feel our increasingly distant intimacy giving me feelings of insecurity that I have not felt with her before.  I hear her getting text messages or FB messages in the middle of the night, but she never addresses it the next day.  I know one of her friends especially messages her at weird hours a lot, so I don't think much of it, but the lack of intimacy is driving my brain to think things it never has before.  It seems silly to feel this way because I really do trust her, but I feel like my damn brain is all twisted up from all of this.\n\nI just don't know what to do.  I love her and want to spend the rest of my life with her, but also don't want to have to essentially force myself on her or literally grab her hand and put it on my dick while we are laying in bed to get things going (which has literally happened).  I feel my eyes wandering and just becoming more and more detached from my relationship with her, which I never ever want to happen.  AITA for feeling this way?",

My sister went back to her college and hasn’t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn’t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn’t find them.it wasn’t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because “I dunno I just like the taste of them.” \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn’t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I’m going to drive out to her college. I’ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must’ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I’m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation.

      "description": "I recently purchased a significant number (&gt;$150 worth) of live lobsters from a large grocery chain that takes pride in their quality and service.\n\nThere was a young man working the fish counter by himself (all geared up in fish mongering gear) but I was the only customer. This was mid-day yesterday. When I asked about storing them overnight he first said to leave them in the tied bags. When I asked about oxygen he then told me to put them in a bucket of salt water. Both of these are dead wrong and will kill the lobsters. He sounded unsure so I asked if he could check with someone else, and said that he was the only one there and, \"do you want the lobsters or not?\"\n\nI bought them, because I'm not driving all over upstate NY looking for live lobster.\n\nAfter confirming proper storage I called the store and spoke to a manager explaining that I was given bad advice by an employee who essentially refused to ask for guidance. Part of this was motivated by a desire to protect my investment by getting reassurance that I could refund my lobsters today if they didn't make it (the manager offered before it came up) but I was careful to be respectful and phrase my complaint as a suggestion they train people better rather than a criticism of the particular employee.\n\nMy family says I'm a jerk for jeopardizing this kids job around Christmas.",

      "description": "So a life long friend had asked me to help him in a project of his. He wants to design a website where people can chat about the topic he told me. I told him that I would like to wait and see what becomes of the project first for two reasons. First is that I like to know everything when going into something or at the very least remove most variables when approaching something. His idea is very open-ended and he didn't do a good job explaining what he has in store for the project. Secondly, I just didn't find the premise all that enticing and I wasn't too sure how far he was willing to with the project itself. He is the type of guy who likes to have a lot of different things happening at once. But I don't know if this will be a project with a future or something that falls to the way-side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo further my second point I have to give some context. He told me that he would like me to help him on another project, a book he is writing. He asked for me to read the first chapter of his book and give him my thoughts and criticisms. When I read about 3 out of the 15 pages I gave my honest opinions about something I found weird about the book or inconsistencies in the narrative. After I explained these to him, he simply told me about another book idea he had, instead of addressing my issues with his original story. I asked him if he wanted me to continue reading and critiquing his story and he said yes. So I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days later I was on a phone call with him and the conversation shifted to his website idea. That was when I got more of an idea on what he wanted to do. Basically, he was going to interview some people that he met through college. Then he would post the interviews and maybe have a forum where people could discuss their opinions about the topic of his website. I told him that's cool and I am glad he has some sort of vision. Then I asked \"what about after that though\" like what is his end goal with the website. He kinda got offended a bit by saying that people from my state are not go-getters and people always focus on the endgame of projects. He went on to say he thinks people in other states are more quick to jump on board with a project as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally got around to reading his story, and so, took about an hour or so reading it, re-reading it, then making side notes on google docs for him to look at. I messaged him and asked him if he thought my critiques were well thought out. He then tells me that he is doing research for yet another project and that he would look at my list of side notes later. It kind of ticked me off a bit that I spent my time to help him yet, because he was preoccupied with other things, he didn't take the time to look over my notes for his story. And still hasn't contacted me about his story idea to this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently he has contacted me again to ask for help on his website. He is using Wordpress to design his website.  He knows I have a lot of free time, seeing as I am unemployed, and that I have some knowledge with computers. He, on the otherhand, does not understand how to use it nor is he that computer savvy. He basically wants me to learn how to use Wordpress and teach it to him. He does preface this by saying, \"if you want to\" and that I would be doing him a huge favor. The only problem is that I turned him down before and he has literally done nothing to convince me on his premise or that he will see this project through. ",

      "description": "Sorry if it's gonna be a long post!\n\nSo me and my boyfriend recently moved to a new house. We're both young and broke so we're trying to save money here and there and the house was only partially furnished. On the first meeting with the landlord, we agreed that he still needed to fix a couple things in the house in the near future (there was no interphone, no freezer in the fridge, no smoke detectors!!!, and no showerhead), and because of some legit reasons (we both have insomnia) we asked him to add another bed in the guest room. \n\nNote we asked \"We know it should be on us, but is there any chance you have a spare bed or mattress you could put in the guest room?\", and he said, sure no problem, we'll buy a cheapish one and give it to you for free. We thought we were very lucky and waited. A month passed and finally the landlord said he would come give us the bed on a certain day. At 9pm that day I called and asked if he was still going to come over and he replied that he changed his mind and he wouldn't buy us another bed. \n\nWell, it was rude not to tell us sooner, but it's kind of fair. So a couple days later he came over to talk about the other things he said he would fix and he said he would order the interphone and smoke detectors and then have his own electrician install them, but we had to wait a bit because he was also having his own house fixed. Sure, fine. He also said he would ask his own plumber advice on how to install a showerhead for a cheapish price (quote \"£10 and it should be good\").\n\nThen we asked about the freezer, he jumped and said (and it really sounded like a stupid excuse...) that the previous tenants stole the fridge that was originally in the kitchen and replaced it but he had no idea that it had no freezer and he agreed to buy one for us (I checked all fucking local appliances stores and even online and you can buy a small one for £70). \n\nDidn't hear from him for another week and I texted him if he had some news. He seemed pissed off and replied \"ordered the freezer\", so I asked when to expect him so that we could be home and he replied \"when it arrives\". \n\nPlease note that I have been extremely polite the entire time and that smoke detectors in the kitchen are mandatory in the UK. We also bought ourselves a lot more stuff that was missing, such as hoover, shelves, wifi hub, wardrobes etc\n\nIdk, are we the assholes for asking for a spare bed in the first place? We've been showering with a fucking spare mug we fill with the bathtub taps for months now and it's kind of scary to know that if there ever was a fire we have no alarm system.",

We still love each other though and he swears hes going to get help for some anger issues and depression he has. Him and his ex broke up way before i met him because she was cheating on him. They only just recently started talking after he moved out of my house after about 7 yrs of no contact with her. He swears nothings going on with her but they talk all the time, even about our marriage. He calls her babe in txts and they say i love you all the time to each other. He swears that this is how they always talked to each other. Hes known her longer than i have and he tells me shes known him longer so she understands him more. We have been married for 8 yrs with 2 kids and together for nearly 15. I trust him when he says they arent sleeping together but i feel that she will try soon enough because she never spoke to him and was almost mad when he married me.  But he swears its not like that and defends her saying im wrong and she wouldn't do that. I said to him that its not normal to talk to other females like this when your in a relationship but he just defends her and tells me nothings going on even though he admits that if i was talking to other guys like this he would be going off his nut at me. But he refuses to stop talking to her cause they have been friends for yrs. Am i the asshole for being pissed off about this?",

      "description": "I’m currently studying for a Masters. 2x /week we’re put into groups to put together a presentation based on a problem we are given. \n\nIn session 1 we all read the problem together, spitball ideas, talk about what we already know and how it could relate to the problem, and draw up a list of things we don’t know that we need to know to be able to answer the problem. \n\nAt the end of session 1 we split up the questions &amp; go away in our own time to do the research required to answer those questions. In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me “so are we using what you did then?” Taken aback I said “well no we’ll use a combination, what info have you found?” And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn’t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn’t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said “is there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?” and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said “Hey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?” at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn’t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn’t found anything because I’d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It’s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn’t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn’t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*",

Lisa is the sweetest girl imaginable, she planned everything through etc. \n\nAt the beginning of December another friend who is also invited and my best friend (let's call her Mary) starts behaving strangely. She doesn't show up to classes anymore, doesn't answer any messages and is being distant. Lisa and I are worried.\n\nMary has done this many times before, ignored us and didn't attend classes at all anymore until something important would come up (i.e. finals) and then she'd be back to normal and behave as if nothing had happened. We know that she is depressed, so we don't push her when it comes to things like this. \n\nBut she stayed silent for a month. I texted her regularily to keep her updated on classes. Around Christmas we all were worried because neither she nor her mother would read or answer our messages and we feared that something bad might have happened to her. \n\nLisa would check on Mary because they lived in the same neighbourhood. In the beginning everything seemed fine, Mary would tell her she was just exhausted. A few days before Christmad however, Mary would close the door on Lisa or not even answer it.\n\nI texted Mary how worried Lisa and everybody was, but she still wouldn't read my messages. Two days before New Year's I decided to call her out on her bullshit.\n\nI know that I could have been more compassionate, but I was really fed up because Lisa would call me daily and cry because she was just so scared for Mary. So I texted Mary that I'm really fed up that neither she nor her mother are answering, that I know she needs time for herself but complete isolation for a month would not help her, at least not in my opinion. And that she could have sent us one message saying that she wasn't feeling well and needed time for herself. I would have been contend with that and left her alone, but like this her behavior was shitty. I also told her she was hurting me with her behavior, because I was worried sick, imagined scenarios of her being in hospital because she hurt herself or even died doing so.\n\nMary didn't answer until the morning of New Year's. Told me that she was disappointed in me calling her behavior shitty and thought I would understand, she didn't feel comfortable texting me because she thought more of me, then proceeded to accuse me of being at fault for since I should have known she was fine. Said my behavior was wrong and she wasn't sure we could be friends anymore. I apoligized but she wouldn't accept it. Apparently it wasn't her fault she was hurting me but my own for caring.\n\nLater everybody was at Lisa's house except Mary. Lisa was crying again, asking me if I had heard from Mary. I told her yes, but I didn't think she would come. Five minutes later, Mary arrives and acts as if nothing had happened.",

I've lived here for many years and so have they and at one point in time, the flag was in good condition. But over the past few years, the flag has become tattered and torn. I was under the understanding that when a flag is so tattered that it no longer fits to serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. ... The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. So would I be the asshole for telling them to take it down or even replace it? What if I got them a new flag?",

      "description": "So I [22m] and my boyfriend [24m] have been living together for some time now. It used to be I would go to the gym on my own, prepare my own meals, and enjoy my time at the gym. However, after being in a relationship problems have arisen. \n\nMy boyfriend always wants to go to the gym with me. It’s so annoying. If I don’t go to the gym with him, he gets pissed off. I’m more into intense bodybuilding regime through PPL, he’s like cardio and doesn’t know what he’s doing. I’m not a trainer, I can’t be that to him. \n\nSecondly, on days where I don’t go to the gym, I remind him that my budget is tight (college) and I can’t be working out everyday like I used to because I’m not going to get enough calories or macronutrients anyway. I tell him this because his diet is just as bad and there’s no way he’s getting any benefit from working out if he’s not eating right. \n\nI finally got fed up with him and told him that if he wants to go to the gym he can go by himself.  He said that I should cook my own meals and buy my own food. I said whatever. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to train my boyfriend and go workout with him?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I are both able to stay in Canada under different permits. I'm a student and she's labeled as only a visitor (but she wants to study too).\nDue to some complications and lack of time, she has to go back to her country of origin and attempt to come back to Canada. \n\nAll of this could've been avoided if I had married her because that's what she was advised to do (as the fastest and easiest option). \nI believe that marriage is a big step in a relationship and not just a simple label. I didn't feel comfortable and didn't see marriage as just a perk. To me it's a big commitment and I don't want to do it for not only economic reasons but because I'm still too young (23 y/o) and marriage means much more than just a ceremony to me.\n\nEven after she explained that we could easily get divorced, or get a real wedding afterwards, I couldn't accept her request and now she'll have to go with the backup plan. This plan presents the possibility of her not being able to enter Canada again for a while. She's convinced she'll be able to come back but I fear I ruined her future in Canada because I didn't want to marry her.\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend's last hope of staying in Canada relied on wether I agreed to marry her for convenience or not. I chose not to due to economic and moral reasons but I still love her. AITA.\n",

Matched with a lady, we share a load of common interests and start talking. We arrange a date, but due to work I have to ask to reschedule. She proceeds to go off on me, telling me tha  tI don't care about her. At this point, part of my brain goes \"NO\" and I begin to overthink everything in the classic way. She apologises, I ask her to leave me alone and explain why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom then until today, every few days we exchange pleasant messages. Today, she bluntly asks why I've not asked her out again. I explain again that I'm not in the correct mental place for anything, and the thought of it makes me want to lock the doors and hide under a blanket. She keeps pressing, asking if I'm attracted to her. I explain that I am, but at this point I'm actually physically shaking. The exchange ends with her making dismissive comments, about how I'm using my mental health as an excuse to talk to other women. I make the snap decision to block her on every place I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

On the short list of things he did, just to set the scene;\nLocked me in a bathroom and a laundry room for respectively 2 and 4 1/2 hours because he thought I was spending too much time out of the apartment, broke a lightbulb on the wall behind me that was meant to hit my face, constantly forced me to watch him self harm and threaten to kill himself, actually attempt to hang himself in front of me, 'gifted' me an iPad and then made me pay $1000 for it and not letting me use it outside allotted hours, and forcing me to pay his half of rent and utilities for 5 months, and the list goes on.\n\nI was a terrified 20 year old girl. One day, he told me it was time to renew the lease on the apartment for 6 months. He asked me if I was planning on paying 6 months, and I told him yes, fully knowing if I said no he would guilt trip or threaten me. At that time, I was forming an escape plan.\nA week later, my brother and I moved all my things and my two pets out and I warned everyone in my life that he was either going to try and break in to find me or hurt himself.\nHe ended up sending many threatening texts and showing up to my work/my family's house telling them he was going to kill my pets and himself if I didn't give him money for rent.\n\nI knew he wasn't going to make it on his own. And he didn't. He lives with his family in another state, but he probably is still in a bad financial place.\nI still feel guilty about this. I try to rationalize my actions, and I really did not have the money, but I still don't feel good about it.\nAITA?",

      "description": "Ok so this happened only a couple of days ago and it’s really been bugging me. \n\nA couple days ago, I asked out this girl I liked. No big deal. She rejects me and I understand, I tell her “Hey, thank you for the reply, hope this doesn’t make anything awkward between us.” \n\nMe, being the teenager I am, is a bit sad at first but completely understand that she doesn’t have any attraction to me. I go about my day normally and try to forget about it.\n\nLater, I’m checking around a couple discord servers and find two people arguing. I butt in and tell them to stop when both of them. One of them replies with some things I said when I asked the girl out. The other then also joins in to say that I shouldn’t have asked her out when I “barely know her”. \n\nI’m at first taken aback and then I am promptly kicked from the discord server for “inciting arguments”. I pause for a bit until I see the girl I asked out is typing to me.\n\nShe responds with “Hey, you shouldn’t have asked them to stop, they were just working out their differences.” \n\nI ask her how they found out the situation and all the details and she replies with that she sent screenshots to her group chat.\n\nShe then apologizes and says that “that’s who they are, they just make insults when they are.”\n\nI’m trying to forget it but a little while after the situation has died down, the two who argued earlier along with friends decide to harass me in my Twitch Stream while I am live broadcasting. I promptly ban them and their friends while trying to stay neutral and unphased by it.\n\nShe texts me today and says that she is sorry that she sent the screenshots but that “it’s normal to and that I do it too.”\n\nI gave her the confession in private, not thinking she would send pictures of what I said to her friends.\n\nAm I the asshole for being upset at the harassment and the screenshots?",

      "description": "I’ve been friends with this girl for almost 10 years now, let’s call her D for convenience sake. Always a little troubled, in and out of homes, but eventually she was living with her dad, but he was a bit of trouble, so she moved in with her boyfriend (J) and his family, but this meant moving 1.5 hours away from the main friendship group, essentially making her the \"left out friend\" (although she made no real effort to come see us). Fast forward about 6 months,  J’s dad received a job offer which forced his parents to move a further 2 hour drive east, so D and J could not do that due to work commitments, so they moved to an inner city apartment. D had no idea how to move her belongings, even refused to hire a truck so she basically begged a bunch of people. I was one of her only friends with a car so I was roped into doing some of the moving, although I didn’t particularly want to. For me it was a 1 hour drive to J’s place, then it was a further 2 hours back to their new apartment, and this trip happened 3 times.  Each time she did pay me $50 though. \n\nOne year later, her lease is up and has to move again. During the year contact was sparse with me and D, both busy with various things, then she pulls the same stunt as last year, although after realising how hard moving was, she ordered a truck, but still needed me and another guy to help her move. This time it was only 1 trip, but I was very reluctant to help as I remembered the horrors of last time (for reference she has severe OCD with her things).  So reluctantly I went and helped her, wasting my Friday night that I could have spent out with my friends. This time was not as bad as the other time but it went smooth enough were it wasn’t terrible. 1 hour drive up then a 25 minute drive to her new place, not as bad. But after it’s all said and done, we have a little get together with a few mates the next night and we come to the part where I may be the asshole. So she was just talking about money and debt she owes to people to my friend, and then she mentions that she owes me $50 for the move, then says I should have done it for free as we were friends. This was in reference to the other guy that helped her move, she had known him for about a year and he didn’t accept any payment, just food. I was taken aback a little as I know had the situation been reversed, she would not have helped me and my girlfriend move. My other mate jokingly agreed with her and she took it serious, and has been off with me ever since, but I wanna know your opinion. Am I the asshole for accepting money off a friend who I helped move even though she always complains about money?\n\nTLDR; helped friend move houses several times, received payment, but friends been off with me since another friend didn't accept any payment. \n",

      "description": "The other day, my mom was watching our kids for a bit while I did errands and my husband was at work. When I got home, she told me that she’d taken the kids on a walk around the neighborhood and that one of my neighbors had a nice recliner sitting outside by the street (meaning it’s okay to take, at least where we live). She said we should take it because we need more seating in the living room. \n\nI told her okay, but I needed to inspect the chair first and ask the neighbors that it was actually okay to take it. I did that, the neighbors said they had gotten a new chair and didn’t have room for this one anymore. The chair is really nice, it matches our living room, and I made sure to sniff it, check it for bugs/stains, etc. Not a thing wrong with it, smelled like someone’s house smell but not a bad smell. \n\nSo my nephew came and helped us get it to the house, and I brought it inside. It’s super comfy and fits right in to the space. \n\nMy husband got really mad about this chair when he got home. He said we don’t know those people and don’t know why they were really getting rid of the chair. So I told him that I checked and there was literally nothing wrong with it. He then started saying that he should have been consulted before the chair came into our house. \n\nThat’s when I said, “I’m sorry I couldn’t ask you while you were at work, but I didn’t want someone else to take it in the mean time.” He didn’t care, he just went on about how it was disrespectful. I told him if he didn’t like the chair then we could get rid of it no problem. I figured that would be the end of it, but no. \n\nHe said the chair is fine and he doesn’t want to get rid of it. So basically he’s mad on principle I guess? I’m feeling like he’s making a huge deal out of nothing. \n\nBy the way we really don’t argue much and have a great marriage, so this is out of character for him and I’m wondering if he’s pissed about something else. Or maybe I’m an asshole for bringing the chair home without asking him? ",

      "description": "So I’ve been working from home for the last 5 years. Before that I have 13 years of experience sharing a room with people at work; never having my own office. I’m accustomed to people at neighboring desks having basic respect for distracting noise while playing music or watching videos. Now at home, my partner is a RE agent and often works from home as well, conducting phone calls loudly, watching the news etc. I’ve asked, consistently, for the use of headphones so I don’t have to listen to whatever is playing/being spoken of. Hearing training videos or talking news heads is much more distracting than music; but I’d still prefer to not be subjected to the noise pollution of someone else’s neighboring operation. The reaction I get is that I’m asking too much. That my previous body of experience in sharing professional spaces is irrelevant. \n\nA long time ago I worked in a call center where you sit in long rows of people without so much as a cube wall. Everyone is talking around you, you have to deal. But I’ve moved out of that kind of office operation a long time ago into jobs that require a greater level of focus, concentration, etc. \n\nWhether it’s business hours or not, I think that people sharing a home have a fundamental consideration of whether or not an audible media is being consumed together, or separately and are behooved to adapt accordingly.\n\ntl;dr I think it’s inconsiderate of others to subject me to audible content they’re listening, but I’m not AITA",

He didn’t realize he didn’t have service and missed all her calls and ended up missing the birth, which all in all took about 6 hours.\n\nI visited the next day and my sister was clearly really upset with her husband and he was apologizing over and over but she was telling him to just leave it alone and drop it, but in a really snappy way. It really cast a bad light on a day that was supposed to be happy. So I told my sister to just drop it. She became very upset and told me to shut my mouth and not comment on what I don’t understand.

      "description": "I want to start this off by explaining that I’ve never been too open with my friends. They don’t know the extent of the sorta shit I went through with my mom and other really personally issues. I never really talked about it because I wasn’t ready to— I bottled all my shit up for a long time. I know I should have been more trusting and open with my friends and I now regret that I wasn’t. \n\nMy mom recently died. It fucked me up. My friends heard about it and the two of them said the typical “oh shit” and “that sucks” sort of responses. After that, one stopped replying and the other one was actively trying to change the subject and no longer asks how I am or comes off as annoyed or super short when I mention something about what’s going on (I have two younger half siblings with no dad, so CPS is involved and they’ve been communicating w/ me a lot because eI’m their next of kin). I haven’t messed my first friend since he isn’t replying to me. I know he isn’t busy because he’s actively online playing Overwatch (he’s dropped 500 sr since I’m no longer invited to play and he doesn’t have a good healer. I found that a little satisfying to know) and my other friend will ask me what’s up, how I am, etc but then change the subject super fast if it isn’t in regards to things like video games or streams. \n\nThe lack of communication or concern is sort of really getting to me. I would have hoped my friends would have supported me through this, offered advice or at least lent a shoulder for me to lean on. They know that I have very few family members, only 2 who actually truly care. When they were through shit I was always there and trying to help them.\n\nAm I an asshole for being mad at them for this? Am I acting entitled? Is it this normal for friends to be so flippant when coming to stuff going on in their friends lives? I always thought friendship was about supporting one another, but am I crossing the line by expecting them to comfort me through this? I really have no clue. Not sure if I should just stop talking about how I feel at all about everything going on and just lie and say everything is okay, or what. ",

There are lots of little issues with the place, but I mostly put up with them because there is really no other place for me to live in the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue: Back in June 2018, the fridge that had been here when I moved in failed. I was gone for a few days before discovering this which meant I had a lot of hot, rotten food to clean out of the fridge and freezer. After I cleaned it, I called the landlord and asked him to either fix or replace the unit. He came by a few days later and did so, with a fridge that looked even older/busted up than the last. But I figured whatever, as long as it does the job. It sucked to be out of \\~$100 of food but I was just grateful to have the old, now stinky fridge out of my kitchen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil today, when the replacement fridge broke. Completely stopped cooling/freezing, and I tried trouble shooting it, making sure it was plugged in, the doors were shut etc. But nope, it was just broken. I feel like he just keeps replacing faulty appliances with faulty appliances (repairs/appliances are his responsibility as per the lease). Now I have lost about $200 worth of brand new groceries, and have rent coming up next week. I cannot afford to replace any of these groceries and pay rent. Would it be unheard of/completely make me an asshole to ask to help for food lost because of his bad appliances/have it come out of this month's rent? I did not even consider it the first time, but now I feel like I should ask because this seems to be a pattern and I'm worried that I'm just going to have more ruined groceries in 6 months-year. TIA!",

      "description": "The night before I went out with my friends until 2:00. I guess while out I must have caught something, because today I have a horrible stomach flu. Vomiting, Diarrhea, chest tightness, you name it. The problem is that because I literally have a horrible work ethic, I pushed most of my school work until today. I have two big tests coming up (a math test on Wednesday and a chem test on Thursday) as well as an English paper due on Wednesday. I asked my parents If could skip school tomorrow in order to get ahead, and they said that I had all of break to complete my work and that I if I truly did have so much homework, then why did I go out with my friends the night before. They also made the point that if I missed school tomorrow I would only fall more behind in school not less. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Procrastinated all my work till the last possible day, got the flu from hanging out late with my friends, now I want to skip school in order to catch up. \n",

      "description": "Sorry, this is long.\n\nOriginally lived w two girls, A &amp; B (all college f). B had to move out early because she needed surgery &amp; couldn’t afford it and rent. Not ideal, but A thought we could move her boyfriend C in (not ideal, and I kept suggesting other things, but she viewed it more as “my boyfriend and I are taking the next step, it’ll work out!”  \n\nJust before B moved out, C’s friend E was kicked out of his dad’s because he gets fired from every job he has since dropping out of high school about 3 or 4 years ago. C, even though he has his OWN apartment at the time, kept allowing E to sleep at our house. After about 3 days, I said I was uncomfortable to A (considering it was OUR place, not C’s) because:\n\nE always talks about fighting/hurting/killing people (including saying he wants to join the army solely to kill people)\n\nhe, a little over year ago (before we all moved in together) told a boyfriend of B’s that he “wanted to break into her apt and steal her underwear because it would be sexy” —and we don’t have locks on our doors here\n\nstole money and weed from C and weed from my boyfriend and me (yes, C knows about this) as well as has gone through C’s stuff in an obvious way while C let E stay with C\n\nHonestly the guy just makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable. The list goes on but I don’t have the available characters.\n\nSeveral months ago, A said “E is moving out of state, you’ll never see him again!” He moved back obviously or I wouldn’t be writing this post. Apparently, he has a great new roommate who doesn’t allow smoking weed in the house or noise after ten. good for him. However, that leads to him coming over several nights a week now. He stays the night which makes me uncomfortable. A has gone out of town for spring break, and E has not left our house since. It’s been four days now.  I don’t know how to approach this with C—especially because E would be here while I said “hey, we have talked about this.”\n\nI get that C pays rent here. However, he refused to sign the lease, which our landlords said needed to be done if he was to move in. I asked him for literally 3 months to do it and gave up.  I get he pays rent but he’s not even on our lease if something goes wrong, and before moving in knew about my discomfort.\n\nBasically, WIBTA if I told C that E needs to go? Debating if C needs to too. Thanks everyone.\n",

      "title": "AITA for breaking up with my bf, and then wanting to come back to the guild we shared a year later?",
      "description": "WARNING - this is a long one!\n\nOver a year ago now, I bonded with a guy in Guild Wars 2 that lived one state over from me in Australia. We got really, really close and in a drunken stupor I basically professed my love to him. We ended up dating, and it was great. We played together all the time, made plans to see each other IRL. It was only an hour's flight and not far enough that we couldn't handle it. We had some hiccups in the relationship, which is that I'm not a really expressive or overly affectionate person. This is a recurring theme, even though I tried hard to work on it because I wanted to be with him, and he had anxiety which made coping with it difficult if he didn't feel like I was investing enough. It's especially harder online because you can't be there physically with someone, so the feeling of emotional distance is amplified.\n\nGW2 was the one thing we shared, and I sort of drifted away from it. There was a series of small events and eventually I needed a break from the game, which is not uncommon for me. I've been playing on and off since release with a few year long breaks after burning out. I'm a very sarcastic and 'shit-talking' type of person. Everyone in the guild took what I said with a grain of salt. We insulted each other playfully and talked shit all the time. I found out later that a girl (she will be important later) in the guild felt like I'd been bullying her. We weren't close and even though I was treating her the same I did everyone else, she didn't reciprocate the same feeling of banter and took it to heart. I felt absolutely awful and tore myself up about it for a long time.\n\nI reached out to her and eventually we mended things, and I thought everything was okay. My bf and this girl ended up getting really close. She had bad depression and they bonded. I'm not the jealous type of girlfriend so I was perfectly okay with them ending up being best friends. Well, it turned out that she was basically in love with him. She flirted with him all the time, and they spent more and more time together. Even though I tried to get him to shut down the flirting, he didn't want to be mean to her or shut her down. It started to make me feel insecure, like I was competing for his time and not able to live up to this other girl.\n\nYou'll recall that I mentioned we were having problems in our relationship. He felt like I wasn't spending enough time with him, that I spent too much time with other people, but he didn't want to play any other game except GW2 even though I was super burnt out. Because video games are how we bonded and it was how we spent time with one another, I tried really hard to get him to try something else so we could play together. He didn't want to, and got upset when I was in calls and games with other people.\n\nWe ended up having a long talk where we discussed where our relationship was going. We mutually agreed that we might not last, but would give it a few more weeks to work things out. The thing that ultimately broke us was when I found out that he had been running a whole bunch of new content with her, even though I had been asking him to play with me so we could spend time together. He was basically brushing me off for her after complaining we didn't spend time together. On top of that, he said she had said things to him like 'you're just being with her because it's easy' and apparently purposefully trying to drive a wedge between us, and she kept flirting, but to my knowledge he never told her off for her behaviour and I didn't want to be 'that' girl who goes off at a boyfriend's female friend. He also made it clear that he wasn't going to stop being friends with her and didn't want me talking to her about it. It felt like he wasn't trying anymore, that he was being a hypocrite, and he just wanted her more, so I broke up with him.\n\nI left the guild because it was too hurtful being in the same one as my ex boyfriend and the girl who ultimately destroyed out relationship. I'd been in that guild for years and played with the people in it for a long, long time. I loved it there, and it was an emotional haven for me on some occasions. I felt resentful that I was the one who ended up leaving, even though I felt as though I'd done nothing wrong, and I still do. But I needed time to heal, and they weren't going anywhere any time soon, so I left. After I did, I sent the girl a rather... nasty message that went along the lines of 'are you happy now? you got what you wanted' and called her, I think, a 'homewrecking sl\\*t'. I was angry and hurt and lashing out, and I don't condone what I said, but there it is. No one said anything to me about it so I thought it might not have even been received (it had been).\n\nMy ex and I remained on OK terms. I owed him some money and was in the process of paying it back, our conversations were casual and pleasant. Once I did, he eventually removed me from social media and whatnot. I was a little surprised but got over it.\n\nIt's been over a year now, and I wanted to start playing GW2 again. I miss the people I played with and I'm ready to put water under the bridge, talk things out, maybe not be friends but at least be able to hang around each other. I reached out to my old guild leader a week and a half ago, who runs a Twitch stream and a public server. He said he was happy to welcome me back, but only on the terms that myself, ex and his now-gf (yes they ended up happily dating), are on okay terms since he didn't want things to be 'awkward'. I was really annoyed about this decision because I didn't (and still don't) think it's fair for me, and just me, to be excluded. I said that awful shit when I left, but I wasn't the only one who played a hand in how horribly everything turned out. I don't think it's fair that me joining back rests on my ex and his girlfriend.\n\nBut I reached out anyway. I've spoken to him and he basically told me 'why would we want you back?' and asked me if I remembered the message I sent his gf after I left. I said I did, but I was really hurt, and that I know it was childish. But I wanted to talk about it and hoped that we could at least settle things and talk about it like adults. I refrained from pointing out that he and his gf also helped to sabotage things and that I'm not the only one to blame for what happened because I don't want to cause a fight and ruin things again.\n\nHe told me it basically rests on his gf because I hurt her the most and whatever makes her happy makes him happy. I've sent her a msg but no reply. It's tearing me apart waiting. I feel awful thinking that they probably see me as this heartless monster but it makes me upset/angry, too, because that's not what I am. I refuse to believe that I'm the sole villain here and I feel like this situation is unfair. I'm willing to give them a chance and I would like the same in return.\n\nRegardless of whether or not I guess back in the guild, I am still going to be in the twitch server, where both of them also talk, so I don't see why it matters. We are going to be around each other anyway, and I would rather have us talk about the elephant in the room than avoid each other til the end of time.\n\nAm I crazy? Am I the asshole, an an asshole? Is it reasonable for me to want to come back after over a year to talk things out? Do you think they're being fair?",

      "description": "Please excuse any major texting errors, I'm on mobile.\n\nA few days ago, I was returning from walking my dog. I usually do a final loop around the front of my house before I head home, so in the loop I saw a car park on the side. I didn't think anything of it and continued down the shared driveway that heads to my house when I hear someone speaking. I have one headphone in so I pluck it out and turn around when I see an older woman.\n\nTo give some background, I live in Northern California and although the area where I live is known for its beautiful locations, robberies and break in have gotten much worse within the last couple years and we've had a couple of major items stolen from our vehicle and windows shattered. My trust level in giving information out is pretty low and I'm not feeling the safest as it is. \n\nSo, the woman comes super close to me and says \"hello, how are you??\" I back away a little because my dog can be too friendly at times and tries to give hugs and say \"hello, good thank you and yourself?\" She then asks if I live around there. The way I am standng, I am inbetween two houses so either one could be my home or I could have simply be using the gate at the end to leave. I say \"yes I live around here\" and leave it at that. But she insists, \"what house do you live in\"? \n\nAt this point, I'm kinda nervous because I'm not very confrontational so I tell her \"oh, sorry I'm just not used to telling strangers where I live\" and laughed to try to make a joke out of it. She goes off and says \"This is my fault, I forgot I was in so and so county, I'm from New York where you can say Hi to people!! I'm just a neighbor trying to say hi!! I'm an educated person!!\"\n\nAfter she said the educated person part, I had it. This lady was yelling at me in the middle of the day outside because I didn't want to tell her specifically what house I live in? I said \"oh, so are you insinuating I'm not an educated person because I won't tell you where I live? Thank you and have a good day\" and I walked through the gate so it seemed like I lived in neither house. She kept yelling after me but I didn't really catch what she said. \n\n\nIf she had said, \"oh, I'm a neighbor, just want to say hi.\" I would have apologized and moved on. But she simply asked me where I lived. However, I feel guilty now. Am I the asshole??",

I (F34) was on a dating website and connected with an awesome guy (M33). We ended up going on a date and it was going pretty well. He was a great conversationalist, and we were able to connect on many topics quite well. Towards the end of the date, I mentioned “Hey do you usually wear straight cut jeans? I think skinny jeans would look better on you.” He replied, “You think so?”. I responded, “yeah!” I didn’t think much of it and it ended pretty well, with a goodnight kiss :)\n\nAfter the date he texted me goodnight and complimented me. After that he went ghost and I never reached out. After a few months he texted me and I asked him after going ghost why did he reach out? He answered, “You started looking for flaws in me right after the very first date. Thought that happens after a few months.” Since then we’ve been talking regularly, but a few of my friends have been saying I’m sort of an asshole for this situation. I didn’t think much of it and now I’m not too sure. Reddit, what do you think?",

      "description": "Me (25M) and girlfriend (28F) have been dating over a year. I’m starting medical school this Fall, and she’s starting Vet school in a different state. We’ll be doing long-distance for 5 years. GF got a late start on her vet school career, but I’m happy to support her because I believe she needs this to feel happy and fulfilled. \n\nFrom day one I have made it clear I want a family and that I want to be a father. I’m happy to wait five more years, but as soon as we’re back together I want to start having a family. She’ll be 33 by the time we start trying. \n\nWhen talking about being honest during long distance, I told her that if she ever changed her mind about wanting kids that she needed to tell me, because that’s a dealbreaker for me. She believes that spouse should always be priority number one. I think that’s true, but one person wanting children and the other one not is reasonable grounds for a breakup. \n\nI want her to be happy, and definitely don’t want to pressure her into having kids if she doesn’t want to! But I feel it’s fair for me to want to find a partner who shares those life goals with me. I really hope that’s her, and I don’t feel it’s unreasonable to ask that if she changes her mind whole preparing to start her career she needs to tell me. AITA?",

      "description": "After school today as I was waiting for the bus to show up to bring me home, a kid with a disability (not sure what, i just know from seeing him in the hallways that he never speaks and he paces a lot) walked up to me and showed me his phone, with the \"add contact\" menu open. I've never spoken to him before so i had no clue why he wanted my number. I pretended to look around my messaging/calling/contacts apps to find my number, and told him \"Sorry man, i don't know where to find my number. I got a new phone.\" (The part about me having a new phone is true). He sort of accepted it and walked off. A minute later, he came up to me asking again for my number. I searched around my phone more, and then realized that I actually don't know where to find it, and although i have my number memorized i still didn't really feel comfortable giving this random kid my number. I simply just told him \"Yeah sorry man, I don't know where to find it\". Then his bus showed up and he walked off to get on.\n\nI keep feeling like shit over it because I don't know whether or not that was an okay thing to do. Maybe he was just trying to make new friends or something, idk. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "(English isn't my first language sorry, I don't know if I should say nephew or son of my BIL) \n\n So yesterday, my husband and I were invited to my BIL's house as they were hosting a party. We arrived there and everything seemed great right until I went to the bathroom. My nephew's bedroom was right next to the bathroom and I saw him holding his tortoise upside down, put it on the floor, and pressed his finger on its \"lower side\" and began spinning it. \n\n I've owned a pet tortoise 5 years ago which lived for 2 years until he died unexpectedly. I went over to my nephew and told him it's probably uncomfortable in that position and to stop spinning it and he did. I went to the bathroom and when I was done he stopped spinning it - but now he put it on a pillow and hit the pillow as hard as he can to catapult the tortoise. Thankfully it landed on the bed and not the floor but I was already horrified. I talked to my BIL and slid what happened into a conversation and he told me that it's just a pet and it'll be fine.\n\n So I put a plan in motion and when my nephew came into the living room I excused myself, went to his bedroom, took the tortoise and put in my purse. For context, the tortoise is literally a baby, it's barely bigger than a water bottle cap (exaggeration but you get the idea). My husband doesn't know and I'm debating whether to release it into the wild (if it even can survive after being a pet) or continue to give it a home here without my husband knowing. \n\n AITA for taking it? My BIL and his wife think one of the kids there took it. \n\n ",

      "description": "To start off, I think some background would be helpful. I will say, I don't think I handled this whole situation well, but, well, it's a little late now. My husband Jacob and I have known each other for 5 years, and married for a few months. We live a state away from both of our families, but I've taken a weekend every 2 months to visit my family, while my husband chooses to ignore texts and calls from his family, and only initiates any communication between them if I'm in a group chat with him. This is important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess this whole story starts almost 2 years ago. Jacob and I spent a few weeks in the summer visiting his mom and stepdad and while we were there, it came up that his sister would be visiting from a couple hours away. This worried us both because he had recently told me that when he was in high school and his sister was in college, she would sneak in bed with him and sleep in only a tank top and underwear, and then would leave before their parents would wake up. From what he told me, this continued on every time he visited her, or she visited him, unless her roommates were around. The visit didn't go well, he was meant to drop me off at a mall for some shopping because his sister had asked that she get time with only him, but I had been sick for a few days and still had fever and ended up fainting, so he called a friend and asked him to meet me at the mall, and then left once that was sorted to meet with his sister. Jacob was very late and his sister had driven through bad traffic and was understandably annoyed, and tensions rose until she finally left, only half an hour after meeting him. From what I understand, she left crying and called their dad, who then called my then fiance and chewed him out for making his sister upset. He was on his way to pick me up when the call happened, and as soon as he arrived he told me he was leaving to drive to where his sister lived to apologize for upsetting her in person and then stay the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this part is my fault. I was sick and upset that Jacob wanted to stay the night with his sister after what he had just told me, about the sleeping in the same bed, and yelled at him that at some point he had to stop sleeping with his sister. He ended up staying with me that night, and since then his relationship with his sister started to go downhill. She would send snapchats of herself in her bra and underwear and then if he didn't reply back, she would ask why he didn't talk to her anymore. Or, she would post said pictures on instagram or snapchat and then message him again, and this is taken directly from a screenshot of a message, she asked him why he didn't care about what she looked like. I would say that what really upset my husband, was when we were both at a family barbecue at a swimming lake and she pulled me aside to tell me to put some clothes on because my bikini was inappropriate to wear around Jacob, and that I should be more conscientious of what I wear because it reflects badly on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next time Jacob contacted her was a few months later, they hadn't talked in months and I thought they should make up and move on, and so pressured him to call her because we were planning on getting married the next year. He called her during her lunch break at work and that ended in her saying to stop contacting her, that he wasn't her brother, that she didn't want to be associated with him until he became a better person, and that she never liked me and that he should make better choices in his life. At this point he completely cut contact with her and blocked her on all platforms. Because of all of this, and his family siding with his sister and bringing up that he was the one that had been creating a problem since he now refused to go to family events if she was there or even call his family because each time he did, they would tell him to call his sister and apologize and move on. We saw her once more at a family birthday party, but at that event she approached him and tried to hug him so he asked her to leave him alone, pushed her away when she didn't move away, and went to talk to the rest of the people in attendance. She then swore at us both, cried, and then as I was walking back to be by my husband after getting a drink, she shoulder checked me, spilling my drink, and almost causing me to fall. I guess the funny part here is that I have 4 inches and at least 30 pounds on her, and was still knocked off balance, which is why Jacob's mother asked me if I'd made the whole thing up. To be honest, I'm not even sure my husband would have believed me if he hadn't seen it with his own eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway now here we are, almost 2 years later, and we've since eloped, due to the family tensions we ended up canceling the wedding, and only his mom and my mom were in attendance as witnesses. Jacob's father got tired of not getting a response, and somehow managed to get my number over the Christmas holidays and began to message me. His sister got an award and the whole family went and he wanted to ask me if I could get my husband to go to the event. I told him I wouldn't be involving myself in this situation, and then on the day of the event, received another message asking if my husband could message his sister a congratulations, and that he had already written it for him and all my husband had to do was copy and paste. Again, he said no, and since then he's spent almost a month writing a message to his sister asking her to take down photos of him on her social media, and letting her know that after all the nasty things that have been said between the both of them, her inappropriate behavior over the summer, and the most recent fiasco at the birthday party, he was officially done with her, and he asked her to stay away from the both of us at family events from now on. She sent the message to both of their parents, and we ended up starting a whole other thing that we hadn't expected, all my husband had wanted was to be able to go to family events without worrying about what his sister would do. The drama finally died down yesterday, and ended with Jacob's father saying I was full of shit and out to hurt his family, and that he didn't need anything from me so I should knock it off. Jacob's mom told us both that we had to forgive and forget because this had gone on long enough and was hurting her and that she understood his sister had done bad things but that she hadn't initiated any contact with us since the birthday party in 4 months and that now we were the only ones causing problems. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my only question is, in all of these situations I feel like I've been the common denominator, and I know for a fact that had I not informed my husband that the things his sister did were inappropriate and showed him resources from r/JUSTNOFAMILY and r/NarcissisticAbuse, everyone would still be a happy family. I thought I was helping my husband by encouraging him to talk to his family about what his sister had said and done, and by making him go to his family's events, and then finally telling him that it was okay to want to officially end the relationship with his sister and reading over the message before he sent it, but all that's happened is he feels like he's lost his family and I feel like I'm the asshole. I do think he's been happier in these two years of low contact with his sister than in the 3 years I knew him when he talked to her everyday, but I can't help but feel like this is all my fault and I should've just let things go on like they were before. So. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: What was a small tiff with husband's sister has now lasted almost 2 years, and has led to my husband feeling like he has no family left, and me being cut off from his family. Who's the asshole here?",

      "description": "Sorry if this is a little sparse on details, don’t know who involved with this regularly browses reddit\n\nA little over a year ago, I met this dude (let’s call him Dave) through a club at school. We talked a bit and I always thought he was a little strange, but not malicious (though he would get annoyed and proudly declare that he knew he was an asshole). Fast forward a couple months and I become friends with this girl (I’ll call her Kate) who happens to be friends with Dave.\n\nDave sexually harasses Kate, she’s obviously disgusted and I am too, so we both sort of do our own thing, still talking to him more out of necessity than want. The months go by, Kate and I get closer and bond over mutual interests, while Dave is obviously jealous that we became so close so quickly. With many smaller comments and literal tantrums leading up to it, it eventually gets to the point where he says to me (only me, not the two of us) that I need to stop bringing up my mutual interests with Kate because he doesn’t enjoy them too. I tell her and she’s obviously like “Fuck him we’ll do what we want” and that was the end of that. We talked to him occasionally, but only when we had no choice. Once he graduated I responded to his texts, but as they got progressively more strange (talking about like “How much I loved him” and stuff) I just stopped. (If I had to guess, he went to texting me because all his existing friends ghosted him earlier, but maybe I’m wrong.) AITA? Or is there a point where enough’s enough? I don’t want to associate with someone who’d treat a close friend of mine so poorly, but I also don’t want to cause a conflict that will definitely affect more than just myself\n\nTLDR: “Friend” Dave sexually harasses my friend Kate. Months go by, Kate and I become closer friends, Dave gets pissed off and clearly shows that he doesn’t like us being friends. I get fed up with everything and ghost the dude to avoid a conflict that would affect more than just me",

      "description": "I have a colleague who picks on me on and off over the past year whenever I am alone with her. I tried my best to avoid her it's not always possible. She would claim that I am doing something wrong and threatened to report me. Whenever I checked with my supervisor if I was doing anything wrong, they said that I wasn't and not to worry. Apparently, she never follows up on her threats to report me and seem to only be on a power trip. \n\nI tried politely disagreeing, ignoring her, calling her out, speaking to lthe union and speaking to management, but they were dismissive and said not to worry. I think the reason that nobody believes me is because she's exceptionally friendly to everyone, especially me, when in public, but it's all fake because she's constantly talking behind people's backs as well. She also bootlicks managers frequently to get in their good books. \n\nThe last thing that I am to do is to report her to the agency we work for, who will likely sack her immediately. They are aware of it but I opted to wait and see if she does it again, as it is frowned upon to bypass management and go straight to the agency. I would have to go through the entire grievance process again if it reoccurs. \n\nI have been assigned to sit with her despite making it clear to management that I feel uncomfortable. If she picks on me again, WIBTA if I tell her \"Stop being a bully and apologise to me right now or else I'll report you to the agency. I hope that you get sacked.\" and write everything she said down in front of her? The last line sounds asshole-ish, but I'm aiming to intimidate her into stopping, but would that make me no different from her because that's exactly what she said to me? I'm afraid that she will twist my words and make it seems like I'm bullying her instead. ",

      "description": "My now ex girlfriend has severe depression and recently diagnosed PTSD from her childhood. She has no family she speaks with other than her grandmother that’s dying of cancer. She really only has three friends that she speaks with on a semi regular basis after her best friend started spreading lies when her fiancé groped my girlfriend when she stayed at their place one night.\n\nWe’ve been together for almost a year and a half but moved in together after 9 months. The last four months after the incident with her best friend’s fiancé have been the definition of hell for both of us.\n\nHer mental issues have kicked into overdrive and it’s been constant fighting and arguing almost everyday. I will admit that I do not have any experience interacting with those with mental issues or depression but God knows I tried my best. I asked people what to do, begged her to go to therapy, and even offered to go once so I can ask questions to help me help her.\n\nDespite my efforts, I just can’t give her the help she needs, what she needs changes constantly and she ends up screaming at me how badly I suck at it. I just suck it up and go to bed alone. We have had several discussions about my lack of knowledge on the subject and she has stated that she knows I’m doing my best.\n\nLast week after another fight, she texted me that she was breaking up with me for those reasons, after telling me that since I have a family that cares for me, anything I’ve earned in life was handed to me. I didn’t go back at her but simply told her that I did my best (which she agreed) but unfortunately I just couldn’t help how I wanted.\n\nAfter assuming that I’d move back to my parents, I had a buddy come over and help me move a few things. It was at this point she came home and scolded me for moving out in front of my friend. I agreed the stay in the apartment but I told her if I can’t handle living with my now ex girlfriend that I would move out and she said that’s understandable.\n\nWe had another fight today because she still expects me to hear her issues and I upset her again. After defending myself for the second time ever in our relationship I told her I can’t do this anymore and I’d be moving out. She then proceeded to get nasty with me and questioned whether I’d pay my half of the rent, even giving me a veiled threat that verbal agreements stand in our area. I found this especially hypocritically since she owes me more than $3000 I’ve lent her under the impression she’d pay me back.\n\nI’m still struggling with this as I can’t wrap my head around whether I’m more in the wrong. I know I wasn’t perfect but I never lied to her, I always tried my best to help, I did anything she ever asked of me.",

      "description": "One of my best friends, Joe, has a birthday coming up. He has been dating Natalie for about a year and recently I went on vacation with the two of them to Montreal for spring break, along with our other friend and my partner. Natalie was completely obnoxious for the whole weekend. She seemed to view the entire experience as an opportunity to beef up her Instagram. She was taking pictures of random crap the entire time. At one point, she took away my drink at a coffee shop for three minutes as she tried to take the perfect picture of everyone’s coffee together on the table. Additionally, she was just kind of a party-pooper the whole time. She held Joe back from going places with the rest of us. She made Joe leave places early. She acted in a super immature way with the way she interacted with me and my partner (nothing I can put my finger on, she just was acting like a 14-year-old trapped in a college student’s body.) And on top of all that, she made some mildly homophobic comments that my partner and I did not appreciate at all. I never really liked her before, but suffice it to say, I was completely disillusioned with her by the end of the trip. \nA few days later, I received a Facebook message from Natalie. She created a group chat of six or seven people saying “Joe mentioned a while back that he wanted (thing) for his birthday. I was wondering if you guys would be willing to split the cost. It should come out to $15/person depending on the shipping cost.” Someone else in the group chat, my friend Mike, immediately replied “lol no” and Natalie removes him from the group. I am very tight on money lately because of the fact that I took a trip to Montreal for spring break so I’ve been trying to be more frugal. Natalie is from a very wealthy family. She has never had a job in college, and she travels abroad seemingly every other month. I usually buy Joe something small myself for his birthday, and the gift that Natalie wanted to get him is not something that would come from me, as it’s not related to an interest that Joe and I share. So in light of all that, I replied in the group chat “i’m sorry but I’m pretty tight on money! i can’t!” Natalie said “damn ok” and removed me from the group. Then I messaged Mike to ask him why he said no, and he said he was annoyed that Natalie kept Joe from his birthday party about a month prior to this. Mike and Joe are longtime best buds. \nFinally, just a few minutes ago, Joe and I went to eat dinner in our dining hall, and Natalie arrived along with her roommate and our other friend who came to Montreal. Natalie completely refused to acknowledge my existence for the entire 15 or so minutes we were sitting directly across from each other. As I was leaving, I said “bye everybody!” and she didn’t look up from her phone. It seems that she is pissed at me for not wanting to contribute to the gift. AITA?",

      "description": "I want to preface by saying I am pretty sure I am the asshole here, but my boyfriend says I'm not. So I'm torn and I was interested what you guys would have to say.\n\nOkay so this Tuesday was my (21F) and my boyfriend's (22M) 2 year anniversary. It's the first one we have been able to spend together, as our first anniversary occured when we were in a LDR.\n\n On the day itself we didn't properly celebrate as he had classes 9-6pm, but he skipped his sports practice in the evening to spend some more time with me, which I was really happy with.\n\nWe had agreed several weeks previously to celebrate on Wednesday, because then he had a full free day to spend with me. But then the evening before he told me he had plans (study plans, so I wasn't really annoyed, just a little saddened) and we could meet up after 4.30pm. \n\nWe live together, so on the Wednesday I decided to wake him up by making him his favourite breakfast (pancakes) and I gave him a card and a small gift- a book he'd been talking about getting for ages. (I don't have a lot of money, my boyfriend is much more well off than me) I also got him roses. \n\nHe was really grateful, but he hadn't got me anything, or done anything special. He said it didn't occur to him to do anything. However, he said seeing as I had put in effort, that he would pay for dinner for both of us, and an activity (VR gaming centre in our town)- both of which we had originally planned upon a few weeks ago. I was really happy, because he knows I don't have a lot of money, so it really helps. I expressed how grateful I was.\n\nHowever, I kind of wanted a card, with a nice message. Obviously I didn't expect a gift after he told me he was willing to pay for the evening, because that was so generous of him. But I kind of wanted something to commemorate the anniversary with that I could keep later to look back on fondly. Sometimes he treats me anyway on non special occasions because he is so well off. (I'm very lucky)  So, I thought a card would make it more \"anniversary\" like.  I also just like the whole romantic messages in it too, haha.\n\nAt the time, because I didn't feel that a card was asking a lot financially or effort/timewise, I asked him if when he came back at 4.30pm he could try and bring me a happy anniversary card. He seemed fine with it, and he brought back a really nice card. I was delighted.\nJ\nBut it's been nagging on my mind today- this guy is normally so thoughtful and generous with his time, and he helps me out financially a lot. Was it selfish to demand extra on top of everything and ask him for a card? Does it come across as me being ungrateful and wanting more and more? What do you think?\n\n",

      "description": "When I was a little boy I met my cousin for the first time. The first few things I noticed about him, is that he had a huge and brittle ego,  he is a pathological liar, and he never reflects on his own actions. He also has the tendency see me a black sheep, and he keeps seeing himself as my savior ( or herder) which is absolute BS and very narcissistic view on reality. Now you might thinking \"yeah he was still a kid people grow up.\" Yeah it got worse through the years...\n \nNow I usually avoid hanging with my cousin, but like once or twice a year I meet up with him to see if everyone is still breathing in my fubar family. I live in a small apartment complex, with two other couple. we have two front door, one to the complex, and the other to our own front door. I trust my neighbor s a lot, I've played online games for three years with these guys and we still play till date, and if anything happens to my pc, that also means they lose a player, which would mean they would have to play with random players which has given them a couple of mini breakdowns through the years. So thereby saying I also have my deterrence. So we get along just fine, that's also correlated to the reason why we often don't close our own front door in the morning and afternoon when we are at home, we also usually knock and wait, and if they ain't home, then fuck it. One day my cousin shows up at my front door of my apartment complex (he stated that someone opened the door for him, but no one except us was home at that moment.)  i'm at home with my gf and we just took a shower and we're suiting up for work, so we're almost butt naked. when all of a sudden I hear a faint knocking on my front door, I look up and tell my girlfriend if she heard something? All of a sudden my cousin walk in unannounced and just waves hi to me and my gf. I'm in shock at this point, and feel kind of messed up, because this is something I don't deal well with, my mother didn't know what the word privacy was, and had a very large tendency to just barge in unannounced without saying a word. So I felt a bit triggered and started yelling at him that I didn't appreciate him just barging into my house. I did not use any profanity. His reaction was to twist the situation around and scold me for scolding him on this matter. Eventually I was appalled and I took his rambling with disdain , my cousin had the audacity to tell me to 'don't blow a fuse' when he barges into my house, like Kramer from Seinfeld, and then scold me for not inviting him in, while i'm in my underwear, and my gf is hiding in the bedroom. After I told him to leave, he still won't talk to me till this date, (not that I actually care, but I guess it's a thing now) but now my  family thinks i'm an asshole because I wasn't hospitable enough for him. AITA for not wanting my cousin randomly in my house? \n",

      "description": "Disclaimer: I'm on mobile so please forgive me for any bad formatting, etc. Also this is gonna sound very much like the Ross/Rachel situation but I promise you it's real. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.",

      "description": "I am a student studying in the final year of highschool with a huge and important test coming up year end. Apparently I have noticed a classmate of mine that always seem to be down in drains. So one day I decided to help him out as we weren't particularly strangers, I walked up to him and I asked him what was wrong and listened to him patiently. Turns out he was an extremely sensitive person that really cares about people's judgement and gets sad everytime he feels that he isn't doing good enough. He felt much better after talking about his problems.\n\nBut here's where the problem start, a few days later he asked my desk mate to move away so he could seat right next to me, knowing he was very sensitive, my desk mate obliged. The first few weeks were fine, we had a few deep conversations and cracked a few jokes along them. But then it started to get out-of-hand from there, he won't let me talk to other people and feel real sad when I left him. Everytime I talk with a few friends, he drags me back so I could talk with him. He follows me everywhere and overwhelm me with his negativity and pessimistic views about life. I mean I get that he is sad but he is almost basing his entire personality on the fact that he is sad. \n\nBut the real frustrating problem is he keeps bugging me during class. As I said I have a huge test coming up, but this dude keeps cracking unfunny jokes in between that really is a distraction. I told him to stop but he just gets all sad and negative about it. So after an entire month of that, I decided to ignore him for a bit. I moved seat because I have decided that my own wellbeing is the priority but everytime I catch sight of him in the backseat, looking so damn sad and alone, I can't help but feel guilty about it. AITA?",

      "description": "So I'm part of a fandom server on Discord where a few of us write fan fiction and we often get feedback from each other and even be the other's beta editor or collaborator. Along comes this first-time fic writer with some pretty awful grammar and spelling, whose comments read like a kindergarten kid just learning to make long sentences. Except her content isn't kindergarten-grade, because she writes mostly *explicit* romance fic.\n\nHer works are essentially erotic vignettes straight out of your typical porno flick except with the characters' names tacked on and basically makes for a painful read because they just don't match up to who the characters are actually like in the source material. It even reads like a self insert in the guise of a gender swapped character at times - and considering the characters this genderswapped version is normally paired with are characters she's expressed personal interest in before it's not hard to make the connection.\n\nShe's asked three of my fellow writer friends to help her edit her work since, which has greatly improved the grammar and spelling of her content to be actually readable, but a lot of her \"characterisation\" (or lack thereof) remains in the final work and her fic summaries which she writes herself are her usual typo-riddled style. I tried reading a few chapters of her work just to see how much my friends were able to turn things around, which is truthfully not much.\n\nShe still doesn't know I blocked her and occasionally addresses me in convos even though I never reply. One time she was talking about her newest chapter which she posted earlier when I happened to be online and her beta for that chapter (also a dear friend of mine and a longtime writing partner) remarked good work. The following exchange was paraphrased:\n\nAuthor: You're the only one who's seen it though, the others haven't, how is it good work?\n\nBeta: It's good work because even if they haven't seen it it's posted and finished, something finished and posted no matter the quality is already good work\n\nMe: It's effort for sure, regardless of the result one already put effort into it that counts for something... I guess\n\nNobody remarked on my comment, but the beta DMed me asking me if it was a call-out for someone. I told them it was nothing at the time, but now I wonder whether I was too snobbish and dismissive of someone who regardless of their skill still put time into doing something they love. On top of that I never confronted her with my gripes about her writing and just pretended nothing was different while basically ignoring her. As a writer myself I know how precious support from peers is, even if as a reader I'm very selective. So am I being elitist or just have preferences?",

They said they think it's 10am. I said I'd really like to know the arrival time so I can plan my morning and so I don't wait around the airport. No text. Had phone conversation yesterday in which I reiterated for them to tell me when the flight gets in, it was in the morning and surf looked good plus I may want to sleep it. No text. Last night I text that \"I really don't want to ask again\" as I was getting frustrated and by this time it's 6pm the night before they arrive. No text. I finally go online and look up flight trackers so I can know for myself. Finally get a text with the flight # but no arrival time, after I've already looked it up. It gets in at 1020. Had I gotten there at 10 I would have been waiting for ~30min.\n\nThis morning comes and they never send me a text about when their getting in. I know what time because I looked it up. I get a text when they land that says \"U comin?\". I drive, pick them up, but can't help but express my frustration with how they wouldn't give me the information after repeated requests. I didn't yell and attack them (though they may have felt attacked) and they proceeded to blow up on me, yelling and kicking me out of the car and speeding off as soon as we got to my spot (used their car to pick them up).\n\nTime and timing has been an issue (they don't care about schedules at all, I do) and so they knew how this may affect me and I really tried not to let it, hence why I tried to ask them multiple times.\n\nThey are pissed because it doesn't seem like a big deal to them.

I didn't think it important to tell them immediately, but after a few months, I commented to my grandmother that I was proud of the weight I was losing due to the surgery. This angered my grandparents, and they were mad they weren't allowed to visit me when I was in the hospital. I apologized and told them I'd let them know next time I'm in the hospital. A year later, my mother finds out from my grandmother that my grandfather was in the hospital recovering from surgery. My mother asked why she wasn't informed, and my grandmother responds \"because you didn't tell me about gone-writing's surgery\". My mother, sister, and I made plans to go visit my grandfather, but things got complicated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sets my grandmother off. She calls my mother and berates her on the phone. I'm sitting nearby and I hear my grandmother tell my mother that she wanted all three of us to go to her apartment so she could tell us what terrible people we were, and that she wanted nothing to do with us. My mother, used to my grandmothers theatrics, hung up on her, and my grandmother called me. She told me to block her number and block her on Facebook and not contact her. I tell her \"okay, cool\" and hang up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a year, everything was pretty quiet until I receive an email from my grandfather about how I was being terrible for not calling my grandmother. I tell my grandfather everything that happened and he essentially just says \"when people get old, they start to act childish. It's your responsibility to be the mature one.\" That didn't sit right with me. I'm 21 years old. I have to be more mature than a 91 year old? Who lived through a World War? I explained that to my grandfather and he suddenly shoots back with dirt on my father. Specifically, he tells me that my mother couldn't be trusted because she was a known liar and my father cheated on her when I was 2 years old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThing is, I know this story. My parents never hid their past from me, and I'm glad they didn't. Had this bomb been dropped on me now, at 21, how would I look at my father? How would it have hurt me? It angered me that he told me that, because if felt as though he was trying to turn me against my own parents. I deleted the email without responding, and my grandmother has been calling me nonstop ever since. I don't want to talk to them anymore because I feel like they've completely burned their bridges with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Firstly, I admit this is not really a moral dilemma, but it's becoming a recurring argument between my boyfriend and I. Maybe this post better belongs in r/relationship_advice but that sub seems to be mostly people asking for help with their failing relationship and I (hope) we don't qualify for that yet. Also, he called me an asshole for this reason, which made me think of this sub.\n\nThe issue is simple. I sneeze loudly. He says obnoxiously loudly, and that I should restrain myself like \"everyone else.\" Our apartment is echo-y so I guess it amplifies my sneeze. I see no point in trying to quiet my sneeze (not hold it back, just make it less forceful) because it really can't be that irritating, can it? \n\nNow we are arguing about scenarios. I said yes, I would attempt to quiet my sneeze if we were in say, a movie theater. Because we're in a public space where people are trying to concentrate on something they have paid for and that seems like a courtesy. His response was, \"so you respect others in public, but not me.\" (Jokingly but...)\n\nHelp me settle this argument. AITA?",

      "description": "I [24M] had been text messaging a girl [23F] for a few weeks after she insisted multiple times that we get together sometime, When I finally asked her out she canceled last minute and said her kid was in trouble so she had to go to school to sort it out. We had been friendly for the better part of a year and I usually saw her once a week when I went to the restaurant where she worked. I would usually grab a coffee for anyone that worked there that wanted one, mostly just her, and occasionally eat lunch there and talk to her if she was working or grab a sandwich before heading to work if I had something scheduled. \n\nA few weeks ago she complained that she had kicked out her on again off again boyfriend whom she hadn't ever mentioned when we spoke, and that some really awful things had been going on in her life and that she was afraid she wasn't going to make rent because of not being able to work full time and not having gotten any assistance from him.\n\nI told her that I could help out if she **really** needed it but didn't hear anything for a few days. That was when she messaged me on social media saying that her phone was shut off and that she really needed money by the end of the week to pay her back-rent to her landlord by Friday night. I took some money ($1k USD) out of my bank account, and told her I had it but had to work but after messaging that I was done at work she said that she was having her family over and didn't want to head out that night to get it, On Friday I messaged her and asked to see her (to talk about a budget/finances but also to give her the money) but she claimed to be busy working. \n\nI was a little suspicious because when I tried to call her it went to voicemail and not the standard \"this line is deactivated\" message, so I called her from a phone at work and she picked up (at which point I hung up without saying anything) and when I tried to call from my number it again went straight to voicemail. She hasn't messaged me and I haven't messaged her back since then (its been about 3 weeks) but I have been back every week to the restaurant but she hasn't worked the shift that I go to since then either.\n\nAITA for not helping someone you caught lying to you after already having offered to help?",

Wife allows 3 YO to eat off her plate, come into bed, wander around restaurants, splay out and tantrum, refusing to do x, etc. Whenever I try to discipline I get called an asshole, etc.\n\n\nThing is that the birth of 3 almost cost both their lives. Wife definitely had PPD and I helped her get with a therapist and the appropriate meds for it. While she is still medicated she is no longer in therapy. I’ve been in touch with her provider and it’s mostly a preventative thing and they will be stepping down soonish (paperwork signed to talk to me because of the situation).\n\n\nLong and short I had been gently suggesting that she is feeding into 3’s behavior by allowing her to behave the way she does. Recently I got fed up with it and called her out on it. I just want 3 to be independent and/or not freaking out every time she leaves the room. I was called a “heartless asshole” and that I didn’t care about our 3. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for trying to stick up for 3 or am I the the asshole for making her feel bad or neither?",

Please help me figure out if I was an asshole or not. \n\nWhile I was in a cafe with my dad, a black homeless man ran in and told us our car was getting a ticket. My dad left so speak with the meter maid. Meanwhile I was wondering what I should do to thank the homeless man. I didn’t have any cash and I didn’t see any ATMs. I saw my dad give the homeless man a dollar.\n\nI worried the homeless man would think we were stingy, selfish people who were so out of touch with reality that we thought giving a single dollar would make us white saviors. I didn't have cash but I did have a card. I bought him tea and 3 cookies.\n\nI made up a speech in my head to use when I gave the man his food. I kept repeating it in my head, trying emphasize how sorry I was that I didn’t have any money and that I hoped this food would be enough.\n\nMy dad disappeared while I was ordering the food and I freaked out so much I forgot to apologize for not giving money. The homeless man put down my food and drinks besides 5 other drinks he'd been given before. I felt ashamed, like my pathetic efforts to help were just another unwanted item that robbed him of the chance to choose for himself with money.\n\nI got into the car with my dad and angrily asked him why he left when I asked him to stay. He didn’t care at all that I’d been calling for him or that my hot tea burned my full hands when I got bumped by someone, looking for him. I told him I was incredibly upset and he told me not to be, but I wouldn’t stop. I kept saying, “Why the hell did you leave? It messed up what I was going to say. Stop leaving me all the time!”\n\n“Use your eyes to look for me, stop freaking out,” he said.\n\nI yelled, “I made myself look like a stupid, racist, out-of-touch white bitch with a savior complex who can’t even do one thing right!” and my dad turned to me and yelled, “Shut up! Shut up and be grateful. I’m paying for everything on this trip. You shut your mouth and quit talking.”\n\nI felt so bad that I burst out crying. I cried so hard I couldn’t even speak. It was just all stupid blubbering and it made my dad yell at me, \"Why are you crying? You have no reason to cry!\" Finally I blubbered out in a pathetic voice, “Please just give me a minute! Just a minute, God!” \n\nWe drove down the streets and I explained how ashamed I was that I couldn’t help at all and how I failed to use my privilege to actually help another human being. He told me I didn’t care about being a good person and that I was just doing it out of guilt. I told him I was upset because I should have done more and he told me I needed to quit being upset because I helped the homeless man and I couldn’t give him everything in one interaction. \n\nI still feel like a huge, worthless, unhelpful, privileged asshole who’s just one more idiotic white bitch who can't do anything to help.

      "description": "She's barely eighteen and she's already looking to settle down. She has only dated guys who are older than thirty. She rejected going to UCLA because her boyfriend told her to. She has stated to me multiple times that she's trying to get pregnant. She has also stated to me that she finds most of her boyfriend's on sugar daddy websites. She blows all her money on clothes and paintings. She lives at one of our family houses. She got five cats and two dogs when she can barely take care of herself. She's living off of her trust fund. The list could honestly go on forever. \n\nMy point is that she makes horrible life decisions. I'm honestly sick and tired of her being a brat when things turn out bad. I have four other siblings and they are doing just fine. So far, most of us have gotten valedictorian except her. She acts like some rich spoiled brat even though our parents raised us to be caring and giving. Honestly, I think our whole family should just drop her. I've been trying to convince my mom to but she won't listen to me. Earlier today my girlfriend kinda exploded on me saying I'm an asshole for trying to make everyone disown her. ",

      "description": "Today one of the people on my floor posted in a floor group chat reminding us that we should stay in line even if it's after 7:00 to make sure that we get our votes in. I consider myself a friend of hers, maybe not super close but we've lived around each other for more than a year now. She's a US citizen, but she's from Britain and she has an English accent. After posting this, I responded saying, \"I'll be sure to vote loyalist this year!\" as a joke.\n\nTo clarify, other people on the floor have made fun of her for multiple reasons, and she has made fun of us for multiple reasons. I never made fun of her accent (and I wouldn't, I think that's unfair) but some people have, and she usually responds by saying something along the lines of, \"At least I can go into a high school without being shot.\" or something similarly irreverent. \n\nAfter posting my joke, the RA texted me (only me) asking me to be respectful of everyone's background and to not make anyone feel like an outsider. I responded by saying that I was celebrating our differences in a fun and non-offensive way (I didn't think that anyone would be offended by a joke about pre-revolutionary war America), but he wasn't a fan. I haven't heard anything from her about it, except for a reminder in the group chat that she was a citizen which I can't get any vibe off of.\n\nShould I have avoided making a joke about her heritage?

I'm not a super slow driver, our speed limit is 55 and I drive 65. I have to get into the left lane about a mile before the exit so I don't have switch lanes at the last second when there may not be an opening for me. I almost always end up with someone angrily tailgating me. It's frustrating and actually pretty scary. \n\nThis morning, someone in my city's sub made a post about how much they hate people cruising in the passing lane. Several people pointed out that a lot of the time you have to drive in the left lane to exit, and they got downvoted into oblivion. \n\nI am so baffled.

      "description": "Little backstory first, so I’ve been engaged for 2 years and in those years I’ve bought a house (last year) and started saving for my wedding (this year). We wanted to get a house first because my son was about to start kindergarten. We didn’t want to have the wedding and then save another year to get the house in another city and then have to transfer him.\nAnyway, well when I proposed to her. We set a date shortly after to be dated to 2 years later. I told my family and everyone that asked about it the date. WELL, apparently not everyone. Just recently my real brother came to me about some information that my STEP brother was planning to propose to his girlfriend of like 4 months. She already knew about the ring because he showed her it when he got it but hadn’t officially proposed yet. (Don’t ask me why he did that because I don’t know why either.) Anyway, I told my real brother “Okay? So what?” He then tells me the date they chose, it was exactly 1 week before ours! They were also using the exact same colors as ours too! I told my real brother, no way they’d do that to us. So I kept my cool about it and we had a family get together and everything was fine. My step brother didn’t bring up anything about it. A few days later I look on Facebook and they posted about the proposal with the exact date my real brother told me about. My fiancé and I are furious! I call my Dad about it and he says he can’t talk right now (he’s with them) so he’ll call me back. I say okay and a few hours go by and he texts me telling me to call him tomorrow which of course makes us even more mad. Because when something like this happens, we like to talk about it right there and then. So I ignore his call the following day because the previous day I was so mad I had to take an ibuprofen and didn’t want a repeat of it. So I call him the next day and I couldn’t believe the words he was saying. Without going into detail he kept defending my step brother over me. He tells me they planned everything including the date before they told my dad and step mother. Even though my step brother and his girlfriend both knew when our wedding was. My dad told me to get over it and it’s “not a big deal” and that if I “keep pushing it, he’s not coming to my wedding.” My dad is my best man by the way. I told him “well that’s fine” and he hung up. My argument is this, what family member does this to another family member? Like, who intentionally rains on another family member’s parade? My outer family will now have to go to 2 weddings on the weekend in a row, my family is already busy enough on the weekends as is.\nAre we the assholes (my fiancé and I) for getting mad about this?",

      "title": "AITA for being really angry at my SO about stupid disagreements like mushrooms?",
      "description": "Ah. Ok. So.\n\nFrom very early on in our relationship, I knew my SO was very headstrong. He told me, his friends told me, his family told me, it's also super obvious, I'd seen it in action. We agree on the big things so it's ok - we were always completely aligned in our political beliefs, religious beliefs, family future plans, etc. All the important things. And the little things? Well, I'm the least headstrong person so it didn't really bother me, because we weren't really butting heads. But it does effect me. I will focus on 1 example below, but just know that this stuff happens all over our life - with stuuuuupid little things like colours, apartments, kitchen supplies, music, tech, what to watch on Netflix, whatever (nothing major though). Anyway, for this main example though, all you have to know is that I like mushrooms (I think).\n\nMe: \"Hey, do you want mushrooms for dinner? I love mushrooms.\"\n\nHe says, \"They're disgusting.\" \n\nI say, \"Really? What kinds have you had?\" \n\nHim: \"All of them. They're disgusting.\"\n\nMe: \"How were they cooked? Poorly cooked mushrooms can get a bit gross.\" \n\nHe says, \"No, I've had them all ways. They're disgusting.\" \n\nMe: \"Ah. Well, I really like them...\"\n\nWe now don't eat mushrooms ever and it's cool and I never bring it up. Don't want him to feel bad and I'm not going to force someone to eat mushrooms who could be allergic, you know? I'm very careful about picking/ordering food with no mushrooms when I can be. He tells waiters he's allergic to them when we go out to eat so that he doesn't get them in his food. I never buy or cook mushrooms for myself, which I used to love. Every time mushrooms come up he says they're disgusting and I began to associate this in my head. So naturally I stop eating mushrooms, and years pass, we get married, move to a new country together. I hate mushrooms now. Yes, that is on me - I'm way too easy-going/steamroller/influenced/people-pleaser or whatever other names you'd like to throw my way. Go ahead. I take responsibility for that, and I'm working on it, and I'm trying to be more in touch with my needs and what I want. It is difficult to just turn off. As I'm becoming more aware of this issue, I'm re-evaluating how we talk to each other and express our needs. I decide to ask him to disagree with me more respectfully and be more aware.\n\nHe doesn't really understand. He thinks that stating his own opinion shouldn't influence mine and it's not his fault at all - it is just all in my head. He says this, a lot. He's very much one of those people that always tries to be logical and remove emotion from situations. I do believe he's right; his opinion shouldn't influence mine. I agree in theory. But still it does. There is part of me deep down that just wants to please him because I love him and I'll always pretty much acquiesce to whatever he prefers to make him happy, I'm working on turning it off and getting more confident in myself. I'm asking that we both become aware of this, and try to adjust our life accordingly. I don't want him to stop expressing his opinions - I just want him to be aware of how he does it and try not to dismiss me and my opinion in the process. He doesn't understand. I start seeing a therapist.\n\nI'm working on myself with this therapist. And I enroll in a mindfulness group, where I talk about this issue regularly. I'm trying to be really critical and evaluate my self-confidence and practice exercises they give me to look at my needs and what makes me happy and try to express them and be more vocal. Sometimes, I am doing better and I tell him my opinion. But whenever he tells me his opinion, if it is not in complete agreement, I feel like he always gets his way. Furthermore, the way he says, 'Mushrooms are disgusting. All of them. They just are.' without ever acknowledging that maybe they're just gross for him and not gross for everyone is unfair. He'll say 'X is right. X is the only way' and if I think Y, well, he's so confident it just floods me with insecurities and questioning my own self. Yeah, sure, that's not his fault, but also, it's not exactly my choice either - why can't we try to work with communicating our wants and needs together? Why do I have to be AS headstrong as him if I ever want my opinion to be heard?\n\nAnyway, to summarise all of this up, years later, after we are married, I'm helping his mum prepare dinner and I discover she's put mushrooms in the egg rolls she's made. He goes to grab one, and I go, 'oh don't! You can't eat it! It has mushrooms in it.' and he goes, 'Nah, my mum knows how to make mushrooms edible.'\n\n...\n\nAITA for feeling completely gaslit and also enraged that he can't be like, 'oh mushrooms aren't my thing but it's ok you like them' or even 'i only like the way my mom makes mushrooms' rather than telling me that they're just always disgusting so incessantly that I literally feel incepted that they are and get nauseous at the thought of them??? AITA for wanting him to express his opinions in a more respectful way, and to be aware of how hard it is for me to disagree with him because I am a spineless jellyfish?? (Also, am I actually crazy here?)\n\nAnyway, that's mushroom-gate. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Please tell me. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "She’s in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything, and against my better judgment I went with it. Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she’s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it’s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we’re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won’t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I’m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I’m wary but I say ok but you’ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can’t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I’m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you’re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I’m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I’m wrong and I overreacted ",

      "description": "The past few years my friend and I have gone out for lunch/happy hours often. We are free to invite whoever we want, and have both brought friends along. We are very different people. I'm young, physically small, never married. She is significantly older, divorced, and obese. We agree and disagree on many topics, and have had lots of great discussions and not held our differences against each other.\n\nShe is obese to the point that it is physically disabling. People are generally judgmental and rude about this which has had mental and emotional impacts on her for a very long time.  So a few months ago when she told me she met someone and they were dating and he was really helping her feel better mentally, emotionally, and physically,  I was really happy for her. \n\nA few days ago she told me something that changed everything. Apparently this guy has been married for the past 23 years and has cheated on his wife consistently for the past 20. She knew he was married from the beginning of their relationship. Hearing he was married really changed my perspective. I feel so bad for his wife and to be honest, I'm questioning my friend's judgement/feel like he is using her since she was so open to his affection.   \nWe'd discussed adultery as an abstract theoretical concept before. She told me that she doesn't think cheating is a big deal if you tell a partner they aren't meeting your sexual needs, then you should be free to meet them yourself as long as your partner doesn't find out about it, because if they don't know then nobody is getting hurt. I told her I strongly disagree, that sounds super toxic/dishonest/a path to a shitty relationship, but I'm not in a relationship with her so I wasn't really concerned that we disagree on that topic.   \nThe day after she told me this we were going to meet up for lunch until she texted me he was going to come along. I told her that I'd rather he didn't because I don't want to meet him. She is pissed because he is important in her life, has been good for her, and has said I'm being judgmental and unsupportive. She's right. I am. I'm still fine with having lunches with just her, but I don't want to talk about him and I definitely don't want to meet him because I'm repulsed by this situation and do not want to get any more involved than I already am.   \nAm I the asshole?

Why do we have to build a new space for you when spaces already exist, regardless of what you plan to use it for?” \n\nThis comment hasn’t gone over well with a few of my religious friends, but if they keep pushing for this room I do plan to keep speaking against it. We’re a public state school operating on extremely limited federal funds as it is.",

We usually only call a few times a year so we were talking for a while, just catching up on things, when he made a comment about how “East Indians are bad at their jobs.” I told him that sounded a little racist, and that people can be bad at their job regardless of where they’re from (not super proud of that comeback but I was trying to keep the conversation pleasant.)\n\nWe went back and forth on this for a couple minutes, and eventually my dad said he wasn’t racist because he married a Chinese woman. I said basically, “your wife has no issue with you and your buddies saying the n-word so maybe that’s not a great example” and his response was to say, “What’s wrong with saying nigger? Nigger nigger nigger nigger. What’s so bad about that?”\n\nAt this point I said I’m done we can talk later, and hung up on him abruptly. He called back immediately and I ignored it. Then he went on a texting spree calling me a pussy, that he’s disappointed and embarrassed of me, how my mom is a liar, how lazy I am, and a few other things about my mom’s side of the family I’d rather not repeat. I was going to ignore it all, but after taking a break from texting me for an hour or so, he started back up with the insults. So I told him “fuck you lose my number” and blocked him from my phone and all social media. \n  \nI just cant help but feel like I escalated the situation when I brought his wife into it, and spiraled the whole conversation out of control.

      "description": "TL:DR at the end, I'm a mobile user, English is not my first language, you get the gist. \n\nMy fiancée and I have been in a relationship for a year now. I'm 23 and she's 27. We're lesbians. I asked her to marry me six months ago and our wedding will be held in a year and a half. We're extremely excited, planning on having kids after the wedding and so on. She's everything I've ever dreamed of and knew from the first time I saw her that I'd make her my wife someday. She knew that as well. There is just one thing bothering me in our relationship. \n\nMy fiancée has a male friend, let's call him Hank. Hank is tall, his clothing and hair style is \"psychobilly\" and he lost his virginity at 26 by having sex with the 17-year-old daughter of his best friend. After that, he started a false rumour that the girl gave him chlamydia and he hasn't had sex since. He has also been unemployed for a long time, because according to him, he doesn't know how to make a CV. Y'know, the kind of a person I wouldn't want to hang around with. Hank is now 27 as well and was a co-worker of my fiancée about six years back, when we hadn't met yet. They became friends and have hung out ever since. However, another co-worker of theirs at that workplace at the time jokingly said to Hank that my fiancée had a crush on him, which is impossible since she's a lesbian. Hank, for some incomprehensible reason, believed it to be true. \n\nEver since then Hank has harassed my fiancée by saying stuff like \"I'd be the man of your dreams\", \"You just haven't tried my dick\", \"I love you and would make you happy\" etc... He insists that my fiancée should sleep with him in order to find out how amazing of a person he is and it doesn't matter that my fiancée is not interested, because according to him, starting a relationship with him would change how my fiancée sees him. He also demands she sees him at LEAST three times a week, and plays martyr (\"you're a bad friend, I'm so lonely, nobody wants to spend time with me\") when she doesn't. She feels horrible whenever Hank does this and doesn't understand why he can't just shut up about it. She's told him multiple, even hundreds of times that she is not interested and will never be. He doesn't accept that. This has gone on for about five years. \n\nNow, he isn't this bad all the time. The reason my fiancée hangs out with him still, is that he can be nice and not speak about that nasty stuff for a while and they share the same passion: cars. They can have a really nice time together and he might go for about a month without harassing her, but then start the bullshit again. \n\nHowever, I feel extremely annoyed and even hurt that my fiancée still hangs out with him. In the past she has cut all contact with him but when that happened, he started visiting her parents all the time, begging for them to reach out to her and ask her to \"be his friend again\". My fiancée says that she never wants that to happen again, as she doesn't want her parents involved. She has blocked him everywhere except instagram, through which they can plan to meet whenever he's being nice again. I have suggested that she could get a restraining order against him, but she says she doesn't want to hurt him and he's the only person she can talk about cars with. \n\nI told her this feels like she'd rather keep hurting me than hurt him. She said that she feels bad and if it comes to that, she will cut all contact with him. Just now she texted him and told him that if he ever talks about his feelings again, she will cut off all contact with him. \n\nAITA for wanting my fiancée to stop being his friend? If not, any advice? \nI feel extremely disrespected but also guilty when my fiancée tells me he's the only person with whom she can talk about cars. \n\nShe read this text before I sent it to you guys so we're very open about the situation. \n\nTL;DR: We're lesbians, getting married in 2020. Fiancée has a male friend Hank, who won't stop sexually harassing her and insisting that she should sleep with him. Fiancée doesn't want to cut all contact with him, because he can be nice at times and he's the only friend she shares her car passion with. I feel disrespected. AITA for wanting her to still cut all contact with him? \n\n",

      "description": "I’m an international student from Nigeria and I couldn’t afford to go back home for spring break so I am in temporary housing for a week. I have a roommate that’s a transfer student from China and we’d both been doing our own things and he didn’t seem to bother me. Now I had a stressful week last week with a bunch of midterms and papers so I couldn’t really talk to my friends. Since the break started I have been playing apex religiously with my headphones on talking to my friends. I don’t rage and I have a naturally quiet voice. Last night the RA knocked on my door and my roommate quickly dragged him out of the room and talked to him for about 10 minutes. The RA came in and told me my roommate said I have no manners and I am too loud while he is trying to study. While we have been here he has played league of legends most of the time and I have barely seen him study. He was demanding a new roommate or he would go to a hotel. I told him my roommate had never talked to me about the issue before and I was confused. The RA went back outside to try and get my roommate so we could all talk but he refused and said he was scared I would harm him. I don’t know where he got that impression but the RA knows me so he dismissed the idea that I would be violent towards him. They continued talking outside while I was inside and the campus police was called because either he claimed I threatened him or he threatened me. The police came and settled everything and told him I can’t be forced to do anything in my room and if he wants to study he should go to the lounge. He left for a while but didn’t take his laptop on anything. When he came back I was watching tv on a low volume (20 on a small Samsung tv) and he immediately called the RA to say I was making noise without talking to me. I got pissed and just turned it off and went to bed. Today I woke up around 10 and started playing apex with friends. He got up at like 12 and went to his computer. While I was playing he told me to shut up and I told him to fuck off. He flipped out and told me I had no right and I should play my games elsewhere. I told him if he wants to study he can go to the lounge as it would be much easier to move a laptop than a tv + console. I don’t fell like I’m making noise and my previous roommate never complained about it so AITA?\nTL:DR\nRoommate says I’m making too much noise but never talked to me about it. Campus police was called and he was told to go to the lounge if he needs to study. Told me to shut up while I was talking to my friends online and I told him to fuck off to the lounge",

You can’t ask him to do anything around the home without him blowing up.  I have him take out the trash and I tied the bag closed and he tossed in the back of his truck and drove around with it then accused me of not knowing how to tie a bag because it came undone.    His room is disgusting as is his bathroom.  I’ve bought him a truck, pay his phone bill, insurance, I added him to my credit cards so he could build credit, bought trips for him to go to NY (he models) and he works and buys his food because he works out 5 hrs a day and adheres to a strict diet.  \n\nThe last straw happened when I suddenly started seeing his texts messages on my phone.  I knew this happened because he was logged into iTunes with my account .  I told him to get his own account, send me his email address and I’d send him his playlists but I don’t want our messages getting mixed up.  Well this started a war.  He basically told me he wasn’t speaking to me anymore and that I was a shitty parent.  I told him if he felt that way he needed to work more hours at his job (he is a manager of a vape shop) he currently works only enough to buy his food, pay his truck insurance, gas and gym membership.  Spends most of his day working out.  \n\nI’m so tired of lighting with him because of how he speaks to me.  I’ve done nothing but support this kid.  My support has know turned into enabling and I’m ready for him to work more hours and move.  ",

      "description": "(First of all, sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language)\n\nContext:\n\nSo...two years ago, my best friend made out and almost had sex with my now-boyfriend (whom I was in a relationship with before all that happened) and my ex I still had feelings for at the time (which she knew), all in rapid succession. It was not the only time she backstabbed me but this action is the most relevant for the story as it had a large impact on me and my trust issues towards her.\n\nI forgave her.\n\nFast forward to the current point in time and all of a sudden the two of them are really good friends. After months of not talking, the relationship between them has gotten to a point where they are constantly texting each other, talking about everything and spending a hell lot of time with each other. He has even slept over at her place a few times.\n\nNow, I talked to both of them about the situation, telling them that it makes me feel uncomfortable, mainly because of what had happened between them already (I didn't scream or curse at either of them). My boyfriend said he felt sorry and that he would spend a little less time with her (I later told him that I didn't want to impair his social life). My best friend, on the other hand, started crying, claimed that I hurt her feelings and that she was at the brink of ending our friendship because of what I said.\n\nI told her that I was sorry and we continued acting normally again.\n\nA day later, while I'm talking to my boyfriend on discord he tells me about how he's going to sleep over at her place. I texted her, saying that I think it's a bit inconsiderate of her to just disregard everything I just told her the day before. She then got really angry at me and told me to stop forcing my boyfriend to stay away from his friends (which I have never done, not even when it comes to her) and how I'm a complete asshole who just thinks about herself while humiliating her and constantly hurting her feelings. At this point I was pretty mad too and noted that she should stop getting pissed off because I was hurt over a mistake **she** had made. I didn't get a response for a while, because apparently she spent the day with my boyfriend. A few hours later I got a passive-aggressive apology and, once again, we started texting normally afterwards. At this point I was tired of getting into a fight everytime I tried to express my feelings so I just dropped the topic and never brought it up again.\n\nYesterday, I talked about something revolving around the relationship I had with the ex I mentioned above. The story didn't even involve her but she immediately started getting angry again and said something along the lines of: \"I'm just gonna act like you didn't just reproach me for doing something two years ago again.\"\n\nLuckily, it was pretty easy to avoid conflict by just explaining what I meant but what she said in that situation has sticked with me. I just don't know anymore, am I overexaggerating or is she just inconsiderate? Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "So, some context. \n\nI work at a Starbucks, and have been for about a year now. This other girl, let's call her M, has been working for about the same amount of time. She's a bit older than I am [I'm 20, M and she's 24] and we are super good friends. It's not uncommon for us to go for a beer after work, as we usually do night shifts together. \n\nThere's this other girl, let's call her J. J and M are about the same age, and J started working here around December. Now one thing about Starbucks (at least, where I come from) is that dating other baristas are not allowed, because it always leads to tension and drama. I've experienced this firsthand in my previous store, and it was a really awful experience. \n\nSo the tea is that M and J have been having sexual relations for the past month or so. M told me last night when she was quite drunk. The other problem is that M has a boyfriend and J has a girlfriend. I really didn't know what to say, because I think infidelity is a pretty awful thing to do when you're not in an open relationship and I didn't want to go through the whole ordeal that is workplace romance again.\n\nI personally decided to put an end to this. I didn't know what else to do.\n\nI talked to my assistant manager the next day. She went really quiet and told me she appreciated my confidence and that she would talk to our store manager to see if M or J can be transferred to another store, and that they can handle it in a private, respectful manner. \n\nAITA for meddling in a situation that wasn't my business and breaking my friend's trust like that?",

      "description": "I’m a 15 year old guy and have a pretty good relationship with my mom. One thing that we have arguments about is my hair. I am a Lebanese-Arab, so I have pretty curly, dry, thick black hair, and also have a pretty big forehead. Whenever it comes time for me to get a haircut, my mom always wants me to get a short buzzcut, but I prefer my hair to be a little bit longer, maybe an inch in length. The thing is, whenever I tell her that she says that I look stupid and disgusting, even I think it looks perfectly fine, and a lot better on me than a short ass buzzcut. I even showed her a picture of my grade 10 picture just to prove it looked fine, but that made it worse. I tell her I’m 15 years old and that it’s my hair so I should be able to choose how I want it, but she starts screaming and insulting me, to the point where my dad will literally have to drag me out of my house just to go the the damn barber. And whenever I go to school after I get my haircut, I usually get made fun of for having such short hair and a high ass hairline, which is so high it looks like I’m balding, and I have told her this but she just doesn’t care and gets even more mad. I just feel like most kids my age wouldn’t have to deal with this, and it is unfair for me. Nearly all the guys I know have long hair, while I have to fight to the death just to keep a fucking inch on my head. My mom isn’t even talking to me because of this. I just want to live my life in peace, but I can’t just because I want to keep an extra centimetre of hair. I am so frustrated. My mom wants to control every aspect of my life, from liking girls to where I go for university to even my own fucking hair. I’m so fucking sick and done with this. This is so frustrating.",

      "description": "So I met this girl (who I think was a friend of a friend) at my high school prom about two years ago and we talked for about five minutes. I noticed that she was a bit overly happy and perhaps a little clingy, but I first figured that was just her personality so I did not pay any mind to it. So only a few minutes after meeting her, she wanted my snapchat information. I figured it wouldn't hurt anyone so I just gave it to her and we exchanged info. After the prom, she started sending me about 3-4 snapchats everyday. Some of them didn't even make sense, like just her drinking a starbucks or something. I did not know how to respond to these so I would just go like \"haha\" or something. I would also get random DMs from her saying like \"just broke up with my bf\" and like a crying emoji. Again, I don't really know how to respond to something like that. I had subtle thoughts that maybe she was into me or something but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and just thought that maybe she just had an eccentric but harmless personality, so I would just respond to everything she wrote to me with like a laughing face or a thanks. She then responded to a picture of my dad from when he was my age saying \"now I know where you get your good looks from. \" Again, I just responded laughing and saying thanks. She then started to calm down a little bit with sending me stuff but would still periodically do it.  She has been doing this for two years now until I pretty much put a stop to it last week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor halloween, I posted a picture of me dressed up as Buddy Holly. Not too long after, she DMed me saying \"OMG you are so cute pls be my bf.\" Hoping that she was joking, I just laughed and said that I was glad that she liked the costume. She then responded again saying to be her bf, and then I responded with the textual equivalent of a nervous laugh. She wrote back saying \"I am guessing you are not available then :(\" I just told her that I couldn't and then blocked her after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like an asshole for blocking her but the reason this situation made me so uncomfortable is because I barely even know who this girl is and the only time I ever actually met her in person was for that 5 minutes. Also, the constant notifications and snapchat photos were getting very annoying, and the messages were making me feel weird.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould you guys have done the same thing or should I have approached the situation better?",

      "description": "I say 'friend' because he's not REALLY my friend, he's just in my social circle. He's my flatmate at university.\n\nSo I (20M) go to university with him (20M), I'll just call him Matt. Matt is in my social circle and he gets all the girls. He's a good looking guy, he's got muscles, curly hair and blue eyes so obviously he's gonna draw attention wherever he goes lol.\n\nBut he's a bit of a ''docuhebro'' and a little bit loud so I don't understand why he ALWAYS gets girls. They always giggle when they talk to him and talk about how hot he is and he's slept with pretty much every girl in my social circle (which is quite a lot).\n\nNow I'm not saying I'm owed sex either, I'm NOT (and as a feminist myself, I'm well aware of the ''nice guys'' phenomenon) but this guy is a typical douchebro and some of the girls in my cirle are ardent Feminists, so why would they sleep with him? He represents everything feminists stand against. \n\nHe's pretty much a sexist guy, he makes jokes to the girls that they should make him a sandwich after he sleeps with them. The latest example is below:\n\nMe and my other flatmates (3 girls, all aged 19) were in the flat watching a movie at around 2am and he comes back from a night out (he went out without us). So he comes into the living room area **drunk** WITH A GIRL he's picked up from a nightclub (also drunk), and she was pretty good looking to be fair. We KNOW they're obviously going to have sex, but he makes a point of saying to us, and showing off ''Guys, I'm going to go and fuck this girl, and then she'll make me breakfast in the morning''. He then takes her to his room and has loud sex.\n\nWTF!!!! Nobody else can get away with doing shit like except this guy. Not only did he do that, but the girl was giggling when he was saying that shit.\n\nI thought my flatmates would be angry at the sexist shit he said but they were giggling and saying he's so hot and I got VERY angry, I haven't said anything to Matt but I feel a lot of anger towards him, AITA?",

Most of the time they ask for money and I don’t feel bad about saying no because idk what they using that money for. But on one specific instance I went to Publix to buy a few things and while I was walking back a homeless dude approached me and asked me if I could  go back and buy him and his daughter a sandwich. The daughter wasn’t there so it made me doubt his story a little bit, but I mean if he just wanted an extra sandwich for himself for later I guess I couldn’t  have blamed him. But anyway I said I didn’t have any money (which wasn’t completely a lie but I mean I could’ve bought a sandwich) and he looked heartbroken so I walked away quickly to avoid guilt.

At one point, we had a running joke where if one of us were losing, we would play an obvious blunder with a smyslov screw. This is where you move a piece and you slam it on the board with a screwing motion to finish. This continued until the joke got old he never really stopped using the smyslov screw. This really ticks me off because it feels like beating a dead horse to me. When I confronted him about it, he told me that I was using it as well but i didn’t really feel like that was the case. He clarified that what he meant was that sometimes when I carried out some crushing attacks, I would sometimes slam the pieces onto their spots. I don’t really feel like that’s a smyslov screw but he said that even if it wasn’t, the game isn’t being disturbed by him doing the smyslov screw and that I was not being reasonable.

      "description": "Hi there,\n\nI've been sick since a week, that's why I want to know if my feelings are valid or if I'm just extremely tired and desperate.\nSome background: I (F21) and SO (M24) have been together for 4 years and have been living together since almost a year.\n\nAs I said, I've been sick since Monday - nothing too bad, a little fever and a throat infection. It got better and I genuinely thought that I would be feeling great again tomorrow. That's why I didn't go to the doctor yet. This evening, I start to feel worse again, my throat hurts really bad and I'm coughing nonstop. I tried to go to bed early, but couldn't fall asleep because I've been waking myself up with coughing. He was out with friends and when he returned at about 1.30am I was pretty miserable, because I just wanted to sleep but couldn't. He seems to be understanding and said good night. Now, remember the coughing? It just didn't stop, resulting in none of us sleeping and me being in pain. It goes on for about one hour, with him getting more and more annoyed. He then gets some earplugs. Unfortunately the coughing still won't stop and I start to get kind of desperate. Half-crying I turn to him, hoping he could do something or at least just be there for me. Instead he raises his voice saying \"please stop, I just want to sleep.\" \"what can I even do\" and \"I have an important day tomorrow.\" (studying for an exam) and in the end \"just go to a doctor if it doesn't get better\". This makes me cry because now I feel it's my fault and then I walked out and go to the living room. Now I'm feeling even worse, still awake as ever, kind of cold because I only have a thin blanket now.\nAfter calming myself down I took some painkillers and now feel a little bit better. \n\nNow, am I right to think it's really selfish to react like this? I mean I get the frustration when you can't sleep (duh, because I'm having the same struggle) but is it too much to think he could act a little bit more empathetic? I have to say, his personality is rather selfish in situations when he doesn't feel well and I have thought similar thoughts in other situations.\nReddit, AITA when I'll tell him tomorrow that his behavior really hurt me? I feel he would find some kind of excuse to not validate my feelings and that's why I want to make sure you would act the same way. Thanks! ",

      "description": "So two major parts of my life converged recently and I’m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I’m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we’d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we’d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we’d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn’t that big of a deal because it’s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there’s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory’s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn’t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn’t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn’t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there’s no one else she’s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn’t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn’t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn’t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere’s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy’s brand of “firey” is a Much better match to Gregory’s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it’s those two. I just can’t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?",

Also, this is more of a “would I be an asshole if ....” etc. \n\nI go to a STEM school, so needless to say, there’s no focus on music. I am a pianist, and enjoy practicing any time I can.

I like to go there to practice in my hour long blocks between classes. \n\nThe chapel is also very dark with the lights off, and hosts a number of large bean bag chairs. Perfect for the sleep deprived engineering student (I am also an engineering student, so I understand the sleep deprivation). \n\nEvery now and then when I go to practice, there’s one or two people out cold. I just walked in and there were three people (it’s 1pm in my area). Once I walked in to people sleeping at 5pm. I really want to wake them up and yell at them to get out because this is extremely frustrating. \n\nSo, AITA for (possibly next time) waking up sleeping college students to practice piano? ",

However, his dad footed the bill and they made a vacation out of it. \n\nBACKGROUND: Due to us growing up on opposite sides of the country I was never really as close to him and his siblings as I am to my cousins that are nearby. I also don't get along very well with them due to philosophical differences but I love them because they are family and put up with it. I have on several occasions tried to reach out to them but never hear back.\n\nMy wife and I had our first child about 8 months before their wedding. When we talked about going out we determined it just wasn't possible due to the financial strain and long distance travel with a newborn. It was suggested that I go out alone but I wasn't keen as I wanted to be with my son. Financially I could have swung it but it was just before the Holidays and would throw a wrench in things. \n\nAm I an asshole for deciding to skip the wedding in favor of saving money and being with my family?\n\nNOTE: I did attend all of my local cousin's weddings but that was because I was not married or financially tied down at that point.",

      "description": "So I met this girl at work about 6 months ago, and we immediately clicked. After 2 or 3 weeks of geting to know her, I asked her out. Only, I made the mistake of asking her to \"hang out\" instead of explicitly asking her on a date. She said yes, but the next day I found out that she did have a BF. I thought \"that's fine, she's a cool person and I like having friends.\" We didn't hang out, though, and I never persued hanging out with her outside of work again. I did feel like I had caught a bit of the feely feels, but I figured I'd get over it and things would be kosher. I know a lot of women who I value as friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut we did talk a lot. Our positions at work caused us to spend a lot of time together talking alone. The more I got to know her, the more and more it became obvious that we had some pretty bonkers stuff in common. Tons of stuff in common. I started to feel like I had never met anyone like her before. I fell for her pretty hard, and I was in way over my head emotionally before I realized it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, she left that job, but we kept in touch over FB messenger pretty often. My feelings grew to the point where I just couldn't get her out of my head. I became very, very depressed and started seeing a therapist for the first time in a long time. It highlighted the fact that I depend too much on others for happiness. I felt like I had to disconnect from her, and that there was no way for us to be friends without it being a toxic, one-sided thing. I didn't want to feel like I was leading her on in a friendship way for too long, and I felt like it would be best for both of us if we weren't friends while I tried to work on my co-dependency issues and my obsession with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince she was already involved with someone and she seemed happy with what she was doing on that end, I didn't want to tell her about my feelings. So I unfollowed her on Facebook and became less responsive on messenger, and I eventually quit responding, hoping she would get the hint. I felt like she was owed an explination, but I didn't think I should tell her about my feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut one day, she texted me, agressively asking for an explination. I told her that I had very strong feelings for her, and that it was probably best for both of us if we weren't friends. She was very hostile, accusing me of not seeing any value in her if I couldn't put my dick in her. Then she blocked me on all social media platforms that we followed each other on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was a month ago, and I am crushed. I've never met anyone that made me feel the way she did, and I'm not that young anymore. I really had no idea what to do that wouldn't end with one of us getting hurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that my fixation on her indicates that I have some serious soul searching to do to improve myself as a person, but I feel like I tried the best I could to what was best for me while also doing what was best for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hello, all! First time posting to this sub, so I hope everything is in order as far as the rules go. I'm sharing this story to find out who is *truly* the asshole in this situation. I know this may seem kind of petty, but it has been bothering me for a little while now. This post will be a bit long, but I will include a TL;DR at the end.\n\nA little backstory: In the Fall term of 2016, I enrolled in a local University along with 2 of my friends. I keep to myself most of the time, going with the flow, and only speak up around friends or when I truly feel like I have something to add to the conversation among strangers, so finding a friend that first semester was kind of difficult. One of my friends introduced me to the asshole in question (AIQ from now on) about 2 months into the term. Everything seemed nice enough in the beginning, and we became friends in the spring semester after taking a foreign language class together. Jump to the fall term (2017), when my teacher announced an upcoming study abroad opportunity in the summer (2018). We were both excited to go, as this could be our only chance of going to a different country (AIQ is a STEM major so she was worried about spending a full term away and how her classes would be, and my mom would not allow me to spend a year away from home since it was my first time going out of the state). Both of us saved up to pay the program fee (faculty-led), deposits, and multi-city plane ticket (we studied abroad in 2 countries that summer). All the while during our free time in class, we talked about how much we couldn't wait to go, what we hoped the cities to be like, where we would go during our free time, etc. Now on to the events that transpired and what led me to cut ties with AIQ.\n\nIn the first country, everyone got along (along with the AIQ and I, there were 11 other people - again it was a faculty-led program, meaning that the foreign language instructors from the university went with us so there wasn't a bunch of people they had to look after). However, when we arrived in the second country, everything kind of turned to shit between the AIQ and I. It began with the AIQ getting snappy and rude with me whenever I asked a general question, even when I wasn't talking to them in particular. If I suggested we do something, she'd say \" we already did that yesterday without you\" or \"we're tired of doing that\". We had to share a room together in the second country, and she held on to the key because she could attach it to her wallet and we thought it'd be easier than trying to look through my small bag in case it sunk down to the bottom. Twice, she came back very late (at around 11:15, which was later than the teacher wanted us to be out), so I waited in the shared space of two other group members until she came back (which was around a 30 minute wait). The first time, she was very apologetic, saying that the train was late (very unusual considering that the trains in this country run every 5 minutes or so), but I accepted her apology. The second time (only two days later), she just huffed past me, unlocked the door, set her bags down (she had went shopping again), and didn't say a word to me until the next morning. As each day passed, communication between us became very limited. Me, not talking to her because I really didn't want to deal with her attitude, and her, for whatever reason she had made up. She only had this attitude with me and she treated the other group members with friendliness and were open to what they wanted to do (although she claimed she disliked two of the other group members, she didn't have an attitude with them).  \n\nShe kept that attitude towards me until we departed for home. The remainder of that summer, I didn't speak to her at all- not even a text. When I saw her again this semester (we take the same foreign language class now), she acted like nothing was wrong and even hugged me- something that she'd never done. We talked about how our lives were so busy now that we've begun our upper level course work. After that first day of class, I didn't talk to her very much because now I know what she is truly like. Friendly at first, but very rude and condescending once you've spent time with her.\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not talking to a friend after she was mean to me when we studied abroad?",

      "description": "Am i the asshole here..so my husband is from Cuba..and I am from America. Obviously a lot of cultural differences between us. But sometimes when it comes to his mom, I get a little upset.  My question is pertaining to something that happened yesterday ( and many more stories like this) while leaving our 2 year old son with her, I had him pick a flower and take it to her. She saw this all happen, and when my son handed her the flower her response was to yell at my husband saying how he should learn from our son and give her flowers all the time. (Of course, special days deserve flowers even though they don't celebrate mother's day) but to just automatically go straight to telling her son it's his job to get her flowers frustrated me.. (isn't his job to get his wife flowers randomly?)  We've had similar situations to this. I.e. when I made a post about him being my king (mi Rey in Spanish) and she commented on it, saying he was HER king. One night my husband and I were talking and she came and interrupted completely and my husband told her to wait until we were done talking, and she flat out said that he needs to stop his conversation with me and talk with her, and that he SHOULD LOVE HER MORE. no, he shouldn't love either of us more, it's simply a different kind of love. Sometimes I simply don't know if I am being immature or just don't understand the culture, but I feel she doesn't respect me or my role at all, and expects her son to be more like a husband..than a son to her. :(",

      "description": "I wouldn’t call myself a professional photographer by any means, but I bought my camera a few years ago and it’s been a hobby of mine; I do get paid sometimes for doing simple stuff like couple shoots, senior pics, etc . I’m very protective of my stuff, especially expensive stuff. \n\nBut several months ago my friend told me her boss wanted a photographer for an event they were having at their school for the kids. She told me that she suggested me to her boss and her boss said okay. Since this is not my career, I wasn’t going to charge a hefty price. I asked how does 200 sound for the 2 to 3 hours i was going to be there? They said that’s fine. \n\nAnyways the day of the event came, I got my gear and drove there, spent a good minute trying to find my friend. When I finally found her she said she’ll look for her boss to tell her I arrived. I Sat in a room for about 30 minutes waiting for her. \nWhen she came back, she said her boss told her they didn’t have enough money in their budget to pay me the 200. I wasn’t pissed, but I was irritated that I had taken the time to get my stuff and drive all the way there when they could’ve told me ahead of time. I said  okay tell your boss that I’ll have to charge a $100 cancellation fee for making me come all the way there and not telling me that I wasn’t gonna work. Her boss agreed to it. Told me to leave my name, address and info to mail me a check. To this day I still didn’t get the check. I decided to let it go. \n\nFast forward to today when the same friend texts me and says “hey lol I don’t want to make any promises to you about getting paid so can I just borrow your camera for my class on Friday?” \n\nI really don’t want to let her borrow it but I’m the type of person who always feels guilty if I say no. Would I be the asshole if I flat out say no? ",

      "description": "I recently got my car serviced at the dealership and received an email to leave a review. I gave 4/5 stars. My reasoning for the 4 stars was that the diagnosis was accurate and the service was good. However, I took off one star because in the time I was waiting, I had to use the restroom urgently, but couldn't find a mens room. There was only a womans restroom and an occupied all-gender restroom, so I ended up waiting ~20 min for someone to come out of the all-gender restroom. In the review I also left a comment where I suggested they make both restrooms all-gender rather than eliminating the men's room. I later received a condescending email from the GM of the dealership apologizing for me \"being offended by change\" and that he grew up in an era where men were courteous to women and that was his thought process when implementing the law required all-gender restroom. He also sent me a link to edit my review and basically told me that I could change the review if I wanted to, so I went back and changed it from 4/5 to 3/5 and also added that the GM was condescending. Was I an asshole to do that?",

      "description": "Background: I'm part of a decently-sized friend group made up of an about equal number of girls and guys (including myself 5F 4M). I recently (a month and a half ago) started dating this guy and he's been a great bf. He's friends with the guys in our group so two weeks after I started dating him I invited him to come along to an event. My friends all seemed to enjoy having him there so whenever we go do something together, I invite him. Over the past week and a half I've noticed my friends are flirting a LOT with him and he's is apparently enjoying it and doing nothing to stop them. Yesterday we went to a restaurant and the flirting would just not stop and he barely talked to me. After we ate I asked him if we could speak privately. We went outside and I told him I didn't like the way he was encouraging the flirting and told him I didn't want him to come to any more events for the time being. He told me that it wasn't him doing the majority of the flirting and that he was very sorry for barely talking to me but that it was unfair for him to be held to a double standard because the guys in my friend group flirt with me a lot too. I told him that we've been friends for years and that it's not the same as him flirting with people he recently met. After this I told my friends that I didn't like how much he'd been flirting with them so he wouldn't be coming to anymore events and all of them (including the guys) started telling me that I'm an asshole. \n\nSo, AITA for no longer inviting my BF to events?",

      "description": "A little bit of background - my parents bought our current car the year I turned 16 with the intention of giving it to me when I learned to drive. 9 years on, I’m finally actually taking lessons, financial situation has changed and they can no longer afford to replace the car, so it will not become mine. I knew this going in. \n\nI’m taking lessons now because my job requires a driving licence. My boss liked me enough to bend the rules a little and hire me on a learner’s licence, with the agreement that I started taking lessons. \nI’ve also been informed that this isn’t the same everywhere, so to add: in the UK, a learner driver can drive a car if they are insured on it under the supervision of an adult over 21 who has held a full driving licence for over 3 years. \n\nNow to the point. \n\nTwo lessons in, my instructor deems me ready to go out on the roads, so I talk to my parents about getting insured on our car so I can practise in it. I of course offer to pay whatever extra it adds on to the price they pay now. \n\nDad refuses to even consider it. He’s dismissed it out of hand as “too expensive” without even finding out how much it would be and completely ignoring all my offers to pay for it... so I’m now in the position where I’m going to have to pay hundreds of pounds more than necessary and take months longer than I needed to to get my licence because the only time I’m going to be able to get behind the wheel is when I’m paying for an instructor’s time, which would be maybe two hours a week if I’m lucky enough for my instructor to always have a free slot every week on a time and day I can do. \n\nI can’t afford to buy a car at the moment. I can’t lease one until I have my full licence. To Mum and I, it was never even a question that I’d be able to use our car when I started learning. Everyone else I know was able to learn in their parents’ car if there was one and they lived at home. I also don’t know if this dragging things out could potentially cause issues with my job, since other people are currently having to cover the driving responsibilities that should be mine. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling like I was entitled to use the car in the first place, or is it fair for me to be upset in this situation, when it was always implied before that I would be able to use it when this happened?",

      "description": "So as some background, I knew my fiancée was unvaccinated before proposing. Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, “overloading the baby’s little body”. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she’s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She’s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can’t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she’s somehow positive for it. (She’s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I’m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I’m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn’t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I’m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe’s up in arms about this now saying how I’m being manipulative and abusive because I’m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she’s not. \n\nI don’t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it’s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she’s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she’s said how it’s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I’ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I’m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don’t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She’s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I’m comfortable with. I can’t go further than that. And now she’s upset that I’m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fiancée thinks vaccines are a hoax and don’t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. ",

      "description": "I cut ties with my parents back in 2015 because I met my boyfriend, who I am still with, and realized how horrible enabled I was. My parents are life long cigarette smokers and drinkers. My dad especially. They allowed my to become an addicted smoker from age 16. I missed out on many opportunities because of it. \n\nI always had a special connection with my dad. He taught me about music and history and how to think level headedly. He was always so forgiving and caring and loved unconditionally but he was a complete alcoholic and coward when it came to my mom. \n\nMy mother, is a complete narcissist and wack job. Life was awesome until she quit taking her xanax in 2013 and told NONE OF US. So we we're just left to deal with her mental abuse. She would \"ground\" me, well after age 18, so she could keep control over me. She attempted to make me quit several jobs. I had to sleep in the car that I owned because she would try to take my keys from me to prevent me from going to work. My dad was called a lazy POS everyday even though he contributed 50% to the household. One night, I was already preparing to move out with my boyfriend, She thought it was time to informed me (drunk as a skunk and with a huge smile) that she was having an affair with her boss. The man she had been calling a \"creep\" for over 2 years. My dad and I have had a history of getting into bad fights over my mother's behavior. He just won't stop defending her actions. And he wont let me confront her, without a fight. \n\nSo I just left. No fight, nothing. I left and cut off every form of communication. I also cut off my grandmother because she would turn around and tell my parents everything I was up to.  I still don't know if my dad knows about the affair but that's was the straw that broke the camel's back. I still don't care if my mom dies tomorrow, she's a fucking cunt and a whore for doing that to the only person that has ever loved her unconditionally. And the fact that she behaved like she was holier than thou towards us at home, and doing that with her boss. Fuck that bitch, I hope she rots. \n\nI'm very torn right now, because of my relationship with my dad I don't think I could live with the regret of never speaking to him again. His drinking became worse after I left. I refuse to blame myself for that. I recieved a message from an online account I can only assume she set up for him (my dad's old school, he'd never open a facebook if he even knew how) that informed me he has congestive heart failure (shocker) and is in the hospital But that women is going to be involved in everything I try to do involving him and make everything about her. And I don't want his last memory to be of me verbally shoving my foot up his wife's ass. Especially if he doesn't know. Im also not interested in a relationship if he makes it through. I just don't know what to do and I feel horrible. The rest of my family is just as bad as my mother and don't care whether he lives or dies. \n\nIf you read all of this, bless you. This is all I have to go to. \n\nTL;DR : Cut ties with both parents because mother is a psychotic adulturous whore and dad is alcoholic fool. Had special relationship with Dad and wants to see him but knows adulturous whore will make it all about her.\nTorn to pieces. ",

      "description": "A week ago, I was in another city getting a prescription at Walgreens. I waited for a few people, and eventually I was at the front of the line. A woman with a walker comes up behind me. I'm guessing she's 85-90. Then, another older woman (maybe 70) comes up behind her. The latest woman in the line loudly announces that the other woman should go to the drop off to get her refills faster because \"SOME PEOPLE\" don't let \"PEOPLE LIKE THEM\" through the line. She said she usually can get her prescriptions faster that way.\nI ignored the whole interaction, and watched the pharmacist get flustered when she tried to fill at the wrong window. I chalked the whole thing up to a different culture, and assumed I was an asshole in that context (the area was near the Mexican border, whereas I'm in a super white Midwest suburb).\n\nToday, in my hometown, a similar incident occurred. I was in line at Walgreens, and a 70-ish woman asked if I was in line. I told her I was. She sighed loudly and pushed her cart NEXT to me in the line. When I got called up, she acted like she was going to go ahead of me. I glared at her, and continued to the window.\n\nIs this some kind of obvious etiquette? AITA? I honestly worry that I'd never get out of Walgreens if I let every old person ahead of me, but maybe that's the normal thing to do? ",

      "description": "Throwaway account\n\nI'm in college, but I still live at home with my parents and my two brothers, the youngest of which has autism. He can't speak, but he was an okay kid until puberty hit him. Now he's gotten more aggressive, yelling and screaming and putting holes in the wall of his bedroom. Therapy and medication isn't helping, and I can't stand the yelling. I tried to be patient with him and ignore him but he pushes me so far that I start screaming back at him. It's gotten so bad that I had to start wearing earplugs whenever I go downstairs, and I spend most of my free time in my room. Sometimes, when my parents aren't home, he targets me specifically for no apparent reason and screams up the staircase to my room until I either lose it and start screaming back or I go to my car and leave. Last time it happened, I just locked myself in the bathroom and cried. Despite my parents being in the same boat and arguably have it worse than me because they're responsible for him, they obviously don't know how to help me as their advice to me either boils down to \"ignore him\" (which never works) or \"calm down\" (which upsets me more). My brother shows no signs of improving and I doubt he'll ever talk at this point. It's gotten to where I can't stand living with him and want to leave home. My mom picked up on this and started crying to me about how she doesn't want me to leave because of my brother and that I would be throwing away the rest of my childhood if I do because then I'll have to step into the adult world. I broke down in front of her and told her I wouldn't leave but I felt manipulated afterwards and was angry because she wasn't taking my feelings into account. Now I'm calling those feelings into question. Maybe she wasn't trying to manipulate me and just wants the best for me. But on the otherhand, I feel like my childhood is already gone. Am I selfish for wanting to leave?",

      "description": "This happened a while ago, but I was just reminded of it when reading posts from this sub and it's a situation I've never really been able to figure out.  \n\nSome context/backstory: I had a really good friend (in hindsight, maybe not the best of friends) in elementary school I met in third grade. We were both really goofy and got along well.  My friend had a rabbit called Boingo. At the beginning of 5th grade, her family was going on a trip to Hawaii and needed someone to babysit their rabbit, so they asked our family and we accepted.  So for two weeks we took care of the rabbit, which was super fun. She and her family were really thankful.\n\nA little bit further into the year, she brought Boingo to our class for a visit, because elementary kids love rabbits. It was a pretty big hit.\n\nNow the actual event.  At the end of the year, our teacher organized a big party for the last full day of school.  One of the things we were going to do was a bingo game where all the things on our boards were our favorite events from the year.  We spent the day before coming up with ideas, and of course Boingo's visit was one of them.  There were a lot of choices to put on our board and I didn't really want to decide (we made our own boards), so I just went down the list on the whiteboard and put every other one on my board.  In the process, I missed Boingo. \n\nSo we play our bingo game and our teacher calls out Boingo.  My friend was sitting next to me and noticed I don't mark anything, and gets really upset.    She starts saying things like \"How could you forget Boingo?!\", \"You babysat him!\" and \"You should have put Boingo on your board!\". I realized I may have made a mistake and profusely apologized, and tried to explain how I chose what to put on my board, so it was an accident.  But she wouldn't even hear it.  She blamed me personally for not putting Boingo.  \n\nThere's two things I remember about this.  One is I became so upset I started crying, but she didn't even care.  The second is what she said after I kept trying to tell her it was an accident. \"You should know not to argue with a girl, because they'll always be right\"\n\nTo this day, she made me feel like such an asshole for not remembering something significant to me and her, even though I feel it was just an accident and shouldn't have been a big deal.  Never been sure what to think about it.",

      "description": "I started going to art school about half a year ago and after a couple months of talking to people and trying to make friends, I met this guy who I thought was super attractive, funny, and we shared a lot of common interests. He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there’s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn’t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes “oh yeah...” That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don’t want to sound offensive but I’m strictly straight. I’m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would’ve told me a long time ago about it, I would’ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don’t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it’s just not what I’m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don’t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I’m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I’m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? ",

      "description": "I want to start this post by saying that there are no potential assholes in this story other than me. Also on mobile. \n\nI work at a large university as staff, who employs students on a part-time basis to assist with or duties. We generally keep students around for their entire time at the university, and become friendly, though not overly so, imo. Sometimes in the course of work, shifts run quite late, and I’ll offer a ride to a student knowing the buses have stopped running or won’t come for hours. I do this for all students that do not have a car or a ride, man or woman. \n\nThe other night, I offered a student a ride home, which she gratefully accepted. I took her home without incident, but I don’t leave until they’ve gotten in the door, just to be sure they’re safely inside since I’ve taken on the responsibility of getting them home. This night, she did not leave her keys, and could not get inside. They turned out to be states away in her boyfriend’s car (spring break). I let her use my phone, and we went back to campus so she could use my computer to get in touch with her mom and try to figure some stuff out. \n\nTalk of a locksmith and hotels comes up, all I can see is dollar signs,and I was about to offer my spare room of my house. I don’t believe either of us would have perceived it as creepy; I’m a married woman about ten years her senior. I stopped short, though, as I thought about the professional line I’d be blurring and the doors it would be opening for the future. (I have been told in personal and professional settings that I am “helpful and friendly...sometimes to your detriment” lol)\n\nShe ended up being able to find a room with a friend for the night, so none of this ended up being an issue. However I still find myself feeling a little guilty that I didn’t offer another no-cost option to this college student, knowing money’s tight during that time of life. \n\nWas my hesitancy selfish?

He also sexually harassed one of my close friends and a bunch of other girls, and he tried to fight just about everyone in the locker room (he was banned from it over this) eventually he had to be monitored by the school cop, which he hated. He jumped from the top of the bleachers once just to escape. I found out he was almost arrested for beating a small kid into a brick wall. I found out in my senior year he was expelled and arrested for trying to kill his mom and sister.\n\nI understand that no one asks to be born, and no one ever asks to be mentally disabled, but the things he’s done can’t be over looked.

      "description": "On my phone. Sorry for the formatting. \nFirst time posting here - long time lurker :)\n\nMy family has a social event this weekend in another town. It’s a 2 hour car drive from our city - which admittedly isn’t much, but my father is usually the one who drives and he always gets exhausted after these kind of trips - he’s quitting smoking and his body is aching all over, plus he’s not that young (55yo). \n\nAnyway, the event is on Saturday and my dad told my mom that he wants to go Friday night because he’d rather be well rested for the day of the event. My mother agreed - she’ll be there already, she goes tomorrow because she teaches in the University there - so my dad will be driving my sister and my two aunts (mother’s sister and mother’s aunt). Let’s call them Aunt 1 and Aunt 2. \n\nAnd here comes the problem... Aunt 1 (mom’s sister) wants to go Saturday - and around 11o’clock, despite my dad also saying that, if they had to go Saturday, he wanted to leave at 9 am at the latest. Mom still didn’t tell Aunt 1 that they’re actually going Friday night, and since mom travels tomorrow, she’ll likely not tell and leave the issue to my dad. Aunt 1 is struggling with depression (she was on antidepressives until last year, quit taking them for reasons we don’t know and only now resumed taking them) but she’s frankly been a nightmare lately. If anything doesn’t go her way she throws a tantrum and raises her voice and gets kinda mean. Because of that everyone’s afraid of telling her the “we’re going Friday” thing. \n\nI was keeping to myself - I’m not going, so I figured it’s none of my business. But now Aunt 1 is telling Aunt 2 that they’re going Saturday around 11am, which isn’t true at all since nobody told her that - she just assumed that, since that’s when she wants to go, that’s when they’ll go. I want to just tell her the truth already because it’s not fair to my dad, but I’m afraid that this isn’t my place. \n\nWibta if I didn’t wait for my mother and just told Aunt 1 that they are not going Saturday, much less at 11am?

      "description": "Ok there's a lot to digress here, so bear with me.\n\nMy 2nd language is Japanese, I speak it at home and been to Japan multiple times. \n\nI've expressed to my boyfriend many, many times that I've wanted us to go to Japan together, because it is like my second culture and I would love for us to experience it together. While he didn't express too much interest in Japanese culture, he said he would also love for us to go to Japan together soon and would want to travel abroad for a new experience.\n\nLast November, I went to Japan for a short vacation and for family reasons, also for my late brother's funeral. Initially my boyfriend was very excited and was planning to come with me, but we went through a hardship and he grew increasingly hesitant, then decided he would not be able to come with me. He also decided the funeral would be too much for him. I was heartbroken and this was a huge event in my life that I wish he could've accompanied me with. I tried to put myself in his shoes and realized that he would not want to go through such a thing but it still hurt because I wish he was with me at my side and wanted his support.\n\nFast forward months later, a few weeks ago he was telling me that he wanted to travel alone to another country, to better his mental health and to discover new things about himself. I was completely on board with it and encouraged him to do so. \n\nHe then informs me yesterday that instead of traveling alone, he was going to go to Japan with his friend. His friend loves Japanese culture and is planning to go to Japan in May, and my boyfriend said he would tag along. He then asked if I would be mad at him for doing so. While I wasn't mad, I was incredibly hurt that this was so spontaneous and that I felt like he didn't consider that I would've wanted to go with him. \n\nHe then said that he was surprised I wasn't on board with him going to Japan right away and that he wished I could come with him, but he was sorry I couldn't. And that made me feel even more sad. I said it's completely fine if he goes to Japan, as he can make his own decisions, but I was still a little hurt that I felt like he didn't consider I've always wanted to go with him. And that I felt he didn't want to go with me. And then we got into an argument about this whole mess.\n\n\nAITA for being hurt that my bf would rather go to Japan with his friend instead?",

      "description": "So my best mate recently started seeing this girl.\n\n\nFor context, both me and my friend have been making music since we could walk and it's something she is really interested in getting into. Knowing this, my buddy had the bright idea of having a little production session at my place yesterday where we would make a track together.\n\n\nThe previous evening they told me they were coming around to my place at noon. Noon rolls around and I ask my buddy where he is, to which I get no reply (as is quite common for him). So I think \"fuck it\" I can probably just lay down some drums and a bass and by the time they get here we will have something to work with. \n\n\nAbout an hour later I get a response from my friend saying \"we're visiting people, we'll probably be there after 5:00\". I'm a pretty easy going guy, so I'm like \"yeah no worries, just get here when you get here\".\n\n\n5:00pm rolls around and I send my buddy another message to which he replies at about 6:00 with \"I'll message you when we're going to your place\". At this point I'd basically written half the song out of boredom and I'm no time freak but this was starting to tick me off a bit. At some point I also invited one of my other mates over to my place with the intention of all of us going out later. \n\n\nThey end up arriving at 9:30pm after more cryptic vague messages.\n\n\nMy buddy's lass doesn't have any music production experience, but because she was drunk she was bombastically telling me what I should be doing and how the track should sound. I'm totally fine with working with someone that doesn't know what they're talking about but I just got the sense she was being a little rude about it.\n\n\nRemember the other friend from earlier. He rocks up and my best friends lass starts talking to him. Now, he's a chef, and she's a vegan, you can probably see where this is going...\n\n\nLong story short they got into a slightly heated discussion about veganism which my other buddy was trying his best to back out of, but I was a little pissed off at the attitude of someone I've never met coming into my house, drinking my beer and telling me how to use my music stuff AND shoving her beliefs down our throats. \n\n\nShe said \"if you want to eat meat you should have to kill the animal every single time\" to which I responded with \"so I guess that means you should have to harvest every plant that you consume as well\", to which she responded with \"no that's not the same thing\".\n\n\nI politely debated with this girl for a bit before she stormed off in a huff and locked herself in my own bathroom. I ended up leaving for the clubs with my other friend and that was that.\n\n\nI messaged my friend today asking if his lass was ok, he said \"she's fine, she thought you were a decent dude but you were a bit insensitive and now she doesn't trust you\".\n\n\nAm I the asshole here guys?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting, in mobile. Throw away. I keep on having these guilty feelings I need to ask some people about.\n\n\nSo I had been dating this girl for almost 2 years, we were both 20, young and in love, living in a small one bedroom apartment. We both went on to be diagnosed with depression after the incident and some other earth shattering events. But to the story at hand.\n\n\nWe were in one of those big relationship defining fights. Those fights that last for awhile and emotions come out so raw that our immature minds couldn’t properly comprehend all of it. The crux of it was simple. She was contemplating opening up our relationship so she could “sow her wild oats” in college. I’m as new age as they come but I had a problem with it and wanted to stay a monogamous couple. \n\n\nThe fight progressed and in the end she wanted to take it all back. I couldn’t accept that, I needed to cool off, it felt like my entire world was spinning so I went into the other room to breathe. (It’s a one room apartment so I couldn’t go anywhere). While in the living room I heard the door to the bathroom slam. I heard her yelling about how she doesn’t want to live. I ran to the bathroom door scared.\n\n\nI heard her frantically searching and slamming through the drawers. I heard a loud crack and a cry. Then it repeated, and repeated.\n\n\nThroughout this time I was saying her name asking her to open the door and to stop. The bang and whimpers continued until I backed up and ran into the bathroom door. The door frame was weak and buckled allowing me in (we had a really cheap apartment, think projects level). When the door swing open I saw her hit her head on the wall again.\n\n\nI immediately grabbed her, wrapped her in a weird bear hug type deal and brought her to the bed in the other room. There she laid next to me and cried for awhile. My head was still spinning but I knew I had to do something. I remembered that 9/11 in our area allowed texting. While she was laying down sobbing I quickly texted 9/11 our location, the situation and to please hurry.\n\n\nMy rational at the time was that she just seriously attempted to hurt herself. As selfish as it sounds I was nowhere near capable of handling the situation alone.\n\n\nThe police came, they talked to us apart. Took us in squad cars to a local hospital where she was admitted to a psych ward after a review. \n\n\nAfter talking to my friends on the matter I was told that I may have handled this wrong. I was informed of the terrible realities of inpatient care. As well as the stress it puts on a person going through a bad times. I feel like shit for hurting her.\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR:\nGirlfriend and I had a big fight over the state of our relationship. She locked herself in the bathroom and hurt herself. I broke in the bathroom and stopped her. Contacted the police and she ended up in inpatient care. \n\n",

      "description": "In my school, every year they organize a ball/prom. Prior to the event, people can nominate themselves to be the king or the queen of the year. Everyone can vote for their king and their queen.\n\nLast year, a gay boy applied to be the queen. And he won the popular vote. He became the queen. It was a very cringy situation because the boy who won King is a straight male and he was made to be coupled with a gay male. I think the King was not happy with that \"Queen\".\n\nI don't like the fact that a boy becoming a queen at all. He's not transgender. He's a gay boy. Before you get crazy and scold at me, I know what people say. I should respect the LGBT community. I do. I am very open to the idea of gay couple and gay marriage. I'd much agree if there were two gay Kings, or two gay Queens. Completely okay with it. But I feel like it is not true to call a gay boy \"Queen\" and assign him to a straight King. If the organizers are to select a king and a queen, they should be straight male and female. I think, the organizers are trying so hard to prove that they have an open mind and also to draw attention from the public.\n\nLike, in real life, one does not question a gay couple \"which one of you is the wife/husband?\" Right? Two men -- two boyfriends/husbands/fathers. Two women -- two girlfriends/wives/mothers.\n\nNote that I did not do anything to show my opposing idea. I'm pretty much introvert and prefer keeping thoughts to myself. However, I need your judgment. AITA for thinking like that?",

      "description": "So, recently my father passed away. He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "I live in a 50 unit suburban condominium complex, with a mix of owners and renters. I own my condo. Each unit has 1 assigned parking spot, which is under a metal carport-type roof and marked with the unit number. We also have a ton of open parking throughout the complex, none of which is covered. I've lived here 6 months and there are always lots of open parking spots.\n\nI am disabled and don't drive, so my assigned spot doesn't ever have a car parked in it. I rarely have people visit me, so I truly don't need my parking space for any practical reason.\n\nSometimes people will pull into my spot briefly, waiting for a friend etc., and I don't mind that. Sometimes people park in my spot for an hour or so, which I find mildly irritating, but understandable, especially if it's raining or really hot weather. But there's a car in my spot right now that's been there overnight, and it's now afternoon. The weather is cold (30°F lows) but clear and dry.\n\nI'm irritated by this car being in my spot, not because I need the spot, but because I think it's rude for someone to park there for 12+ hours without asking me if it's okay. \n\nI'm not planning to do anything about it right now, because I realize I'm irritated about something that has zero actual impact on me, but I want to know if I'm TA for not wanting anyone to park there even though I'm not using the space.",

      "description": "Hey everybody, I’m back. \n\nLink to my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/av4172/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_look_after_my/?st=JSNG69DN&amp;sh=88a70b87\n\nTLDR for the last post; I (44M) live with my girlfriend (32F) and my two boys, 8 and 14. My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn’t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn’t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I’ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I’ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother’s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I’m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I’m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole?

      "description": "My dad was abusive towards my whole family. My mom tried to leave him when I was very young but went back to him because he started winning the custody battle over me. For this reason, I think my mom resents me as the reason she was stuck with an abusive man.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my dad would abuse me and my mom would tell me it was my fault for not making a bigger effort to get along with him and obey him. I grew up thinking I was a bad person, because of this and because she was often irrationally cold and angry with me in a way she wasn’t to my siblings. When I was a teenager, I had some major health problems that made it hard for me to take care of myself. My mom was constantly angry and cruel to me during that 3 year period. I ended up in an abusive relationship with someone who raped me, and I couldn’t tell my mom about it because she was more interested in yelling at me for “having bad judgment” for dating this person. I moved out after being kicked out of the house temporarily. \n\nAfter I moved my dad turned some of his abuse on my younger brother, who I have always felt my mom favored over my sister and I. He threatened to kick my brother out of the house, so my mom left him. My dad made the divorce very difficult for her, going on a meth bender and losing his job (she had been a stay at home mom for years) so she would have to lose her house and alimony. My mom has understandably been a wreck since.\n\nI recently confronted my mom about the way she’s always treated me, since she asked if I was angry at her and I felt I owed her the truth. She told me that she felt trapped, that staying with her abuser was hard for her but she did it so we wouldn’t end up homeless, and that she always took his side because he would treat her worse if he thought she was undermining him in front of the kid (me). She said she was cruel to me for years because she was under a lot of stress - her brother committed suicide, her mom for Alzheimer’s and she had to fight her mom’s husband’s family over her care, and she lost her support system (she had previously homeschooled my siblings and I and now she didn’t so didn’t see the same moms). She said her hand was forced to leave my dad because he wanted to kick my brother out of the house, and she would’ve done the same if he tried to kick me out (she doesn’t remember that SHE kicked me out because she was on drugs at the time and is in denial). She says she just wants a closer relationship since I’m mentally ill and she’s worried about me.\n\nAITA for still being mad at her? I honestly feel she could’ve done more and is in denial about her real reasons for leaving. She claims to hate my dad but still keeps in contact with him despite him being a meth addict and trying to throw my sister off the side of the highway the last time any of us saw him. Even if she is being honest, I would rather have been homeless than lived with my dad. And this is petty, but I’m also mad that she’s sad about her brother. He molested me when I was young. She doesn’t know that but she does know that he was a convicted pedophile and was always alone with me so I can’t imagine she doesn’t suspect it. I still love her but I just don’t forgive her at all.",

      "description": "This happened today. Obligatory I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting.\n\nSo, I go to a public charter high school. This is important because we only have about 100 students, so we don't get a lot of state funding. Because we don't get a lot of funding, when things break, they tend to stay that way for a while before (hopefully) getting fixed.\n\nIt's been really cold here in Texas as of late, and we had a couple days where it didn't get out of the low 30°s. Now, normally this wouldn't be a big deal because I spend my whole day inside, *except* the heating isn't working! It was out Monday and yesterday and still today, it's not working. So corporate told the principal to get some space heaters and use those until things get fixed. Problem solved, right? Wrong. My school is one big open room with the desks in the middle area, which means the power outlets aren't a reasonable distance from where we work. So, they got extension cords for the space heaters so they could be closer to us.\n\nOne of the teachers mentioned that if two are plugged in, only one will work. So I went to check the wattage of the heaters and saw in big bold letters \"Warning: always plug heaters into a wall outlet. Do not use with extension cords or power strips.\" Or something to that effect. So, not wanting anything to short circuit and start a fire, I unplugged them. \n\nA girl that sits near me walked in and asked about the heaters, I said that we can't use them because they'll short circuit and start a fire if used with a power strip, and, would you rather be dead or a little chilly? I thought it was perfectly reasonable. But apparently she and another kid who sits near me thought it was very annoying. \"You don't need to explain everything and act like you're better than us.\" I was confused about why she said that and she and the other kid started explaining how I'm \"annoying\" and \"entitled.\" I got embarrassed and flustered trying to defend myself but they just kept going.\n\n\nTL;DR I explained to someone how space heaters will short circuit if used in a power strip, and she and another kid started saying I was annoying and entitled and acted like I was better than everyone. \n\nSide note: I have social pragmatic communication disorder, here's a [link ](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/social-pragmatic-communication-disorder/) explaining what that is.",

      "description": "Background: \n\nMy grandma is very independent and lived by herself doing everything on her own - travelling, staying alone. She was poor and worked hard to save every penny. In fact, today, she had pre-paid for her own funeral and cemetery plot.\n\nShe has two sons - my dad and my uncle. Growing up, the grandchildren, we (some of us) were close to my Grandmother during her weekly visits. Up till we were around 12-15yrs old. But then we all grew up and did our own thing - being usual asshole teens/young adults. My parents, they were not exactly what you would call filial. My mum would complain about my Grandmother being naggy or slow or troublesome. My dad wouldn’t / couldn’t stand up for his own mum. I think my parents are receiving the taste of their own medicine because we are also demonstrating some form of non-filialness towards them one way or another now.\n\nBack to my grandma. In the past 4-5 years, as she became incapable of caring for herself, she was bounced from one nursing home to another nursing home. I never understood why my parents or my uncle’s side could not get hired help and accommodate her at home. All the grandchildren were adults and living away from home, some overseas, myself included. So there was definitely space at home and they just had to do the necessary old person’s renovations. But no one bothered. \n\nFast forward to today:\nMy grandmother’s funeral. My elder two siblings who never were that close to her, cried their eyeballs out and proclaimed that they were. They never saw her much / did anything for her - neither did I. My mum cried like it was her own Mother who died. My dad did too but in the last one year he did show some form of filial piety towards her (he regretted for not having a close relationship with her either due to personal reasons or because my mum is controlling of him like that).\n\nSo am i the asshole, for judging my siblings and mum for bawling their eyes out when they barely did anything / cared for her / even spoke to her much when she was alive? Am I the asshole for judging my siblings, especially one of my sister who is the most unfilial towards my mum, for now crying so much at my grandmother’s grave when she can do better/differently towards her living mother?\nAm I also the asshole for not shedding much tears when I was considered one of the closest to my grandmother when I was younger?\n\nTLDR: No one cared for my grandmother when she was alive, but all cried during her funeral. Am I an asshole for judging them?\n\n\n",

      "description": "About a week ago, my husband and I heard some loud paddling noises and screaming from our next door neighbors followed by 2 young girls running outside crying. We regularly hear tons of yelling from their apartment (from mom and kids) but can never distinguish if it's just kids yelling because they're kids, or yelling because they're in distress. We had already told ourselves if there was ever any sign they might be getting hurt by their mom we'd report it, so when all that happened, we called. \n\nWe've never really met the family before, mostly because they seem pretty reserved. We reached out when they moved in but they didn't seem interested. Then, I think the mom thinks we ratted them out for having a dog against their lease (it barks all day so I'm sure one of the other neighbors reported them) and seemingly retaliated by making multiple false reports that our dog had been barking and attempting to get us in trouble with management. The reason I mention all this is because it seems clear the mom already doesn't think of us fondly.  She seems very hostile to her own children based on her constant yelling and swearing so we didn't talk to her before calling CPS in order to avoid any problems between us and her as neighbors. \n\nThe case worker followed up with me today noting there were no signs of abuse and told me a bit about how she's a single mom trying to make things work and is very upset by the whole scenario. So now, I just feel really terrible about reporting her when I could have just walked 3 steps out my front door and asked her what's going on. At the same time, I'm fairly convinced the conversation would have escalated and if we did call after that, she'd know who to blame. But then again, I've hardly met her...so am I an asshole? ",

      "description": "So basically, I'll keep this as short and basic as possible. My friend, Y, is an AMAZING artist. She has outstanding talent and I'm very proud of her, and I do my best to support her as much as I can. But here's the problem. She's extremely depressing, and can be very.....oblivious when it comes to observing people's moods. \n\n Just yesterday, at our club, it was pretty obvious that our president and her bf were having an issue, as she was crying and her boyfriend was holding her. Y took this to say, \"Ooh look at the couple, couple of the yeeeaarrr\" which caused our president to snap and say \"Fuck off. Really. Fuck off\" Y was a bit taken aback and apologized several times. That's fine and all, and I ordered the president to take her issues outside. However, Y decided to explain the situation, repetitively, to people who had no business knowing about the issue. I told her to stop talking about it because it was over and no one else needed to know about it. She kept asking why after I specifically told her. \n\nIn a few more events, she says extremely depressing shit all day everyday, makes inappropriate and uncomfortable jokes all the time, especially when I'm eating, and constantly puts herself down even when a whole bunch of people tell her the complete opposite. \n\nNow I know I can be strong with my words, and I don't like to hurt others said words, but I couldn't hold it anymore. I told her that 1. She needs to stop talking about shit that makes others uncomfortable, ESPECIALLY when it's a very sensitive or heavy subject to the other. 2. She needs to stop being so depressing because she will never get any pity from me, due to the fact that she does it way too much. And 3. To stop making excessive dirty jokes that makes everyone uncomfortable. \n\nShe looked extremely hurt about it and fell silent. I felt pretty guilty after saying that, because I don't like seeing her get hurt. So inform me. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hey guys, here's the issue.\nSo a few months ago, my friend and my other friend got into a big fight, we'll call them James and Tim. Long story short, they aren't speaking, and the argument ended with both parties feeling that the other person was \"the toxic one\". I've been friends with both of these guys for over ten years, and I had no intention of stopping being friends with either of them, but recently James has been putting me more and more in the middle of things. He constantly talks to me about what a horrible person Tim is and how awful he treats people. I get pretty tired of hearing it all, and Tim knows James' saying things like this to me, but he doesnt really care at this point. Tim has always been more of the level headed one, and he has no intention of talking to me about James or trying to change my opinion of him. James, on the other hand, just can't accept the fact that I remain friends with Tim. He stepped it up and now gets furious at me, asking \"How can you be be friends with Tim after he treated me so badly? Do you not see the way he treats me?\" I get that Tim was mean to James, but James acts like he is completely innocent. It takes two to argue, and when he brings up Tim's horrible treatment, I tell him that he also treated Tim horribly, and that he's not the victim. He views this as me attempting to \"Justify James' horrible actions\" and gets even angrier. Fast forward to three weeks ago. James messaged Tim, and he was attempting to get an apology out of him. This lead to a huge blowout, with many more insults flung from both parties. Right after the argument, James texts me and tells me that he can't be friends with anyone who is friends with Tim, including me. \"It's either me or him\". Of course, I didn't stand for this. I told him off, angrily telling him he has no right to choose who I'm friends with. I also told him I don't want to stop being friends with either of them, and that if he wants to stop being friends with me, it's his own choice. He's acted very different since then, and I feel a bit bad. Am I the asshole in this situation?",

My boyfriend was raised in SoCal by free range parents. \nI have been taught my whole life to respect my elders, mind my manners, and to know what to say/do in front of whom.\nSo I get along easily with people, and things generally go ok for me because I have this blind respect for authority that is expected from a young adult. On top of that I’m very conscious of my audience and I try my best to adjust how I act and what I say so I don’t offend people or anything. I know it’s a little silly but it’s just how I was raised.\nNow my boyfriend on the other hand, he treats everyone that he meets like they’re best friends. No blind respect, no boundaries, no filter, just equality. He doesn’t care who sees how he acts because he knows the people who matter know who he is and love him. But he keeps getting in trouble for his mouth, because he’s too comfortable in front of the wrong people. \nAnd I am trying to teach him that communication is everything, but he thinks I’m inhibiting who he is. That changing how he talks to certain people takes away a part of his identity, like he’s pretending to be someone he isn’t. \nI feel like an asshole because I don’t want to change him, or make him feel like he doesn’t belong.

      "description": "So, I work at a clothing store and there is one employee that has smelled bad for the past 4 years. It's not like 'oops I forgot to wear deodorant' stink but a 'juice that collects on the bottom of a dumpster' stink. I honestly can't tell where the smell could be coming from but it is really bad. If she gets up from a chair the chair will smell just like her and any room she goes in smells absolutely terrible because of her. Every night we have to febreze the store because she stinks up the whole store. I've met her mom and dad before and they both smell perfectly fine.\n\nI brought it up to my manager who said she had already talked to her 3 times previous because herself and other employees had a problem with her smell but she would speak with her again. My manager then spoke with this girl and I felt terrible because she came out of the office crying and left early. The next day she came back and she had no smell whatsoever. My manager said next time someone mentions the smell she will be going to corporate to speak about firing this girl or giving her some type of class on hygiene. Both of which would be embarrassing. Anyway, she smelled perfectly fine but this lasted for a week.\n\nFast forward to today, she smelled so bad that me and some other employees could not even stand to be in the same room as her. A customer came up and told me we need to wash the clothes because they smelled terrible but I know the customer was just smelling the girl she was standing next to. I plan on going and talking to my manager on tomorrow about calling corporate because it's gotten so bad. I feel bad because the girl is very nice but I literally can't even go near her because she smells so bad. I can't even understand how someone can handle smelling that bad. I don't feel like it should be my job to tell a 25 year old woman that she needs to practice personal hygiene. \n\n\nAITA for getting corporate called on my coworker?\n\n\n\n       ",

      "description": "I've only been with the organization a little over a year, but I've started to gain a reputation for being willing to take on the projects nobody wants and being able to turn them around in a time much quicker than what they would anticipate (underpromise, overdeliver). \n\nThis is largely because the previous company I worked for, I'd have to turn around large projects in 2-6 weeks where projects of smaller size at my current role I have 10-12 months to turn around. I just never adjusted my pace when I left.\n\nIn any event, I got assigned as a secondary on a project with a coworker in a different region (we report to different people, but ultimately all within the same overreaching sub-organization) and she was supposed to be the lead on it and we were given 4 months to complete this project. She's been with the organization about 8 years. \n\nBasically the project was 200 items that we had to figure out the status of, get approval to update a couple of pieces of information on, and then submit for an update. So we split the list in half straight down the middle.\n\nThen she immediately went on vacation and then just kind of vanished due to illness for a couple of weeks, leaving me on my own.\n\nSo I went to work on it and I completed my half of the list in a couple of weeks and since she was MIA, I started working on her part of the list too. Once she finally got back, I had gotten through about 70% of the list and we divided it in half again.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks, I've completed the half that was given to me and her status update list hasn't really moved, so I've been asking her if there is anything she needs me to do do so she can complete it since I know she is really busy. She always keeps saying no. \n\nI send out reports every week with the link to the status sheet (the bosses requested this link be included) and then quick overview reports of where we are on the grand scheme of the project. I purposely don't put which percentage of who did what on the overview reports because I don't think it's relevant to presenting to a director. However, you can look at the status update sheet and see who completed what.\n\nApparently her boss decided to look at the status update sheet and saw that I had completed something like 80% of the overall list and didn't have any In Progress anymore and her part of the list was still largely set to In Progress and only had a handful of complete items and she got a stern talking to about not taking lead on it.\n\nShe was a little touchy with me this morning because of the talking to she got because apparently I made her look bad to her boss. I apologized and told her that I don't really care who does what part of the project, if she does 5% or 100%. I only care that the project gets completed on time and we are on track to completing our part 3 weeks ahead of the other teams that are working on this in their respective areas. I still don't think she's all that happy with me about it. \n\nAm I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "Sorry for spelling I'm on mobile. So, today at my Highschool we had a Thanksgiving lunch. Which is just an extended, free lunch, with Thanksgiving food. So, my friend and I were spending the last 20 minutes of the lunch period discussing Fallout lore, because were nerds. And this group of like, 6 people, were being very loud and obnoxious. Screaming about butts or something. When one of them took some of her trash, and put it on our table.\n\nI picked up the trash from our table, and put it on the seat next to her. The guy sitting one seat away from her (Who by the way seems to be going on some sort of power trip. Like bragging about how much money he has.) throws the trash at me. So I pick up the trash and throw it harder back at him. He proceeds to threaten me with \"I'll beat you up boy! Dont mess with me boy!\" I ignored them and pretended that they weren't there for the rest of the lunch. AITA?\n\nTL;DR Group of annoying loud kids put trash on my table, I put it on their, They threw it at me, I threw it back, Alpha Male of group threatens me.",

      "description": "So backstory, my mom lives with me in California and uses my vehicle a few times a week to run errands. She's not on my insurance policy, and has her own full coverage policy on her vehicle that my brother drives back in our home state of Texas. She got into a fender bender in my vehicle and is most likely at fault. (She backed into a small sedan that creeped up behind her after she checked the blind spots) my vehicle is a jeep grand Cherokee so it sits higher up. The damage on my vehicle is minimal and will most likely buff out. But the bumper on the other us torn and the paint scuffed. She gave the other driver her insurance policy Info and parted ways. He mentioned if she didn't want to claim it on her policy he'd accept 1800 in cash for the damages. She just found out after calling her insurance that they wont cover her in my vehicle and to use my policy. I really dont want to use my policy because I had a bad driving history when I was younger and my premiums have just gotten to a point where it is affordable. Also, if I were the one to get in the wreck I would've given the guy the 1800 to avoid claiming in my insurance. So am I the asshole for expecting her to pay him out of pocket as I would do as well?",

      "description": "So I’ve lived with the same 5 guys for the past 3 years or so, and it’s been an amazing time and I wouldn’t change any of it, they’re my best friends and I love them all. \n\nWe finish Uni this coming Summer. Originally we were all planning on staying together as we move on into adulthood and real life jobs etc. However, over the last half year/year all of them have found themselves in relationships, which alongside studying takes up a considerable amount of time. \n\nWhereas before we would go out and do stuff as a house it’s largely become them going off as couples to do things that would be weird as the only single person there. I don’t resent these guys at all and I’m super stoked that they’re all happy, however I don’t plan on getting into a relationship any time soon and I’m beginning to feel more and more secluded as the only single person there. \n\nSo, last night after a few drinks I told them that I’m planning on moving home after our final semester to save some money then move somewhere different. This didn’t go down well, which wasn’t helped by the booze. I suggested that they could use the extra room to move on one of their girlfriends or something and I got called bitter and jealous because I was single. Then I got mad and told them that I “wasn’t there for a fucking couples retreat” and went to bed. We’ve never really argued before as a house so this is foreign ground for me. \n\nNow it’s the next day and I’ve only spoken to one of them all day, they’ve all been out at their SO’s all day (what a surprise). Am I the asshole here? I really don’t know. \n",

      "description": "AITA?\n\nHeres a little backstory,\n\nmy brother and i were adopted by another family member, we went through foster care only having each other. He is 8 years older than i am. i am 19 now, he is 27. \n\nmy parents kicked him out for the last time when i was 13 and he was 21, because he wouldnt stop smoking weed, disobeying, and he could not hold a job down even though my parents got him multiple jobs.\n\nhe went to Waco, where my mother who gave us up lives (i was adopted due to drugs and theft at the age of 5, therefore i hate her and have no reason to respect his decision) and he got into some pretty hard drugs. he called me maybe once a month, and i respect that because i know he truly cares for me but cannot get out of the lifestyle he is in. time went on, i turned 18 and moved out of my parents house due to complications, he figured this out and began messaging me over facebook, as he was not allowed to while i was living with my family, because they did not want me to have any connections with my previous scumbag mother other than one call a month under their supervision. anyway, i was ok with him messaging me, but soon the messages stopped, i didnt think much of it, as he doesnt have much money and i assumed he didnt pay his phone bill. i get a text from my mom while at work, and she sent me a picture of his mugshot, and she told me he was in jail for stealing from a disabled woman he was taking care of. \n\nabout a month later i get a message from him, i didnt even read it, i went on a rant and ripped him a new one as best i could through text, calling him all sorts of names, because what kind of person steals from a disabled lady? or anyone for that matter...\n\nanyways... he apologized, said he was with a new girl that he loved very much, had a job, and they shared an apartment. he asked me for 20$ one day because they needed gas money, i had to turn him down because i had just paid a bill and didnt have more than 15$ on my debit.\n\nabout three months later he is saying that he is having trouble with groceries... he asked for money again, this time i was in a good position, had all my bills paid for the month and decided i had about 120$ to spare for my older brother. However... there was NO WAY IN HELL i was just going to transfer a drug addict 120$. mostly because i didnt want him to OD, but another reason is that i wanted my hard earned money to go to a good place...so i made him an order on HEB curbside, picked out all of his groceries, got some toiletries... it was a huge order, mainly because i got all the cheap stuff, but that shouldnt matter. i set the pickup time for the next day, i called the ladies in curbside and told them not to give it to anyone other than him, he got the order, thanked me, and all was good. \n\nfast forward to mid december, he texts me saying he needed 30$ to open an account and unlock his credit card, and he will transfer me 100$ back as a thank you for the groceries. i decided this ONE time i would transfer him money. \n\ni wait two days, and ask him where my part is, or at least my 30$ back because insurance was due...no response.\n\na day later... no response.\n\nfinally he hits me with \"yeah i dont know, i called, they said they would get back with me monday\" \n\ni may be 19, but i am not stupid. the last thing i said to him was \"dont worry about the 30$, even though you probably never were, dont ask me for help ever again\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? he wished me a happy birthday and apologized, i have him a \"thanks\" and refuse to message him back. \n\nwhat kind of man asks his 19 year old sister for financial help, knowing that i am the last one in the family that will even talk to him, then screws me over???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR brother is a loser with an addiction and asks me, his younger sister, for constant help, and eventually screws me over just like the rest of the family.

I started binge eating when recovering, gained weight and now I'm about 160 lb and 5'4''. I'm working with therapist to solve my problematic relationship with food and then I will focus on losing the weight.\n\nThis friday me and a few of my friends from class were talking about what dresses we are going to were to our upcoming prom. I said that I'm kind of nervous about going dress shoping because I'm scared that nothing is going to fit me and that I won't like how I look like in the dress. \n\nAnother classmate (she knows about my eating disorder) overheard me and started giving me weight loss advice - she talked about counting calories, low carb etc. Hearing it made me feel like shit, so I politely asked her to stop, and that hearing stuff like this is hard for me and that it triggers my eating disorder. She didn't stop and continued, I lost it, told her to fuck off and left.\n\nSome of my classmates and friends told me that I was too rude and apparently now think that I'm a bitch. Are they right, reddit? I know that I should have probably kept my cool, but it was hard for me and I couldn't. \n\n",

If I want to leave my street and turn left or right, I can’t see traffic because of the double parking.  The restaurant owner doesn’t care, because business is business.  The times I’ve confronted people about doing this, they say something along the lines of, “I’ll be just five minutes.”  The police will only ticket cars if they drive by.  Since I’m not left with many options, I’ve resorted to taking big green stickers with “no parking” on them and slapping them on their windshield.  The stickers do not peel off easily.  In fact if you try, they only tear off the green color and leave the white backing behind.  It takes a razor blade to scrape them off, so it’s not damaging their windshield.  It’s just highly inconvenient, which is the point. AITA for inconveniencing them?",

      "description": "Setting: company party last night at a fancy restaurant. Sister (24) was on an empty stomach and had 5 drinks. Midway through dinner I realize the severity of how drunk she is (being super loud, not being able to walk straight, wanting to pee all the time) She went from zero to sloppy drunk. I tried to make her drink water but it was too late I guess. I went with her to the bathroom where she puked. I took her outside to get fresh air and she was sitting on a bench complaining she’s cold and wanted to go home. I kept telling her to drink water and assured her that we were just waiting on my husband so we could leave. I sneak off to my husband and he offers to switch places so he could watch her while I socialize w my coworkers (sister and I work at the same company). We assume after a few she’ll sober up and the night won’t be a total failure. It’s his turn to watch her when after about 10 minutes he comes back saying don’t be upset. Your sister ran off on me. She kept insisting she wanted to go home and she didn’t want to wait any longer. I tried to stop her but she punched me twice so I got pissed off and let her go. She’s a grown adult. \nSooooo, AITA for being mad that my husband let her go in her drunken state? \n\n(Story has a happy ending, not sure if that matters to form your opinion.) sigh. Thanks, Reddit.

We moved into together about a year ago in a small one bedroom studio.\n\nFast forward to the past couple of months. She has been increasing not willing or wanting to have sex with me on any basis. She will walk around the appartment naked for most of the time she is home. And whenever i suggest we get busy with its a stern  no followed by a barrade of how rude it is to assume that just becasue she is naked we should have sex. Now im not saying that i deserve it or anything. I mearly make the suggestion and yet get yelled at everytime. She will even like dance around and show off her bodus in front of me but as soon as getting busy comes up its nope! Followed by a good 20 mins of being yelled at. Am i the asshole here.  ",

      "description": "A bit of context:\n\nI bought a house about 3 years ago. A coworker (not on my team but same department) kind of pushed me (and yes I'm a pushover) to let him rent from me.\n\nSo yes he's my roommate and my tenant.\n\nHe pays seriously low rent. He pays about 75% of the low end of what he might pay elsewhere (60% of what he'd have to pay if he split an actual apartment). He pays about $100 total for all utilities (cable, internet, water, sewage, electrical, gas) and I pay the actual bills (my portion is easily 3x his).\n\nTo be clear, he **is not a bad guy and he would probably pay if I asked for more.**\n\nIt's just that it's my house and I kinda want to enjoy it by myself. Plus a lot of things he does annoys me. He left the fucking front door open once! I have security cameras and he just makes fun of it and constantly forgets to arm it. He never turns the light off anywhere. The few rules I have for safety purposes he forgets (don't turn on the dryer and leave the house, please for the love of god unplug the god damn toaster oven). He rarely takes the recycling out. After two years of begging he finally takes out the trash but only if he made chicken that day (and he hasn't learned how to put the trash can out for collection). Not maliciously, he's just clueless.\n\nAnd I admit at first I was happy to have him because I figured I could meet more people through him and what not. But nope that isn't happening. \n\nIf he leaves, I would have so much freedom that I constantly day dream about this. Like I could use his room as a game room! I could actually vacuum the whole house (I'm a neat freak... he hasn't washed the bathroom rug in the nearly 3 years he has been here - he also didn't how to use a vacuum cleaner). I could dance around naked the house! I can put up speakers everywhere and play all of my shitty songs! I won't have to check if he closed the front door!\n\nAnyway I've had some of my friends and mutual co-workers call me an asshole because I said I wanted to cancel his lease in the next two months (yes I plan on giving him like 50 day notice). They say I'm a lucky fuck for being able to find a good roommate (because he is) and others struggle finding a good roommate (and I agree - all of my roommates in college were nightmares). They say I'm spoiled for throwing away a source of income. They say I'm an asshole for making him find a another place in a tough market. \n\nI really keep dreaming about enjoying the house alone, but I fear they are right. Am I the asshole?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I force a relocation after moving for my wife years earlier? (Very long, tl,dr at bottom)",
      "description": "OK so please stay with me this is a very complex situation. My wife and I have been married for 4 years and together for over 8. For a little over 3 years we have lived in NYC which I absolutely hate. It overwhelms me, it is outrageously expensive, and is just hard to live in unless you are one of the mega-rich. We moved to the city to pursue my wife's dream of becoming a professional actor. Initially, the plan was to live here for two years and if she had not accomplished much by that time we would move back home (we are from the southeast). \n\nDuring this time I have worked 4 different jobs and slowly made a decent living for us but it has been brutal. When we first moved I had to take a 100% commission job in sales just to get hired.  Seven days a week work because I had to sell or there was no money. Needless to say we blew through what savings we had pretty quickly, most of which was from selling my car to afford the first couple of months rent. After the sales job I worked for a restaurant start up for a year, then broke in to healthcare management, and now manage a clinic. I have a good employer at this point, and our finances are at long last somewhat stable (been there 8 months). \n\nMy wife has made consistent progress in becoming an actor and trying to join one of the acting unions. She had to start with choir and ensemble roles, but over the time we have spent here she has worked and worked and made it in to principal roles and paid contracts. Now, when I say paid I mean technically they get a check but it is criminal what these theatre companies are able to get away with (we are talking like $200/week). I am extremely proud of her, and I have zero doubts that she isn't always doing her best to make something happen. I love my wife dearly and I know she loves me.\n\nThat said, I have always been the one that has to pay all of our bills. Rent, Internet, Phone, Electric I pay 100% every month and buy most of our groceries. I have very little residual income at the end of each month after bills though fortunately at this point I do have some going in to a 401k. I was already starting to burn out and then a real life change occured....\n\nMy father passed away unexpectedly last spring. We knew he wasn't in great health, but this was a shock. I got the call one morning and he was just gone. I loved my dad, he was a tremendous man who made sure I had good opportunities and was always around for me as I grew up. I was so fortunate to have a father that truly cared. I say that because this was a soul-crushing blow to me and has completely shaken me to my core and I still feel it every day.\n\nBefore his death, I had the resolve from knowing that even though I didn't like living in NYC my wife loves it and that I am being a good spouse for giving her the opportunity to pursue her dream. But now I can't handle it. I have panic attacks all the time, I have been going to a psychologist since November and have had no significant breakthroughs. I feel depressed all the time. I am trying to see a psychiatrist but finding one that takes our insurance has been tough. I have a very hard time completing even basic functions, and I know that my mom and brother are struggling. \n\nI want to move back south asap and get closer to our family. I want to start preparing for my wife and I's life together and  getting to a place where I can deal with this grief. We speak about it all the time and I know she doesn't want to leave NYC. She will but her conditions have been that I have to have a job lined up before we can, and she only really is OK with moving to Atlanta, Georgia (we are not from Georgia) because there is a market for her work there. I am torn because part of me thinks that my health should 100% be a drop everything and lets get you right sort of scenario for her but it doesn't seem to be all of the time. Then I am also torn because I feel I should be stronger and able to handle these things so that she can keep working on what she wants whether it be in NYC or elsewhere. I think my mental stability has about 6 months tops left in the city before I really break.\n\nSo I guess all of that is to ask this question. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?\n\nThank you to anyone kind enough to read through that wall of text.\n\ntl,dr\n\nI relocated to NYC for my wife a little over 3 years ago to support her in her dream of being a professional actor. I hate living there, she loves it. I am the breadwinner and pay 100% of our bills, but she has made progress in establishing her career. My father passed away last spring and now my mental health has gone to s**t with the grief making the anxiety I have from living in the city, on top of the sheer grief itself, even worse. She doesn't want to leave but will concede to relocating to ATL, GA as there is a market there for her work. I just want to get close to home. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?",

      "description": "I met this girl about 9 months ago. She seemed nice enough and I'm fairly new to town so we friend each other on Facebook and start hanging out. She's basically a 13 year old (some form of developmental disability) but she's actually 30+. Everything is always about her and her ex, how she wants a baby, and how she needs a boyfriend. She bombarded me with messages all day and if I didn't reply (cause I was at work), she would send me more. I took her to another city for her birthday and we went to dinner, the adult store (lingerie and such), and drinks with my friends. By the end of the night, she wanted to go home with one of said friends. She cried to said friend because she and I haven't hooked up yet (I'm bi, she isn't), and then called me repeatedly cause she thought I left her there. My phone was on silent so I didn't hear it. She basically bombards friends with messages (like 20 in 2 hours) and expects me to basically be a babysitter when we go out. At this point, I'm fed up with the crap she talks about (trying to hook up with anyone &amp; everyone, trying to marry her ex best friends husband, and having a baby). This girl is legit not capable of caring for herself and cannot cook or clean or hold a job. I tell her she needs hobbies and try to get her to different topics of conversation. She refuses to stop talking about above stuff and is trying to get guys to date her. She was telling people around town details about us going out and telling everyone about get lingerie. By this point, I'm frustrated beyond belief because I want a friend, not a child and she's not understanding even though I keep talking to her about it and I am stressed to the max. It finally blows up when I get a call from another friend about something she said. I tell her I'm upset and need time, she decided we aren't friends anymore and blocks me. I'm not upset about this at all. Does that make me the ass? ",

      "description": "Today I noticed one of my potted plants hanging off of the shelf where it normally sits. This usually means the baby got to it - she puts her feet on the bottom shelf and hoists herself up. Usually this section of the room is off-limits for this reason. The pot was nowhere to be found. Definitely the baby. As I went to fix it I noticed it was basically on the verge of death so I asked my SO if she knew it was like that.\n\nHer: What plant?\n\nMe: This plant\n\nHer: Oh yeah, it's been that way for a week *shrugs*\n\n*Note: I've been away on business and only recently returned home*\n\nMe: (frustrated) Thanks. You could have said something about it, it's basically dead at this point\n\nHer: How is this MY fault!? I didn't know it shouldn't be like that!\n\nMe: How could you not know a plant shouldn't be hanging from a shelf without a pot? And when you found a random plant pot on the ground, saw a plant hanging off the shelf, and didn't either think that's not normal or to at least say anything to me? Also why was the baby left unattended (again!) long enough that she was able to climb up there, de-pot a plant, and then run around with the glass pot, also unattended? And you saw all of this and never thought anything was strange about it?\n\nHer: Well I didn't know the plant needed a pot. I've only seen it once before this (when it was in a pot, on the shelf, like all the other plants)\n\nIt's worth mentioning that she has plenty of her own house plants - it's not just a me-only hobby that she's clueless about.\n\nWho's TA here?",

Anna is under the impression that they are going to date once his relationship is over.  I feel as if Jim is in the wrong for even acting as if they are going to have something while he is dating another girl. On top of that, he stays over late most days in a dark room with Anna \"watching movies\".\n\nI  think Jim has already betrayed his girlfriend and I feel terrible for her. He has shared private details about his sex life with Anna and how is unsatisfied. I think it's extremely selfish of him to string his girlfriend along cause he doesn't wanna be homeless \n\nI do admit that I feel strongly about the whole cheating thing. My mom was cheated on more times than I can count and I've been cheated on. that shit sucks and if it were to happen again I would want to know.\n\nI also admit I hate this guy for acting like this while he has a girlfriend and I hide his shoes everytime he is over as a little fuck you...\n\nWould I be an asshole if I were to tell his girlfriend about what he has been doing behind her back?

When lunch time comes around 7 girls show up and just start sitting at our table and bring other chairs from nearby. They never once asked if they could join us or if they were bothering us, it was as if we weren't even there. They started blasting music and just talking really loudly to the point we not only couldn't work productively but we could barely talk to each other. More and more girls show up until there's maybe 10-15? Idk they kept coming and we decided to leave. We leave all of our plates and dishes as well as garbage from before hand. While we were leaving I talked to my friends in Spanish (none of the girls speak spanish i think) and tell them to make it as messy as possible. I \"accidentally\" spilled the ketchup which went on their legs and stained two of their white skirts. My buddy also \"accidentally spilled\" his soda ruining causing all of them to back up and get their food out of the way. We walk away with a big mess as if nothing happened while they're screaming at us and the neighboring people snap chatted it. They became kind of a laughing stock. They're pissed at me and give me nasty glares but whatever idgaf. AITA here cuz now i feel a bit guilty about the situation",

      "description": "My sister (18) is here in United States on student visa. My husband and I pay for most of her stuff, in case that matters. Her boyfriend is Mexican citizen and she was telling me how she wants to go with him to Mexico during spring break. I told her that currently Mexico is not safe, and even my Mexican co-workers are avoiding doing there. I told her that I would love to visit Mexico too, but right now it's not worth the risk. We left it at that, no big deal. \n\nEarlier today, I get a text from her saying that she is going to Tijuana for tacos with her boyfriend's family. I called her and asked whether she can enter the US back, and she said that his family \nsaid it will be fine. I informed her that boyfriend and his family are Mexican citizens; however, she is a citizen of different country and she will need visa to get it! But most importantly, will she be able to get back into the country? She kept saying it'll be fine. I told her that this decision is irresponsible and she needs to come back home, to which she replied \"it's going to be fine.\" \n\nI broke down crying because this is not the first time she makes an irresponsible decision and goes against me. My husband called her and told her that if she doesn't come home right now, she is flying back home.\n\nShe called me and I explained to her that right now she is my responsibility and I am her mother figure. Our mom (who is 10,000 miles away) is sleeping right now and doesn't even know this is happening! If something happens to her, it will be on me and I don't want to risk anything happening to her. She told me I am overreacting and start acting like sister, i.e. support her. I totally lost it and said that she is 18 and this is her decision. However, if she chooses to go to Mexico, when she gets back she needs to pack her stuff and find a new place to live because clearly she doesn't give a shit about my boundaries. She replied that after my husband yelling at her, she doesn't know if things can go back to normal. \n\nOur family shares our locations on Google Maps, and she is by Mexican border, so she chose to go. According to my Google search, she does need visa to get to the Mexico, AND she needs to notify her school prior to travel. I am so pissed at her for completely ignoring my concerns and presenting me with the fact that she is going to Mexico on the way to Mexico?\nTLDR: Younger sister went to Mexico with her boyfriend's family and notified me on her way there.

      "title": "AITA for renting a Uhaul for my friends and then reporting it stolen when they didn't return it?",
      "description": "I was helping some friends of mine financially for a while, but I couldn't do it anymore. They relied on me a lot and I told them that I couldn't be responsible for them anymore.  The female is a very nice lady that is unfortunately associated with the male. The male has taken advantage of me before and it's only because of the female that I associated with him at all.  They were good friends and roommates. \n\nThey hit some hard times financially and were eventually kicked out of their home for non-payment of rent and I was trying to be helpful and rented them a Uhaul truck with the understanding that it would be returned the next day (Thursday).  \n\nThursday turned into Saturday. Come to find out that they planned to live in the truck until they found a place. Not part of the original plan.  My dad and I went to pick up the truck on Saturday like they agreed but they weren't there. After several phone calls, they promised to meet us at the Uhaul store that afternoon. They never showed and blocked our phone #s and we waited there for six hours. \n\nOn Monday, I got a text that they planned to return the truck on Wednesday, seven days after the initial rental. I was still trying to be reasonable at this point so I agreed. On Wednesday, they said to meet them at their old house on Friday morning. \n\nFriday morning came and my mom and I went there. Surprise surprise, they weren't there. The female called, though, and said she'd had some problems, etc. and that she would return the truck that night and even give me money towards it (I didn't care about that as much as just returning it so the expense wouldn't keep going up).  I told her that if it wasn't returned that evening I would call the police. \n\nFriday afternoon I got a call from the male saying that the female is going to hang on to the truck and it won't be returned that night. He says he is in a different state, though I had reason to believe he is still with the female.  Again, I stated if it wasn't returned that I would call the police. He became very belligerent and threatened to call the police claiming I stole some property I had that was the female's (which she gave me and I have text messages telling me to keep it). \n\nFriday evening, I went to Uhaul to get the necessary information on the truck and then to the police to at least see if a phone call from the police would be enough to spur my friends into returning it. While I was at the police station, the female called me and said that she still planned to return the truck that night, but she had been out looking for places to live and will not return to the truck until much later in the evening.  She seemed very upset over the whole thing and I agreed to await further instructions from her about picking it up.  However, I asked for the location of the vehicle and she claimed not to know. It was parked at a friend's house and she didn't know the street name. \n\nThe agreement was for her to call me in an hour when she got back to the vehicle. I texted her when I hadn't heard from her an hour and a half later.  She said then that she would call me in twenty minutes. That was the last I heard from her.  I called her about thirty times and texted several times with no answer all over the next 12 hours.  \n\nFinally, on Saturday morning (today), I gave her a warning that in an hour, if I didn't hear from her, I was going to follow through and go back to the police. \n\nWhen the hour was up, I called and texted her again with no answer.  I went to the police and filed the report.  Then went to Uhaul and gave them the information. I texted her to let her know that if she returned the truck at night after hours, Uhaul would not do anything to her (that's what I was told). However, if she was caught with it, then she/he would be arrested. \n\nI feel really bad and I hate to see anyone get arrested but I grew tired of the lies.   Am I a jerk?",

      "description": "So on Saturday I got a call from cousin to comeover her place because she had a 5 month old mixed husky puppy someone was giving away. A soccer coach of her nephew had dropped it off for my cousin to find her a home because he did not have time for her. If she couldn’t find a home he would drop her off at the shelter.\n\nI went over and I instantly wanted her. My cousin called the coach and let him know and he was okay with me bringing her home then and there. She spent the night with me and the next day my cousin called saying the coach wanted to sell me her previous cage. I told my cousin I would just order a new one.\n\nLater that day my cousin texts me that the owner wanted her back because he found someone willing to pay. But apparently my cousin had told him off saying he already gave her away to someone and that its wrong to just take her back just to make some money off of her. \n\nI can’t help but feel bad. Should I have bought the cage off of him because now he just has an empty cage? Maybe he just had regrets about giving her away? AITA?",

      "description": "she has a track record of not contributing to group projects, and this isn’t my first time with her. as much as i try to be understanding, when it comes to deadlines, we usually set a date for our own parts to be finished and this is usually a couple days before the actual submission of the project. she never heeds that deadline and oftentimes does her part right before the actual submission - which i just detest doing because i feel the quality of work is compromised. \nit’s not like she doesn’t reply in group chats or gives ideas about the work, she just does not do her assigned part. \nthe thing is - she has ADHD. she isn’t secretive about that and i know she needs more effort to do work. the other day, my friend was ranting about her and said something along the lines of “just because she has ADHD, everyone’s gonna brush off her mistakes and she never gets any consequences”. hearing this did make me uncomfortable, I don’t agree with the way my friend used her mental disorder to belittle her, if that makes sense.  \nanother project is due soon, and she has not done any work despite our group-set deadline being a couple days back. i got pissed and just sent her a chain of messages, basically commenting on her lack of responsibility to do work, and telling her that whether she chose to do the work or not wouldn’t affect us - the rest of us would just make up for it. but after sending that i felt, basically like an asshole. \n\nTLDR; group member never does any work, but she has ADHD, was i wrong to scold her lack of responsibility because i should be more understanding of her mental disorder?

If there’s a party going on or they’re all doing something they make sure to always include me or ask me if I want to come. They’ve taken the fall for me multiple times when it should’ve been all of us who should’ve gotten in trouble and have never asked of me to do the same. The bad thing is that they can be assholes to other people. Sometimes they’ll roast kids who they think are weird ( weebs, kids who we think are furries or are into weird stuff). The bullying can be brutal sometimes and while I tell them to stop, and sometimes they do, they’ll continue doing it. People at school have the impression of me that I’m a nice person in general so they always ask me  to either keep them in check or to stop being friends with them. They say that by being friends with them while they’re bullying other students is me condoning their actions. Now I don’t like them bullying other kids but that’s not enough for me to stop being friends with them. Even though I don’t take part in the bullying am I an asshole for being friends with them regardless?",

      "title": "AITA Visiting girlfriend 7000 miles away and wanting some attention",
      "description": "A little background: My girlfriend and I have known each other for two years, we use to work together. We were together for two months before our jobs had her relocate to a foreign country, then we talked and video chatted daily for a month leading up to my visit. I love her so much, we click really well, and we had been talking about engagement leading up to the trip.\n\nAlso, go easy on me, I'm not a great writer.\n\nWell, I got my trip situated to put in for leave for the entire duration of the trip (14 days total) with two days travel time on the front end and three days on the backend. I had all my flights booked, made it there after some pretty long flights, no problems in our relationship at all before getting there. We were so excited to be seeing each other for the first time in months, and it had been about a year since our last romantic encounter. We broke up for about a year after a two-month fling that got a little ugly because she was going through a bad divorce. We talked about it a lot after-words and we ended it because she started to love me, and she wasn't ready for that so soon after her divorce.\n\nWell, I show up and everything is great, better than great actually. The sex is fantastic, we are laughing, eating, having fun. Just a really awesome time only problem at this time is her internet went off because she forgot to pay the bill for a few months. Well we get to the third day of the trip she has an appointment she has to go to and I ask if she wants me to give her some space since we had spent so much time together. I thought it might be healthy to take a breather. Well, she didn't like that too much and she told me \"I'm not wasting my breath asking if you want to come, you can come if you want to but I'm not making you do anything.\" in sort of a negative tone. So I wait a little bit, still not sure if I should go after the aggression but decide to start getting ready. Usually, she takes a bit longer to get ready so I was a little slow on the ball and she leaves after telling me I was too slow and should have gotten ready earlier, fair, but keep in mind it was still about 45 minutes to the appointment, which was right down the road. So I wait until she gets back and I ask if she wants to talk about it, she tells me not really. So I apologize and tell her my point of view on the interaction. She gets very upset at me and tells me to stop starting shit. I was a little taken aback by that and remained quiet and let her get it out of her system, she took this as me pouting. I help her with the bill which is well over $400 at this point, but I know she will pay me back. We spend the rest of the day watching TV, unable to talk because I couldn't start a conversation without it veering south, and not physical affection from her at all.\n\nDay four is like this as well, we had times in the past where sometimes she just needs a little time, so I give it to her and lay on the opposite side of the bed, she did not want to be touched. We laid in bed the whole day, then went out to dinner with some of her friends.\n\nDay five starts off the same, no cuddling or anything in bed which is different because in the past we had always cuddled to sleep, but she said it was too hot so I didn't argue. When we are waking up she grabs my hand and kisses it, honestly at this point I'm just internally begging for any kind of affection so it was very heartwarming. She had to go get a birth control implant that day, and those things hurt for days. We went on a trip to a lake with one of her friends this day, started off the same after she was fully awake as the previous two days, mostly ignored again or a negative attitude. The drive to the lake is about an hour and 45 minutes, she didn't address me once the entire drive and only talked to her friend. Her friend, however, was very nice and talked with me about some mutual interests. We get to the lake and she is actively trying to avoid talking to me still, went to some shops near it and she wouldn't talk to me, or respond to any of my comments about some trinkets. We start the drive back and we make a snack stop because he friend had to take a number two, I say I'm going in and ask if she wants anything. She turns to her friend in the back seat and asks him to get her a drink. After her friend leaves, I ask her what's going on and why thing have been weird\" the past few days. Her reply is nothing was wrong and that she wants space, then she tells me I'm the one whos starting \"shit out of nothing\" because she \"asked her friend instead of me to get her a drink\". I quickly drop the subject hoping that it really was like that. We get back to her place that night and things actually seem a bit better, we end of having sex that night not great because of her arm but I'm just glad we are back to being affectionate.\n\nDay six I wake up feeling pretty good, although we couldn't cuddle or anything during the night because I didn't want to risk her arm being hurt. She has a quick appointment to take a short class, then she is back. She kissed me when she got back. after that, it seemed like the previous night didn't change anything and we are back to how it was before distance and negativity. We spend the rest of the day inside watching TV, eat Popeyes for dinner. Silence for nearly the entire day between negative comments anytime I try to start a conversation. Day seven Then it was back to more of the same, we go out to eat at a KBBQ style place and its dead silence nearly the entire time, aside from passing food back and forth and making sure each other have enough to eat. I try to ask why things are so weird between us again and I get shut down instantly, again. Apparently its fine and she just doesn't feel like talking. No affection at all this day.\n\nDay eight at this point I'm really at my wit's end, I can't deal with this silence much longer and I'm just counting down the clock to leave the next morning. We eat Popeyes for dinner and stay inside all day again, going to the superstore to pick up some necessities for a little bit, but it's obvious she didn't want my presence. I didn't bother to bring up the subject and I was just looking to get on my flight the next day. Day nine My flight got delayed a day. We went back to her place for two hours and got in an argument because I made a joke about something we were watching. After that, I went and got a hotel room. Day ten I boarded my flight, we didn't talk at all this day aside from organizing her to get me to the airport, maybe 10-minute drive for her in total. I said my goodbyes and she was silent. Later on, she texts me telling her when I land at each stop and acting as if she cared. It felt nice.\n\nDay eleven I'm at a layover at my next stop, total time is about a day. I have a lot of time to think so I confront her about how the trip was for me and my point of view on the whole thing. She was very quick to make excuses to a comment I made about how I felt like I \"wasn't able to talk and I was more or less silenced\" telling me that \"just because things didn't go the way YOU expected does not mean YOU know exactly how I feel\", telling me that I \"wasn't being ignored\" and that I was making her a \"villain\". She told me that I \"kept pushing her\" to talk about what was wrong, and that's why she was refusing to say what was bothering her. After that, I kind of just told her that I was done pursuing the relationship, explained why the trip was very hurtful to me and try to explain it to the best of my ability from my point of view. Which is basically that I have no idea aside from that first argument why everything went so downhill so fast, and that I felt like the distance between us was greater when I was there than when I wasn't. Basically just pouring my heart out about how I wanted a little more attention. Well, she tells me that \"just because things didn't go your way, you're making me the villain.\" and that she's upset that I pushed her way too much to talk while I was there.\n\nThis is already really long, I wish I could show all of you what happened more accurately. \n\nTLDR: Visited girlfriend 7000 miles away, got in a small argument after being there for three days. Isolated and ignored for the most part for the rest of trip afterward, told I'm the one making the problem.\n\nI'm at a loss Reddit, Am I The Asshole for wanting a little more attention and verbal/physical affirmation in our relationship after traveling all that way?",

      "description": "*on mobile sorry for formatting \nMy ex roommate/bestfriend got pregnant accidentally this last summer. (one month after signing a year long lease) I was very happy for her and her boyfriend however she quickly cut me off even though we still lived together. Two months later she tells me she is moving in two weeks and needs to be off our lease to sign her new one. She said she would pay her half of the rent for the remainder of our lease or until I found a new roommate because her boyfriend got rent paid for through military. I let her off the lease with that in mind. We're both full time students and part time employeed in small college town so naturally it's been rough to find a roommate (especially because my she moved out middle of October) after paying two months of her half of the rent she sends me a message completely unprompted to say that I'm a shitty friend for not having found a roommate yet. [Side note: she told me she was leaving on a specific day which she lied about because  I came home from work one day and she was just gone. She never said anything to me about it] and that she wasn't gonna give me anymore money for the rent because I've been given ample time to find one. I've now been put into a financial crisis because no one can move in due to their own leases not being up and I cannot handle the entire rent myself. Had to borrow money from my boyfriend which makes me feel shitty. So I sent her a message recently - even though we haven't talked since her message to me - and told her she wasn't a decent enough person to even think twice of the burden she put on me as well. I understand a kid is scary and expensive and I don't think I would be nearly as mad if she approached it differently. Just wanna know if I'm the asshole for the disdain I feel for her?\n\nTLDR: Roommate moved out with almost no noticed and basically left me with the entire rent knowing I couldn't afford it",

      "description": "So here's my problem. I'm 20M, and studying mathematics at a college in Germany. The last two years I've been studying IT at the same college but I dropped out and was kinda sulking the entire summer of 2018 about it. Afterwards, I started to think about my situation and decided to try again. Here's the thing, I'm a pretty extroverted guy and I really wanna go out during the evening and go to a bar with friends or something else. But my mother, who raised me single handedly doesn't allow it. She says that it's too dangerous at this time and I shouldn't be going out because I have class the next day. I feel like I should be standing up to her and stand my ground since I'm 20 but I also don't wanna risk arguing with my mom about this since she's all alone and I don't wanna argue with her. So what do I do now? ",

      "description": "So a while ago, july 2018 my male friend (I'll call him Richard) was in love with a girl (Anne) and wanted to get to know her better. This was in the summer break after the end of highschool. He was a very close friend to mine with who I usually went to parties, concerts, played a lot of games and helped each other so when he said he wanted to \"try his luck\" with this girl, I decided I should not have interfered. Well after a month or so she got slightly bored of his tries (she was also a friend of mine) and started telling me how he couldn't understand her signals, even tho she rejected him on many ocassions. I started to fall in love with her and we went out a couple of times and got closer so the inevitable happened. We got together and weren't afraid of our relationship. Well it seemed like that wasn't Richard's cup of tea, he started to ignore both of us, even though I apologized to him for getting with Anne, considering he told me on may-june that he loves her a lot and that it would mean everything for her to love him back. When I said sorry he responded passive-aggresively saying that I betrayed him and that I didn't care or respected his feelings. I apologized and sent him memes, asked him things on a daily basis and he responded very shortly with \"haha\",\"ok\", seeming very sick of me. In august there was a party where we all were invited but he refused to come and told the host \"I don't wanna see OP, I'm done with him \". Me and Anne broke up one month ago and in all this time I lost touch with common friends that I had with him. AITA for being in a relationship with her after she dumped him, even though he told me 2 months earlier to not interfere? ",

My mum (40) was diagnosed with breast cancer on 20th Feb and its associated with the BRCA gene. \n\nI (24f) moved to New Zealand nearly 4 years ago and recently went back to the UK in Nov. \n\nSo me and mum have been talking alot, obviously, and her being who she is doesn't want me to fly back and leave my life here (i have a good job, a partner and a doggo). \n\nWe agreed that i would be more useful during her operations and that i dont need to be there for her chemo. \n\nI have a sister (23) and two brothers (21 &amp; 14). My mum has heaps of friends and a partner who can support her.\n\nCurrently she is having a lot of tests and starts chemo on 28th march. My sister has been going to alot of the appointments with her and my mum mentioned to me that she was grateful my sister could help her take her mind off of everything. After that phone call i thought about it and i hate the fact that i have to chose to support my mum though chemo or her op's.\n\nIm the eldest and have always looked after the family. My mum is a recovered alcoholic (6years drink free) and most of my childhood was looking out for my siblings. During mums recovery i was solo on helping her through it. My sister has a kid and my step dad took my brothers away. Long long story. \nNot that im saying i have done my 'fair share', but i thought this was important for context. \n\nI love my mum and i know she is scared and im torn between being giving up my life here in NZ &amp; being in the UK to support my mum fully. Or continuing to build my life here, i have emergency flight money, and fly over when she will need me most. \n\nAITA for wanting to stay here? Please be honest x \n\nP.S wrote on my phone ",

For example last year we were both at our fathers on Christmas Eve and I collected my sister and came in to my mother around 1 o'clock Christmas Day.\n\nFollowing on from above, this year was meant to be the opposite I.e. we were with my mother for Christmas Eve. About a month ago we had acknowledge that this was the case (as it has been for around 18 years) as she was telling me she got invited to my cousins house and also to her friends house for Christmas Day.\n\n2 weeks ago my sister announced out of nowhere that she was switching because she wanted to be there for when Santa comes for her younger siblings. My Mam and sister then tell me I should rearrange aswell and I refuse because plans have been made and food bought etc. and it was too short notice. They have been guilt tripping me since then, constantly bringing it up, saying how it's better for my younger brother to have me Christmas morning (which i acknowledge as a good idea and may be the case in the next few years) and saying how Christmas isn't going to be good this year.\n\nYesterday my mother text my father saying that she wanted the switch days and I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with him explaining that it wasn't my idea to switch and that I didn't want to, because he was slightly put out because he thought i didn't want to spend it with them.\n\nI feel guilty that Im \"ruining\" my mam and sisters plans but I don't think I should be forced to change my pre-arranged plans to accommodate their last minute change.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "A bit of context, I am heavily introverted, and by that I mean get tired of being around people fairly quickly and when I get tired I tend to leash out (I'm working on it, but right now the best method is just to get out of the situation) up until I have an anxiety attack/a mental breakdown. After I've been social in a large group (a.i. Christmas) I need about a day where I'm pretty much alone to rewind. I know this is atypical and I should probably have seen a psychiatrist at an early age, but I never did. This is rarely an issue now as I've learned my limits but things often go wrong when you involve my mom and her side of the family. I'm 18 now and I live with my parents. I see my grandparents pretty often but not my cousin.\n\nSo it was the day after Christmas, me, my mom and my brother were at my grandparent's house with my cousin and as the day progressed I became more and more tired as usual. I got about an hour alone while the rest were on a walk, but I still felt the rudeness show up, so when it came time to discussing whether we would stay for dinner I said I wanted to go home. Mom clearly heard me yet confidently said we would stay. I repeated myself this time expressing how tired I was, but she persisted. \n\nSo I said something like \"fine, then I'll take the bus. Goodbye\" and walked to the front door. Mom chased me and told me something like \"You are going to stay! Think of grandma, grandpa and your cousin.\" to which I replied, somewhat angrily: \"I said goodbye. I can go home when I want and I'm really tired right now. You know how that ends.\" She kept saying that this was going to ruin Christmas as I rushed out the door to the bus stop and the silence of the outside made me think more rationally. I didn't even get of the lawn before I realised that I had the car key so I went back inside to leave it there. \n\nNow my family were going home after all and my mom had railed everybody in the house. I told my mom that they should stay if they want to and I'll go home but for some reason that wasn't an option.\n\nFrom my mom's perspective I know she wants everyone to be together ~~and happy~~ as much as possible and stuff like this makes her really upset. She feels it's my duty to be well mannered and consequently social until she decides it's time to go home. She can't understand why an hour of rest shouldn't be enough to cover a day of socialising. \n\nFrom my perspective she does this so often. With this I mean try to guilt trip me into situations I'm not comfortable being. It's always \"Think of ... and ...! They'll be so sad and it will ruin our entire day!\" in even though the other people have said that I don't have to stay/go if I don't want to. Especially my cousin has stressed that he thinks this is shitty behaviour when we two talk and respectfully taken my side in front of my mom, but nothing has changed.",

      "description": "Due to my own personal issues and a general lack of affection toward my now ex I made the decision to break up with her after two years of dating. \n\nI arranged for us to attend a popular five star uptown gourmet restaurant (on the east coast) with a famous interior provençal fantasia of poppy paintings and arcane farm that rivals the now defunct La Mangeoire. I suspect some of you may know of this restaurant, in which case you realize how difficult it is to get a table.\n\nWhen we are finally sat down my goal was to treat her to a meal, and then proceed with the breakup after the fact. However speaking with her is very grating at this point and she is extremely annoying, clicking her tongue and pacing her nails over the table linen. \n\nShe also insisted on holding my hand, which I rebuffed instantly. This set her into defensive mode. I decided to expedite the entire process and breakup with her ahead of dinner.\n\nShe did not take it well, and that is an understatement. What began as shock proceeded into her face distorting into a solemn, betrayed look, then finally settling into yelling and crying.\n\nI can handle the crying as I am acclimated to that behavior from her, but the yelling in public was beyond infuriating as many eyes were drawn to our table and I know that word is going to get out to my coworkers about this. The entire point of using a public place was to avoid unnecessary drama.\n\nHer hysterics continue and after I am unable to calm her down I decide the best course of action is to simply leave. I did not get to eat dinner despite reserving a table for literally days. When she texts me later I tell her that she is completely out of line acting that way in public, and that shes infantile.\n\nShe says that she doesnt care and that she can act however she wants to act. I don't disagree that she is able to act like a idiot, but that does not mean she should. Am I the asshole in this situation for not breaking up after we ate? ",

      "title": "AITA for taking a month to make plans for my birthday?",
      "description": "Sorry for any weird formatting, I'm on mobile. I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but it's still pretty damn long, so apologies in advance. \n\nI'm a sophomore in college and my birthday was late in January. Towards the beginning of the month during break I had asked my mom if they would be able to come down to campus around my birthday and do something with me and my friends. I wasn't sure if financially they could, as a couple things had happened that made money more of a concern than usual. She told me not to worry about that and to figure out what I wanted to do.\n\nOver the next few weeks I had a lot to do - with classes starting, research, my grading job, and trying to find time for my friends and a little for myself I was pretty busy. Because of this I kept forgetting to figure out what I wanted to do when they came. My mom continued asking every few days or so, but I kept forgetting (this is a common problem with me and it's really frustrating, it leads to issues for me sometimes). I should also note that I'll miss calls or texts from them a decent amount because I'm not around my phone often, but at home I'm more attentive to it because I have much more free time. This frustrates my parents, especially my mom, as they think I don't pay attention to them. Anyway, it got a to few days before the weekend before my birthday, and my parents told me they couldn't make it that morning and would come next weekend.\n\nI decided that week that I wanted to either go bowling or play mini golf, depending on what worked best for everyone. I told my mom, and she said I needed to figure out which for sure, what time, who was coming, if anyone needed a ride, etc. I'd say this was about Monday, maybe? I was busy throughout the week and didn't have much time to talk to people, alongside the fact that I would constantly forget only to remember later and feel anxious about it.\n\nThis all finally came to a head last night, where my mom snapped. Something important is that she has some anger issues. She would never hurt me or anything, but she gets extremely angry and screams. Well, that's what happened. I was with my girlfriend in bed late at night and had forgotten my phone in a different room. I remembered it and went to grab it. Then I saw my mom had texted me several times and tried to call me 10 times in the span of two minutes. I should also note that using Tasker I had it set up on my phone so that if I shook my phone, it would mute all sound and automatically reject calls. I had left it on before I left my phone, so no sound was being played and all calls were being rejected.\n\nSo I shit myself out of terror and called her immediately. She then yelled at me for 7 minutes about how I didn't care about her or my dad and that I was being disrespectful for not getting back to her sooner. There was more she said, but I've forgotten most due to a bit of overload and just generally being forgetful. She concluded by asking why if I don't care, she should care and said something else after that. I couldn't hear the last part because I was exhausted, so I asked what she said and apologized saying that I was tired and missed it. Then she said \"You know what? I'm done. BYE!\" and hung up on me. My girlfriend and I talked about it, and I turned my volume on anticipating that I would get a call back. About 20 minutes later I did.\n\nI can't remember much of that call, just that it was upsetting. At one point I know she said if I disrespected her like that again she would keep my truck (which is being repaired - they're paying for the repairs if that matters), break my phone, bring me home every weekend, and at some other point she said she'd break my fingers (dont remember how that came up? It was still while saying basically that I had better never do that again. I should also clarify that my mom has never hurt me and I know she wont, even if she threatens to sometimes when she gets really angry). Those were the most intense things, but the rest of the call was also pretty bad. Sorry I can't give more of it.\n\nEarlier today my Dad called to figure out what I had wanted to do. I told him what I had planned and we put together the last parts (ended up being bowling if anyone cares). He was also angry about how I had waited until the last minute and yelled at me a bit too, though it wasn't nearly as bad as with my mom. He basically was telling me how frustrating it was to not be able to contact me when they need me, and that it seems like I don't care about them. He did say they wanted to do this for me and see me but it seemed like I didn't care at all. In addition he said I was stressing my mom out because they didn't know what was going on yet, that my mom was already feeling sick and that was making it worse, and that they spent an hour last night talking about me and this whole thing when they could've been sleeping. My mom was there too and said something along the lines of how I only want their money and don't give a damn about them. After a bit of that we hung up, and that's where I am now.\n\nSo, I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, I really should've figured things out earlier. I meant to, I just was busy and kept forgetting, though my parents say that's not an excuse. I can be pretty bad about getting back to them sometimes. Usually I'll respond within a day, but once in a while I'll miss it for longer. I can see how that would be frustrating. But on the other hand, I feel like they, especially my mom, went way overboard and that it wasnt nearly bad enough to justify that kind of response. This sort of thing happens somewhat often and I usually feel conflicted about it. I've wanted to post before, but never did until now. So, AITA?",

      "description": "Hi everyone. I wanna provide some backstory that this is a high school relationship and I’m 16. Sorry for formatting I’m on mobile.\n\nAnyways, ever since I had a pneumonia and ear infection in early January late December, my mom has been strict about me being sick and if I wanna stay home she usually is okay with it (I don’t take advantage of staying home lol, need good grades) so this past week my girlfriend got bronchitis and she was pissed off that I didn’t wanna hang and I insisted she got rest, we ended up hanging because I guess I got manipulated by her and forced into it.\n\nSo, today I’m feeling sick and I tell my mom that and I have no big tests or anything important today so I’m gonna stay home. \n\nI begin texting my girlfriend that I’m staying home, not feeling well. And not once was like “feel better” she’s instead all mad that we can’t go out today cause it’s Valentines Day, I understand it’s Valentine’s Day but it’s a bit stuck up to not care about me at all. So I tell her about how my mom is really strict about what I do when I’m sick and she’s Iike “so much for going out with your girl on valentine’s day” so after her saying that upon other minimal selfish texts I responded with “I really don’t know if your being serious” and then I continued that text like “after I just explained to you that I was sick” and she had the nerve to say “boohoo your sick” so I replied with “gtfo.” And she said “ha”\n\nI just wanna know if I did something wrong. I can’t control being sick today, I don’t feel well. Is she just being controlling? AITA? ",

      "description": "This was a few months ago but I still wonder about it. We’ve been together about seven months at this point. He’s expressed that big social gatherings bother him and that dances/parties especially aren’t his scene.\n\nWe’re in highschool and there are homecoming dances. I’d gone the previous year with friends, before I’d met my boyfriend, and decided to go this year as well. Two weeks before the dance, I’d texted my boyfriend, asking if he’s gone to past dances since he’s in a higher grade. He tells me no and asks why I asked, and I tell him it’s because I wanted to know if I’d be going with friends or him as a date in advance. He was unsure and the convo stopped there. \n\nFlash forward two weeks, the day of the dance. I’m getting ready and receive a text from him. He asks if I’m attending the dance and I say yes. I get a very typical “oh, nevermind,” response. I press a little and he ends up flipping the fuck out. He immediately asks why I hadn’t asked him to be his date, and why he was finding out last minute I was going. I told him I’d mentioned it two weeks prior and didn’t bring it up again because I didn’t want to pester him. I’m terrified of bothering somebody so close to me. My anxiety makes me 100x more bothered by rejection, especially from my own partner. He tells me “I’m at a tournament stressing about this because you didn’t want to use your big girl words.” (He’s an extremely dedicated wrestler. Tournaments are every weekend and it’d take something super important for him to miss one.) \n\nBy now I’ve left home. I ended up repeatedly apologizing for not making my desire for him to be my date clear and spent most of my dance time worriedly checking my phone notifications. I asked how I could prevent this from happening in the future, to which he gave a condescending “Speak up. That is quite literally what needed to happen. A concept instilled in four year olds because they’ll hurt themselves and not say anything.” That combined with the big girl comment left me extremely hurt but I gave up trying to defend myself because every reason seemed like bullshit to him. \n\nHalfway through the dance, he asks where I am. Somehow he’d gotten entry. We sat down and talked more, and he was noticeably calmer. A few off topic things were mentioned and I’d asked why he even approached me when we first met, and he claimed it was a friend’s dare. This killed my self esteem, which he knows I already struggle with heavily. I told him that later that night and he admitted he lied about it being a dare make somebody feel worse than he was (because he’d lost the tournament? Which anybody would be upset by.)\n\nBasically, AITA for not formally asking him straight up to go to the dance with me? Or was it blown out of proportion? My friends think his reaction was completely uncalled for and that his words were beyond hurtful, but I feel as though none of this would’ve happened if I just had the balls to be direct. ",

      "description": "There's a bit of backstory that has lead me to the decision I made:\n\nI am the supervisor of a team of concierges. Before I worked here, there was another supervisor that worked in my place. A few years ago she lost her mother. She had to go back to Hungary for the funeral. A bunch of clients and residents had donated money but a few co-workers had also lent her some money too (about $1000). They gave it to her with the understanding that she would pay it back. Well months passed and she ended up leaving for a better job opportunity. Since then she's been avoiding calls from the people I work with and has only given them a fraction of what was loaned to her.\n\nNow come to the present time. A co-worker approached me yesterday and told me that his 92 year old grandmother has passed away. He explained that he would like to attend the funeral and be with family in his homeland, India. He was very sad about this. I had consoled to the extent of professionalism but that was all. I do feel bad for anyone who has lost a loved one, but she was 92. I can only feel sadness for someone briefly if they lived a long healthy life. I think if anything, that calls for a celebration.\n\nAnyways, so this guy is telling about the prices to go to India and how outrageous it is. I totally understand the stress of it all but then he asks me for a loan. He wanted about $500 to help him out. I immediately say no. I wasn't rude about it but I made it clear that I don't do that. I don't mind lending money to family and friends who I trust. A co-worker is a completely different story though. I just don't trust him. He may try to pull what the other supervisor did. All of it just seemed fishy. I wasn't interested in getting wrapped up in financial drama. Not to mention, it's two days after Christmas which is always a difficult time for most.\n\nHe was very upset with me for not even considering it. Because I'm the supervisor, I guess they think I make a lot more than them. But it's really not the case. I'm struggling like the rest of the working class.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think anyone should get mad at someone for not lending them money. You have the right to ask someone what ever you want. I just don't think you should expect things from people even during a trying time.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all of your comments. Turns out the guy wasn't even going to India. He asked a few other people and now there is a full blown investigation. I'm not sure if this is grounds for dismissal but at least he learned something from it. Hopefully.",

      "title": "WIBTA If I asked my Mom to kick the kid out",
      "description": "Hey guys,\n\nI'll explain this as succinctly as possible. 5 months ago, my mom invited the son of an old friend of hers to move in to our house. We (my sister and I) don't know the family well, so we thought it was odd. \n\nAs the days went on, we started to learn more about him. He's a sweet kid, but he definitely has his flaws. For one, he's a 17 year old high school dropout. Not great, but it happens (this is how I rationalized it to myself). He also smokes a ton of pot. While it isn't that big of a deal, we haven't been happy with the stench. His room is putrid. It smells like a mix between rotten food and pot. My mother seems to have no issue with any of this for whatever reason. \n\nAll of that doesn't seem \\*that\\* bad, right? I didn't think so either until my younger sister recently filled me in on some of the underpinnings of his life. She has the room adjacent to his. The wall that separates the room is extremely thin, so she hears everything. Here's what she told me: \"I can hear EVERYTHING, Dreadcarrier. The drop of a pin, a whisper. So guess what I get to hear when he has his boyfriend over 3-4 nights a week? A lot of fighting, crying, and sex.\" She's a college student (as am I) so this really disrupts her sleep/work schedule. Once again, my mother brushes this off. She thinks she's doing something nice for the kid and that takes precedence.\n\nBut wait, there's more! My little sister follows him on Instagram. He has been posting pictures of himself \"tripping\" on my back porch! Not to mention the fact that he took a picture of himself using my sister's expensive Yeti cup as a gravity bong. All of this has her truly irked, and my mom thought she was overreacting (to the cup thing, not sure if she knows about the psychedelics). \n\nAnyway, I've been skeptical of this arrangement from the get-go. I never thought it was a good idea to remove a problem child from his (accepting of his sexuality but strict about his lack of achievement) family. Once I saw it was giving him the freedom to do drugs and continue to let himself fall into a hole, my suspicions were confirmed. I haven't voiced my concerns because it isn't my house or my business, but now it is affecting my sister's life. \n\nI plan on confronting my mother. I want to explain that what she is doing may seem like a good deed, but it isn't helping the kid in the long-term. He has no life structure, no authority making sure he is doing right. He also has no intention of going back to school and smokes pot all the time. Giving him carte blanche isn't what's best for him. I also plan on explaining that his presence is disrupting her successful child's life. It isn't fair to give her the short end of the stick because she works hard. She deserves to live in a quiet house where she feels comfortable. \n\nWIBTA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my ex to stop hanging out with a certain guy?",
      "description": "TL;DR - Ex of 4 years and I are talking about getting back together, she started hanging out with someone in the 9 months her and I were apart who has become abusive.  I want to get back together with her and\n\nMy ex and I dated for about 4 years prior to us breaking up about 9 months ago.  I initiated the break up due to emotional issues stemming from my father's death in August 2017 (I was having a lot of difficulty processing and expressing emotions healthily and she is already a very emotional person and I kept asking myself \"How am I supposed to take care of your emotional needs when i can't even take care of my own?\"  I've since learned that letting people in is not weakness, as well as made progress towards getting past being constantly affected by the loss of the greatest man I've ever known).  At the time, she had said she would like to remain friends and we actually made earnest and sincere efforts to be friends; hanging out at neutral and public locations, paying for ourselves if food/drink/entertainment became involved, etc.  A few weeks ago, it came to a point where we realized the feelings were still there, mutually, but that we would need to talk more about how it was going to work between us (it used to be very one-sided in my direction and I want to put the balance more towards the middle) if we were to get back together.  So we began talking about getting back together and we still are.\n\nDuring all this time, she started hanging out another guy.  I was fine with this because we were broken up at the time and he seemed like a good friend to her.  Until a lot of things happened to make me feel the opposite.  Without going too deep into it and making this a stupidly long post, he has an abusive streak that he's using to control her.  In recent months, he's had her cosign for a brand new motorcycle and rejected getting a used car, isolated her from most of her friends, and move in with him into an apartment that she can barely afford half the rent on (and he can't pass a tenant screening so she's on the hook for that, too).  If she were to take on the amount of time necessary for her to afford more plus bills, she would have to quit school.  Everytime I come to her place, I'm told by her to just not engage (I do not like this \"man\" and refuse to do him the courtesy of hiding it from my face).  When I leave, he gets in her face and tries to intimidate her accusing her of bringing me over to have sex (the woman was on the floor shaking in obvious medical distress and he said, \"You're a needy little cunt, aren't you?\" and left.  I was there to help take care of her.).\n\nI have told her that she needs to get out of there, I have pointed out all the red flags, and she has been told how all of those were also things done to her by her mother (very abusive childhood).  I have also said that I can't control what she does with her life or who she hangs out with when we date again, but I have told her that if we moved in together, he will not be welcome in my home and I refuse to make him feel welcome in my home (still debating whether I'm even going to *let* him feel welcome in my home.  I am aware that it would be her home, too.).  She is still intent on being friends with him.  I haven't dropped the \"It's either him or me,\" line and I'm afraid of it coming to that because I'm not sure I would win but more importantly, it would put a huge strain on our relationship and I'm not sure we would outlast it before she realized that getting away from him was a good thing.  Am I the asshole for wanting her to get this guy out of her life before her and I get back together and try to find a place to live?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "My roomate has a tendency to stay up really late playing on his gaming laptop, usually until around four or five in the morning. I’m kind of a light sleeper and that—coupled with his talking throughout the night—usually makes it a lot harder for me to sleep. I’ve tried just sleeping through it for the semester, but it’s gotten a lot harder recently since he got a new setup with a bigger, brighter monitor and mechanical keyboard that makes loud clicking noises every time he presses a key. \n\nI asked him if there was anything he could do about the keyboard, and he already had a conventional keyboard for assignments that he started switching to for the night, but that’s still pretty loud. \n\nLast night, I was feeling kind of sick and I have a midterm today, and I really wanted to sleep well, so I asked him if he could just take his laptop to the basement. Our dorm has a commons area with tables that’s open 24/7 and usually pretty deserted at night, so I didn’t see why he couldn’t do the same stuff there.\n\nAfter I asked, he just sat there for a couple minutes, staring blankly at his monitor, then threw his headphones on his desk and angrily got up to leave. I asked him if there’s something about the basement that totally fucks up his plans, and he just said no dismissively and continued to leave. I tried talking to him further, but he ignored me as he left. He’s furious.\n\nI’ve tried to be accommodating to him. I got a sleep mask to deal with the light at night and just listening to music to drown out the noise he makes, but that doesn’t make it easier to sleep. He sleeps from around six to eight AM and then from around four to ten PM, and I try to find other places to go in the evening so I don’t disturb him. \n\nI tried communicating with him last night that this was a problem for me, but he wouldn’t communicate back. \n\nI don’t feel it’s unreasonable to want a dark, quiet place to sleep from around midnight to six in the morning. Is it? If so, how should I handle this situation?",

      "description": "So for some backstory, I had already dated this guy before, and in that relationship he had cheated on me. We spent some time apart and I realized that I still wanted him in my life. Long story short, we got back together. Throughout the relationship, he was very rude, uncaring, and inconsiderate towards me. I would always let him walk all over me because I knew he was in a tight spot with his family at the time but it still hurt whenever he would insult me or do other generally not so great things. I finally decided that it was time to end the relationship because I just did not love him like I had used to, and I explained that to him as best as I could. For the weeks after, he threatened suicide, self harm, and other terrible things. He had been one of my best friends as well as a boyfriend, so I would try to be there for him. Due to what he calls “his bad state of mind” he treated me even worse to the point where I’d stay up crying thinking it was my fault for putting him in this terrible situation. That went on up until a mutual friend of ours told me that he had been trying to make me feel jealous, upset, etc. to try and win me back, so I decided then and there to just cut things off. I see him later in the week with a gash going up his wrist, and decide that he needs me there for him. About another week went by until he started flaunting this new girl he was talking to, talking about how she was better than me. It really stung, and to be honest I lost my cool. I was not nor was I previously ever in the right state of mind to be helping another person with their major mental problems, but i knew he needed a friend (if that’s what you can call friendship) this past week everything blew up. We got into a big argument where he accused me of manipulating him and becoming selfish and bitchy. I finally decided it was time to cut him off FOR REAL. Two days later I’m hearing from our mutual friends he’s trying to kill himself again. Am I the asshole for not being able to put up with his shit when he really needed me? ",

      "description": "So, my best friend is getting married in 10 months. Let's call her Becky. I'm her maid of honor. Its exciting and I'm really happy for her. I've never been a maid of honor before though. I'm struggling with this situation so far:\n\nSo Becky has already picked out her dress and decided on bridesmaid dresses. We spent an entire day shopping in a city an hour away and deciding on these things. \n\nSince then, she has invited the other bridesmaids and I to go to 2 events with her. The first was a florist visit last month so she could decide on the kind of flowers she wanted for the wedding. I originally said yes I would go, but then she had to change the date of the appointment to a day where I had to work. So I didnt go. \n\nThe second event was yesterday. 3 days prior she had told me and other bridesmaids about this bridal fair she wanted to go to, and asked if we could go. I told her I would have to see how things went because I worked that evening. The event would basically take most of my sleeping time. But whatever. \n\nSaturday night comes along and Becky and I both get invited out to a birthday party of a mutual friend that night. We both had off, and we would see some good friends which included the other bridesmaids, so we all went. Everyone got wasted, most people not making it home before vomiting. I had a good time, things felt good. At the party, Becky asked me again if I would go to the bridal fair the next morning. She begged, saying only a couple of other older family members were going with her. Drunk me felt like Superwoman, so I said sure. Everyone got drunk af and went home. \n\nI went home at 2am, woke up at 5am with a splitting headache and a shit ton of stomach pain. I took ibuprofen and tried to get comfortable enough to sleep. No go. I chugged water. Still felt like shit. Now its 8am and I am extremely nauseous. I hadn't drank alcohol since 1am, I thought I had escaped nausea. My boyfriend was really worried I had something else going on because of the amount of pain I was in, and wanted me to go to the hospital, but I'm in the medical field so I felt like I knew when I would need to go to the doctor. I couldnt sleep still. It was 9:30am. The bridal fair was supposed to be at 11. I texted Becky to tell her I wasnt going to be able to go. I felt like complete crap. I apologized. \n\nI finally vomited, passed gas, and the stomach pains/nausea started to fade. It was 11:30. Becky had opened my message but not responded. I finally was able to fall asleep. At 1pm I woke up to a message from Becky, saying she was extremely disappointed in the fact that I wasnt there for her with the wedding planning. She said I never went to events with her and she would just have to learn to \"lean on\" someone else instead of me. \n\nI'm like...what? I spent a day with her picking out dresses. I am actively planning an expensive bachelorette party because she wants a destination one. I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. It has just been shitty timing for the other stuff. I told Becky this, she said it doesnt change the fact that I've let her down and been a disappointment to her. She then went on to say she doesnt accept my reasons for not going to the bridal fair (extreme nausea and pain). She said every other bridesmaid had messaged her the same thing and she expected more. \n\nI just... I don't know. In my family, you did not have the maid of honor or bridesmaids do shit like this. They help with bachelorette parties and stuff like that. It's just weird to me that Becky seems to expect this much of me and the other bridesmaids. Is this normal though? Am I being an asshole? \n\nTl;dr bride is mad that maid of honor and bridesmaids cant make it to florist meeting and bridal fair. AITA for not being there?",

Not to go into too much detail, she ended up accusing me of doing something behind her back that i know she asked me not to do. That wasn't the case, things started getting heated, and i raised my voice, essentially turning it into a full blown fight.\n\nWe worked it out later (ended up being mostly a miscommunication) and I said that I was \"sorry for escalating the situation.\" I stand by what I said, but I fully acknowledge that I made the argument into a bigger deal than it needed to be and I was genuinely sorry for it.\n\nI feel like that makes sense, but my girlfriend gets a little upset by it sometimes because she feels like I'm being insincere (or pointed) when I qualify apologies like that.\n\nThis isn't an ongoing argument or anything, and she and I truly have a great relationship. I guess I'm just looking for a reality check here: Am i being an asshole by doing this, or does this sound more like a \"no assholes\" situation and we just need to communicate more effectively?\n\nThanks for reading and any insight you guys might have",

It was her first lesson.\n\nBehind me and my friends is a row of three girls and they were really annoyed of the pencil extension I had. I don't really know why. If they wanted to look at the intern speaking in front of the class they just could look past me so they don't really see the pencil unless they want to see it.\n\nAfter a while they whispered that it is a rude thing to do so I figured I should apologize to the intern. I did and she said that it wasn't really rude for her and I could continue if I want to.\n So I continued but the two of the three girls just continued to mock me and say thing like \"I think I'll get up and take his pencil away\" and so on.\nI don't think I did something wrong but what do you think?",

It's one of those little knives you can get as a souvenir. However, a few days ago she threatened me with it, and even though I knew she couldn't do anything like follow through, because it was during class time in a science lab, and she would get expelled immediately, it still made me very weary. I considered talking to her about leaving it at home, but she is very attached to it and I doubt anything would come of it. The only option I could think of would be to tell a teacher, but I know that could end in a close friend being expelled. Even if she doesn't get expelled, she might never feel comfortable around me. However, I can't feel comfortable when she's proven that she CAN use the knife on a friend. I feel either option is horrible, what do you think?

      "description": "I'm going to try to provide all the facts but my memory of this night is not entirely there. I pieced this together from my friends and parts of my own memory.\n\nSo last weekend I was at a small party (6 people) at my friend's house who I will call Dylan. We are a group of 5 friends but this time Dylan invited a girl he recently met, I'll call her Emma. We had a bunch of different substances and planned on playing some (board) games and just having a good time.\n\nAround 9 PM I took a bar of Xanax after smoking a bit. I must say I do have a little tolerance to benzos so this didn't really knock me out or anything. Dylan decided to stick to alcohol this night and Emma took 2C-B for the first time. The others were smoking weed and drinking, my other friend (Brian) took a bar of Xanax too. \n\nWe were all having a great time. Emma was having the time of her life and could not believe what she was experiencing, meanwhile Dylan was already getting pretty drunk. Around 11 PM we started playing a drinking game. I had my mind set on taking it easy since I have blacked out in the past combining benzos and alcohol. Emma came to sit next to me and kept touching me and resting her head on my shoulder. I did not know how to respond to this and just let her do her thing. I know how intense and stimulating a trip can be and did not want to mess up the moment.\n\nThe drinking game went pretty OK. I stopped after 3 shots because I already felt that I was entering dangerous territory. Dylan on the other hand was getting absolutely hammered. Emma was playing it safe too and stopped after 2 shots. While this was going on she was still very touchy and affectionate towards me. Honestly I just didn't really know what to do. I've never gone beyond first base with a girl and felt conflicted. My friends noticed this and distracted her for some time.\n\nSomewhere between 11 and 12 PM I took another bar of Xanax. I know, it's stupid but I couldn't help it. I remember feeling pretty slumped and went to lay down on a bed in a different room. I slept for an unknown amount of time (0-2h) and woke up with Emma standing next to me. At this point I was still pretty barred out and she was talking to me. I didn't really care for whatever what she was saying and just closed my eyes again. This is where it all falls down.\n\nI think around an hour passed when Emma came to lie down next to me, and I asked her what she was doing. She told me she was just tired from the trip and wanted to relax a little, I believe she was close to the end of the peak. I think I was sobering up a little bit (could have taken another bar, not sure) and put on some relaxing music and tried to sleep again. At this point Emma was again getting very touchy and I just ignored and tried to go to sleep. I remember taking off my boxers and that's about it. I woke up around 10 AM with both of us naked and I left shortly after.\n\nI have no exact memory of what happened and tried my best to piece the shards I know together. After this I called Dylan and asked him if he knew what happened the other night and how he was doing. He told me he knows absolutely nothing but had a good time regardless. I don't know what to tell him, I feel like this would put an end to our friendship. I have seen Emma once since this all went down and she kept going with the same touchiness and attention. I don't know what to make of this but I feel like I gigantic dick and asshole. \n\nTLDR: Had sex (?) with my friend's fling while she was tripping and I was partially blacked out. He doesn't know and she acts like nothing happened but still gives me lots of attention.",

I also lived in a dorm for my freshman year of college, and so I have generally not lived with my mother for a good chunk of the last few years.\n\nSome background - my mom lives less than an hour away. She has always been overbearing in this kind of way but it has gotten worse since she's been with her boyfriend who she does not really get along with. I know she's not happy and that's why I feel bad, but it's getting to be too much.\n\nShe calls me almost every day and I don't like to talk on the phone. I work two jobs and am in my last semester of school. I'm busy and don't really have that much to talk about every single day or even multiple times a week. I'm just on that grind. I'd rather just text with her. She will call me when I'm at work (\"I don't know your schedule\"). I've expressed I'd rather text but she just generally will not. I'm not much of a phone talker in general. Then she will get mad and guilt me saying I'm ungrateful because \"she just wants to talk to me,\" if I can't talk when she calls. I'm getting tired but feel too guilty trying to set some boundaries. I know she does mean well but I am getting stressed with this neuroticism. Am I being a bad daughter or asshole? I feel like I'm being a scapegoat right now but then I feel so guilty even typing this post out that idk.",

      "description": "A bit of backstory. I met my wife in the summer of 2008. She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?",

      "description": "My parents are divorced, for 10 years now. I have two younger sisters who are both married with children. I’m 36, I have an 8 year old son, and I’m divorced. I was able to attend college after high school despite my parents discouraging me to do so, mostly because of scholarships. I moved out at 18 and never asked for help. I’ve got a great job and I actually have a really nice 4 bedroom house in a nice neighborhood. \nMy parents are financially shaky- my mom had open heart surgery this summer and turns out and has no insurance. I paid for her post op rehab. She’s extremely narcissistic and turns on a guilt trip all the time. \nMy dad has a small photography business that has barely been scraping by. He refuses to get a job and hasn’t filed taxes in years. He asks me to meet up for dinner and sticks me with the bill all the time. He posted on Facebook last week that he needs $3000 or he’s going to get evicted. He’s asking his friends to PayPal him, but even if he does get the money, he’s going to struggle to maintain. He has no sense of fiscal responsibility- refuses to budget or cook- goes to concerts, trips, posts about it all on Facebook. Eventually he will be homeless. \nHere’s the thing- I love my dad, but part of why I moved out is he would order me around. “Get me a glass of water, make me a sandwich, clean this”. His house is always a mess and he never picks up after himself. I don’t want him living with me- that’s not the example I want for my son. My ex was a lot like this so I am already battling the “women exist to take care of men” thing. I have the space and the means, but I don’t feel it’s my responsibility to take care of people that never took care of me. \nAm I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "On mobile, formatting might suck.\n\nI live with my mum and my brother (my dad lives about 30 minutes away) and consider myself to be very close to both of them.\n\nWe spend a lot of time together, but I also like to be alone a lot and as such spend a lot of the day in my room. We eat dinner together and watch a film or a tv show but then I disappear upstairs again. My problem is that they always seem to have the best time whenever I'm not around - I can often hear them laughing and chatting as soon as I leave, and whenever they go shopping together without me they come back beaming and clearly having laughed their heads off.\n\nI'm not suggesting they're the assholes for having a good time, and I don't want them to not have fun. I just wish I was more involved, especially since mum and dad separated and the three of us have become a lot more tight-knit.\n\nWhenever I bring this up to them they brush it off and say that I'm imagining it and I should just spend more time with them. I know that if I want to be included I need to spend more time with them, but I find it really hard to be around people for extended periods of time (I'm a big introvert) and I feel like I'm intruding as they clearly have less fun when I'm there.\n\nAITA for thinking I'm the outcast of the family, and should I be making an effort to spend more time with them and be included?",

She has also had a past problem with alcohol/drug abuse that I have seen my self throughout the past few years.\n\nI feel like im just being greedy with my \"stuff\" but I also feel like she is using it just for an escape and not for the enjoyment. I don't want to give her it every day but once a week is fine, I would like to just have some for my self. She calls me a dick for not giving any to her and says shes just gonna have to go out and find some her self. I feel when she says that she is just trying to make me feel bad and give her some. Like I said before she has had lots of problems with drugs and I don't want to influence her more with not giving her any but on the other hand I feel like im being greedy by not giving her any.\n\nI love my mom to death but I feel like she doesn't even notice how she has affected me and my brother through all of this and when she calls me a dick and try's to guilt trip me it makes me feel really conflicted and stressed.

He also has lost all of his jobs or quit because he would become angry with the managers, which I understand but you have to suck up shitty managers.\n\nSo he has been telling me all this depressing stuff like I hate my life, ill never get a job im going to be homeless etc. I supported him for a long time and tried my best to just help him get out of his depressive state but with all the stuff going on in his life he started lashing out at me with his temper.\n\nI decided to write to him some serious advice that is kind of critical of his life and I know that it can be hard to accept that but pretty much I told him he needs to stop being sorry for himself, if he wants a job he needs to make his full time job finding a job. I told him he needs to suck up his managers being assholes and that honestly every problem in his life is usually caused by him. \n\nHe didn’t like me saying this and has blocked me and I haven’t heard from him since so reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for nagging my wife about cleaning?",
      "description": "We've been together for the better part of 20 years, and one of the biggest points of contention in our relationship is that my wife simply does not clean up after herself.\n\nShe'll do maybe one load of dishes a week to feel like she's contributed, she'll do her laundry if she runs out of clothes, and she might put away some of her stuff if I harp on about it enough. The only time she might actually clean the house is if we have company over, but since we live out in the sticks that's maybe a couple times a year.\n\nNow, I'm by no means Howard Hughes-levels of neat freak, but I do like to keep things at least reasonably tidy and organized. I tend to work less hours (although right now I'm working on-call and a SAHD) so I'm ok with doing the majority of the general housework, but it still bothers me that I'm constantly picking up after her.\n\nCase in point: a couple days ago I did a deep clean of the kitchen; washed all the dishes and scrubbed down the stove and counter tops. After she got home from work she made dinner (which was mostly leftovers anyways) and then had an impulse to do some baking. Now, I'm a proponent of the \"if you cook, they clean\" rule, but within reason. By the end of the night there was a full load of dishes and the surfaces were worse than they were before I cleaned them.\n\nMaybe this will come across as crazy, but the little stuff sometimes bothers me more than the big things. This morning she left some crumbs on the counter (that I had just re-cleaned yesterday after the previous mess) from making breakfast. Now, it only took me a few seconds to sweep the crumbs off the counter and throw them away, but it bothers me that she couldn't be bothered to take the few seconds to do it herself. Or the damn pull tabs from the milk cartons that just sit on the counter top for days until I finally take the few seconds required to throw it away.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the endless battlefield that is the kitchen table. She insists on using the table as her home office, because her actual home office is too cluttered to be used as such. In several homes we have been in, she has used the table as a dumping ground for her stuff, even though in one home she would have to walk past her office room and open a baby gate to get to the table, and in another walk down 14' of stairs and yet again open a baby gate. I just don't understand how someone can exert MORE effort to make a mess than to not.\n\nNow if I'm not already, this might be the point that I officially become the asshole. Her mom is a hoarder. Not to the point that you'd see on the TLC show, but still pretty bad. I'm starting to realize that my wife might not know what \"cleaning up after yourself\" even means. Granted, I spent most of my formative years in a similar environment (more dilapidation than hoarding) and I think it my stress is related to that, but it my be comforting for her in a way.",

A girl sitting behind me was holding scissors and somebody informed me that she had cut my hair. She only took a tiny bit out, and I don't think it was noticeable. We were both around 15, and we weren't particularly friendly before this but we had no real animosity either.\n\n\nFrom what I remember, I didn't immediately react in any way. I took scissors from the art room later that day and hid them in my bag. I sat behind her on the bus home, and took a slither out of the bottom of her ponytail. I returned the scissors the next morning, and I never heard any mention of it from parents or teachers.\n\n\nI'm not sure that I regret doing it even to this day, an eye for an eye and all that. From what I remember she shaved her head at some point, though I'm not sure how long after this she did it. I'm not sure why I'm bringing this up now, but I've become a lot more self aware of my actions as an adult and sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between standing up for yourself, prideful self destruction, or just straight up assholeness.",

      "description": "There’s this girl in one of my classes that I absolutely hate. We are on the same sports team, but she had pretty much ignored me until this class. I sat next to her the first day of class because she was with another girl who I actually like from the same team.\n\nShe says a lot of shit that annoys me but mostly it’s three things. First, she cheats off my papers without asking me even though I told her to do it herself and I’m clearly uncomfortable with this. I don’t really care if she cheats in general, but it really bothers me that she just takes my papers without asking. Then, she offers me advice about how I should add fluff to my college app even though I never asked her for advice. She tells me my brother (also a senior) shouldn’t have gotten in to his dream school because in her opinion he “doesn’t do anything.” She also gives me advice about how I should go get drunk at a party because I’m too uptight, again I didn’t ask.\n\nUp until about a week ago I had just ignored her when she did this and would talk to my other friend. I also moved seats because she was annoying me. Last class, she gave me a brownie and I thought it was kind of like an “I’m sorry for being a dick” peace offering. I ate it and then five minutes later she comes over to me and tells me it had weed in it. I was fucking pissed. My dad has struggled with addiction and I really don’t want to touch that stuff. She knows I don’t drink, smoke, etc. I freak out in class but then I realize she might be lying so I just wait to see if she comes over and says it was a joke. Class ended (about 45 minutes after I ate the brownie) and she finally comes over and says it was a joke and that she didn’t put weed in it because she didn’t want to waste her money on me.\n\nAnyways, I was going to report her for bullying and harassment because of all this, but I don’t want her to get in serious trouble, so I was instead going to tell her off in front of all of her “friends” (they don’t like her) in class and be really loud about it so she would be embarrassed.

      "description": "I'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. ",

      "description": "At a family Christmas brunch my brother had done his absolute best preparing a vegan dessert for the family. He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn’t help it… it just… looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don’t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it…\n\nNow I’ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked… “Papa, what is that?” and I just, blurted out… “It’s Play-doh, baby!”\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some “clay to play with”, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother’s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails… the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother’s dessert. He wasn’t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches’ vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.",

      "description": "So today I went [Twitch.TV](https://Twitch.TV) to see if people were enjoying Kingdom Hearts 3, and I just got done with the game  and enjoyed it a lot I decided to see if people were getting ready to either beat it or just you know enjoy it, also keep in mind i don't watch to many streamers, so I found a streamer let's call him F@#$@ for now and he was getting prepped  up for the final world so he decided to go back finish up some stuff like postcards, treasure chests and etc and when got to Tangled's world he couldn't find the last Lucky Emblem he needed for the world and well seeing that he seemed to be struggling a bit, I told him where it was, because i had trouble with the same one and found it a couple hours before hand and so after telling him where it was, \"he says how did you know where it was at\" and I simple said I found it earlier it gave me trouble to and then he goes off on me about how i'm a asshole and how jerks and dicks like me ruin everything and how my parents should be upset about how they raised me and how i shouldn't be alive and etc, and then he banned me from chat. Then I was like ok? What did i do wrong then everyone in chat was laughing saying I saw that coming and etc. But before i said anything people were helping him out with the locations before hand so WTF? But anyway i reported him to twitch and went on to watch a different streamer that doesn't treat people like shit for trying to help. So AITA in this situation?                   P.S. If there is any spelling errors i'm sorry i was kinda pissed off when trying this. ",

      "description": "Me and my wife have been married two years. She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.",

      "title": "AITA for expecting to be a big part of a friend's hypothetical wedding when I can't promise that she'd have the same part in mine?",
      "description": "So me and my friend have been really close since we started middle school. She's the closest person to me outside my family, and the closest friend I've ever had. She's in a serious relationship and has been for a while, so since a friend of ours got married over the weekend she's had weddings on the mind. I teased her about basically planning her whole wedding since then and she told me she'd planned nearly everything, except who her maid of honor would be. She basically told me that I would only be hers if I promised that she'd be mine. For some background, she's not close to any of her family and has no close siblings. I'm her closest friend, so when the time comes then I'd assumed she'd pick me, because there really isn't anyone else who would make sense. In contrast, I come from a very large family, and despite many brothers, I only have one sister, who I'm pretty close to. I told my friend many years ago, probably around 8th grade, that I'd like my sister to be my maid of honor when I get married because she's my only sister, and that made sense to me. She knows this, she was offended at the time, but she knows it's important to me. The last time we talked about it I basically just said that there's no way that I'd be able to plan anything about my wedding now, and that we can worry about it later on. After she made that condition today I just made a joke about how she'd be waiting a long time to tie the knot if she had to wait for me to do it first, and then after I didn't promise her that she stopped texting me back at all. She'll get over it (I'm not scared she won't talk to me or anything), but is it unreasonable for me to expect to be her maid of honor if I can't promise she'd be mine, or is it unreasonable that she's making a fight over something that probably won't be an issue for at least a decade? (We're only 20).",

I adjust the chair and put in 20 dollars and started hitting the play and afterwords won a small sum like 5 dollars.This guy comes up behind me and says that this was his machine. I did not see this guy by the ATM when I walked around or anywhere near the vicinity of this machine. I told him no one was here and tbh I didnt even see the 5 cents of credit that was left inside. I won the bonus of $132 and he started telling me that this was his money. He even asked the guy next to him that \"this was his seat\" but the dude next to him just shrugged his shoulders.

      "description": "My husband switched jobs within the past year or so and new job allows him to work from home  a few days a week.  He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can’t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can’t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he’s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!",

      "description": "So my sister and aunt are super religious and they have a habit of debating the bible with people any chance they get.\n\nWe were recent celebrating my grandpa's birthday and they start up again debating bible passages. Usually i either agree with them or I ignore them but my new years resolution was to be more assertive so when they came to me i gave my thoughts.\n\nIve been dealing with depression and guilt for a long time. As a kid i was molested by a relative, and growing up i did things that were considered very sinful. \n\nBut ive learned to let that all go by embracing like a moral nihilism. I came to the conclusion that morality is simply a societal set of guidelines to keep the masses in check. It also varies from country to country and culture to culture.\n\nWhats immoral in an islamic country might be celebrated in a scandinavian country and vice versa. The only thing that really matters in consequence, if your actions will give you a negative or positive result.\n\nTheres no point in being guilty or sad due to past actions as it doesnt really matter. And if you can break that tether to morality that binds you to society, you can achieve almost anything.\n\nNo i have not actually read nietzsche. I know about the superman concept but i dont think im one. This is just something i came up with on my own and makes me feel a lot better. Nihilism is just a good word for it.\n\nIm not a great philosopher so maybe this sounds stupid, idk. But i basically express these thoughts to them and their main takeaway is that im an athiest who thinks christians are stupid.\n\nI told them thats not what im trying to say but everything falls apart and now ive been partly blamed for ruining grandpas birthday. \n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to move out regardless of how it impacts family?",
      "description": "3 years ago I moved in with my Sister, Brother in Law, and their 2 boys ages 8 and 10. Part of my reasoning was to help them financially, part of this was to help myself get on my feet in a new state. I feel though as my sister has always looked at me as a neanderthal. When she visited my apartment for the first time (2 years before I moved in with them) the first thing she did (after hugging me and saying Hi) was went straight to the cupboards and said \"Oh my god, you have real food!!\". I was 30 years old for fucks sake. What did she think I ate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince moving in, she has made increasingly hurtful remarks and while I believe she may not be aware of what she is saying, I am tired of it. She is an emotional wreck so she breaks at even a hint of ill feelings. Once I disagreed with something and she broke down crying because I thought she was a horrible mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough..... I wouldnt say she is a horrible mother, there's a lot she isnt doing right, in my opinion. Her kids (now 11 and 13) are lazy and out of control. They dont clean up after them selves (because mom will do it). They go apeshit if we kick them off the xBox that they have been playing all day. I had to buy a router that I could set time limits that would shut off the internet at 10pm otherwise they would be up until midnight even if they had school the next day. The first night it took effect, the oldest lost his shit, got his cell phone and resumed watching videos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't reprimand the kids because, as my sister told me, \"They are MY kids and I will take care of it.\" The brother in law just kind of looks the other way unless something serious happens. He will step in when a MAJOR attitude correction needs to take place (like when the oldest punched a girl in school).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I am done with feeling like less of a person just to help them out. I think they would be OK without me financially, but it would strain things a little bit for them. They would have to shuffle some of their financial priorities. But honestly, I dont care any more.  I care about them as my family, but not at the expense of my sanity and feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to move out regardless of how it would impact them?",

I know that seems unfair, but he is old fashioned and didn't want me to work at all.

I was fine with this thinking it would just be part of the rent, but he's also making me pay for food as well.

I know it's gross, but that's just how I feel.\n\nWe are still doing our day to day thing, but I really am thinking of breaking up with him.

They all grew up from a farmer's family and they're somewhat tight knit. They knew this would be inevitable soon as she is very very old.\n\nI don't know if I want to go, though. For a few reasons, one being that I really can't afford to miss work. Another in law isn't going because he can't miss work either. Also, I have severe anxiety when other people drive. I don't even let my own SO drive me around a whole lot just because I prefer to drive myself. I was in a car wreck a few years back and I just get so nervous when other people drive me around because I have no control of the situation. Also, I think two of the drivers that is going on the trip isn't particularly good at driving. I got confirmation on that just the other day due to their driving. \n\nI just dont want to seem like an asshole for not going. I've met her once and she was super sweet, and that was like 2 years ago and I havent seen anyone else since. SO and I arent married yet either. \n",

This winter I’ve even been getting up extra early when it snows so that after I shovel our driveway, I have time to run over to her’s and shovel her driveway as well.   Same thing with last summer/fall keeping up with her yard work.  \n\nThe problem is that it’s went from being every once in a while to every single weekend.  My gf keeps volunteering me to do things.  We’ve been understaffed at work for a little over a month and as a result I’ve only been getting one day off a week.  \n\nWhen we go over there we are there the entire day.  Even when the work is done, gf and her mom will visit and talk often until dinner time despite the fact that they see each other and talk on the phone constantly.  \n\nI’d get annoyed about being volunteered if I was getting my normal two days off a week, but now that it’s just Sundays I’m getting straight up pissed.  I talked to my gf about it two weeks ago and she just guilt tripped me about it.  The thing is a lot of what I do, my gf could do as well.  Like rearranging her mom’s furniture.   She said it would take her an hour for what I could do in ten minutes.   But it never is ten minutes, it’s all fucking day on my one day off a week when I really just want to sit around in my underwear and watch tv.  \n\nAm I an asshole if I just start flat out refusing to help her mom?   She really is a sweet lady, but I’m not her work horse.  ",

They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.",

      "description": "About two and a half years ago I adopted an amazing Great Dane from a woman on craigslist who's husband was in jail and and she had some serious health problems and couldn't keep him. He's a wonderful dog, smart, affectionate and well behaved. However he does have some baggage and can be a little reactive (barking, lunging) on the leash when other dogs or unfamiliar men run at him.       \n       \nI usually take him on a long walk in the evening around 7 after I get home from work. If we see other dogs or joggers we usually step off the sidewalk into a parking lot, driveway, grassy area or just cross the street. However there are a few stretches of the sidewalk that are fenced on one side and a busy roadway on the other.       \n           \nSometimes we will come across men who run barrel towards us at full speed (it actually happens more than you'd think) either trying to catch a bus, out on a spring, or doing who knows what. If we cannot get directly out of their path, I usually call ahead and ask if they could not run at us and either slow down or give us a chance to pass.  I've gotten ignored, dirty looks, eye rolls, mean comments, etc.       \nWhile I've grown up on a farm around animals and know that running full speed at any large unfamiliar animal is unsafe and an incredibly bad idea, I recognize that others may not realize that. Everyone should be free to enjoy the sidewalks safely in a manner of their choosing, but am I the asshole for asking them to run at us?        ",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my partner to move",
      "description": " \n\nI live in Australia and they live in England, we've been dating for collectively 2 years. After our first year of dating my partner broke up with me because they were unable to handle the distance, I didn't take it well and we didn't talk for 6 months. After 6 months they messaged me and our relationship rekindled and is going reasonably well except for the distance. My partner's currently trying to get their top surgery through the nhs. I'm in uni. Near the start we decided that my partner would be the one to move because they insisted, as well as me preferring my city because the both of us are able to walk down the street without people glaring. As the distance was the issue last time I wanted to try and get moved in asap, long distance is shit and as we're both young in low paying jobs at most we can afford to see each other 3 times a year.\n\nMy partner going to move when they got info that they could get an appointment with a gender therapist to get evaluated for top surgery in March last year and appointments are being organised for applicants from mid 2017 atm. Obviously it's going to take a long time; I suggested that I quit uni and move to England until my partner would be able to move here. My partner doesn't like this idea and keeps insisting that I shouldn't give up my future, I've got friends here etc. I know that they care about me and don't want to be the reason I quit school but it's turned into a 'nobody can move' situation and it's stressful. Our relationship is great when we're together and I'm very happy with them.\n\nOver the past couple of months I've been suggesting things like dropping out or my partner moving in and we get a bank loan and get their surgery done here through private care. My partner doesn’t want to deal with debt yet, which is fair but it just means we're stuck waiting around for the nhs. If you keep up with Australian immigration law changes you'd be aware that the government is making it very hard to get accepted for a visa, as well as rural-only visas being considered to stop overpopulation in capitals. As I live in a capital city I'm worried that if moving gets put off any longer my partner won't be able to move at all, or that I'm going to end up having to quit school anyway. It feels like we're never going to have an actual relationship and I keep getting upset over the smallest things and it always ends with the same 'move in' 'I can't' conversation. I feel like the asshole because I know my partner feels guilty and I keep begging, but I also think they're the asshole because they actively are stopping me from moving in with them because they know I don't like England and don’t want me to quit school. I definitely don't want to stop them from getting their top surgery in any way because I truly love them and I know how much it would mean to them, I just also don't want it to possibly halt our lives together for years.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation or are we both shit?",

      "title": "AITA for outing my closeted brother after he mocked me in front of my family and friends?",
      "description": "So. I have an older brother. He is 25. I am 19. He is gay but he is closeted. He has only told me and his close friends about his gayness. Our parents are conservative. He is not my mother’s child, only my father’s. His real mother is a deadbeat. However if he came out I am certain my father would come around to it, only because over the years he’s gradually distanced himself from our old church because of how hateful the pastors’ associates have become toward gay people. It’s not an endorsement of their lifestyle, but it is a refusal to despise them. However he still thinks he has the right to deny baking a cake for them. \n\nI disagree with my father and my parents’ conservativeness, but have yet to vocalize said disagreements. I merely keep a safe distance since I’m in college. My brother however still tries to please them because I think he is conflicted. He still has Christian ideals and prays but his friends don’t share the same values (a lot of them are off the books weed/coke  dealers). He’s a bit of an alcoholic because of the fights he got into with our controlling parents growing up and I wouldn’t call him a deadbeat because he’s a very skilled manager at a retail store and did graduate college buuut all his free time is spent partying and abusing drugs as he tries to support his friends’ rap career (he’s apart of their group and frankly they suck. I wouldn’t disparage them if they didn’t pretend to be better than they are or ridicule me for being book smart, but the only person in their group that has a shot at making it is their producer because he can make beats in the style of many other producers. Lyrically speaking they need some help.)\n\nMy brother is a pretty macho fella. I am not. I do like sports, i play with my friends, but i don’t have as much muscle mass as him despite being toned/muscular myself. He used to bully me because he was treated as the problem child by my parents growing up but that all changed when i played sports in high school. I wouldn’t call him “nice,” but i would say he became invested in my athletic career and gave me helpful pointers, but it was primarily to preserve his reputation at our high school/college. His athletic career was the only way he could gain favor with my dad who served in the military. \n\nAs i mentioned earlier his friends are into drug abuse. He is heavily invested in a thuggish image that he maintains on his private instagram. He used to constantly pick on me for being a square and doing well in high school and college. I don’t resent him as much because I understand where he’s coming from and I’ve secretly been going to therapy for the last year to feel better about myself. I wouldn’t say I am at 100%, but I am far more confident than I used to be. Occasionally though i will be reminded of something he did and it’ll fuck up my whole day. (nitpicking my athletic performance in front of others, calling me gay as a kid cause I was into opera and Sailor Moon, criticizing me in front of our veteran of a dad when i wore brighter colors, belittling my interest in theater, etc.) One day he called me crying while drunk and apologized for being an asshole, but he hasn’t really changed much. He’ll still occasionally call me pansy or queer, despite my protests. I only know about him being gay because he opened up to me while under the influence, and told me “to never mention it again” when he sobered up. One of his friends mentioned it in front of me and he was pissed. \n\nAnyhoo, I attended a Christmas Eve family event and brought two friends. Word got around that I made the honor roll. He scoffed and rolled his eyes. My mother made a smart ass remark at my brothers’ expense. She said she meant it as a joke but it pissed him off. He glared at her and walked out. He returned a couple of hours later and talked to her privately, but he was drunk as fuck. I could tell by his staggering. She urged him to drink some water and sober up and he initially listened but couldn’t resist the call of my cousins playing basketball in the driveway. \n\nHe began to show off in front of my younger cousins. He was sloppy and unnecessarily aggressive. My cousins are 14, 16, and 17. I was already outside with my friends watching and we decided to go to one of their houses. My brother continuously taunted me as I left and threw the basketball at my head. I gave him the bird as I was slowly losing my cool then he continued to taunt me “cone here pussy, come play with me ya little queer” etc etc and I lost it. “Youre the only real queer around here.” He came at me but I ran away and all my friends and cousins subdued him. He cursed me as I got into my car and my dad and all the dudes came outside to find out what happened. He brushed it off and walked away. I haven’t talked to him since and he didn’t show up for Christmas breakfast. \n\nI really hate that I outted him but there’s a part of me that feels good about it. I finally hurt him. But I outted him in front of my cousins who I’m certain relayed the info to my uncle and father. Dads been pretty stern all morning. \n\nAITA? Could there have been a better way to go around this? He just makes me feel so weak and he’s projected his weakness and “”effiminacy”” on to me for so fucking long and it felt good to hurt him back. I just hate that it was at an inconvenient time for him and could mar his already shit relationship with our parents. Being closeted is more-so about survival than anything else and i feel like shit\n\nTLDR; My closeted bully of an older brother got mad at me at Christmas Eve dinner bc my mom showed off my academic success at his expense. He taunted me while playing basketball calling me pansy and queer and I outted him. AITA?",

      "description": "Yikes this title looks really bitchy but here we go. Apologies beforehand since I’m on mobile.\n\nSo I’m in highschool and my (now ex) boyfriend recently got into college. We were going through a rough time since we liked being together, but were long distance.\n\nHe was always kind of clingy, but when he moved it got even worse which contributed to our break up. Especially when it concerned me hanging out with other guys at school (however I was always in groups with mixed genders). Some warning signs I should’ve paid attention to were that he would say stuff like “I couldn’t live without you” etc., which to me at the time was dumb romantic lines but now is a problem.\n\nI broke up with him over a phone call which I kind of regret but now am now thankful for after seeing his response. I haven’t seen him since but he would text me randomly asking why I didn’t love him even though I had explained my reasoning over the phone. I didn’t usually respond to these texts since I had already said what I wanted to when we broke up.\n\nIt didn’t really become a major problem until one day he sent over 100 texts within an hour demanding to see me and saying he was going to commit suicide if he didn’t. I texted him back and his attitude immediately flipped and started cracking jokes which I found kind of scary to be honest. I texted one of his friends to keep an eye on him and then blocked him on all channels. \n\nMy mom said I have a responsibility to make sure he’s okay and I should check on him every week but my dad said blocking him was the right move.\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "So I went to a friends house this last weekend and after staying I left and got food, gas and a car wash. I did not care to much about where I went to for the was so I decided to use the gas station one that just uses pressure washers. I have a new car and only want to get the salt and dirt off from the past week, and I don't like to go to ones that have the big bush washers in fear they could scratch my car so this was perfect. I get gas and pay for the wash there at the pump and get in line.\n\nOnce in line (about 7 cars ahead of me due to it being a Saturday) I notice that someone has stopped right after they exit the wash and is drying their car by hand. I think nothing of it until I see the next car is doing the same thing. After a little while I notice its the same guy, so someone is out there drying cars after. I assume its a homeless guy just trying to be nice and looking for cash. I figure I will tell him no thank you since I have no cash on me, usually never do unless I need it. When I go to a big car wash I have $$ to tip the people who take care of the car after the wash. Once I get closer and I'm about the 3rd car in line I notice this is an employee (not in uniform). They are going in and out of the side door of the wash to the front of the line, doing something and then going back in to go and dry cars. After investigating I see what he is doing.\n\nFirst he goes out to the front of the line, makes sure the car can pay or enter code and then proceeds to use a scrub brush and cleans the rims, salt areas, headlights and bumpers. He then goes into the side door and out the other side to catch the car coming out to dry it.\n\nNOTE: There is no sign or anything stating someone is doing this. \n\nI just let they guy do his thing, the brush looks new when I see him do it to the car in front of me so I figure there is low risk if him scratching my new car, by new I mean 2019 on a lease new. He brushes, I enter my code and go into the wash. My next assumption is that the blow dryer does not work, that's why he is out here. The area the station is at is a nicer part of town and the gas station was clean and well kept. So I go with this assumption and as I exit the wash, the blow dryer works. So I let it do its thing and as I pull up he walks up and just starts drying. I was going to tell him no thank you but could not do it quick enough before he was already drying so I let him. He comes to the window as I am about to pull away and just looks at me, I roll down the window and he says he is working for tips and next time to do that. I nod and drive off. He looked super annoyed and pissed when I had nothing but again, there was nothing saying he was going to be there and this is not a normal part of a gas station car wash. AITA??",

      "description": "My friend of over 15 years is getting married in a few months. I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn’t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? ",

      "description": " This is my first time posting to reddit and I am using a throwaway to remain anonymous…\n\nSorry for the long introduction, I just feel like having some background on the nature of our relationship would be helpful. Please feel free to skip my rambles to the tl;dr\n\nAbout 5 months ago I (23F) started talking to this guy (25M) I met on tinder, who I’ll call TG (for tinder guy). We hit it off and after a few weeks of hanging out became friends with benefits. This lasted around 4 months before I started to develop feelings. I believe it is important to be honest about these things so I told him how I was feeling right when I realized. I told him he had no obligation to feel the same way, but that I wanted to know where his head was at so I didn’t spend my time pining for a guy just to have my heart broken. To me, getting rejected was a lot easier and simpler when my feelings were still pretty new and not that deep. TG told me that he appreciated my honesty and enjoyed hanging out with me but he saw me as more of a friend than a girlfriend. Getting rejected obviously hurt, but that was the response I was expecting. I told him that I respected that but that I needed some time before we could start being friends and he agreed. Overall, we ended things on pretty good terms.\n\nWith the exception of him sending a few drunk 3 am texts asking for sex (that despite the temptation, I didn’t respond to), we didn’t communicate and we live far enough away that I never had to run into him in public.\n\nDuring the time when we were fwb, TG mentioned that he was looking for jobs in the finance industry and I told him my dad is the VP of a pretty large finance company. (For anyone who thinks he used me to get to my dad: we met randomly on tinder, I have a pretty common last name, and we had already been hooking up for a few weeks when I told him).\n\nAfter about a month after we ended things, I get a text from TG during waking hours asking if I could put in a good word for him with my dad for a job at the company my dad works at. My dad has nothing to do with interviewing/hiring employees, but obviously a recommendation from the company’s VP would be a major advantage. I told TG that I did not feel comfortable doing that. TG then accused me as being vindictive and that I was trying to punish him for not wanting to be my boyfriend. My dad has no idea that TG exists, I have never posted anything with him or about him on social media and I don’t tell my father about the guys I casually hook up with. If I was telling my dad that TG was a terrible person who he shouldn’t hire, then I would 100% understand that I would be the vindictive asshole… but I’m not doing anything like that. TG is in a no better or worse situation from knowing me.\n\nThe part that makes me feel like an asshole is that if TG was my boyfriend, I would ask my dad to recommend him in a heartbeat. So its not like I’m on some moral high ground where jobs should only gotten solely on the basis of merit. Ideally, that would be the case, but I understand in the real world (especially the finance world), who you know matters. TG is a good guy who I know is qualified and I would be happy for him if he got the job, but I just don’t want to ask my dad do to this for him. Does that make me the asshole?\n\n**tl;dr** for not asking my dad to recommend my former fwb for a job.",

      "description": "Slight context required. My biological parents divorced when my younger brother and I were 3 and 12 respectively. I'd say it was quite messy as far as divorces go. My mum has remained single since and went through a great deal of mental issues in the aftermath (that's a whole other story) whereas my dad has gone through his 2nd marriage, moved country, and is now on his 3rd.\n\nSince my dad moved away, it's been difficult to keep in contact with him. Even more so after he began living with his partner and her 2 children. This is evident when, at the beginning of this year, I find out via Facebook photos that he came back to the country and married his current wife without letting either myself or my brother know (we are now 17 and 26) despite him also taking the time to visit my brother afterwards. \n\nIn any case, we come to last month where I discover (once again, via Facebook photos) that my dad and his wife have welcomed a child into the world. Even now, I don't know how to feel about this, and neither does my brother who found out the same way. This was also when I offhandidly mentioned they were married and discovered my brother wasn't even aware. We are now of the belief that dad has pushed us to the side in favour of his new family.\n\nThen we came to the issue of whether to tell my mum about all of this or not. Yes, I understand it technically isn't her business and could potentially hurt her to know. However, I feel that she should be aware of it if only to inform her and potentially gain some solidarity in how my brother and I feel. I should clarify that my brother and I have not spoken to our dad since the birth, and have been hesitant to because of how this made us feel.",

      "title": "AITA for snapping on my (25F) best friend (30F) when she shared difficult things with me ?",
      "description": "FTP. On mobile, and not a native English speaker.\n\n\nSome backstory : \n\n\nI’ve known D for about 3 years in a uni association. We at first didn’t engage much, but then had to work together, and automatically became friends. \nSince then, we’ve been seeing and texting each other regularly, and it felt good to have found someone who is like the friendship equivalent of a soulmate. To say, after watching the San Junipero episode of Black Mirror, we said that if we ever end up alone in our 40s, we will date each other. \n\nThings between us have always been easy. We were at first a trio, but the other girl, L (30F), has been a true pain. She knew D for a couple of years longer, and has seen me like the intruder in a way. She acted like she was my friend, but then would tell D how I was toxic for her, when really she was the one who was toxic, and trying to be D’s only friend and making her her property in a way. \n\nThis didn’t put a strain in my relationship with D, and more so, reinforced it. We had each other’s back. \n\nTwo years ago, I went through a really tough break up, and at the time D had gotten into a relationship with a very manipulative guy. He would dictate her every move, and was all around a bad guy. I warned her, and told her to break it off. She didn’t really listen, as I was very much in the slump and couldn’t possibly rationalise it all with her. \n\nShe ended up breaking up in February 2017, which was a relief for me, but then she spent the entire year crying about how much of a monster he was, although I had warned her multiple times that he was sucking the life out of her. \n\nThings didn’t get better, when she found out she had a strain of HPV that gave her condylomas, and the timing matched with when she was with that guy. I did my best to be there for her, and reassure her that it wasn’t the end of the world. Offered to be with her when she went to the gynaecologist, and also when she went to get them lasered off. I listened to her on the phone hours at the time, when she cried because of him, thought she would never be able to be with someone ever again, and beating herself about it all. She had zero self esteem at that point. \n\nI did what any best friend would do, and explained to her that all of this wasn’t true, that she wasn’t worthless, and will find someone who will be beyond her expectations. \n\n\nAll through it all, she barely inquired how I was doing. I was going through a shit year, and except some times when I would break down in front of her, she was basically inexistant. Never asked how I was holding up, never offered to cheer me up. I get it. She was going through her own stuff, and I couldn’t hold her accountable for it. \n\nSo I sucked it up. \n\n\nAt the end of 2017, she started seeing this guy, who was initially trying to get together with me, but I rejected him over and over, because I was still hoping my ex would come back, and truly, he wasn’t my type personality wise. I need someone who is very active, quick witted, who can make me laugh, and who isn’t in some sort of half asleep state all the time. \n\nBut anyway, the guy didn’t want a relationship, and was just profiting off her state to get sex, basically living at her place and not spending a dime when helping with groceries or anything. She even did his laundry. FFS. What king of man child is that. \n\nHere again, I told her he wasn’t a good fit for her, that he used her as a surrogate mother who would also have sex with him. She didn’t listen. She needed the attention and told me it felt great that he would be here at night to stroke her hair. Fine. \n\n\nThen he started dropping the ball continuously. \nThey established they would have a sort of open relationship. Except he knew first hand that she wasn’t going to act on anything because she was unable to trust men anymore. He is very socially awkward and although not ugly at all he still scared people off because he’s just weird at first. He used her weakness to profit from the situation. They said that the rule was no telling. She didn’t want to hear about who he thought was attractive, or who he fucks. \n\nBut he mentioned one girl, even had her name in one of his passwords, called her by her name, you know the drill. \n\nShe kept coming to me crying saying that he fucked up again. At the time, I met my now boyfriend and was doing so much better, so I was ready to be her clutch again although she wasn’t mine for so long. So I listened, warned her, again and again, even had my boyfriend explain that as a guy he thinks his behaviour is unacceptable and so on and so forth. \n\nShe didn’t want to quit it. I told her that she didn’t need to come telling me about those things because it would just make me mad. She still did. And I still listened. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, she went on a trip, and she met this guy. They didn’t have sex, like no PiV but did everything around. I asked her why she didn’t go all the way when she recounted her nights with him, absolutely over the moon. And she said that she wasn’t allowed to “take off her clothes” when with someone else. Like. What ? She could do bj’s, get fingered, whatever else, but no PiV. I was mad. I didn’t know about this. How can you call this an open relationship ? Yeah you don’t. He’s profiting. Because she would excuse him for fucking someone all the way, but he would probably have thought it’s a deal breaker. Screw that. \n\nSince October, I’ve been very depressed. I can barely get out of bed. I can barely have sex with my boyfriend. I almost don’t eat anymore. Life is all together shitty. But yet again now, although I’ve told her, she doesn’t give a shit, or at least doesn’t try to be a friend to me. \nSo when she told me that her guy got upset because she “slept” with someone, I had enough. She was in tears saying that she fucked things up, and I told her I didn’t want to hear it. \n\nI went to leave, and she called me selfish. She doesn’t seem to realise that I have been suicidal, but I should somehow give a shit about her shitty relationship when I’m this down. \n\nI snapped at her and said that I don’t give a crap if she feels bad, because once again I warned her multiple times that this guy is a piece of work, and that she shouldn’t have agreed to anything with him if she wasn’t able to put up with it. \n\nNow I think our relationship is broken and there might be no going back unless she accepts that I’m also hurting in my own way, and have other things on my mind. She won’t apologise because she thinks I’ve overreacted, but I don’t see it. \n\nSo AITA for telling her to fuck off ? \n",

      "description": "I’m a 21 year old who moved out of my parents home last year to live with my partner 50+ kilometres away (about an hour drive without traffic). \nMy mom and I are extremely close. Unfortunately, my mom runs a busy business and I work/college full time, so I don’t get to see her too often. She has some emotional attachment issues toward me, probably because I am the youngest child and have had a few suicide scares. \nShe has expressed so much emotional strain around not seeing me enough after I moved out.  It can border on guilt tripping sometimes. I do miss her so I agreed to come spend Tuesday nights there because I have an early class near her house on Wednesday morning. \nHowever it’s been 3 weeks and each time, I stay up until 3-5 AM simply now able to sleep. I already struggle with sleeping due to mental illness, but for some reason I cannot for the life of me fall asleep in my old house anymore. I’ve tried sleeping pills, meditation, exercise, wine and CBD.  It makes Wednesday’s class and following shift at work absolute hell running on 4 or less hours of sleep, so I have told them that I’m sorry but I won’t be spending the night anymore. \nMy mom thinks that it’s an excuse because I slept here for 15 years from the age of 5 when we moved in. She also thinks that I don’t want to spend time with her because of my strained relationship with her husband. They have both said I need to honour my promise to my mom, and that I am disrespecting our relationship by doing so. \n\nAm I an asshole for breaking a promise to my mom? ",

      "description": "(For clarification this is a banking job)I started the job back in November, 4 times since I started my immediate supervisor had me sign incident reports where I made a mistake. Each time I was told it was nbd and that it’s just a formality, just put some bs in the description box and sign it, which I did. Fast forward to this last week, I was brought in for my 90 day evaluation (after working there for nearly 150 days). I was told by the regional manager that if I had one more of these I would be fired and my supervisor was sitting right next to me during this whole talk. I just said I’ll do better because of how off guard I was by This response and couldn’t summon the courage to say the person sitting next to me told me that I was doing fine and painted a whole different picture about those mistakes I made. I was also told the only reason I wasn’t fired right then and there was because of how understaffed we were. I also tried talking to other management and they said it was inappropriate to talk that way about my supervisor to them.\n\nThis left me feeling like I couldn’t trust anyone above me and after talking to fellow coworkers about the situation they said I should tell HR about it, but I also did some reflecting and decided I want to go back to my old job, which I can go back to anytime, I already cleared it with my old bosses, my coworkers said they would support me, and I realized that I was a lot happier, made better money, and had a lot more respect for my bosses at my old job, but I just want to make sure I am approaching this in a Just and legitimate way.",

      "description": "Backstory: the people next door have four children ages 2, 4, 7 &amp; 9. Recently the father spent some time in jail for child cruelty (he apparently left marks around his nephews neck and tried to drown him but I've been told he was falsely accused.) The dad lost his job and is not allowed to live in the house or be around his kids so hes basically living in their vehicle, in their driveway. He takes the mother back and forth to work still but he's not allowed to watch his own kids. He also leaves a lot during the day, while the mom's at work. They leave the kids home alone a lot. A few times I have been asked to watch them for a an hour so the mom and dad can run errands and i agreed since my son (5) and daughter (1) enjoy playing with them but it's always turned into a few hours when it was supposed to only be one. I have never been paid but i didn't mind too much because they're clearly struggling. \n\nThe last couple of times I was asked to babysit it was for 8 hours while the mom went to work. In fact they have dropped these kids off at my door and drove off expecting me to say yes. Again i was not offered money... She's never asked me directly or really ever spoken to me, she just gets her kids to ask. I declined because that's just too long and i have my hands full with my own children and also being 31 weeks pregnant. Well, i found out that the kids have been staying home all day by themselves and now i feel terrible. Would you watch them?",

      "description": "Sorry for the dramatic title lol. Hoping to get some insight, especially from couples who experienced similar situations and young professionals. \n\nMy SO and I are looking to move apartments. Currently our commutes are a blessing, 30 mins door to door max. While an ideal situation, lately my SO has been entertaining the idea of a new area that is at least an hour commute each way. \n\nFurther out we could afford a bigger, newer space with loads of amenities. Our money could go almost 25% further. He wants a home office where he can close the door and take important client meetings. He travels once a month for work and the area would be close to two major airports. \n\nI wouldn’t mind this in the least bit if we had a mortgage and kids, but as it stands now we are a young, childless couple renting while trying to save money for a down payment for a house. Money aside, my biggest concern is that 2hr/day commute which feels unnecessary and could even backfire on us. \n\nHis job is extremely stressful and time consuming. He will be traveling a lot. He’s already up to his eyeballs in work and will no doubt only get busier. Since I’m not making as much or stressed as much as he is, I naturally would take on more responsibilities around the house to ease his day and streamline our lives, like cleaning, cooking, chores and appointments, etc. \n\nI (at least in the foreseeable future) will not have the flexibility to work from home like he does. I work full time and, if we make this move, I will spend 2 hours commuting each day. Not only will I have to leave earlier in the morning, I will be coming home later. I’m looking for a higher paying position now that will no doubt be more time consuming, so it could mean I’ll be home an additional hour or two later every day. \n\nThe move so far out from work feels draining and unnecessary. I would prefer to be closer to work without the extra space and amenities and get home in time to make dinner and clean up, instead of coming home after a long day and a longer commute to cook and clean, only to do it all over again eight hours later. \n\nUltimately, I want to ease the weight of his job, but I feel like he doesn’t realize how a move this far out might backfire on us long term. The space would be super nice but the time and energy would be stretched thin. \n\nEventually when we do have a family and house 1hr+ out from work, by that time I’ll either be working part time or staying at home with the kids while they’re young. Again the commute is not the issue m, it’s the fact that I won’t be able to do as much as I want around the house to support our family without bleeding myself dry or relying on him to take on a large portion of the responsibilities. \n\nI also don’t want to sound like I’m trying to get out of an 1hr+ commute because I’m lazy or something. Or maybe I am being lazy, you guys tell me! I don’t have much real world experience and I’m sure I’m not the first or the last person to take on a longer commute. In the end, I would hate for this to put unnecessary strain on us and create any imbalance or resentment. Thanks for reading!",

      "description": "Some background: A few years ago I went to school with a girl who seemed to have a lot of drama with people (we’ll call her X). Everyone told me she was the worst but I tried to give her a chance anyways because I don’t like to judge people based off rumors. I tried to be nice at school but in the end she turned out to be exactly the person everyone told me she was (somewhat toxic, really narcissistic.) School finished and I never heard from her again. \n\nI got a job at my current location a few months ago, and X got hired where I work about a week ago. Since then she’s been causing a lot of problems. For example when the assistant manager called her out on charging too much and stealing products, X went straight to the manager and said she felt “attacked.” Most recently our manager created a “chore chart” for us. We don’t get paid to do these things. If it was stuff that I should be doing anyways like cleaning up after myself it would be fine but it’s things that take at least 1+ hour of time that I’m not getting paid to do. So when I was talking about it to another coworker of mine X overheard us and went straight to the manager and told her basically everything we said. Now we’ve all decided to stop talking to her completely because she obviously has no interest in being our friend anyways and we can’t trust her with information. I mean it seems justified but I still feel like I’m being mean. AITA?",

I don't mind my boyfriend smoking with his friends so long as I'm not completely left alone. \n\nUnfortunately, this has happened 3 times already. Or more, I don't really remember. At a friends house party, my boyfriend left with his friends to go smoke because they know I don't really like it, which leaves me with a bunch of people that I don't know. He promised me he'd stay with me the whole time in an effort to make me go with him to the party, but ditches me an hour in. \n\nI was angry but he promised he wouldn't do it again. Cue two more times when he and his friends go outside to smoke weed and I'm left inside alone to look after the dogs. Which would have been fine except it was 4am and we were very, very far from my house and he was my only ride. \n\nI'm really upset with him because I'm incredibly socially anxious. If I have someone I know with me,  then I'll feel a lot better and socialise more. But he leaves me consistently and it makes me so anxious and nervous. I've told him again and again but every time, weed &gt; me. I understand that he doesn't bring me with him to go smoke because he knows I can't stand being around smoke, but I honestly wish he could just stay with me or just not invite me? Sometimes I get it and I'll just try and politely go home, but he'll get upset that I don't want to stay. I've only left a party once after he ditched me, and he was angry with me for the whole day afterwards. \n\nIdk who's the asshole here.\n\nTl:dr bf wants me to go parties with him and he promises me he won't ditch me for weed. Then he ditches me for weed. And I get upset and he says it's because I don't like the smoke.  I remind him of the promise and he promises he won't do it again.  Cue to him doing it again. If I don't go to a party, he gets upset and says I never wanna do anything with him. If I leave halfway, he'll be angry with me for being rude. ",

I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Just back from a run this evening. I’m running on the pavement with the traffic behind me. It’s a fairly busy road and I wouldn’t feel too comfortable jumping into the road without looking due to a lot of bikes and buses on this road. When people are on the pavement blocking my path, they usually see me and move out the way if we are going opposite directions, or if we are going the same direction, I usually shout ahead and everyone let’s me through happily.\n\nI was running towards a couple with the woman pushing a pram on the house side of the pavement and the man was walking beside her. I was running on the “road” side of the pavement and made it very clear I was running towards the man, hoping he’d move. I was running fast and didn’t want to check the road behind and run round them. The man doesn’t move and I slow down till I’m right in front of him and shout at them “can you get out the way, im running ffs”. Their reply, “what?? Excuse me?!” was a reaction of bemused and anger and of a “I can’t believe someone actually shouted at us for not moving” tone. I ran past them having slowed right down to a walk, checked the road was clear and ran round them.\n\nI made it clear, to me atleast, that I was not expecting the woman to move her pram and that the man should move as I was running on his side of the pavement. I can run past people in single file but walking two abreast, to me, is moronic and inconsiderate whether I was running or walking.\n\nI semi doubted my actions afterwards and I know there’s the argument that pavements aren’t designed for running so AITA?",

      "description": "Okay, I have a friend who I love dearly, she's a good person. She gets disability and hasn't had a stable place to stay since October of 2017. Unfortunately she won't quit using meth. She got 800.00 on the first of the month and was completely broke by the ninth. She seemed high yesterday when I saw her, I confronted her about it and she didn't say anything. I even asked her what did she do with it all? Where did you spend it at? She has no tag on her car, no cigs and no where to go. I told her I know exactly where it went. It went in a pipe. She comes over here expecting me to bail her out. I have no gas and no where to go. Am I an asshole to raise hell at her, sick and tired of her living a messy lifestyle? She stays with strange dudes, she's in her fifties and I told her I'm scared something bad is going to happen to you and you deserve better. What exactly did you think was going to happen spending every dime you have and having nothing to fall back on to last you the month? I gave her 12.00 and sent her on her way. I'm so fucking done with this learned helplessness, this I fucking refuse to help myself and I expect you to take care of me for three weeks because I want to stay fucked up. I am probably the asshole, I didn't let her sleep here last night ( I made her sleep in her car, mostly out of tough love, if she sees that she's not going to be rescued then maybe she will be more responsible). I have tried multiple times to help her, to get her to send her debit card here so we can work together about managing her money. I don't know what else to do. I think she needs to be in a group home, she is very child like in the way she spends her money. She buys stupid shit then doesn't have her bills paid then gets evicted. Either that or overdraws her checking account. She thinks that everyone should be responsible for her and she doesn't have to be. I have a daughter to worry about she's a full grown adult. I don't know honestly if she literally can't take care of herself, as in the mental capacity to do so or she just refuses to. I had to kick her out last summer for it, she threatened to kill me and was mean to my daughter high on meth. To make this worse is the fact she is a paranoid schizophrenic. You can't fucking use meth being schizophrenic, it induces psychosis!!!! what the fuck! Someone please help me here! I feel awful but I can't keep rescuing someone who won't save themselves. I can't do their footwork. Ugh.",

She's been nothing but an amazing parent and she and my dad are perfect in every way, except one thing: my mum is a regular smoker.\n\nShe is a science teacher, she teaches about the dangers of smoking and what problems it can cause later in life, yet almost every day for the past 30 years she's been a smoker. I understand what I'm proposing is manipulative, and I wouldn't even consider it under normal circumstances:\n\n- Yesterday, my dad told me that my grandad was diagnosed with lung cancer, after being hospitalised for the past week because he has a stroke. My grandad has been a heavy smoker all his life.\n\n- A couple years ago my mum's mum was diagnosed with lung cancer, and now has 60% lung capacity because of surgery. She was and even now is still a heavy smoker.\n\n- A decade ago my mum's dad died of a heart attack. He'd previously has another heart attack AND had a major stroke. He was a smoker.\n\nI've seen what smoking does to people, and I don't want that for my mum. My nan had to carry an oxygen concentrator when she visited us because that was the only way she could be mobile, for god's sake. My mum even quit smoking with my nan after she was diagnosed, but about a year ago she started again..\n\nWhen I was walking with my dad about his dad's prognosis, he mentioned that my mum was probably going to die of a stroke. It all just hit me, that **she will die because of this.** My dad gave up smoking a couple of decades ago, and he was furious when my mum started again.\n\nI want to save my dad from having to live through a third family member having a stoke. I want to stop all this fucking pain because of a single fucking addiction. I love my parents so much and it kills me to see my mum killing herself with this habit...\n\nI'm seriously considering taking drastic measures. I'm going to plead with my mum to stop, but if she doesn't then I'll make her think I've taken it up. She's directly promised me never to become a smoker, but if she doesn't stop I don't think I have a choice.\n\nSo yeah. I just feel so helpless, and this is potentially my last ditch effort. Am I the Asshole here? What else can I do?\n\n**tl;dr**: 3/4 grandparents have suffered from smoking. My mum is a regular smoker and she's going to smoker her way to an early grave. None of my direct family want this. Is pretending to take it up a step too far?",

      "description": "Ok so backstory: last night I saw pretty suspicious behavior from my mom on her phone. She kept on wanting me to go to work today and wanting me outside the house, which I felt was off. So I decided to have a look through it when she was asleep and I saw her texting a family friend weird things like “daddy” and “I’m on my period, not in the mood”. I was pretty shook. I decided to look through her search history and saw her searching for “sexy kissing” pics and “love” pics on google. I went through her recently deleted and unfortunately saw a pic of her in her underwear. \n\nI confronted the family friend on WhatsApp before telling my mom first, and basically told him to fuck off and don’t text my mom. I was able to see what they said to each other because I opened WhatsApp web last night and could basically see their chats. I saw him text her that they “had a big problem” and that I know everything. \n\nNow when I confronted my mom she kept on denying it. She said that I saw it in a wrong way (what other way is there to see “daddy”?) and that she was planning a summer visit to India with him and planning on how to pay for it to surprise my dad. They both kept on denying it. She kept on saying why would I cheat now in my 50s (mind you my dad is outside the country). \n\nNow I’m really stuck in crossroads. Is she actually cheating? Or am I seeing this the wrong way? ",

      "description": "So I was having issues with my car and my parents helped me get a new one and even put it in my name. I was in a little debt from school so I honestly didn't have really any money at all. I didn't ask them to give me a car but they offered, so I took it. It  was a piece of crap car, probably worth around $2000. Nothing Fancy. I paid for repairs on the new car and got new tires. So I spent at least a few hundred. I wasn't expecting to keep it forever but at least a year or two. So then I started my job full time (I had to wait a few months before they would let me) and started getting paid decently well. Then my dad randomly says he wants the car back so he can sell it to pay for his garage on his retirement house.... Yes his retirement house. I said ok but was pissed off. I ended up ignoring him and haven't really talked to him sense. (6 months ago) I mean I think it's fair that I'm a little more concerned about my student debt than your retirement house garage. I don't even have the money to buy a car. So I just kept it since it was under my name and there wasn't anything he could do. I feel slightly bad, like I abused my parents trust but at the same time I feel like they couldn't even empathize with the position I was in. I feel like it put a bit of a strain on our relationship even though we don't talk about it. I'm just beginning to be financially secure and I didn't want to fuck that up though. I don't ask them to pay anything and am completely independent otherwise. I have my own health insurance(I could legally be on theirs since I'm 24), car insurance, phone bill, apartment, do my own taxes (mom is a CPA), etc. Literally this is the only thing.",

      "description": "He (let’s call him T) was abusive (emotionally, physically, sexually), and my boyfriend (let’s call him A) doesn’t know much about it, I don’t talk about it a lot, even if I want to. I’m usually scared of not being believed, or being told that I’m exaggerating and playing the victim. \n\nA hates T, but for less-than-ideal reasons. A doesn’t know much about the relationship, but he knows a few details, which in itself are bad enough for him to hate T. But he hates T because of a recent incident that took place. \n\nT started talking to me, and at some point, he tried initiating a sexual conversation. He lives a state away, for context, this happened over a phone call. I didn’t play along, but he sounded so desperate, like he needed me, and I made the (poor) decision of telling him that I’m always going to want A. I didn’t go into details of my sex life, but it was more along the lines of “You don’t want to know about the way he makes me feel?” etc.  I know it was wrong, and it’s sadistic of me, but it was the first time in 5 years that I ever felt a mini victory between T and I. \n\nWhen I told A about it, he was pissed. He kept asking me why I didn’t cut it off, why I engaged at all, and I blurted out a pretty serious incident of sexual assault so he could see where I was coming from, to explain the dynamics between us. I took responsibility for the call, and I didn’t use the incident as an excuse, I was just trying to explain to him what he kept asking me. A is usually empathetic, but that day, he didn’t even acknowledge the assault, and I felt like everything I was afraid of was coming true. He said I was making it all about myself. It’s been over a month, and he still hasn’t acknowledged the incident I told him about. \n\nWe got past it, but only with me profusely apologising. I know it was my fault, but it affected me. I have other serious mental illnesses, which often endanger me physically, but rn, I can’t trust him. \n\nMy ex, for all his manipulative ways, is great with words. He knows the tone to take with me that gets me into “little space”, where I give up all control and let him tell me what to do. Usually that’s hurtful, but in situations where I’m in physical danger, it works temporarily. \n\nBoth A and I have our exams, which are pretty important. I don’t want to talk to A about this rn, and I’m myself trying to just survive these exams. I’m quite stressed. I texted T everytime I felt unsafe, and he helped me out (he plays the ‘nice guy’ bit in my life, but he still has control/anger issues). I know my relationship with A won’t survive if I tell him about these conversations, which is why I plan not to, and instead get over the incident after the exams with my therapist’s help. I only text T out of self preservation, bec my therapist is not available right now. \n\nOfc it’s wrong, I’m just trying to figure out how much of an asshole I am in this situation. ",

      "description": "I’ve been dating this guy for a while and we were out last night and he kept on texting his ex gf late at night when we were both drunk. I am aware that they speak to each other occasionally but he doesn’t usually do it in front of me and for so long. He texted her while we waited for our uber, in the uber, and back at my house. They were sending messages back and forth and she was sending him massive paragraphs. When I told him about it at home he said that nothing is going on and that she just ‘wanted to clarify one thing’ and that they talk but it’s never inappropriate. But I saw him messaging her for ages and they always add and remove each other in fb and apparently it’s because she keeps on blocking him when he’s seeing me to get his attention. We are in an ldr and he lives six hours away so we see each other around once a month if that matters. I cried and then we had sex and then I cried again and then we kinda just went to sleep. He also said that he would block her if I wanted him to and I said no and it’s fine. At some point idk why but I said ‘If it were reversed then I’d just expect you to trust me’ (I was drunk tbf) and he did this patronizing face and said yeahhhhh. The next morning when I apologized for possibly overreacting he just said ‘yeah was a bit odd’ and he didn’t apologize and we didn’t talk about what they talked about or what’s going on. I still had a bitter taste in my mouth about the whole thing and tried to tell him that I need him to be sensitive to my emotions because then I’ll just keep on getting hurt and he said ‘yeah I know that’s why I’m not mad’ which stung in itself. So ultimately, am I overreacting? Should I just leave it alone? I kinda regret saying anything and feel crazy and jealous \n",

      "description": "I was at a baseball game recently and it was getting into the 2nd or 3rd inning and I put my foot up on the seat in front of me. No one was sitting there so I didn't think twice about doing it. The guy one whole seat over asked me to take my foot off of the seat. I admit I was a little annoyed but I obliged. I said, \"Sorry about that that\" and moved my foot over yet another entire seat. So now there are two entire seats between his body and my seat. I asked him, \"Does this bother you\"? He then moved the two seats over and and with both hands flung my foot off of the seat. I will admit that I was angry and in my anger I asked, \"what the fuck is your problem\"? Or something similar. I was angry enough that I don't remember. (I've texted my BIL to see if he remembers if any of you care or think it is relevant.) Suffice it to say it wasn't nice whatever is was. He refused to look at me. Now that there was someone sitting in front of me I refrained from putting my feet on the seats. \n\nHowever, after that I went from peacefully enjoying opening day with my BIL to being angry. I saw that he was wearing a jersey from the other team so whenever my team did something good I cheered obnoxiously. We were down by a couple runs at that point so there wasn't much to cheer about. For example, loud clapping (more than was necessary) and high fivng the people around us like it was my job. After a half inning he left and did not return. I'm assuming to find better seats. \n\nI don't want to mislead you fine people but, before the incident I was sitting in the sits doing what people do at baseball games. This guy didn't even exist to me. There was no previous conflict. In fact it was pretty serene. I was just thinking about maybe getting a hot dog when this all went down.",

      "description": "Ok, I'll try to make this short, but I want to be fair to my fiance and give his side as best as I can, so I might do a shitty job of being brief.\n\nMy fiance and I have a 3 year old son and we've been together for 5 years. He works a full time job, as do I, and he just went back to school to finish his last semester of college (he failed a couple of courses last time he went 2 years ago, I'll get to that). His job is shift work, and he rotates between afternoons (3-11pm) and nights (11pm-7am). During the day, he goes to school, and he squeezes studying and sleeping in between those hours.\n\nI work a full time job in a city just over an hours job away if traffic is good. It's a very demanding job, and I often have to take work home with me. I do the majority of the care of our son, obviously because my fiance is so busy. I'm also 6 months pregnant.\n\nNow, the AITA part. My fiance often spends very long hours in the garage, staying up all night studying or doing other projects (he's just getting into wood working and likes doing renos on our house). The big issue though is that my fiance is an alcoholic. 90% of the time he pulls these all-nighters, he drinks. He's often running himself dead because his life is so demanding right now, and to top it off he refusing to see my view: that staying up all night like he does is a terrible, negative habit that is destroying him and our relationship. I've argued that he doesn't study as effectively if he's running on no sleep and drinking. I've tried explaining that it's terrible for his health. I've tried explaining that when he does this, it falls on me to make sure that he gets out of bed to go to work and go to school, and he's damn near impossible to wake up. He often gets mad at me for waking him. It's also the exact kind of environment and habit he should be avoiding because he trying to quit drinking. This kind of behaviour is why he ended up failing the two courses he's retaking in the first place. \n\nThe biggest kicker is, though, that I just really want to spend more time with him. I feel so alone, and I feel like he could spend more time with his family if he just chose to sleep at night and do the things he needs to do during the day/evening. He misses out on spending time and doing things with us and he doesn't see it because he's not there to notice it. I even offered to help him study. He's a wonderful person that works harder than anyone I know. I love him very much.\n\nHe says that I'm being controlling and selfish because this is one thing he enjoys doing and I want to take it from him. He says he feels like a puppet on a string that is expected to do things when I want regardless of how he feels. He explained that he works shift work and his sleep schedule is messed up to begin with, so he can't always sleep. \n\nI could go on for a while longer, especially about his drinking, but I want to keep it to just this one thing\n\nTL;DR: My fiance works full time and goes to school part time, and often stays up all night drinking and studying. AITA for wanting him to spend more time with his family and go to bed at night instead?",

      "description": "Throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my main one.\n\nIt snowed a whole lot where we are last night and the roads were super scary and bad. I picked my boyfriend up and brought him to my apartment. He had a bag so he was sleeping over, a nice surprise. I told him that I would not drive him to work in the morning because I did not expect the roads to clear up and it was very scary driving to pick him up. There is a bus stop two or three blocks from my apt that he could take directly to work.\n\nNext day: He leaves to go to the bus stop and when he sees the streets he immediately snapchats me that I am an ass for not driving him because the streets are fine (which I did not know). He gets to the bus stop and asks me to drive him because the bus won't be there for another 10 minutes or so. I am mildly sick and he was already at the bus stop so I said no, that I would probably get to him at the same time as the bus anyway.\n\nSo he's all mad at me now for not driving him and I'm mad at him for being mad at me because I do not owe him rides, he should plan better to get to his job, and he called me an ass without apologizing. His unwillingness to forgive me has me wondering...Am I the asshole?",

Man also experiments with party drugs and struggles with depression. (Was not aware of drugs at the time) Man treats woman like she’s a crazy stalker, and not the woman who would call and check on him when he was frequently struggling with depression and drinking. \n\nFlirting - defined as putting hands around waist, playing with hair, touching each other’s face, sharing drinks, winking, smiling, the whole awkward staring into someone’s eyes thing, frequent extended hugs (Lasting over 30 seconds) and leaning into each other, kisses on cheek, etc.\n\nMan is blocked and out of her life at this point. Woman still feels paranoid that it was something wrong with her. \n\n(Just a note, I wrote this post like this to try to be as objective as possible.)\n\nAm I the asshole for ignoring him saying “we’re just friends” or is he the asshole for continuing to flirt with a woman even after she tells him she’s in love with him? \n\n\n",

      "description": "This is a very long story of my narcissistic mother. \n\nFrom a very young age, I was emotionally and mentally abused by my mother. She would call me names such as slut and prostitute. She also made me feel extremely insecure about my looks and my weight. She emotionally blackmails me constantly, saying how if it weren't for her, I wouldn't be where I am today.\n\nThis is mostly because her first husband(my biological father) was complete human garbage and it has affected her way of thinking about men and life in general.Luckily, she remarried a man when I was about 10 years old who is now my stepfather, who I am completely grateful for. But because of this, she feels that I owe her forever because she raised me when she quotes, \"I could have just left you to die with your father\"\n\nFast forward now at 25, I've been studying overseas in Australia for 3 years, and planning to stay because I really like it here. I was the one who tried to convince my parents for them not to send me to Australia because it was way too expensive and I didn't want my dad to be so financially burdened. But they told me they think I would have better career opportunities there. So here I am. I found a part time job and tried to helped my dad to reduce some bills like partially supporting two of my siblings who are also studying here with me. One of the major reasons for sending me over is so they can \"find a good husband\". I'm Asian, so I come from a relatively conservative culture. My parents prefer it I stick to my \"own kind\". I have many relatives here and my mother puts them on the pedestal as my cousins have managed to find good and rich husbands of \"their own kind\" and live such a happy life, so I should be like them. \n\nI'm dating an Australian man, who treats me well, respects me, supports me more than anyone I have ever dated regardless of race. My parents disapprove of him being alot older than me and they disapprove that he is not of \"my own kind\", claiming that Australians have high tendency to be abusive, rapists etc which I find complete and utter bullshit. After finding out I have been dating him for months, my mom confronted me and said I should break up with him and move to another state. I told her no because I am an adult so I can make my own decisions.\n\nYou must be wondering how I know what she's doing back home. I have a 20 year old sister back home who being verbally abused by my parents as well. She has no reason to exaggerate or lie to me about what my mom has been saying because she would actually benefit from it more by siding with my mother. My sister is the only one in the family who stands by my side. My mother has successfully turned everyone else against me, like my dad and younger brother.\n \nMy mother has also tarnished my name in my hometown to my friends and extended family by telling everyone that I'm a useless whore who left the family. I feel like cutting my mother off is the best solution for my own wellbeing and sanity. ",

I was told about this about 2 weeks ago and flat out said I'm not going to go to that restaurant because my dad used to be a manager there and they treated him extremely badly and basically forced him to quit. This was in 2014 and I won't forget the shit they put my dad through and it was a terrible thing to do to another person. I told my GF that but she's like how it was so long ago and its a really good place now I doubt they treat their employees like that still. I just told her I don't want to spend money at a place that treated my dad so badly. I told her I'll see her sister the next day and get her a gift. She called me an asshole and said I'm being inconsiderate.\n\nAITA?",

It was in dreads, tied up on top of his head so the bleached ends were all sticking out kinda like a koosh ball (that's a dumb comparison but it's all I can think of) and some of the dreads had these little gold ringlets on them, I thought it was really cool, so I said ''Hey I love your hair, those ring things are really cool\" and the guy said thanks in kind of a monotone/emotionless voice, but he talked like that the whole time we were there so I figured that was just how he talked. After we left, my friend told me I shouldn't have said anything, and that it sounded like I was making fun of him, and that he doesn't need approval from some random white guy. Said friend is mixed, her mom is black and her dad is white, I didn't mean anything by the comment, I genuinely just thought his hair was really cool. AITA?",

      "description": "AITA for thinking my guy friend is sketchy and should reimburse me some medical expenses?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi all! Throwaway so my real account doesn't get doxxed in case someone I know stumbles upon this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago, I went out with a group of friends and drank extremely heavily. I woke up in a guy friend's bed ( aren't super close but are definitely friends) and he informed me we'd had sex the night before. I had zero real memory of this occurring. I had always thought he was cute, and though I hadn't ever actively considered sleeping with him I believed him when he said I was in to it and wanted it, even though I must have been super drunk because I've never blacked the point where I don't remember an ENTIRE block of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm on birth control, but it failed and shortly after we had sex I had a positive pregnancy test. I then went to my OB/GYN and found out that I'd essentially had been pregnant and suffered a very early miscarriage. He'd be the father, as I hadn't had sex with anyone but him. I had to have my birth control device (IUD) changed out and several ultrasounds bc any IUD associated pregnancy is extremely risky. I later had very heavy vaginal bleeding as a result of the hormone changes, having the IUD changed out, etc and ended up in the ER. All of this resulted in about $1500 worth of medical bills. I brought this up to him and he wasn't keen on helping out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit, AITA for even expecting him to contribute a small financial amount? AITA for thinking the way we had sex in the first place is super sketchy based on how drunk I must have been? A friend implied he'd essentially assaulted me and i dont know what to think. i appreciate any input!!!",

At the time i kinda had romantic feelings for her but they weren't strong enough for me to like do anything about it and since they were dating i was like duh no chance but i was fine with that because I was doing my own thing and exploring myself I wasn't in a state to have a relationship at that time but do keep in mind I was not the reason they broke up.\n\nBut Now things have changed 3 weeks ago I started talking HR and she told me that she and GB broke up because reasons. I didn't know that at the time everyone was kept in the dark about it.\n\n So I felt like wow I waited awhile to ask her out and when I did she said um yes of course. Now I told some people in our friend group and was met with immediate backlash with them saying how awful I am, that I shouldn't be doing this, and how that I'm only doing it to cause drama which is not the case.\n\nSo right now I'm at a loss my reasoning is that relationships are about trial and error and thar if it didn't work out then respect each other and move on and not take any hostility towards their new S/O but apparently not and now I'm doubting myself \n\nSo WIBTA if I started to date her\n\n",

      "description": "     I have an ex-friend that says she has a “diagnosed phobia of vomit”. For the purpose of this story, we’ll call her X. Some of my friends and I were talking in a group chat, and one of my friends (let’s call her Y) started sending very fake looking stock photos of people vomiting for some reason. Jokingly, I said “you should send those to X”. My friend actually sent them to her, and X called back sobbing and threatening to call the cops. \n     Y was understandably upset that I told her to send them, because I convinced her to send the photos and then she had to deal with X and her reaction. I thought Y knew about her phobia, and therefore wouldn’t send them to avoid triggering her. Y didn’t know, and sent her the photos because I told her to. I didn’t stop Y from sending the photos, but I didn’t really have much of a chance to as it was too late when I learned that she had actually sent them. The photos were very cartoonish and fake-looking, and I am having trouble believing that it would evoke such a response in her. X is known to overreact to everything and seek for attention. \n     The next day, I had a serious allergic reaction while I was running, and I started to go into anaphylactic shock. I had the worst itching of my life, my throat started to close up, I experienced the worse stomach cramps I’ve ever had, threw up multiple times, nearly shit myself, and I literally couldn’t walk so I had to be picked up in a truck by a park ranger and driven to the trail entrance so the ambulance could take me to the hospital. If it wasn’t for the two friends I had helping me and calling the park ranger, I could have died. The experience was traumatic for me and it took me a while to get over it. \n     I was still recovering from the physical symptoms of the allergic reaction when I heard X went around telling people that “going into anaphylactic shock was karma for what I did to her”. I can’t believe she thinks I deserve that for jokingly telling a friend to send her badly faked pictures of someone throwing up. I understand that phobias can be serious, but knowing her I feel like she overreacted and exaggerated her phobia for attention because that’s just the type of person she is. \n     Am I the asshole for telling Y to send those photos, even though I wasn’t serious? Am I justified in being upset at what X said, or did I deserve anaphylactic shock?\n     TL;DR: I used to be friends with someone who has a vomit phobia. As a joke, I tell one of my other friends to send her some obviously fake photos of people vomiting. She goes hysterical, cries and threatens to call the police. The next day, I nearly die from an allergic reaction and she tells people that I deserved it for what I did to her. ",

      "description": "My brother and my stepdad hate each others’ guts. I don’t want to get too into their history, because it’s winding, complicated and personal, so I’ll summarise it as quickly as I can. My stepdad has been around since we were 2 and 3 respectively. When we were young, we were very close. As we got older, my stepdad was very very strict and could be very cruel verbally at times. My brother was extremely wild and did a lot of dangerous and illegal things. I want to say that I genuinely don’t think either of them is blameless, though I genuinely think I’m too close to the issue to asses it objectively, seeing as I grew up alongside my brother. \n\nA few years back, they had a really big falling out. They both said a lot of terrible and very over the line things and they both made a lot of threats. My brother left by choice and my stepdad was glad. My brother is 24, lives in an apartment paid for by our biological dad (who has never been much of a dad to either of us in any ways except occasionally financial). It’s a very upper class, expensive apartment. He has no job and receives hundreds of dollars per week from both our parents and grandparents. \n\nMy mother has spent the last three years trying to force them to make peace. It’s very, very painful for her and has taken a huge toll on both relationships. My brother says my mum should’ve picked us over our stepdad. Every time we see my brother, my mum tries to convince him that they should make peace. My brother swears and screams and often walks off. In 3 years, his answer has never wavered.\n\nEvery year, we go away one night for Christmas. I’m on that night away as we speak. My mother brought it up (they’re both intoxicated) and my brother got angry immediately and started telling her if she kept doing it, he’d leave. \n\nMy mum asked me, in front of my brother, to tell my brother he should do it. She got emotional and begged me to tell him he has to forgive my stepdad. I said I didn’t want to be involved (a stance I’ve held for all 3 years) and she got very angry and now won’t speak with me.\n\nMy problem with taking a side is that I’m very torn. My relationships with both my brother and stepdad are very, very tense. My brother is known to fly off the handle and I’m afraid that if I tried to take a side, he’d never forgive me and I’d be burned out too. I genuinely believe I’m too close to the situation. I have a lot of feelings about both of them and my opinion changes a lot depending on what happens and how people act. I feel like I’m too close to it all to decide and like I don’t want to sway people to do “the right thing” when I’m not even sure what the right thing is.\n\nOn the one hand, my brother is selfish, angry and aggressive. On the other, I know he harbours a lot of abandonment issues and that he’s still very hurt and emotional about my stepdad. My stepdad is angry, mean and cold. He definitely said things he shouldn’t have said to us (with us as children at the time). On the other hand, he’s been married to my mum almost 20 years and I know she loves him. My mum is overemotional, but she’s also one of my best friends in the word. She desperately wants me to side with her, but I’m afraid by siding with her, I’ll make everything ten times worse.\n\nI hope this doesn’t come across as a shit post or something, because being so close to it and with everyone around me being so emotional with the issue, I’m genuinely unsure if what I’m doing is right. My mum has been loyal to me and I don’t want to be disloyal to her, but I don’t want to force something and make everything worse and potentially lose my brother entirely. \n\nTL;DR: my brother and my stepdad hate each other and my mum wants me to force them to make peace. I don’t feel like I can be a part of it, but that’s making her think I’m disloyal to her. AITA? \n\nAlso, sorry for the formatting, I’m sitting in a hotel on my mobile. ",

      "description": "I (28M) took over my dad's business about a year ago since he passed away. \n\nIt's only a mid sized business. Not at millionaire status or anything but well into six figures at least. My dad treated it like more of a ''caring'' approach to it I guess? Not sure how to describe his attitude about it really, he was just really content and loved life I guess. He liked his business the way it was, and he was good friends with many of the the owners of the local ''rival'' business.\n\nI have wanted to take a different approach to it. I want to win, basically. **I want to destroy my competitors**, I have no delusions of grandeur in that I expect to become a multi-millionaire (so I'll get that out of the way), but I can definitely see a lot of potential for growth. I want them to go out of business and expand.\n\nSo I went for a drink with my sister (24F) and mother (55F) and we had a few drinks. Anyway they ended up asking me about how I feel about taking over that business and whether if that's really what I wanted to do, and I said yes, I then said while a bit drunk ''I want to destroy the competitors'' (well, I actually 'I want to destroy___ and then said the actual names of the local rivals, but I can't say those names here). \n\nThey said I was a huge asshole for having that mentality. But I don't see how....I mean I dabbled a bit into Competition Law once while I was a at uni, and I found myself liking the Chicago school of competition more than the alternatives (e.g. Ordoliberal) but my sister especially went in on me. She said that my mentality is ''toxic'', AITA?",

So I, as probably many of Sims players across the world, made a version of myself in the game and went on into the world to live my life. Couple of hours pass by and I'm getting better at my job, learning how to cook and I got an in-game, virtual, nonreallifeexistant girlfriend. You know what happens next. So my real gf sees that I'm playing Sims, she likes the game as well and starts to watch me playing, we're talking, having fun and then it happened. She saw the \"bitch\" that was in my Sims house. At first she was a little mad but didn't show it I guess. Me, not seeing any signs of annoyance, started interacting with the in-game gf and she kissed me. Then my real life gf flipped the FUCK out. I'm not gonna go into details here but she's still not talking to me and it's the day after. I tried to talk to her about it, explaining that it just a game, hell, even saying that I will BREAK UP with the gf in the game. Nothing is working.

      "description": "This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.\n\nI am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like \"Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19.\" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.\n\nBut there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.\n\nI was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.\nIt all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.\n\nShe had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's\", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.\n\nI was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.\n\nShe is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.\n",

      "description": "Alright,\n\nso my friend recently introduced a girl into my friend group, who are mostly guys. I recently broke up from a bad relationship and became attracted to this girl very quickly because she is very chill to be around and I am probably desperate. I don't know her that well and know that I am indulging in most of my insecurities here, so much of my feelings are based on irrational thoughts. \n\nI get these flare ups of jealousy, mostly minor, when she is interacting with other people in my friend group but not me. I am able to push these feelings to the side mostly but they tend to come up every now and again. I am by no means mean are possessive outwardly towards my friends and I like them, but when this girl is interacting with my other friends and not me, I get this twinge of jealousy even though she has interacted with me before. Its like I have to automatic possessive desire to have her to myself and have her only interact with me, but I resist it because I know its bullshit and she is her own person and wants to be friends with all of us, not me.\n\n The idea of getting into a relationship with her actually concerns me because I am afraid the insecure habits and emotions that developed in my last relationship would affect any potential (and extremely unlikely) relationship with her as I would just become a total dick. \n\nAITA for even having these feelings? I push them to the side most of the time but I am sure they are unconsciously affecting my behavior to be more possessive in my mind. To clarify, this is all mild in my mind and I do not make it a problem for my friend group in any way, and I have not outright told anyone in the friend group of my attraction. Also, I am getting no signs from her that she is interested and consciously think it is ridiculous that I would be attracted to her this quickly. My thoughts and desires are igniting primal possessiveness in me. ",

      "description": "Oh, boy.\n\nI should probably say one thing. I’ve probably lied about my age on other posts, sorry if there’s any inconsistencies. I am a 14 year old.\n\nI’m going to go ahead and type this out - My mother has a boyfriend, he’s lived with us (and my grandmother, who has had a stroke) for maybe 1 year and a half? God, it feels like longer.\n\nWe’ll call my mother’s boyfriend “Stevie”. Stevie is awful to my mother. I could talk about him for hours, so sorry if I talk about him for too long. Feel free to skip to the TL;DR.\n\nStevie often has arguments with my mother. I’d say twice a month. In these, He accuses her of something she didn’t do, throws something, and goes into HER room like a bratty child.\n\nSometimes, he leaves. This has always been for about a week though. Once we got lucky and Stevie left for almost a month. He then comes back, says he’s “sorry”, and he invites himself back in.\n\nMy mom only kept him around for what may sound like a selfish reason. When me and my mother had to leave somewhere, we needed someone to take after my grandmother, which because of the stroke, makes her not think correctly.\n\nI’m going to be honest. It was also because of money. We are in a very bad money situation. Anyway, I’ve heard him call my mother a slut more times than I can count.\n\nI used to cry and be upset, but now I’m just angry. I’m angry at him for acting less mature than me, though I am only 14 years old. \n\nHowever, I’m also angry at my mom. She kept this man around even though he was treating her like this. I’m angry at my Grandmother, as well.\n\nI’m currently typing this because they’re having another argument again, and I feel so angry at this man I want to do something, though I know not to.\n\nAm I the Asshole for being mad at my family? I will be honest, I personally don’t think I am. However, other’s do.\n\nTL;DR, My mother has a boyfriend who is an awful person to her on top of being immature, and I’m mad at my household for keeping him around.\n\nSorry for any grammatical errors or if this post was all over the place.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT\n\nJesus, nobody will see this, but Incase someone does see this, he finally left. I feel fully calm and safe for the first time in years. Thank you to everyone who commented something or even just read my post. Both of those things made it surprisingly easier. So, thank you. ",

      "description": "So this happens from time to time so what I’m about to post is not the only time but the last. \n\nI’ve received a message from a dude I didn’t know on facebook and let’s be real, we all know where this is going. He said that he wanted us to get to know eachother. I replied “sorry, but I am not interested” because I was not born yesterday. This “I messaged you just to be friends” is the oldest trick in the book in order to get to a girl and I have a boyfriend so this doesn’t fly. \n\nBut let’s say he gets the benefit of the doubt and truly just wants to be friends. Why would I want a random ass dude that messaged me online as my friend? I barely have time to keep in touch with my old friends, let alone a guy that is not in my group of friends, is not in my uni and we have nothing in common in general so I’d have to rip time from my schedule specially for him, a stranger. I also feel like the friendship would be forced and not “natural” at all.\n\nHe immediately got mad and started asking me questions like “why are on social media then? To gain likes on your pics?” “It hurts to have one more friend? and passive aggressive things like “excuse me that I did not have the chance to meet you in person”. \n\nTo me, it is pretty clear that he was under the impression I would accept the friendship and he would have the chance of asking me out, while it is very clear from my profile that I have a boyfriend. Further proof of how this is not about a friendship (if more was needed) is that he messaged my twin sister as well. \n\nTL:DR A random guy messaged me on facebook claiming he wanted a “friendship” when he knew nothing about me apart from how I looked and I turned him down which made him mad. \n\nAITA for turning it down?

      "description": "A large number of my friends had conflicting opinions on the subject, so I'll throw it to reddit at large. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst and foremost, I am not a fan of the tipping culture in general. I think it's preposterous that servers, drivers, or members of any profession should be paid less than minimum wage with the assumption that tips will make up the difference. That being said, I accept that the system is not going to change anytime soon, and so I make sure to tip decently when I visit restaurants. (Never less than 15% unless the server was actively rude, 20% as a baseline for slightly above average service). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, when I order delivery, in addition to an expected tip, there is a flat delivery charge (usually $2) that is explicitly NOT a tip to the drivers. Because of this, I have developed a system where, when I do order out by myself, I usually order a few meals, eat one immediately, and have the others as leftovers. In this case, I tip 20% of what one meal would have cost, on top of the standard delivery fee. This dilutes the fee and the tip over several meals, making the price of delivery worth it for me. The amount of work that the driver does is unchanged from 1-3 meals, so I feel that tipping the same amount is justified. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis leads to a second discussion. I brought up my habits at a party last night, and got mixed responses. One friend, who had been a delivery driver in the past, claimed that this was unacceptable. He told me that his wages were only $4/hr, that his only other income was tips, and that even with 20% tips he would often not make minimum wage. I agreed with him that the system was flawed, and told him that everyone in his position should simply find another job. If enough drivers don't keep their position due to the unfair system, wages will increase. (He had already done this, moving from food delivery to another, standard salary job). In areas of poverty, I understand that sometimes, you take what you can get, but this is a middle class neighborhood with plenty of jobs available that do not require any significant level of education. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, reddit, AITA for (1) ordering more food for takeout but tipping the same, and/or (2) believing that workers should protest a crappy system by changing jobs?

      "description": "I live with 3 other girls, one of whom we'll call Katie. This is the first year I've lived with any of these girls and initially things were great. We're all on the same university course, were spending lots of time together, etc etc. Back in September, 3 weeks after we moved in, Katie organised my 21st birthday party. She really went to town. She bought a cake, a bottle of tequila, made a fun quiz about me for the party and came up with what my flatmates should get me. I had a great time! I have social insecurities and felt very loved. I was and still am grateful for all this effort she went to. A few weeks later, I signed a lease with her and 2 other girls to live with her next year.\n\nSince then, things have gone south. By November, it was clear that Katie and I weren't getting on. I felt like she often spoke down to me and made me out to be stupid, was snappy and generally rude to me. She also acts this way to my other flatmate Gemma. This behaviour was picked up by my other flatmates too. There have been a handful of fall-outs, I've reached out to her to make amends, asked if I've done anything wrong but all in all its been a fairly direct conflict-free relationship. \n\nI now actively dislike Katie. She complains all the time, makes a huge deal out of her problems, tries to one up me and Gemma, disagrees with us just to disagree...She has blamed me for things going wrong which have been nothing to do with me, bitched about me to my other flatmates, rolled my eyes at me when I've contributed to group work at uni...it's a hostile environment and I try my best not to rise to it. It's worsened my social anxieties and is a contributing factor to starting CBT a month ago.\n\nKatie's birthday is in 2 weeks and is having a dinner party style celebration in our flat. She's inviting our friendship group (we share most of our friends) and asking everyone to bring a dish. If this wasn't in my flat, I wouldn't go but really want to avoid sparking any drama. However, I'm torn as to whether to get her a present or even a card. I want to avoid making a statement by not getting her anything or stir up any drama, yet I don't really think she deserves anything from me. That said, I'm still grateful for the effort she put into my birthday. Gemma is getting her a card and present as they'd been best friends for a few years before this and I don't think Katie knows that Gamma doesn't consider her a friend any more. \n\nSo, WIBTA for not getting her a present? Should I just get her a card? Or even nothing at all? \n\nTldr; I don't like my flatmate. She organised my birthday party. WIBTA for not getting her anything for her birthday?",

      "description": "I have a friend who for about a month started flirting with me. For the most part they were little things a few times a day, winking or sticking their tongue out at me when things said could be taken \"sexually\". But sometimes there were events that really took it farther like \"I know you wanna touch my butt\" and offering me the opportunity or verbally suggesting other romantic or \"sexual\" things rather than the more subtle winking. It was at a point where several of our mutual friends believed they were interested in me. Until after a month of it they somewhat abruptly declared that they is not interested in me or anyone else in the friend group and would never date any of us. Unknown to them I did have a crush on them before the flirting started, but I would rather keep a friend than risk losing it over that.\n\nFor the next few days I spent very little time with friends. I had a big homework assignment to do so they felt like I was avoiding them, which I kind of was. I needed time alone to get over the \"broken heart\". Afterward we talked a little and they voiced how their flirting meant absolutely nothing and they were not interested in me at all.\n\nNow things are awkward between us and we are no longer as good of friends as we used to be. they claims that since then I am sometimes hostile towards them. I just feel awkward at this point and sometimes jealous of those who are closer friends with them than I am now.\n\nI cannot help but be upset at them and get jealous or hurt. I am no longer one of their best friends. I know its not 100% their fault but did i overreact? AITA?",

      "description": "My boyfriend (26M) is really sweet, and comes from a less advantaged background than I do.  But, that being said- we’re both in the same graduate school program, so we’re both very capable individuals.  I am really type A, and actively try to figure things out myself.  My boyfriend constantly asks me questions about easily google-able questions, or for the answers to things that I had to figure out myself- i.e. by reading the directions.  Two examples:  \n\n1) He needed his school transcripts for something, so he asked me where and how to get them- I told him the website that our school uses (and its intuitive; login in, select student information, select transcripts - &gt; print), and he literally asked me every single page on the website what to click next, rather than just click around himself. It’s a waste of my time, especially because I already took the time to learn how to use the system.  The same time he could take- but he knows I’ll tel him.  \n\n2) We are in a class together, and there was a homework assignment- and he asked me to explain the assignment to him (which was posted online with directions), and tell him how long it took me to complete.  Telling him how long the assignment took wasn’t a big deal, but read the damn directions! \n\nThese kind of incidences happen daily.  He just never puts in the work to figure anything out- he always asks me.  I’m not a super genius, I just read the directions and investigate!  It’s annoying to feel like I’m always babying someone.  Sometimes I find myself really annoyed about it, and he thinks I’m a jerk for not wanting to help him.  \n\nAITA for not wanting my boyfriend to at least TRY to figure out how to do things himself before asking me?   ",

      "description": "I work at McDonald’s because I’m a teenager wanting to make a little extra money and I thought it was a great place to start. I went to the McDonald’s up the street from me and went in for an application. The next day I turned in my application and got an interview. You know normal stuff for when you get a job. \n\n\nWhen I ended up getting the job my first day of work was just me bagging up the food and handing it out to the people in the dining area. After my first week I started working morning on the weekends and that’s where I met creepo. When he first saw me he was like “so you’re ________.” And I said “yeah this is my first time ever having a job” and he went in for a high five and said “Wow that’s amazing!” When I gave him a high five he kinda held my hand for a minute.  Kinda weird but didn’t think much about it. \n\n\nFast forward to a few weeks working the morning shifts and he decided to move me to drive thru where I take the orders and give the food to the customers. It’s probably my most favorite position. But its always just him and I alone until 11 which gives him at least 4 hours alone with me. This is when he starts to act weirder. \n\n\nI would be taking an order and he’ll come up behind me and start playing with my hair and saying “Look at you working hard.” In the most uncomfortable sexual voice. Then later, I was making an iced coffee for the customer. While I was stirring the spoon around to mix the coffee and the cream he grabbed my arm gently and just held it there. I push my arm away from his grip and he called me rude. \n\n\nI like to do my makeup like many other 16 year old girls do. So I’ll sometimes walk into work after school and have eyeshadow or eyeliner and the first thing he says to me is “You look beautiful today.” And grabs my hand softly like he’s about to hold it. After these encounters with him I decided enough was enough and I told my boyfriend and he called my McDonald’s and talked to the store manager who eventually called me the next day. \n\n\nThe store manager said she’d like to hear both sides of the story but I kind of feel bad for telling on him. I know what he was doing was wrong but I guess I feel bad because I don’t want him to find out I said anything so that if he doesn’t get fired that I’d have to be around him again. Let me remind you, I’m 16 and he’s around mid 40’s.  Pray for me tomorrow when I see him again. ",

      "description": "I go to a community college and a good amount of friends I’ve made this semester are all around 18 (I’m 23). Theres this one guy I’ve been friends with since the beginning of the fall semester that I sometimes give rides home to because 1. It’s RIGHT on the way for me going home and 2. He walks, doesn’t have someone to pick him up, and carries a lot of stuff, especially for the classes he’s taking this semester). \n\nNow, there’s this other guy who is also his age who has been hanging with us a bit more recently this semester. He usually has a ride (I’m assuming from family). One time he wanted to hang out a little bit more after classes with me and my other friend so he asked if he could get a ride home to be able to hang out a little longer and I said sure and he called off his ride. No big deal. \n\nI’ve noticed now he tends to hang around more often after classes and whenever my one friend who walks asks if I could drop him off, he piggybacks on it right after him, which makes me feel like I have to say yes if I said yes to my other friend. He lives about 6 minutes from where I live but at the same time it’s still kind of a detour for me and the car I have isn’t kind with gas; it’s not a lot but it is at the same time. \n\nSo now it’s gotten to the point where it seems like he called off his previous arrangement for rides and kind of assumes I’ll say yes. I had to race home for something I had to do after school the last I saw them and felt bad for having to say no to both, but also to my friend who walks because it was raining and cold that day. Idk hes a really nice guy and I honestly believe he just wants to be able to hang out with us a little bit more, and I kind of feel like a dick for having this bother me so much. So, AITA? \n\nTL;DR am I the asshole for only being okay with giving my friend who walks to school rides, and not to another friend who essentially has a ride but just wants to hang out with us more it seems.

      "description": "Sorry, mobile formatting, TLDR at the end.\n\nSo I was with this girl for around 5 months, and it ended in October last year, before this we were best friends for around a year and she meant everything to me. In the end, she had her reasons for not wanting to continue the relationship, which I respected, these included things such as culture, school stress, and just wanting to be her own person.\n\nWe made the effort to try and remain friends the same way we were before the relationship, which to this day is still happening, which I’m grateful for. She got over the relationship very quickly however,probably around a week or two after we broke up we were texting about feelings and stuff and she mentioned she basically had 0 romantic feelings for me anymore and that I shouldn’t try and get my hopes up of ever getting back with her (this is because I did have and still do have strong feelings for her, she wasn’t saying it to be an ass). \n\nThe problem is, shortly after the break up, she starts hanging around with this guy, who we will call A. She claims that A was a family friend from when she was younger, who didn’t speak to her much during our relationship out of respect. However, she calls him her best friend, but never mentioned him or anything to do with him once in the time we were friends or during the relationship, only after. \n\nDuring our relationship, it definitely seemed as if I would always be the one to initiate anything, intimacy, dates, all of it. She didn’t make to much of an effort to plan things or anything, and would often back out of things due to family stuff which I respected (she has had a rough upbringing so I respected these reasons). \n\nSince we broke up, she has been hanging with A a lot. Like nearly daily going out on drives, going out places to eat etc, none of which she really did with me. \n\nI asked her if they have feelings for each other since we agreed to be open with this sort of stuff shortly after breaking up and she insisted nothing was happening and that he was like a brother to her, but recently she’s admitted they now both have strong feelings for each other and she said she loves him and can’t see herself with anybody else. She’s barely talking to me anymore and is always talking to or is always with this guy, and is not making an effort with me whatsoever despite regarding me as one of her best friends.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for being suspicious that there might have been something going on between my ex and A while we were together?

      "description": "Now to start off, let me say that this isn't a post to get validation, I seriously want to know if I'm being an asshole, or at least, anything less than OK. It's also important to note that nobody has ever called me an asshole over this, it's just something that I myself am worried about.\n\nAnyway, I'm in love with my best (female) friend. I myself am male. During this story, which is still going on right now, we're around ages 16-20.\n\nI became friends with her because I had a crush on her. As soon as I felt it was socially appropriate, which was about 4-5 months into our friendship, I told her that. She said OK, but has basically dodged saying anything about reciprocation. Now, I'm not a dumbass, I know that \"not saying yes\" means \"no\". So I don't make any illusions of her being in love with me. She's basically trying to not hurt my feelings.\n\nHowever, despite this, I'm still in love with her. I don't have any issue with her avoiding the question, and I know that she, currently, isn't interested in a relationship (With anyone). Knowing this, I try to avoid bringing it up to much and try to just stay mostly friends. But I can't get rid of my love for her. I've told her this as well, or at least, I think it was clear from what I've said.\n\nThe big problem is that my wishes for the friendship and hers obviously don't align perfectly. I'd like to have way more contact with her than the other way around. Now, we've devised a situation that mostly works. We meet up at least once a year, possibly more if she wants. I email her every month. And she's 'required' to send me 2 emails per year. Now, when I say emails, these are big emails, usually being 1-3 pages, but I've sent one that was 8,25 pages long. A bit excessive, I know. Plus sometimes, there's some extra contact, like wishing each other a happy birthday, happy new year, all that jazz. \n\nAll in all, I'd say, on average, we meet up around 2 times a year and she emails me a couple of times a year, while I email her every month. This along with little titbits of contact along the way. She has assured me that this isn't something specific to me, and that this is just how she works. This has fluctuated along the years, but so far, the friendship has survived, even despite some (possibly major) issues. I'd obviously like more contact, but I try to respect her wishes.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not always the best at respecting her wishes and boundaries. Often times I get too excited or too depressed and start messaging her a bit too often. For example, while I can keep myself to 1 email per month the majority of the times, I'd say that in 1/3rd of all months, there would be another email. Sometimes, these weren't too big, like responding back to her when she responded, however, I don't think these emails were a real problem. The real problem emails were the ones I sent out of depression, loneliness, or whatever.\n\nI try to restrain myself from sending those emails, and in later times (As in, the last few months), I've been able to do so (Because I currently don't have anything that would lead to me sending those emails). However, previously, I haven't been so lucky. I went almost a whole year sending her 2 emails instead of 1, where I basically split up the month in 2 segments. Now, after she told me that she didn't like it, because it became too much for her, I stopped immediately. But I still did it for the previous few months, and that's something that I can't take back.\n\nThe even bigger problem however, weren't those emails. They weren't the emails I sent out of depression or other things. The emails I did send out of depression were pretty fucking bad. I'd try to always assure her that it wasn't her fault and that I'm merely venting to her about shit, but it basically became a negative feedback loop for myself. As I've said, currently, I've stopped doing so, and don't plan on doing it again, although I don't know if I'll be able to restrain myself from doing so when the going gets tough again.\n\nAnd currently, we've worked out most of these issues and our friendship still stands. We're prepared to face any new issues that might come our way, and the future looks bright. But my question is, was I an asshole for doing that to her in the past, or was it just a series of unfortunate events?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my girlfriend to get rid of this cat",
      "description": "We live together in case anyone needs that clarified ahead of time.\n\nSo \"we\" have two cats. They were both brought in at different times and under the guise of fostering them. The first cat I agreed to foster, but while we were doing that she got attached and wanted to keep the cat. \n\nI said no, I don't want a cat, but she persisted so I made the deal parents often make - she can keep the cat if she takes care of it. She agreed to that and so we fully adopted that cat.\n\nIf my girlfriend went home for a holiday or something, I'll feed the cat and clean the litterbox, but otherwise my girlfriend took care of everything which was fine.\n\nRecently she wanted to foster ANOTHER cat, to which I said no we already have a cat and she would become attached to it. She begged and begged, promised it would only be for 2-3 weeks, and I guess I'm a sucker because I eventually said it was fine if it was only for a short while.\n\nFor reference, minor backstory here. My girlfriend is part of a group that takes care of feral cats in the city. She found this cat while it was basically on the brink of death. He needed his tail amputated and almost had to lose a paw as well. She said that we would only be fostering him until his wounds healed and he was off his medication.\n\nAnyway, that was 4 months ago. I wouldn't really care except that the new cat does not get along with our old cat. He keeps attacking her so we have to keep them separated and my girlfriend keeps trying to involve me more and more with the cats.\n\nOur original cat has grown on me but I'm not particularly fond of this new one because he keeps attacking our old one. I keep asking her when we're going to give him up, but it seems pretty apparent she has no intention of doing that.\n\nWe have to keep the cats separated, which usually means I need to bring our old cat into our office (where she basically lives now) so that the new one doesn't get cooped up in the spare bedroom.\n\nAnyway, I'm just tired of this shit. I felt bad for the cat which is why I eventually caved, but I do NOT want to adopt him. I honestly have no idea why my girlfriend got so attached and won't put him up for adoption. If he got along with our current cat I wouldn't care, but he doesn't and it has been FOUR MONTHS of trying to integrate them. It's clearly not going to work, but she won't stop trying.\n\nI basically bother her every night about when she's going to put him up for adoption or give him to a shelter and recently she's been getting pissy with me about how I can say something like that. It gets pretty close to the point of fighting and I just drop it because I don't care enough to get into a real argument about it, but it bothers me enough to vent about it here and check...\n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting to get rid of this cat?",

      "description": "Okay, throwaway account because personal reasons. Anyways I have a dilemma and am not sure what to do about it. \n\nSo my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year and my close (one might even say best) friend, let's call her Megan, has been making advances that I'm not comfortable with. However, for context, let's start at the beginning.\n\nI introduced her to my boyfriend and they got along pretty well, I thought they were gonna be good friends and things would be good between the three of us. Then he moved around 6-ish months and we're now in a long distance relationship. After that, the red flags started to show up. \n\nShe started tellling me she was jealous of my relationship and that she had gotten romantic feelings for him, my boyfriend and I shut that down. She started talking with him on a practically daily basis, I ignored it because my boyfriend reassured me he was gonna shut down any advances she puts out towards him, and he has. \n\nThe big ones that make me think shit's going down is that she has made it a point to try to invite him to do stuff with her *alone*, ***multiple times*** while I was talking with both of them, I brought up all my concerns to her and she appologized, stating that she was offended I would think that about her. However, I truly believe that I cannot trust her because she has proven that to me through a couple of friends I'm close to that have talked with her, that she says one thing to me, and another thing to them.\n\nI guess I just want to ask if I'm an asshole for thinking there's something there when there might not be?",

      "description": "Moved into an on campus apartment with a close friend and acquaintance, then they went batshit when I decided I was leaving.\n\nBefore December, Everything seemed okay with my roommates.  I did get annoyed with how little they cleaned.  But there wasn’t any problem until I told them that I didn’t want a dog in the apartment. I was really vocal about not wanting a dog and within the week they came to me and told me that they wanted to move because I was messy and I didn’t get along with them. I did the dishes and trash everyday, and was the only person consistently picking up the apartment. I will admit that they probably cleaned up after me three times total, in the entire semester that I lived with them. But it’s not like I wasn’t cleaning up after them almost every week either.\nWhen they found out that the housing policy would require them to pay almost 2k each to leave they dropped the subject and decided to stay. I was pissed at this point and decided to avoid being in the apartment as much as possible, and spent a lot of time studying on campus. I also made sure to never touch their messes to establish how little they do around the apartment.\nAfter having my roommates boyfriend of three days move in for the rest of the semester (who was like four years older than us, and cooked just to leave the pots and pans out for the entire day)  and pretty much having petty fights every two weeks I was pretty tired. After another scuffle, I decided to pick up a friends sublease, and dropped the 2k needed to leave and began to pack up my stuff without telling them. I bought the majority of the cleaning supplies and all of the bowls, plates silverware pots and pans so I knew they were going to be stuck without a kitchen with me leaving so unexpectedly. They came home mid-packing session, and they were mad enough to tell me that they were moving in a week, and told me how rude I was for leaving without notice. We fought over the next two days of me packing and leaving. I had to throw away one of my roommates moldy bathroom rugs during the semester, and after “her mom badgered her about it” I ended up forking over 25$ for a bathroom rug that she said was okay to throw out.\nAfter officially checking out of my “room” I rented I got a call from my roommate accusing me of taking her collectible plastic cups, they were 8$ each and she was “ missing” ten of them. She wanted me to pay 80$ for them. I genuinely thought that maybe I had grabbed them on accident, and after checking ALL of the stuff I packed I realized that the cups were probably back at the apartment. I tried to tell her I didn’t have them and got into a screaming match with her over the phone. 30 minutes later my mom got a call from their parents claiming That I was going to be reported to campus police for stealing almost 100$ of their babies stuff and a bunch of other stuff I didn’t do. Like sell weed out of the apartment, spent all my money on liquor, and forced my roommates to drive me and my drunk friends around. \n\nSo I ghosted them. The semester hasn’t started yet, but I’m worried I’m going to be taken to small claims court over plastic cups ",

      "title": "AITA for thinking my boyfriend is shit at art and for wanting to discourage him from doing a career in animation?",
      "description": "AITA for thinking my boyfriend is shit at art?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend has been pursing a career in art and animation for practically the entirety of our relationship (6+years) and has gotten nowhere. He went to a fancy art school where he worked his ass off for his degree (went to community college first, worked the entire time he was at school, went to food closets, was homeless on and off living out of his car, ect). After we both graduated, we moved in together and I went to get my masters and he went to work in food service. He's been stuck on the idea that he HAS to do animation and hes just waiting for his big break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblem is. He sucks at it.\n\nHe hasn't even made an animation!\n\nYeah his school sucked so much, they didn't even have students make a demo reel. His story ideas are terrible, his artwork is terrible, and it feels like he's done nothing since graduating. I feel terrible for thinking this way and feel like a total asshole for trying to persuade him to seek another career path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Side:** He won't tell me why he wants to do animation specifically (not even the generic, \"I want to make an impact on the world\" kind of thing) and complains that the world is out to get him (often saying he suffers from \"bad luck\" or \"god hates me\" when I feel like it's his life choices hes making). He complains that the animation industry is cutthroat and works you to the bone and how awful it is. He also complains that art is so hard for him and his hand physically hurts when he even thinks about doing something creative. This all prompts me to say, \"If its so terrible and you complain about it so much.... well then why do you want to do it?\" and he goes on and on about how he wants to create a cartoon series and that he wants to put his degree to use. Or he comes up with a different disingenuous answer every time I ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, he started working part time so that he could work on his art more... but he hasn't really done much. He thought he could open commissions up to make some money on the side... but no one has even messaged him about it and its been months. He has no online following and complains about that too. I'm having to pay for a lot of things because he only makes enough to pay his bills and rent (I buy food, pay for any kind of date, pay for getting his car fixed, pay him for gas to get to work, ect). I honestly don't mind if he was happy but he hates this job too, and it sounds like it's not the right fit. He will not seek another job or pick up more hours because he thinks he is not qualified for anything outside food service and retail (not true), he doesn't want to do any more schooling or training for another career path, and he wants his next job to be an animation job and that's that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is also dead set on moving in with his former roommate that lives in LA (I really dislike him and think hes super sexist and a general man-child) so they can make their own TV show and pitch it to studios. Problem is, I think this friend is just as depressed and hasn't done shit either so I don't know how moving in with him would help. But he claims they have brilliant ideas (that I think are bad) and he needs to be in the same room to \"bounce ideas off each other.\" (Skype is out of the question apparently??)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is stressful for me because he won't say when he is going to move, wont make any plans for it, has no savings for it, and doesn't even know how long he will live out there (six months?? a year??? indefinitely????). I'm trying to find my own way in the world as well and it just feels like his ideas are just outlandish based on his skill. It's making it hard to move forward in life and make plans for the future together. We are close to our thirties now and while we are both the definition of late bloomers, I'm kind of tired of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am by no means a saint. I have had to change my career path and tried many different jobs out. I'm not doing a job that matches my degree. I've volunteered at a lot of different places and come at my career goals in non conventional ways. I've learned a lot from all of these experiences about what I want to do with my life. When he looks at jobs, if they aren't animation he wont even both applying. He's worked food service, retail, and that's it and only because he needed a paycheck. Never had an internship, never volunteered anywhere, nothing. I asked him if he would like to volunteer someplace now he's working part time and he said, \"no that will just take time away that I could be spending drawing.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gets very angry and stubborn with me if I mention pursuing a different career path, no matter how gently I say it, and it has been the basis for almost all of our fights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**His side:** He often feels like I dislike his art and am not supportive of him. He says that these things take time and he is working on artwork and has made lots of progress. He also says he is applying for lots of jobs and he goes to (expensive!) animation conventions to network with people and recruiters for jobs. He spent $500 on an online skype tutoring course with a well known animator and really hit it off with the guy. He thinks that I just really don't get along with his old roommate and wishes that I did because then we could all move in together. LA is the place to be if you want to do animation and no other city would provide him as many opportunities. Me not supporting him is making things worse in his eyes and he wants me to be a supportive partner.  He blames the world around him and says his lack of money makes it hard to do anything. His computer is 4+years old now and makes it hard to even run photoshop on and that's why he doesn't like to animate or do art as much. He also says it takes him a long time to get his creativity flowing and it takes him too long to draw anything. If he just had more talent, he would have a job already (exact wording from him). He gets distracted while drawing and loses track of time (especially in the morning) making it hard to find time in the day to do anything productive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe does suffer from depression and has since childhood. I had to push\\* him to go to therapy. He had a lot of negative experiences in the past and was on a crap load of medications that really messed with his affect. Since in therapy he's moved forward a bit, but his therapist is mostly about dealing with his stress and teaching meditation techniques. I also recently pushed him to get medical insurance and see a psychiatrist (and a doctor for the first time since dating). He got diagnosed with ADHD and is somewhat interested in pursuing medication, but is still hesitant because he \"doesn't want to become dependent on a pill.\" and, \"I've made it this far without medication, I don't want to lose the coping mechanisms I've learned to deal with it.\"\n\n\\*By push I mean looking up therapists/medical plans and basically laying it out for him or giving him a script of what to say on the phone when he chooses who to call. As with most things regarding his self care, it's a struggle to get him to do it but once he does he appreciates it and is thankful. I know you can't make anyone get help if they really don't want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently looking into doing couples therapy with him.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nHe has many redeeming qualities (like being a wonderful supportive partner to me) and is such a smart brilliant person with so many skills. He's great at math, science, and all kinds of other subjects! But his determination and constant failure to get into the animation field have been a strain on our relationship. I feel like a huge asshole because instead of being supportive, I want to discourage him! When he draws me things or asks me to look at his latest work, I just feel upset because it's terrible and he won't get a job with his skills the way they are now.  I understand he is going through some heavy depression, but he's just so stubborn. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I was taking the train home from university in the evening. At some point, a guy, who was talking on the telephone, seated himself beside me. At first, I didn´t really acknowledge him but after some time I looked over and glanced at his phone (which I normally wouldn´t do and I don´t know why I did it in that moment). \n\nTo my surprise and also shock he had taken a photo of the girl who was sitting opposite of him. Even worse, he scrolled through his photo library and there were several more pictures of strange girls on trains, which he obviously took without them noticing. At first, I wasn´t certain on what to do and when he got up to sit somewhere else (for whatever reasons) I informed the girl that I don´t want to scare her but the creepy dude who was just sitting here made a photo of her. She thanked me and when she got off he, fortunately, didn´t follow.\n\nNow my question is: am I the asshole for not confronting him? I´m a woman myself and not very strong and to be honest I was just scared of that man. I even checked to make sure that he was not getting off at the same stop as me. And now I´m not sure if the thing I did was right or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He was going to be home before me so I asked if he would grab it from the front hall. When I came in through the back, I asked if he grabbed it, he said he didn't see it. I went down the front stairs and there it was a white bag with my name on it. A 12x12 shipping bag, right on the radiator under the mail boxes. I came up stairs grumbling because he can't be counted on for anything. He still hasn't paid but half of the rent, eats my food and offers nothing in return, when he is bothered to help clean he does less than a half assed attempt, often needing to be redone the same day. Well because I was grumbling he blasted the TV, I said \"turn it down little boy.\" He threw something at me and then it was on... I let loose with a whole bunch of shit I've been holding back. Also, told him that since he ain't paid but half the months rent he can be gone by Sunday. He said that ain't going to happen, I made it clear I want him gone now. He called me names and then I really blew up. Telling him I was sick of his drunk attempts at sex, limp dick, drug habit, crappy kitchen hygiene (he thinks hes a chef) and on and on. The reason we are broke up is his lies and drug use. Maybe I am an asshole, but shit he's such a dick to me.",

She texts me later that night that one of the guys there put his arm around her and she put a stop to it real quick. To be honest I didn’t think much of that because it could have been a totally friendly gesture but she ends up explaining that he tried hugging her a lot and when he did it was like extra tight or something (he was drunk btw). Point is, she said she felt uncomfortable. This didn’t sit well with me, so I told her I’d talk to him. I knew she wouldn’t want me to get into an altercation so I told her I was not looking to fight this kid but rather tell him to calm down with it because it made her uncomfortable and I don’t want anyone making my girlfriend feel that way.  Even though I said that, she still insisted that I keep my mouth shut because she’ll feel awkward around him and it’ll make her upset if I do. Honestly now I feel like taking to this kid regardless of how she’s gonna feel because I don’t think it should matter if she feels awkward. He made her uncomfortable, and that shouldn’t just go unnoticed. If I talk to this guy about it, am I an asshole for being selfish and not caring about her? Been pondering this for a while now.",

So far so good. \n\nBUT. From about 9am onwards (and today is Saturday I might add), this group of like 5 or 6 kids have been running around the pool literally SCREAMING. And the adults were using their yelling voices too. It's happy yelling but like damn. At the top of the lungs is not necessary. This has been going on for at least an hour now. We can't be the only people here who were woken up by their noise. And I've never seen a group of kids just scream nonstop like they are, and the adults join in, at a nice hotel like this.\n\nI'm afraid to confront them because if the parents are screaming too, they will probably just get angry and tell me to stop ruining their vacation or whatever.",

      "description": "Sorry, this is long and maybe trivial for many people. Additionally english is not my first language and Iam on mobile.\n\nMy SO of 3,5 years and I have bought a house together. It is from around 1960 and although the former owner took care of it, it is ofc in no way up to an usual standard a house should have today. I was very happy about buying our future home and although I wasn't too much looking forward to spend all my time working in the house, I was very positive about the whole situation, as my FIL offered his help. He has helped us before with stuff in our present flat and it always worked out decent.\n\nSo we bought the house and started with the usual...getting rid of the old stuff, ripping of wallpapers etc. And here is when the shit started. FIL and MIL got a key from my SO and started working without one of us being there. Sounds nice? Not for me. They decided about the stuff they did and I absolutly hated that they were doing it without us there. I tried to stop it the nice way like \"Hey, you musn't work here while we are not helping, let's do this later. \" but the did not get it. I asked my SO to make them stop, but he didn't. I told him, that this will lead to problems, but he shrugged it off. Here it is to mention, that he really, *really* adores his parents, they are the highest standard for him in whatever decision, a thinking I myself cannot understand, although Iam close to my father as well.\n\nIt went on...every decision we made was declined as \"impossible\" when it meant to do some more work to do. FIL only wanted to do less than absolutly necessary...e.g. not getting new electricity and so on. He would show me (and just me, as he is sure it is only me who does not want the stuff he tells) every damn socket to prove we do not have to change anything. We still did and his help got less.\n\nBut: Stuff still got worse, but just so lightly, that I can't even explain properly. My SO, who is a (sometime too) lovely and trusting person does not even notice most of the time. FIL just won't listen. Whenever I tell what we planned and have to do he would make it just the other way, driving me nuts.\n\nI know Iam not the most patiently person in the world and due to being very strict oftens many people cannot handle this. I feel sad for my SO having to deal with this, and he straight told me today when I asked him (again) to talk to his father that \"You are forcing me to do stuff I do not want to do.\" while he cannot understand that his parents are in my opinion incredible rude and even when they try to be helpful it is not helful in any way when we can never be sure if something will be made as we wish. And if I say \"we\" it is mostly me, as he will believe every damn word his father says, even if there is proof that it is as wrong as it can be.\n\nI told him to talk to his parents again. I cannot stand this anymore, Iam handling far more than I can, working a fulltime job and doing every single thing by myself, as I know that otherwise it will be done in a different way as wished. Additionally my SO has not the slightest idea how to renovate a house (neither have I, but Iam learning and reading stuff every night for many month by now) and he really sucks at crafting. Due to the high pressure Iam even less patient and we fight a lot, what is pretty uncommon for us. It sucks and I fucking hate it and the whole situation and I know that my bad mood is most responsible for our fights. I told him today again, that we need the help, that I would really appreciate his fathers help, but only if he does it as we wish with no exceptions. My SO does not want to do this. It might sound trivial, but the conflict in the whole situation is really strong and Iam even afraid for our future. So know Iam asking myself...\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo at work, my coworker relieves me nearly everyday at change of shift. Normally we have a pretty good relationship and talk for a bit before switching. Usually its to vent on other coworkers who have causes us stress the last time we saw each other (usually the same people.) But today was different.\n\nToday they come into work and notice that another coworker who normally works in the back, is working out front where everyone can see. (Big lobby area, the guy has a stand out for a group today) and my coworker just starts railing on this dude. \"Oh god, fatso's out of the kitchen. I can't stand him.\" Now normally I understand - the dude is hard to get along with at work because he's head chef and is demanding of everyone he talks to. However when its not busy or when he is just hanging out (rarely) the guy has always been pleasant with me so in my mind: Pleasant dude/demanding when working. I can live with that.\n\nHowever I don't think my coworker has ever just chatted with the guy, except in work mode. And they are loudly complain about the chef working in the lobby today. Now the lobby's big, he probably can't hear them talk but they are making no effort to conceal it. In fact they're going on and on so much I only get a chance to say one sentence- \"I think you're overstepping.\"\n\nThey shut up. Like on the spot. Now normally they are chatty no matter what but this was an instant shift. They didn't talk to me besides \"Yes, No,\" or \"okay\" until I packed up and left. Reeeaaally different from any other interaction with them. Personally I'm thankful in case chef was going to overhear at some point later in the day when I wasn't there.\n\nTLDR: Coworker was complaining loudly about fellow coworker who was working in the same room (probably couldn't hear at the time) and I told them they were overstepping without explaining myself. Coworker got visibly upset with me and refused to talk to me till I left.\n\nSo specifically- AITA for the way I spoke? WITA for not properly conveying why I disagreed, seeing as I only said one sentence? (But it worked)",

      "description": "Recently my brother's childhood friend he grew up with died. The guy was always in trouble with the law. He had a wrap sheet probably 10 miles long. Few days ago, police show up at the house to arrest him on outstanding warrants, child neglect, and lots of other stuff. He ran back inside the house after announcing he was going to get a gun. He was shot by police and later died at the hospital.\n\nAnyways, this guy used to live with my family growing up. He was a criminal from a very young age. He stole hundreds of dollars from my parents including electronics.  When he lived with us, he did mean things to me (I was around 12 at the time.) I would be afraid to sleep because he would put random objects like erasers, paperclips, pencils, even food in my mouth. I would wake up with this stuff in my mouth. Always surprised I never choked on it. There were other incidents where he would barge into the bathroom while I was using it and would proceed to laugh and make fun of me.\n\nI never told my parents because to them, kids always lie and make stuff up (my sister used to make shit up all the time so therefore we were all liars.) So I always kept quiet about it. Well I recently told my parents what went on and they both gave me this super shocked look like I was making it up. My mom thinks I should be sympathetic towards the man's death but I honestly feel nothing. I told her that I didn't think people deserved to be shot, but his death wasn't a surprise to me. \n\nI also don't have much to do with my brother as he is a criminal himself. Mom is upset I refuse to console or talk to him about it. I don't allow him to have my phone number because he can get pretty annoying (asking for money, stuff, etc.) He's been asking my parents for my number and I will be pretty upset if they give it out. I'm pretty sure they think i'm this snobby bitch. Am I the asshole for not caring?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for kicking my mom out since she can't afford the rent?",
      "description": "My mom and Dad have been together for 29 years and things got rocky between them about 15 years ago. She has accused my dad of cheating, yelled at random women for sleeping with him in public with no proof, and even threatened to throw acid at a woman receiving financial help from my dad since they live in a third world country and insulin is too expensive to purchase for their 8 year old diabetic son. My father has left many times throughout my childhood only to return a day later because he knew that if he left, I'd become homeless with my mother. \n\nThree nights ago, my father decided he had enough and left her for good. This means, that somebody needs to cover the rent - and I warned her since he left that she would have to find housing since playing the rent would require a roommate and said roommate would most likely refuse to house my mother rent free. She barely acknowledged my warning - muttering under her breath or changing the subject by flipping the script and saying that she couldn't believe her own daughter was kicking her out (I am in my 20s by the way). \n\n I managed to find a roommate that has taken a tour of the place and agreed to move in AND PAY HIS PORTION OF THE RENT! I updated my mom on the news and informed her that he would be moving in by the end of the month - meaning she has until then to pack up and leave. \n\nAlso, the whole time this has been happening I've been recommending to her to talk to my brother who is a single father with two kids and a demanding full time job to talk to him about moving in since she babysits his kids 6 out of 7 days anyway. He's in the middle of a custody battle too so my father and I agree that her moving in would be beneficial to both of them. \n\nSome quick notes to add more context: \n\n- I have a dog so finding an apartment is harder. \n- I live in NYC so finding a 2 Bdrm that accepts dogs and is in my budget makes it even harder. \n- The rent at my current apartment is way below my budget.\n\nIt's a tough situation so I really don't know if I'm being the asshole or not. Any advice is also appreciated. Thanks. ",

      "description": "I (21m) and my St Bernard, Moose (3m) have a super close relationship. He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. ",

      "description": "Background: I'm Vietnamese. Lunar New Year is approaching, which probably is our biggest holiday of the year. The need of human resources is extremely high, so I took the job at a cinema at the checking post as my part time. Note that I work full time at Lotte Mart (a shopping center similar to Walmart) at the receiving dept. My full time job is very time-consuming and exhausting, as we often have containers of goods coming in and out, and there are only 5 staffs in my department, 2 of which only deal with papers and one is our supervisor, which means he rarely gets involved in the receiving process. Me being constantly exhauted is inevitable.\n\nTherefore, when it came to my part time job, I have stated very clearly to my manager that I could only stay for an extra of 15 to 20 minutes at max, partly because I needed rest and partly because my place was about 30 minutes away from the cinema. She was ok with it at first.\n\nBut things didn't go well. She constantly asked me to stay extra time to clean things up, although she has 5 or 6 staffs (who work full time) AND floor janitors to do so. I declined her politely every time, but I always clean up my post spotless before taking my payment and leaving, which also took me 5 to 10 minutes. She wasn't happy with it and insisted that I work overtime or she would pay me nothing. When I asked her if I was going to be paid for my extra time, she said it was my \"contribution to the cinema for being very generous\". I was paid 15$ for a 3 hours shift (which is reasonable considering our standard) and because of that she forced me to work 1 more hour \"to match my payment\". I'm like \"screw you, I'm done\" about a week after. She then told her staffs (one of them told me later) that I was \"asky, selfish and lazy\", and claim my work to be \"not worthy of what I was paid\", although I haven't heard a single complain from my customers.\n\nTell me, what would you do if you were in my shoes?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",

We were both young and dumb, but he was younger and dumber. We got in fist fights, he got really physical once and tried to choke me, he would gaslight me about things, and pressure me into sexual encounters. We broke up after i found out he had cheated on me and he threatened to kill me for several months afterwards (he was over seas so he couldnt. But he would call/text threats all the time/constantly ). After that I got together with my now husband and we were happy. B began to continue to gaslight me for years, using his relationship with my mother to force himself into my life. Him and my mom would show up at my work/my mom would say \"give him another chance\" etc etc for years. I finally set boundaries with my family when they \"adopted\" him and call him my brother now. :/ now. My mom is pretty much my only family left, i wanted to go visit (*1200 miles away ), and found out hes living with her.  My mother and the extended family there doesnt seem to understand that i dont want to visit if hes there. I offered to get a hotel and visit them away from the hoyse but They keep saying im being paranoid and \"hes changed, dont be an asshole\"....

Last year, my brother asked me to take her checkbook because she was having trouble remembering how to write checks.  I had seen many checks in my SIL's handwriting over the last few years.  SIL asked me to \"leave a blank check at mom's house\".  AITA for asking why?  Then I offered to pay SIL electronically - turns out that when they \"take\" her to dinner on Saturday nights, they keep a running total of what she owes them, then write a check to themselves every few months.  They are wealthy, and these checks are $100 for 4 meals/month from places like Applebee's.  $25 meals at Applebees?  AITA???  They refuse to use PayPal or Venmo, so I told them I'd mail a check.  AITA???",

I have to go to this one specific store to get the part, as they're the only ones who sell OEM parts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walk into the store and talk to the cashier working there. Told him what i need and the entire time he seems annoyed and like he doesn't want to talk. I had to call my dad as i was talking to him and verify the parts, vin number etc. And he was visibly getting annoyed, telling me theres a lineup behind me. I asked him if he was sure the part would fit, and he tells me \"If it fits, it fits. If it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit\". To this, i got annoyed. I told him to \"stop being a little bitch and tell me if this part is going to fit.\". This made him worked up and he started yelling telling me not to call him a little bitch. He then goes to pick his pack of cigarettes up and leave the store for im assuming a smoke break because he just got called a little bitch by an 18 year old. I told him to have fun smoking his cancer sticks as he was walking out and he yelled at me some more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, tell me reddit, am i the asshole?",

At this point, she has been home for a couple days and this is the first time any of us has heard anything about this.

      "description": "This was during 2015-2016 when I had a heavy poker addiction. Back then I worked as a cashier and struggled to make enough money. I lived in a small apartment by my self and had almost no savings. A friend of mine told me about online poker and casino games and how much fun he had playing. So I thought why not give it a try \nAt first I didn't find it amusing at all. I lost a couple of dollars and didn't think much about it. But when I got home from work I would always play for a small amount of money and one day a won a big price. (At least for me at that time). I think it was 500 dollar and that made me so happy because I really needed that money. Although I never cashed them out. I just continues playing until I lost it all again. After about a month or so I would put in all of my money to these online casinos and just continue to play until a lost it all. This quickly turned in to a bad habit and because my income was so low I almost didn't have enough cash for food. What i did was pretty stupid I know, but I was still a better option then to take a bunch of loans that would stack up. When I went to my mum's house (which was about every weekend) I would take money from her wallet and from her saving just finance my poker addiction. She had a well paid job and and probably didn't had a hard time just because I took a little money. But this went on for a long time and to this day I feel so bad for what I did. I am now free from the addiction and have a better job and about a week ago I told her all of it. She got really mad and haven't responded or talked to me that last days. \n\nAm i the asshole for taking my mum's money for my poker addiction and pay it back years later?\n\n(Sorry for bad English)",

      "description": "**Tl:DR**  \\- I carry some emotional hurt over how I felt disrespected over my personal faults and mental health issues during the relationship, despite how accepting I was of my ex-gf 's own faults and mental health problems. I get really offended when I feel my ex-gf continues to disrespect me when the first thing she does when arriving back in my city is call me up to get access to drugs for herself and her casual sex friend. AITA for getting angry at her and telling her off?\n\n(Disclaimer - I'm not in the hardcore drug crowd, and neither was she before this)\n\n(Disclaimer 2 - This was a 3 year relationship, so not insignificant considering we are both in our 20's)\n\n(Disclaimer 3 - we both suffer from some form of perfectionism and intermittent depression issues. I also have a few anxiety issues from the perfectionism. Both of us intermittently see psychologists to manage this during our lives)\n\n**Background story**\n\nSo my ex gf and I break up last year. Combination of factors including the  relationship turning long distance, but despite some ugly moments in  the break-up we have intermittent contact, mainly because we have good  understanding of each other. We are both perfectionists, both have high  expectations of ourselves, high drive to try to succeed in our careers,   are both blunt but introverted, despite being both socially amicable.  etc etc - We have good interpersonal chemistry that we both enjoy.\n\nMy personal reason for the break up was the unequal treatment I felt being  with her. Despite being a perfectionist, I was only perfectionist with myself, and I generally didn't judge my ex gf's negative traits. These traits included some pretty toxic behaviors, including threatening  suicide to get attention (according to her psychologist), undermining me  emotionally when arguing eg. name calling, playing on personal fears  (e.g. you will never be successful). She would in general be  hyper-critical, and especially when she was upset she would not care at  all what she said, regardless of how hurtful or damaging it was.\n\nI  tried to over-looked some of her extreme behavior because I deeply  enjoyed her company in other areas. She was highly motivated, and we  were pro-active together in our lives. I had endless conversations with her, and in general we tried to support each others personal development. We shared the burden of each others degree together. She was the person that got me out of my post-graduation funk  and got my ass moving towards actually getting my career going. We even built a little micro-business together.\n\nDespite her intense nature I deeply respected her for these positive traits. I even somewhat admired her for her dedication to improve herself. She was  constantly working extra-curricular activities to further her  experience, and I deeply loved that energy she had.\n\nBut over-time, I generally began to resent, what I saw as a lack of  personal respect for me. She would often be incredibly harsh and unsupportive of my emotional problems that came with perfectionism and  anxiety, my struggle with employment while studying my masters, my  procrastination that came from perfectionism and distaste of not doing a  good job in my assessment. She was incredibly disrespectful to me personal struggles with anxiety and perfectionism while all the time I  never once judged her for her own emotional and mental problems even though I clearly could have.\n\nI  do get some emotional closure for my feelings after 6 months of break-up, as she messages, apologizes and says she feels she was really harsh and unfair  to me in our relationship, and basically feels terrible that she treated me the way she did. This resolves some of my festering emotions and I more or less try to let go of my hurt feelings and move on with my life. \n\n**The lead up to incident**\n\nWe've been talking intermittently about our lives every few months since the break-up, and she's been getting into drinking, and from what I can  gather, a few hard drugs like cocaine and ecstasy. Her life seems to in general  have become more extreme over time. She has become a stripper over the semester break because she said she \"wanted to get a thicker skin and toughen up\".\n\nSo fast-forward to early December, 8 months after break-up, and she's coming back to my  city to gather some personal belongings she has left at my place for the  last 8 months, and we've agreed to meet up on the day she arrives and have dinner. The day before she gets to my city we have one last phone  conversation. The conversation swings wildly from her sending me  potential career jobs in her city that she thinks would be good for me,  some encouragement for doing a blog that I was thinking of starting, and offering to help me out with a struggle I was having with my current  academic dispute i was having with my university....\n\nThis  shifts to her own problems, which include opening up that she  is really upset because she was kicked from one of her stripping  contracts, because she went, took cocaine, and had a foursome with a  wealthy casual sex friend she has been dating, who happened to be  visiting her in the strip club, whom the cameras caught her leaving  with.\n\nAt the end of this conversation during the goodbye, she then also tells me that she loves me???????\n\nThis  conversation both confuses and upsets me. It feels wrong for her to be  over-sharing sharing these weird sexual things with me, I understand she  is having a rough time, but I can't be there for her in this capacity,  especially in the same breadth as telling me she loves me. I don't know what to say, so I just say bye. \n\n**The Incident**\n\nOn  the day she gets to my city, I text her at 6pm, and she's already  drunk. She tells me that she is now staying at the Hilton hotel for a  few days instead of staying for one day as she previously told me, as  she's decided to come with her rich casual sex buddy on a whim, for a conference he is going to in my city. Without so much as a hello how are you, she begins asking me if I know anyone that can get her and her (sex) friend  some cocaine. I say I can't. She then asks me if I have any MDMA (think  ecstasy)  she can have. I can't respond anymore because I'm with a  friend.\n\nShe texts an hour later and asks  again \"so can we have it\", thinking I have these imaginary drugs for her. The expectancy is kind of annoying me. I say don't have any drugs, or know anyone at the moment except  for marijuana. Finally she says they want to buy all the weed I have on me if I want to sell them it.\n\nAt this  point I'm pretty pissed, like she hasn't seen me in months and the first  thing she does is want to use me to get drugs. This feels incredibly disrespectful to me as a person, like I'm some nobody drug dealer she is calling to get a fix,  but also as a former partner, as it's asking me to be involved  and in some way facilitating her fuck buddy, without considering how  inappropriate or uncomfortable that might be for an ex. Like what am I  supposed to do? Drive into the city in the middle of the night, make a  impersonal transaction of weed to her and some fuck buddy, and then just fuck off like some random drug dealer?\n\nI'm  immediately enraged by her for putting me in this trashy and low value  position with her. It brings up all the emotions I felt for how  disrespectful she was to me in the past, ripping open all these old  wounds. In my anger I basically tell her she's basically become the low  value whore she's always wanted to be, how uncool it is that she's  immediately just asked me for drugs and that's it, and how fucked up and  reckless her current life choices have been leading up to this point.   It's like all the poison that she had given to me over the years, all the nasty stuff that I had to endure or tolerate suddenly came out of  me, and I just lashed out in disgust.\n\nShe  doesn't even understand why I'm upset. She starts associating it with  jealousy, or emotions, saying that we are no longer together, and that  she would like me to not judge her for her life choices and just be good  friends. But I'm too angry, I'm too hurt to even think calmly anymore. I  tell her how messed up her current life choices have been in getting  her to this point and that I don't want to know anymore about what  messed up, reckless behavior she is doing.\n\nShe essentially tells me \"Fine. Fuck off\", and blocks me on every social media outlet we share. \n\nI'm honestly infuriated the it seems so blind to her how not ok this must seem. Am I the asshole here for getting upset at her requests?\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI honestly just want to know, am I the asshole here? I know I didn't handle the situation well, but were my feelings on this issue warranted? Was I actually just being unreasonable and her request was normal for someone into drugs? Is this just me struggling to let go of old baggage and I overreacted?",

So I stand there holding it open for her like an awkward fuck as she slowly walks up.  When she got to me she gave me a dirty look and went to the door set of doors and opened them and went in.  I’m not sure what the dirty look was about, I can’t see anything wrong with the gesture, but it made it clear that some people just don’t like it.  So since then I don’t hold doors open for people unless they are directly behind me.  I’ve been told by multiple people that it’s rude, but it seems better to play it safe.  ",

      "description": "disclaimer: this is my first post on reddit ever so I’m super sorry if it doesn’t flow too well.\n\nSo I’m a sophomore in high school and I’m a little awkward, so I don’t have a ton of friends. I have a few friends from my student government class, but that’s about it. I do have a couple home schooled friends too that I met playing online video games.\n\nAnyways, over the past few months I have heard some of my friends making plans to do various things together like get lunch, go to movies, just hang out, etc. After I’d seen them do this in front of me without an invite, I decided to ask the girl who usually plans these things, who I’ll call Betty. Betty said that I wasn’t that much fun to hang out with because I'm too awkward to talk to. Ouch.\n\nOnce they know my feelings are hurt, Betty just starts to do it even more frequently. Well one day at lunch, my homeschool friends call me and ask if I want to go get tacos with them. We plan it out on the phone, right in front of my friends. Betty then says that I’m rude for planning so do something without her, and that just for that, I wouldn’t be invited for the next few times they hang out.\n\nAt this point, I’m upset. I’m hindsight, I could’ve just walked away while I was on the phone but that isn’t the point. After that though, I just decided that I would not be hanging out with those kids outside of school and just chill with my homeschooled friends because the are the only ones who like having me around.\n\nNow Betty is calling me a bad friend for not wanting to hang out with them at the few things I’ve gotten invited to. \n\nSorry for the long read, but Am I The Asshole here?",

To get in the university here i did a preparation of 2 years intense study and still i could never be sure that i would get in. The thing is that this was not my problem. The same amount of study i will put in Czech republic. But i want to explore new places and be more free. I need this. My mother supports me even if she doesn't want me to leave her. My father won't keep me from going there but he is literally fighting me on this every day.. Also my parents are divorced. I stayed at his house this weekend as normal and he and his wife started a conversation making me feel like sheet and they tried to convince me to stay here. My father is afraid i will ask him more money than i already do and at the same time he goes exlensive vacation with his family and buys a huge tv that costs 600 euros. What is your opinion?",

      "description": "I just recently upgraded from apartment living to a three bedroom duplex with my two children, wife and I. We have lived in apartments our entire adult lives.  Top floor, bottom floor, u name it, and we are used to and understanding of the noise. \n\nMoving to a duplex was a large step up for us. Each kid has their own room now! We have a garage! A backyard! We can grill! Also, it costs way more in rent then we have ever spent. But it seemed worth it, better school district and all that. \n\nThen real life set in and it hit hard. It’s almost like clock work, every night around 8-8:30ish the pounding and screaming starts. And it continued every night past 10:00 for quite awhile. \n\nAbout two weeks in it became ridiculous. My children were having a hard time falling asleep and it would go late enough that even my wife and I would have trouble going to sleep. One night it was exceptionally bad and my wife and I had had it! I knocked politely and the dad answered. \n\nI calmly explained to him that the noise was really loud, and that I wanted to have open communication with him because I’m sure they hear my kids at times too. He responded by saying, no, they never hear us and admitted it was all them. Then stated that one of their four children had autism and then nonchalantly jotted down my phone number and texted me for future use. \n\nSince then we haven’t heard anything past 10pm, (quiet hours are 10pm-8am) but every night there is pounding and screaming, every god damn night! And every god damn night my children have difficulty falling asleep! \n\nSince then we have filed multiple complaints with our rental agency, showing videos of even, of how loud it is and they don’t seem to care. They have done absolutely nothing. It’s so bad we are wanting to break our lease a month and a half in so we can, once again, have peace. \n\nTonight it was a bit worse than usual and I texted the dad to ask if he would consider moving the loud child to a room that doesnt share a wall. I havnt heard back and I don’t expect to. \n\nBut I can’t stop wondering.....\n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n",

      "description": "So, my husband thinks I'm an asshole, because he's the guy's supervisor. I reported the guy to management because my husband wasn't going to say anything. \n\nWe work in a warehouse. Employee parking is on either side of the warehouse, both blocked off by rolling gates that you need a badge to open. I was going in, and this woman came in behind me. I used to do the same thing before I worked here, bringing my husband lunch every day. Security knew me before I got hired. \n\nThe woman had kids in her car, I figured she was dropping lunch off for her husband and would leave. But then she got the kids out of the car to sit at our picnic area. \n\nThis is where the problem comes in: we RARELY have small children on any part of the property, but NEVER in the employee parking areas, if only because it's not safe.  First, no one is looking for small children in the parking lot, and the guys were leaving for lunch. We still have tractor trailers coming and going through the parking lot at odd times, and occasionally the guys come out in forklifts. It is not safe for children. The liability issue is huge. \n\nSo, I reported it to management. There are a lot of safety concerns where we work, we have accidents almost weekly, common sense would be to not have kids in work areas. I consider the parking lot a work area because we still have work access even in the parking lot. But again, my husband says I'm an asshole for reporting it. Am I?",

I had enough and was thinking it was a scam and so I asked for refund- this was almost 2 weeks ago. In the last 2 weeks I had bought and received the item needed from another store. \n\n\nYesterday low and behold the original refunded eBay item has been delivered to me. I checked the invoice slip and it was sent about a week after the refund. WAITA if I keep it? If they chase me up I’m happy for them to send me a new invoice to pay but my plan is to not reach out to them first. It’s actually from huge company in my country (but their eBay name wasn’t under the company name which is strange because I’d bought from the company’s proper eBay previously) and it is technically their mistake. I do feel shitty about it but also didn’t intend for this and they can afford the loss. \n\n",

      "description": "My son is 16 and lives with his dad, stepmother and siblings in another town about 3 hours away.\n\nTraditionally (since 10 years or so), we go on holiday together over his Easter school break. My mum used to join previously, for a few years, my (new) husband comes along. The holidays are fun and everybody is getting along well. \n\nThis year‘s holiday was planned a few weeks ago. My son contributed in picking the destination, confirmed he wants to go and was asked a few times regarding his input on the itinerary and program. I even shared a GoogleDoc with him on booking status of the hotels and tours. \n\nAs of today, the holiday including flights, hotels, rental car, visas and a few tours are booked and part (most?!) of it paid and non-refundable. \n\nI just received a message that he does not want to go as he wants to spent time at home with his new girlfriend and friends. \n\nI totally get his reasons. He is 16, it‘s an exciting time with cool things around every corner. I understand he does not want to go on holidays with the family anymore. \n\nThe problem I have is that he confirmed before and is not really sensitive to the effort and budget investment that goes into such a trip. I want him to understand that the investment we made and that it is not integer to cancel on your mum and leave here with the bill. \n\nHe says if he comes along, it will be wasted money anyway as he will not be able to enjoy the trip. And he will probably see me as the A for making hin. \n\nSo, WIBTA for insisting he joins the holiday?",

      "description": "I play rugby with the guy in question (let's say, \"Mark\") but I don't usually hang out with him outside of matches and practice. He broke up with a woman (Jia) that I'm rather attracted to last week. For the sake of propriety, I had not real intention to make moves or anything. \n\nBut last night I'm at a bar, and both Mark and Jia are there. I was at a table with some friends, and he was a couple tables over. Jia's with her friends as well but after a time comes over to my table and sits next to me, starts chatting me up. We flirt, and eventually she leans in and kisses me, and I reciprocate. I tend to think that PDA of that kind is a bit trashy so after a few seconds I get up with her and we go outside, but I can see that Mark has been watching the entire time. He makes a rude comment to both of us as we pass. \n\nToday at practice he picked a fight with me that would have come to blows if the other guys on the team hadn't held him back. He's steaming mad. I feel a little sorry for him, but at the moment I can't actually bring myself to feel bad about hooking up with Jia, or the fact that he was there for it. AITA here?",

      "description": "I currently attend the two-year campus of a state university, but I have done so well there that I have an opportunity to transfer to a selective school. I have several brothers and sisters, and many of them have already left home, with most of them not even living in the same state anymore. Only two of us live in the same house as my mother, who was recently diagnosed with heart problems and also likely has glaucoma. Prior to these health issues being discovered, I applied to several schools, most of which are out of our state. I am in the running for a big scholarship that will let me pay to go to school wherever I am accepted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore my mother got sick, they were already trying to convince me that I should not go to school out of state. They told me about it not being safe for me to go to school out of state, how I could get robbed, shot, or taken advantage of in a big city. They guilt tripped me about how bad they would feel if something were to happen to me, and said other things to try to make me reconsider my decisions. I could transfer to the main campus of my state school like my original plan was when I started college, but if I have the opportunity to go to a school like Harvard or Stanford, I believe that I should take it. I honestly have no interest in continuing at my state university, and my safety school is a different university in our state that is considered better. That school is a couple of hours away, so even then I would have to live in the dorms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother recently found out about some pretty serious (but not fatal) health issues, and my sister, the only other one who lives inside the house with us, works a lot, meaning she is often not home. Between school, work, and the gym I am gone for about 12 hours a day on school days. My sister is gone more than that. The other day, my other sister, who works overseas, was visiting home on vacation. She and my sister who lives with us lectured about me needing to step up as a man and stick around in case my mother needs my help. They attacked my masculinity a little bit, and when I said why don't they step up and help out, they said that I have a larger responsibility because I am a man. They said that if I moved away and something bad happened that it would be my fault since I abandoned her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am the youngest child, but even if we ignore that, this still feels like an unfair thing to say to me. No one else was asked to put their dreams on hold. I have a once in a lifetime opportunity, the kind of chance that won't be there later, but they just do not understand that. If they do, then they do not care. Besides, one of the selective schools I applied to is in our city, so there is a chance I'll be minutes away, not hours. I took these things into account, but I feel like my family is still  emotionally blackmailing me. ",

      "description": "This happened two nights ago. It’s Friday evening and I’m antsy and bored; college hasn’t been going well and my grandfather is on his deathbed. I feel the need to do something different, other than the usual process of smoking and drinking and waking up with a hangover. I needed something different. Rather than camp in the local forest or play dungeons and dragons, I decide I really want to do some LSD with my friends. I make some calls and found a supplier and four of my closest friends to join me in my trip. This is where the trouble begins. \n\nWe arrive at the dealer’s dorm, we’ll call him S. He’s a pretty charismatic guy, and no lie I’m immediately jealous of his handsomeness and ability to talk, and it doesn’t help that one of my friends whom I have a bit of a crush on (let’s call her M) was taken with him immediately, so I was a bit jealous. Not only that, but I find myself incredibly uncomfortable around him as soon as we meet. I’m autistic and socially anxious so I don’t think anything of it. I’m used to ignoring my instincts about people. \n\nS had initially said that we would be getting sugar cubes with liquid L dropped on them, but in his room he says he’ll drop it directly on our tongues and we oblige. I’m only looking for one hit but when it’s my turn he gives me two before I can really react. I just laugh it off. The rest of our party takes the dose (one person taking it in the eye, let’s call her H). We chill in his room and chat while we wait for it to kick in, and S offers everyone some dabs, which my friends take. \n\nEventually the acid hits us and our trips are starting up. We go down to one of our party’s room, let’s call him J, and start watching a movie. Everyone joins, including S, who is a few years older than the rest of us and a first-semester student at our school. Eventually, we decide to go walk to a swing on campus, everyone but S and M.\n\nWe leave, me, J, another friend we’ll call C, and another we’ll call Z. J and C are tripping with me, Z is drunk and high. H stays with S and M but leaves after me, Z, J, and C. S and M are in J’s room alone. \n\nAfter a while me and C realize there’s a problem here, but we can’t quite focus on it because we were tripping deep. We try to get back to the room but don’t rush because Z and J left for it ahead of us. We call M. S asked her up to his room. It is important to note that at this point we realized that S had not dropped with us. He was stone cold sober the entire time. \n\nMe and C return to S’s room. M is sitting on the bed and S is sitting in front of his tv, talking about a movie called “Freaks” in which circus freaks with, and I quote, “freaks with disabilities and mental illnesses form an alliance and beat the bad guy.” I know I was tripping then, but I saw a copy of our school newspaper on his desk, the one in which my senior project, a Hidden Disabilities Alliance/ support group, was written about. M tells me later that S has brought that movie up because one of the characters crawls out of a door, like she was when she tried to leave his room. \n\nWe sit there for a bit. H returns, M goes out to get a cigarette, and S begins to seem agitated. He starts making cracks at me and C (J is bad tripping and Z is helping him), and eventually he takes out a glass pipe. He tells us it’s DMT, and that someone is going to hit it. I tell him he’s the only sober one, but he keeps pushing it. I get my backpack (S: “Going to class there buddy?”) and leave. C and H follow me. \n\nI go to M and tell her we need to leave. She smiling so much, she’s loving this right now. Apparently they were having a great conversation. I tell her that S had tried to push DMT on us, and she flies to the door and says she wants to do DMT. This is where I fuck up. M has a history of sexual assault. She is currently trying to decide what to do about it legally. I tell her S was giving me a bad vibe. She asks what I mean. I can’t remember if it was me or C who first said S was “rapey,” but one of us does, and that sends M into a PTSD attack for the rest of her trip- about 6-7 hours. \n\nWe don’t see S again, and we salvage the situation a bit, but she was upset at me, and rightfully so. Everyone eventually meets up and we go to the mountains to watch the sunrise when we all came down. \n\nTLDR: Got acid from a sketchy guy, tried to prevent a possibly bad situation, sent my best friend on a PTSD attack while tripping.

      "description": "So, Reddit, I'm already pretty sure the answer to this YTA but I'd still like to ask for your opinions. I live in a suburb of a major city in the US that was celebrating St. Patrick's Day today. There was an obnoxious drunk woman in her lower 20s on the train back out to the suburbs from the city that for 20-25 straight minutes had to very loudly Face time anyone who would answer her about her trek from the city back out to the suburbs. Everyone on the car was visibly annoyed with her. She stated once or twice the stop she was planning on getting off at during these Face time convos. She then drunkenly passed out before her planned stop. The whole car then pretty much collectively decided to not wake her up at her stop. I am off the train now and more sober and feeling guilty about participating in this. So in this case how much AITA?",

It really sucks. \nSo today after a match of tickling / wrestling away, i sat on top of him and said I’d fart. He begged me not to for a second before I did. It was a small one. He said he felt a puff of air on his belly. He immediately got up and showered, upset at me. \nNow, we aren’t strangers to bodily functions. We’ve lived together a while.

Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male",

      "description": "So.\n\nA while ago, my friend started being a dick to both me and his girlfriend, who I had started talking to, with no intentions for her other than friendship. I can understand the jealousy in there, that's not the issue here. I became closer friends with his girlfriend, closer than he was to her apparently. This made him angry. After a while she broke up with him and he blamed me for it. He started being hurtful to her, saying things like \"I wish you still loved me so I could hurt you\" and making jokes about having sex with her with an unsavory character, basically in front of her face. But she's my friend, and if he's going to start attacking her like that, I'm going to side with her.  But I have no intention of anything other than friends with her. She has another boyfriend now, and I'm happy for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time that this was happening, I was talking to a different girl. He started getting close to her when difficulties sprang up, so I felt like he was taking advantage of the situation. After what felt like forever to me, I fell out with this girl with much pain and grief involved. But he continued getting close to her, even after his girlfriend broke up with him. Understandably I was very angry about this, I felt hurt and betrayed, and yes, jealousy is a factor here. I never went as far as he did though, to make cruel jokes at her expense and to threaten her. I don't care about her anymore, I'm over it. \n\nRecently, they started dating.\n\nI shouldn't care, I shouldn't have an issue with it. I don't even talk to her anymore. But the fact that he's still close to someone who hurt me makes me irritable and angry. I can barely stand his presence, his voice annoys me wherever I hear it, and he seems to be a leech on a group of friends, along with this unsavory character I mentioned earlier. Needless to say we aren't friends anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I have 2 grudges here. Firstly, the grudge with the way he acted towards his ex-girlfriend, my friend, and secondly, the way I feel he's manipulated my troubles with a different girl to get closer to her, remain close to her, and even date her despite knowing of the pain that she caused me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "Last night I was driving around town to kill time. I ended up driving down a quiet and deserted road near the outskirts of town and came across a group of maybe 30 high school students that looked to be about 16 or 17. They had been obviously drinking and looked like they were having a good time. I drove past them and left them alone, however, I couldn't stop thinking about whether I should let the police know or not. I didn't wanna wake up in the morning to a news report saying that there was a car accident that killed a bunch of drunk teenagers. I knew I'd feel extremely guilty if I knew I could've stopped that from happening. People driving from drunk driving happens pretty often in this town. After thinking and driving for another half hour, I finally decided to call the police and ask to have someone check up on the kids. Immediately, they sent someone out and im pretty sure they got busted. I feel really bad for being a snitch and i usually keep to myself, but I also felt like I needed to do it. I know it's important for teenagers to have their fun and I know what it's like to be a teenager,  I still am one. However, I also feel like they should have fun to a certain extent. I really didn't want anyone to drive off into the bay or off a bridge, killing many young teens who have so much to live for. Of course that could be worst case scenario, but im just trying to tell myself that I did the right thing. What do you guys think?",

      "description": "I have a coworker named Jim, who has had a really rough past few years. He's had a parent die in the last few years, and  he's estranged from his surviving parent. Like me, he's fresh out of college and moved to this area for this job, like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were assigned desks next to each other. And he seemed nice enough. Soon (within a day or two of me starting) he started to tell me all about how hard it's been for him and his family to lose those family members, in great detail. He told me too about his girlfriend, who had stayed back in Wyoming, and about what sounded like a very toxic relationship--the mutual cheating, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI initially felt bad for this guy and tried to be a listening ear while he told me, at our office desks, all this stuff that's happened to him in the last year.  He told me about all of his family drama, about the woman he's seeing on the side, how unsupportive his girlfriend is of his career, and even about how he went on a date with our boss's boss's boss. He said he didn't have lot of people in the city, and despite sensing some red flags, I told him that if he ever needed someone to chat with, he could rely on me. I invited him to hang out a couple times. But soon, I realized that the listening tended not to be reciprocal and that what this guy really needed was a therapist. Seriously, it was like everyday, he had a new problem or issue that he would go on and on about. And it became overwhelming and uncomfortable, as I had really just met him and he seemed to never be curious about my life or what things I may be grappling with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to distance myself and got to know other people in the office.  I've made some good friends. Here's the thing--Jim seems to be offended when other folks in the office and I hang out without him. Jim has asked repeatedly to join in on our outside-of-work hang outs, but we don't know what to say. We all just don't want to hear about his family troubles and toxic relationship and how many girls he's currently seeing now on the side--anymore. Jim has proven time and again that he's rarely able to talk about other subjects. But we still feel bad for him. Are we assholes for excluding this parent-less man who doesn't really know anyone else as a transplant from Wyoming? Should we be more sympathetic and give him another chance?",

      "description": "So the other day I was just getting out of the shower when I took a look at my phone. My notifications said that my cousin mentioned me in a Facebook comment. I thought to myself, “hmm, wonder what this could be all about.”\n\nFirst, let me preface this by saying that I rarely ever use FB or their messenger app (otherwise I couldn’t spend so much time on Reddit). So I open the app and read what my cousin posted. My cousin’s 7 year old daughter was doing a fundraiser for heart health sponsored through her elementary school trying to raise $250 dollars. \n\nUnfortunately that’s not all my cousin decided to post on her wall. On the link she called out myself and numerous members of my family and tagged them for not donating to her daughter’s fundraiser, “especially considering the history of heart disease that runs in our family.” \n\nAfter reading this I felt blindsided. I know for a fact I had no knowledge of this fundraiser because (a) I don’t use FB, and (b) she never once messaged any of us directly asking for help (which every member of my household said they would’ve gladly contributed to had she done so).  The only thing she ever posted was a general link that all her friends could see, no tags. Nothing less than two weeks ago. Nobody had any idea that this was a thing but apparently we were supposed to know about everything my cousin posts (which is quite a lot).\n\nSo today she commented to my aunt (her mother), again on FB and for the whole world to see, that she cannot trust family to help out, and that she expected differently from her family. So I decided to message her to talk about this issue and clear the air. I explained how I felt blindsided and that all she needed to do was message me. Her response was that she tagged all of us so she wouldn’t look like she was singling anyone out. I did my best trying to be the adult between us (she’s in her forties and I’m 27). But even after carefully explaining how this made me feel and how I wish she would’ve approached the situation she just told me “will do.”\n\nThe thing is, I’m now considering not donating to my little cousin because of her mother but I feel terrible. She’s just a kid and she shouldn’t be punished for her mother’s actions, especially considering what she’s raising money for. Even still, I’m pissed and really don’t want to give them a dime because I truly believe my cousin should understand that her words carry consequences and I’m afraid contributing will only reinforce her belief that shaming her family is the way to getting what she wants. AITA?",

I have bipolar disorder and highly functional autism, and he is dealing with antisocial personality disorder. \n\nWe are both independent adults at good points of our lives and we try to not affect each other with our own “mental” struggles, we’re both too sensitive for that and having a healthy relationship (for once) is definitely the goal.\n\nOf course, struggling as we are, we constantly have bad moments and deal with them very differently. As he’s antisocial, he’ll isolate himself, sometimes for weeks. This was difficult for me at first as I’m afraid of rejection, but after nearly 2 years together, I’ve realized this is the BEST solution as he gets hostile (never aggressive) during these periods and it is actually worse to be around him than to be  “abandoned”, as he’s always come back so far.\n\nNow, whenever he gets anxious, I know that what’s best for him is that I leave, before he has to tell me. It’s not fun for me, but I do it for him, because I love him and I want him to feel better.\n\nI have a strange relationship with both my parents and am rather dependent on people around me as a consequence of this and my autism. I try hard to change this though, especially with him, and feel that I’ve done good work. But sometimes I just need him.\n\nThis happened today at the restaurant. I mentioned that I have highly functional autism and while I’m capable of living independently, I am sound and light sensitive and can get anxious in social situations. Especially if they are unusual and I haven’t “practiced” this social situation before.\n\nToday we were going to have lunch together and the waiter was walking around close to us, making strange singing noises that made me anxious. I am also recovering from a flu and didn’t feel good from walking in the cold.\n\nThe food came and my potatoes were undercooked. All these things together made me upset and I struggled to keep it cool and needed him to be on my side and help me fix what can be fixed of the situation. \n\nHe didn’t. He told me that “I won’t this time”. Why? I don’t know. Maybe I was being too difficult. But I tried not to make a scene. I just told him that I’m tired of always coming to the conclusion that I care more about him than he cares about me. I told him I didn’t want him to come back to my place with me, and that I wanted to go home.\n\nHe told me to leave. I did, upset but not too dramatically.\n\nI went home and cried a lot. He came back later to pick some stuff up before he went home. I noticed later that he left the food I ordered (minus the potatoes that made me lose it) in a doggy bag on my table.\n\nNow I’m a bit torn. I know I overreacted, but I tend to do, and so does he. When he does, I adapt to him. When I do... he still expects me to adapt to him? I can’t just stop being anxious any easier than he can, and he always uses this as an excuse.\n\nI know he’s antisocial and sometimes he frankly doesn’t care about me. This doesn’t make him bad. But it also means that I’m not bad for being dependent at times and needing him.\n\nAm I the asshole in this shit show?\n\nThanks to anyone sharing their point of view, I just want to add that I have no intentions of speaking badly about my boyfriend and I appreciate if everyone can be considerate of the struggles we both have.\n",

      "description": "A very long story long, my ex-wife and I split up mid last year after I discovered she was having an affair with a co-worker. We had been together for 10 years and she walked out of our home the night she admitted her affair to me and left. This blindsided me so it's been pretty rough for me to accept, I was hoping she would at least try some marriage counselling or try and figure out what went wrong before I made a decision on if we should part ways but she wasn't interested and basically told me in no uncertain terms we would never get back together and to give up any hope of that. She is still with this guy today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo around this time last year, before the cheating was revealed, 2 of our closer friends invited us to their wedding, my wife is best friends with the Bride I was invited to be a Groomsman by the Groom and happily accepted. When we first broke up, I was talking to the Groom and pointed out that the wedding was going to be an issue, in my experience the bridal party are introduced to a song (we had picked our wedding song), dance together etc. He agreed and said he would actually understand if I couldn't go, but that I should definitely go to his bucks–a week long overseas trip. In January the Bride had her birthday and didn't invite me or mention anything, which kind of hurt. I put that aside and went to the bucks recently, had a good time with the buck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the weekend it was time to RSVP for the wedding and I'd been changing my mind back and forth often and thought maybe it was best if I avoided it all-together. The few times I've seen my ex when she has come to our house to pack her things, take the dog etc, I've found it really difficult to be around her so I've been avoiding any contact and removed her from social media to try and focus on moving on. I tried to call the groom to ask if my ex would be bringing her affair partner and to see what expectations there are for the bridal party. He didn't answer his phone so I sent a message basically saying that I regrettably won't be attending because of the situation with my ex-wife. In hindsight I probably should have kept trying to call him but I was really anxious about the call in the first place and just wanted it to be dealt with so I could try and relax. I haven't got a reply from him in 24 hours and I've tried to ring him several times today but he isn't answering, which is a bit unusual for him. I just wanted to say that maybe I panicked a bit sending the text message off and perhaps I could go to the ceremony as a regular non bridal party member and that would make things a bit more bearable for me in terms of being around my ex-wife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just feel awful about it, I thought he would understand but maybe after all this time he forgot that he said he would understand if I didn't come, or figured I would've said something sooner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here or am I overthinking this? Thanks in advance for your responses.",

      "description": "[I'm reposting this from r/advice because literally only 2 people replied except for trolls.]\n\nHey just for fair warning I am writing this on a mobile so sorry for formatting peeps..\n\nOk so for starters I am a 14 year old girl. My birthday is in 2004 so I will only be 15 later this year (keep this in mind because the girl in the story is only about 3 months older than me). \n\nMy brother is going to 19 somewhat soon (some time in march). I've never really had a good relationship with him. We argue almost everyday over the smallest things (Side note: I suspect he has autism/tourettes as he gets random bursts of anger and he has always been the \"special\" kid - YES I have tried explaining this to my mom but shes such a softie and expects everyone to ignore how badly he treats us because \"he's special\".)\n\nAnyways on to the relevant shit - remember the girl I mentioned earlier? Let's call her Jasmine. Now back in 2016 my brother and myself used to attend a youth service (I no longer go due to changed views but that's not important) where we met Jasmine, at that time she was attending the same Primary school as I was but I was only just starting to get to know her. She was also a bit of an \"odd\" person but I dont judge - we even became quite good friends. Fast forward about early 2018, Jasmine moves to a different town 15 minutes away after she's held back a year (so now shes my age but one grade behind). \n\nJasmine and I sort of drifted apart and I thought she was out of my life. Recently she suddenly started posting on her WhatsApp status out of nowhere, since I hadn't seen her online in over 2 months. These posts were all random deep and edgy quotes but amongst one of the slides was a picture of her and my brother in his room on his bed and they're all cuddled up and shit. My stomach honestly dropped and I just felt really sick to my stomach. It had to have been recently because 1. we moved into a new house and his walls are a bright colour so I could obviously see it was our new house and 2. he had recently dyed his hair which you could see in the image. \n\nI never remember her being invited to our house so I suspect he snuck her in which makes me even more ill.. I just cant believe he could do that. Everytime I look at a guy older than 17 I immediately associate it with my brother and am no longer interested. I'm honestly just really creeped out.\n\nSo in conclusion: Should I tell my mom? Or should I leave it because it's none of my business? I'm just super conflicted and could use some advice.",

I’m incompetent of helping them when they’re in a tough time, I just sit there worried for them, and feel like even more of an asshole because I don’t know what to do. My anxiety issues cause me to zone out in deep conversations so it seems like I’m not listening, I almost started crying in front of one of them during a conversation about relationships. I can’t help with their work as I’m not smart enough to understand calculus, or mental illness psychology. (I’m a graphic design major). \n\nI do try to be helpful in times, like offering food to them because we’re all broke, or to help move equipment for their class projects. \n\nI feel like I should just stay away from them. I’m never too into conversation and tend to make things dark, and kinda awkward. It might be better for them as they don’t have to put up with my asshole-ry ",

I’m 18 and barely getting done with highschool, getting into college in around 6 months and can’t make a living by myself.\n\nNow we get into the juicy stuff, I used to have a best friend who left after 4 years for Seattle due to his dad’s work, he was my only friend and I found it really hard to socialize. I also suffered from bullying that ranged from verbal abuse to hardcore wedgies on a daily basis. I went into a deep depression and even though my parents always intended to give me the best trips, clothes and experiences possible, I felt empty inside and even got to the point where I wanted to end my life.\n\nI’ve come a long way by myself emotionally and a little bit longer than 7 months ago I got my first GF (who for the sake of privacy we’ll call Kayla). Kayla has always had my back and has been supportive of everything I’ve done. My dad on the other hand has been the complete opposite, he has always wanted something different from me, he’s always looked at the way I look and present myself as instead of how I feel and what I like.\n\nI met Kayla at a national academic tournament, she lives 300 miles away from me, and my dad doesn’t like that a single bit. A few days ago he blew up and called everything I like and love (soccer and Kayla mainly) a bunch of literal bs that isn’t right for me.\nHonestly I feel like it’s been several years where I feel rejected by my own dad. So WIBTA if I leave my parents, my brother and my sister for a life in Kayla’s state? Not entirely leaving for her sake, I just want to feel accepted and fulfilled.",

      "description": "  \n\nMy brother and I are both married with children. I rent from my father who lives in the same building and my brother lives 3 miles away. For the last few years my brother has been complaining to his wife and my parents that he, our kids, and I don't spend enough time together. In the last three or four years, he has invited me to one event outside of his home, birthday parties, block parties, and New Year celebrations, all of which I have attended. In that time, I've invited him to an annual convention that he did attend three times, birthday parties that he didn't attend, and a few other random things he passed on. Now, events aside, the only other relevant information is that my nephew has very flat feet and needs special inserts to walk for long periods of time. I hope that is enough back story and presented without bias.\n\nTwo months ago, I purchased tickets for my brother, his son, my son, and myself to attend the annual convention. When I let my brother know, he said he was on board and that was pretty much it until a day before the convention. At that time, I texted him to ask how he wanted to handle travel to the venue. He said he didn't really care and it was my choice. As his son was staying the weekend with my father, I suggested he pick us up at 11 am the day of the convention. Initially, he provided a simple agreement, but a few hours later he messages me letting me know that his son misplaced one of his inserts earlier in the week and walking for a long time was going to be an issue for him. As such, they probably weren't going to make it through the whole convention and we might want to take separate vehicles so my son and I can finish the convention if they have to leave. I thought about it for a few hours and informed him that I agreed and, while I was hopeful they would make it through, believed it would be best if we took separate cars and we could meet at the entrance to the convention. He responded with (not verbatim), \"Well, I still have to pick up \\[my son\\] from, dad's, so I guess I'll text you when I get there.\" I replied questioning why my nephew wouldn't just ride with me and he answered, \"Because I'm picking him up. Thanks anyway.\" My first instinct was to ask him what his problem was, but I said, \"You're welcome. We'll see you there. Love you,\" and left it alone.\n\nTo shorten an already long story, my brother informed my dad to not let my nephew go anywhere with me, told my father he doesn't want to be a part-time family member (not sure what that specifically means here), had his wife pick up his son, and never did attend the convention. I haven't heard anything from him since.\n\nAm I an asshole for not wanting to have my son's and my time at the convention potentially cut short by my nephew's physical limitation and agreeing to take two cars after it was suggested?",

It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?",

I’m working on a plan with my doctor, but for the meantime I don’t sleep all night, or at least until very late. I also am a university student living in a dorm room with 1 other guy.\n\n\nAs opposed to staying in the room all night with my computer light on, I usually hang out in the campus library all night, or the local McDonalds. I generally come back home around 5-6 am, and try to be as quiet as possible, but my roommate often wakes up, and I feel terrible about it. He hasn’t openly complained about it to me, but I know that I wouldn’t like being woken up in the middle of the night by him coming home (to be fair, I have. He once brought his friend over at 6 am, who promptly began setting our trash on fire...). \n\n\nI guess, am I the asshole for waking my roommate up? Would it be better if I just stayed in my room with the laptop light? Thanks",

      "description": "My aunt owns a Cabin in the mountains, it's nice this time of year because it's close to ski resorts and has a very nice wintery feel. \n\n2 years ago my Aunt agreed to let my wife and I use it. Initially it was just supposed to be us 2. But as time went on and we were unable to find time to get away we missed the opportunity 2 Winters in a row. \n\nWord about the cabin got out to my wife's family and they expressed interest in possibly joining us if we ever decided to, or found the time, to go. \n\nI was fine with this. It was just me and her and her parents. Then her sister and nephew were added to the discussion without really asking me. But I was still okay with it because I love her family and we all get along well. \n\nSo we found a weekend to go and everything was looking fine. Then I find out that my wife's niece was also invited without asking me. I grit my teeth a bit simply because I wasn't consulted about it but in the end I was still okay with it. \n\nNow this trip has transformed from something that was just supposed to be my wife and I into her family trip to my family cabin. I'm okay with it. But a bit annoyed that my trip was \"taken over\".\n\nI was asked (I was finally asked!) if the niece could bring her new girlfriend (the romantic type. They are both 18.) To which I said no. I was not comfortable with that because this girl is a stranger and my wife's niece doesn't exactly have a great track record of making great decisions. \n\nI didn't feel comfortable bringing a stranger that I can't vouch for to my family cabin. \n\nAll of a sudden people are angry that I would deny her GF the opportunity to go and spend time with the family. And since the trip is a month away I have \"plenty of time to get to know her\" (their words). And \"it's only one person and we approve of her. It's not like she's bringing a bunch of people you don't know.  As if it's my job to go out of my way to vet the girl and test to see if she can earn my approval. \n\nAt this point I don't think I even want to go anymore. This whole thing has morphed into something that I don't recognize as the cozy little get away that I planned with my wife 2 years ago. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Wife's family wants to bring a stranger to my family's Cabin and I'm not comfortable with it. Stranger is my wife's niece's new GF.",

      "description": "I'm 21 and my girlfriend is 24. This morning I made her coffee and breakfast in bed and as she was drinking the coffee she said it was too strong and I said I'd make another. She then said \"you know, you shouldn't use too much coffee when making it\". This isn't the first time I've made her coffee and it isn't the first time she tells me how to do simple stuff. Maybe it's her accent (she's not from my country) but it comes off as condescending sometimes. I then sat next to her and said in the calmest way I could \"(her name), sometimes I've been noticing that you tell me how to do things quite frequently and sometimes it makes me feel a bit condescended because it's like you're telling me how to do the simplest things\" I then said I'm not mad or angry and I don't want to start an argument but I just wanted to bring this to her. She gets really defensive easily during arguments and doesn't see an issue with this. But I explained that it happens frequently and it just doesn't feel great when it's all the time.\n\nIt escalated quickly into an argument. I told her that I realise she's older and that she may feel the need to tell me how to do things and she responded with something along the lines of \"I've been through more, I have family and you don't and so you don't have those to explain things to you, which may mean I care more about you\" (I'm estranged from my family). I started saying that I just brought something to her and didn't want to argue and if I don't feel I can bring stuff to her then why should I to which she replied \" then why should we be in relationship\". She brings this up every other argument and has packed her bags about 3 times threatening to leave which breaks me. She then shuts her eyes and doesn't say anything else, I try talking to her and with no response ask if she doesn't want to talk. She then says \"you have hurt me so much, you have said disgusting things and I don't want to talk\". I point out that she just said about breaking up which is disgusting and it's met with \"you made me say that because you hurt me\". Then she got under the bed covers and went back to sleep.\n\nI'm just at a loss, everything seems perfect when we're happy but every argument it just turns into this..",

      "description": "Okay so there's quite a bit to this story but I'll try my best to explain it as neutral and equal as possible. Me and my girlfriend have been together for about a year and a half now and it's been a bumpy road pretty much the whole time. We met 3 years ago but kept it casual for a long time as I didn't feel ready for a relationship due to trust issues on my end which I was very up front about to her,  I'd say that we are still in love but it's definitely a very distant love where neither of us can talk to each other about anything (all this leads up to my main point.) Our sex life has been getting worse and worse over the months and has always been quite dry compared to what I like which has always made distance between us as I see it as an important part of a healthy relationship which she disagrees with. There's much more but I'll get to the main point.\n\nEND OF THE BRIEF BACK STORY\n\nSo this has been something I've been doing quite recently where she'll either go somewhere or listen to a certain person that I think is quite honestly stupid and without logic. For example she works in a mostly female work force so there's a lot of bitching and people making up things about others which she has been caught on the middle of as of now. 2 specific girls started lying and picking on her friend and actually made a complaint to the boss about the lies they'd made up about my girlfriend and her friend. This has caused my girlfriend a lot of stress so obviously being her boyfriend I've told her to stop getting involved with girls like that as they are just causing her stress and making her miserable at home which she just shruggs off ebeb though she told me that it makes her feel that way. Fast forward to a couple of nights ago when one of those girls lying about her texts her asking to meet up at 11:30PM basically crying for attention hecause no else will come out and even though all the shit she made my girl feel and all the lies she made up about her, my girl goes to meet up eith her and be a shoulder to cry on which I obviously question and say that shes playing you and just making a fool out of you. Then she says that its \"my choice what I do and you shouldn't question me.\" This made me confused as I thought it seemed like common sense to not go but obviously I was wrong as I spoke my concern about what she'll say and maybe even start a fight to which my girl just shrugged her shoulders and left. Another example was a night when she was just going out with some friends to a bar which I was completely fine with until it got to about 1:30 in the morning which was odd because she had work the next day. I tried calling her to check up and she didn't answer after another few times of calling which got me worried because I didn't hear from her since 5PM that evening and I had no idea where she could be or if she was safe. An hour and a half passes and I get a call from her saying she's on her way back to which I respond with telling her of the worry I was in and how scared it had made me. She tells me that she was going to come back earlier but one of the guys in her group had just gone through a break up so she was trying to give advice and help talk to him for the past couple of hours which made me flip my shit as she knows of the distressing past mental abuse I suffered from other relationships and the trust issues I face every day. I've told her about these things so she understands my thought process and how I put things together in my head. However it didn't occur to her that I'd be pissed about her fixing another boys issues while simultaneously causing more for me by not even sending a single message saying what time she'll be back or if she was even alive. I critized how she thought that was okay and how she would think I wouldn't worry with the issues I've told her about time and time again. There are more instances of similar situations but you get the image, I'm not saying that any of this isn't my faults because I do believe it's my fault but I definitely don't think I'm an asshole with how open I've been about her about these issues and that it will affect the relationship.\n\nIn short: AITA for being annoyed about said situations and questions her mental logic to do certain things that she knows won't end well or are just letting her get used by others?",

      "description": "A month ago, my mom asked me whether or not I could tutor her friend's teenage daughter, as she was having a rough time at school and her grades were slipping because of depression. I went through depression in high school and would have loved to have someone to help me during that time, so I said \"yes, just tell me when/where/etc.\" The conversation was left at that.\n\nDuring the month, I have heard nothing from the family about tutoring the girl. No times, no place, and no confirmation about anything. However, today the mother confronted me about not taking the initiative in helping her daughter. Apparently, I was supposed to follow up with them even though I don't have their contact info and I was under the impression that communication would mostly be through my mother as I don't know her personally. This is my first time even attempting to tutor someone, so was I in the wrong for not contacting her?",

      "description": "My ex and I broke up 7 months ago, but we have a lot of mutual friends and go to the same parties so I can't avoid seeing him, although we are not friends anymore because his new girlfriend is not comfortable with it.\n\nI saw him with his new girlfriend in July and I sent her a message asking if she is uncomfortable that I go to the same parties as them, she said no it's fine. I also asked for my stuff back from my ex, and she said he would give it to a mutual friend (still haven't gotten it back).\n\nAfter that, I messaged her in August because she seemed very angry at me, for example pushing me when she walked past. She said that nothing is wrong, that's just her face.\n\nIn September I saw them again, and she still seemed like she wanted to murder me. I sent her a message saying that it was nice to see her, it looked like she was having fun. She replied saying thanks you too.\n\nI haven't contacted her after that, but last night my ex texted me saying not to message his girlfriend or talk to her, he wants nothing to do with me, and he just wants me to leave them alone.\n\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "So this happened last night and when I woke up this morning I still felt pretty bad so I'd love some opinions.\n\nBit of backstory: I live in a slightly rough area, there's a bit of gang violence and a large homeless population, nothing overtly dangerous most of the time, but as with any large homeless population, for every 100 who are just regular people having a hard time and just trying to get by, you get a dozen unsavoury characters who are heavily into drugs, can be violent, etc. To put in perspective, it's not the kind of place that you'd get knifed for looking at someone funny, but you wouldn't walk around with an expensive phone in your hands in case you get mugged. As a woman currently living alone (spouse is away on business) I obviously have to keep my wits about me in terms of safety, though there are very few occasions when I have ever felt at risk. \n\nI'm walking home last night from a local supermarket down an unlit path after dark; again, not a dangerous thing to do most of the time in my experience, but you do have to be fairly careful and alert. I pass a pair of men, approx 30-40, drinking a few beers on a bench; just as I get to the point where my back is to them, I hear one of them stand up and call out something like \"hey miss\" or \"hey ma'am\" - I just kept walking. I don't know what their reasoning behind trying to stop me was, but I don't believe they were in any way a threat looking back - my front door was less than 12 feet from them and they made no attempt to follow me or anything like that - but my instincts say that offending a random stranger is less important than preserving my own safety. That said, I did spend the rest of the night feeling bad, and the feeling stuck with me through to this morning.\n\nSo thoughts? Am I right to feel bad, or was this just a sensible call on my part?

A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?

      "description": "Sorry for the impending wall of text.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little background before starting.\n\nSorry for possible poor grammar, English isn't my first language.\n\nThe story happened last year. Me and my good friend Marie (fake name for obvious reasons) were sub-renting (pretty illegal) a flat we had found on the French equivalent of Craigslist in the city we go to college at.\n\nMarie and I, at the time, we really close friends and were really excited to share a flat. It just didn't work out as flatmates because we were so incompatible personnality and lifestyle wise so we argued for a lot of stuff although we were perfectly getting along outside the flat.\n\nThe flat had 2 bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom.  The main focus here is on the bedrooms and living room. Apart from the technical issues there was in the flat, there was ONE big, main issue.  The guy subrenting the flat didn't want to include his bedroom in the deal so we were left with the 2nd bedroom and the living room (with either a couch or a crappy inflatable mattress to sleep on).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarie and I agreed to take turns. One week one of us would get the bedroom, one week one of us would sleep on the couch and vice versa, fair enough. We even agreed that on sunday evening, the one in charge of the bedroom would change the sheets and clean the room so the other one wouldn't have to deal with the other one's mess, fair enough.\n\nWe strongly agreed on those terms and we would bend the rules if some people were over, although the only time we bent them was when I let her use the bed a few nights during some of MY weeks so she could have privacy with her fuck buddy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to 2 months in, and I have to go back to my hometown for a week because my bestfriend had unexpectedly died and I wanted to be around my friends to grieve and cry together. After one tough week I went back to my flat, completely, mentally worn out, and just sad. I only wanted to go to sleep in the bed because it was MY turn to use the bedroom.\n\n I asked Marie to do the switcheroo as usual but didn't want this time. I asked her why and she told me In a very very annoyed and arrogant way that I had to sleep on the couch because during the week in my hometown I could sleep in my own bed so it was unfair that I got to sleep in a bed 2 weeks in row. \n\nI was really surprised of such an answer, as she totally knew that I lost my friend and that I was in a really tough spot in my life (for some other reasons). After some quick back and forth I didn't have the energy nor the patience to argue and just sterly told her \"Fuck off\" and left the room to play some games. (Had she argued calmly I would have definitely tried to find common ground but in this case, nope.)\n\n She snapped at me and insulted me and talking nonsense about how I was inconsiderate, bringing up stuff unrelated to the argument and I just told her \"What-thefuck-ever\". She started to cry and eventually complied.  She guilt tripped me into apologising to her for being so mean but she never apologised for being so insensitive to me. Rules are rules ffs. The few common friends we had didn't give a crap about the argument (rightfully so) and a few friends of mine say I'm NTA although I should have handled it more diplomatically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm asking you Reddit, AITA for telling her to F off because she arrogantly wanted to argue? am I NTA because she acted like an entitled brat? Is ESH because although she didn't act appropriately I could've  handled the matter more nicely?\n\n(We're no longer friends as I moved back to my hometown after finishing college and just didn't want to be her friend anymore due to further arguments on other stuff)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask for INFO as I may have forgotten some details along the way! \n\nThanks for reading!",

      "description": "Hello! \n\nHere's an argument we had while driving home..\n\n\n\nFirst for some background. \n\n\n\nMy fiance and I both own our own cars. Both are over 100k miles. Mine has about 20k miles more and is a little bit younger. Mine is worth about 2-3k more on Kelly blue book. We have separate car insurance.  I have comprehensive/collision and I thiiiink he no longer has comprehensive/collision. \n\n\nSince our driveway forces us to park each other in , for convenience, we switch cars about every other day. Aka some days I drive his car and some days I drive my car and likewise. \n\n\n\nWe have split finances and don't currently plan on merging them although we do have a share account for food/house expenses that we contribute equally to. \n\n\nOn to the argument... \nIt came up that he assumed if I got into an accident in his car and totalled it that I would buy him a new car (not new new.. just new to us). His rational was that if he himself got in an accident in mine that he would feel bad and would want to make it up to me and do the same. \n\n\nI replied that I wasn't comfortable with that. He clarified only if one of us was at fault for the accident/ it was caused by stupidity on our part.  \n\n\n\nMy thought process is that each of our cars are our responsibility to take care of.\n\n\nHowever if I dinged his car and it was fixable I would try to fix it/make him whole. But if the car it totalled I doubt he would get the same car/same year/same mileage as  it would make more sense to upgrade. I would probably offer to help with the cost.. but not front it all. That would put us in the awkward situation where one if us would have to buy two cars back to back potentially since both of them are getting further along in years. Although I doubt we will have to replace them for years to come.. hopefully. \n\nHe actually seemed ok with my reasoning and I'm glad this was brought up before either of us got into a bad accident (knock on wood). \n\nAITA for not wanting to buy him a new car if I wrecked it? \n\nWhat do you guys think would be a fair? \n",

      "description": "This happened about 8 years ago, but it came up recently when I was discussing “awkward first dates” on another subreddit....   This was before I met my husband for those who might creep through my comments out of suspicion...\n\nI was on dating websites back then, and came across a guy who SEEMED cool and we agreed to meet up for pizza.  Upon arrival, he gives me a toy Megazord from the Power Rangers series...\n\nGUY: “I like to give presents.”\n\n....  Ooookaaay....  VERY odd since although I was geeky myself (still am today to a certain point) I hadn’t been into Power Rangers since I was in 5th grade....   I don’t even remember telling him that I ever liked Power Rangers....\n\nThe date was boring as sin, we had nothing in common, and afterwards we never kept in touch.\n\nAbout a week later, I’m gathering some old stuff at home to sell on eBay and decide to throw Megazord in there, especially since 1) I have no use for him and 2)  I don’t really want it.\n\nAnother week passes, out of the complete blue, Dude IMs me and asks, “So how much did you get from my gift on eBay?”\n\nFirst, I’m freaked out because I don’t know HOW he found out what I put on eBay (I never added him on any of my social accounts) but then goes off saying, “That Megazord meant a lot to me!  It was given to me as a child by my grandmother before she passed away!!”\n\nME: “Then why did you give it to me?”\n\nHIM: “Because I wanted you to like me.”\n\nI don’t remember exactly how the rest of the conversation went, but I remember cringing like crazy a lot, and we eventually agree never to speak to each other again.\n\nI haven’t thought about it much since, but since I did bring it up recently, I figured I’d ask here....\n\nWas I an asshole?",

This time we talk for maybe 2 min and she says “hey I’m gonna i wanna go talk to this new girl” and I question her by saying “about what?” And “who?” And she tells me it’s a new girl and she doesn’t wanna tell me what they’re gonna talk about.\n\nI usually drop things because I really do trust her.. but this makes me question things because I want her to be open with me about everything. I feel like In a relationship you should keep things from your S/O no matter how small. If they ask you should answer.. she doesn’t feel that way. Now we’re arguing because she thinks I don’t trust her. But I know I trust her but her keeping secrets is making me question my trust. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm 29 years old. I dated my ex for 4 years and we've been broken up for another 4. Context is hugely important here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had an incredible relationship. I've never felt more loved, happy, and fulfilled. \n\nI've always been into drugs (weed, coke, molly, etc) but my best friend/dealer managed to get his hands on heroin. I was an idiot who thought statistics didn't apply to me and I tried it. This was 7 years ago. I didn’t touch it again for almost a year until my birthday where I did it. That turned into using it on special occasions to using it weekly and to make a long story short, I became an addict.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy ex was an angel at that time and *pleaded* with me to get help. I thought I could handle quitting on my own. I couldn't admit to myself I needed help. My personality started changing. I would get irritable and scream at her. I would gaslight her (tell her I only used once that week knowing very well I was high all day everyday). I stole from her (not to mention my parents and friends). I was never physically abusive, but I was a piece of shit and look back in shame of what I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, after two years, she couldn't take it anymore and broke up with me. I was a mess. I was using a LOT more, stealing more, etc. I eventually OD’d and hit rock bottom.\n\nAfter my overdose, I knew that if I continued on this path, it WILL kill me. My withdrawal lasted for 10 days. It was hell on Earth, but I made it, and haven’t touched any drug since.\n\nI decided to turn my entire life around. I started volunteering at local schools (I worked with administration for local schools and was able to share my experience as an addict to kids), learned new skills to fill my resume gap. I got a job as a statistician a few months later (I majored in statistics in school) and now make decent money. I started working on myself, eating right, lifting, meditation, yoga. During the first couple years, it’s like I traded one addiction (heroin) with another (improving myself). I was scared shitless of becoming the failure I was destined to be in that lifestyle. I gained quite a bit of weight (muscle), look better than I ever had. I repaid every dime I ever stole (wrote them letters and checks individually).\n\nThe whole point of this context is to emphasize: I really have changed. I know I made shitty choices and I regret the person I was every day. \n\nI want to know, would I be the asshole if I reached out to her? I miss her everyday. She was my everything, my world. I’ve never had anybody else I was so happy with. When getting clean, my whole thought process was to become the man she wished I was. And now that I’m here, I just don’t know. I know I caused her so much pain. But I love her, and I want to prove to her that I’m no longer the shitty addict I used to be. \n\nWIBTA?\n\nTLDR; Former addict. Girlfriend broke up with me. Hit rock bottom. Want her back. WIBTA?",

      "description": "I'm the manager of a barbershop/salon. We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway here, some details changed including prices. \n\nI know this looks like word vomit, and I’m sorry about that. I can provide more info if needed. TLDR at bottom\n\nMy sister is getting married in 8 weeks and the girls in the bridal party are planning on going to a bachelorette party in 6 weeks. \n\nWhen she started planning the wedding, she had a very modest budget and aspirations, which has spiraled a little out of control. The costs have trickled down to bridesmaids (5) and maids of honor (2). I am one of the 2 maids of honour. She refused to consider the idea of the girls getting their own dresses after being given a colour/colour palette. We absolutely had to shop from a specific website, which offers good deals, but I never plan on wearing this nonreturnable, $150 dress ever again. As far as I know, all the other girls are on the same boat, but no one wants to say anything because they don’t want to upset her. \n\nI only know the other girls in the bridal party casually, but almost everyone is wanting to start a family and they’re wanting to save up for everything that comes with that. I met with one of the bridesmaids and she told me that she was considering not going on the trip because of the increasing costs. \n\nAs for the trip, sis picked the place, which is a drive for almost everyone else. For her, it’s 2 hours; for others, it’s up to 8/9 hours. I found accommodations that were nice, but sis wanted to spend way more. I told her that there would be people who would not show up if it cost too much, and she told me she would pay out of pocket, and we could just pick an arbitrary number to tell the bridesmaids to pay so they don’t feel like charity cases. She looked through all the choices I had chosen and vetoed them all because they were not glamorous enough. She picked a place on her own, and I still don’t know how much she paid for it. I let her pick and pay because some places had different amenities. I picked $50 (not true price, just wanna stay anonymous) as the price per person. The bridesmaids enquired as to how to pay for it, I told them and they sent the money straight to sis. \n\nDays after I get notifications from the bridesmaids saying that they have paid, I get a text from sis saying that the price is higher because one of the bridesmaids is not going. Sis had know about that situation before she booked the place. She texts me to let me know, and I asked her to ask them for the extra money. She thought I was shaming her. I told her that I felt rude asking for more money from them under the circumstances, and she unhinged on me. I told her that I am not the only moh, and that she is more than welcome to ask her to relay the message to the girls. \n\nTLDR/Summary\n-sis started small with wedding planning, has spiraled out of control\n-said she would pay out of pocket for more glamourous accommodations for bachelorette party\n-wants me to ask bridesmaids for more money\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for breaking up with my depressed girlfriend?",
      "description": "So I broke up with my long term girlfriend right before we went to college a few months ago.  I really enjoyed our relationship and her as a person but I felt we couldn't keep dating anymore. We started dating about a year and half ago, before our senior year. It was fine and dandy until around graduation time. She was battling through depression and other mental issues (including an emotionally abusive mother and school stress). We went to prom together and she started pressuring me into having sex with her. It started as a joke but then she said if I really loved her then I would have it with her. And she started to say that about a lot of other things. I had my reserves because I was already starting to question our relationship, but that really made me question her intentions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I felt like our relationship devolved from two best friends to me being her emotional crutch. The whole summer was just me taking care of her from one dilemma to the next. I loved her and was wanting to help so I overlooked a lot of it. But the final straw was when I went on a trip to Europe as my grad present. I saved money for two years by working in fast food for this trip and was super excited. My ex was not going on the trip from going on another trip the summer before. I was only able to talk to her a few times over the trip because of the cellular reception. Every time we talked, she just talked about how jealous that I was on the trip. She never even asked me what I did on the trip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I came back from the trip, I decided to confront her about how I wasn't happy. When I did, she broke down crying and was angry that I never told her all these things bothered me. So I backtracked and decided on a break. We talked less for about a week then got coffee right before we moved in to college. She seemed like she was really trying to be better and wanting me to be happy so I thought getting back together would be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we moved in to college, everything just felt the exact same between us. So I finally just ended it for sure this time a week in. It really hurt the both of us. And every day after that, I was thinking about her. So about a month later, I texted her to get coffee and try to get back together. We met, she showed up with two massive hickies on her neck (that kinda hurt). We talked about college and life. She told me about all the new guys she's been with and I sheepishly avoided my lack of moving on. We finally talked about us, and she told me that I broke her and I was an asshole for not communicating. She then said she never loved me, which I knew was a lie but still hurt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel terrible for leaving her in such a bad state during the first semester of college, but some of my friends are college have said though that she is being manipulative. I want to be a better person and see where I can grow. So am I the asshole for giving up on our relationship and not communicating, or was she truly manipulative and I am blinded by the fantasy of what we use to have?",

      "description": "I have a 20 year old Honda. I bought it for $400 a year ago. It has massive clutch problems but nothing that can't be temporarily fixed by putting fluid in the clutch; for $400 I didn't expect it to last long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going through a breakup, and the car suddenly became way more important to me. I've spent $600 on it in the last two weeks to get new tags on it and then I had to pay to get it out of impound because I was driving it uninsured. Now it's insured, it's registered, it's mine, and the clutch went out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, fine, it's happened before. My dad has a mechanic buddy so I asked him to put some fluid in it and I'd pay for his time. Tonight, my dad say's he's replacing the whole clutch, brakes, and my bearings, and I owe him $1000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost it. I realize that I need the car, I realize that I probably can't get a better one for $1000, I realize that the $1000 quote is about 75% better than any other mechanic would give me. But HOLY SHIT HE JUST SPENT $1000 OF MY MONEY WITHOUT EVEN ASKING.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel really stupid for being mad about now having a much better working car, but frankly I wasn't planning on ever, ever repairing a $400 POS, I was just going to drive it until it broke and then rinse and repeat. He says it will last five years and gave me a big ol' lecture on it, and I do understand that he did me a good turn, but I'm still upset about the money I wasn't asked about spending. That's a very, very large amount for me, and I just shelled out a previous $600 for something I wish I'd left in impound.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's acting like I'm a real dick for being upset. Am I?",

      "description": "I’ll keep it short. I’ve been friends with “Ben” since we were 12. He’s kinda popped in and out of my life since, disappearing for a couple years at a time when he has a new gf etc. We recently started talking again about 3 weeks ago, and within that time he’s disappeared 3 times.  I’m not into forced communication texting, I don’t need to talk everyday. Our friendship has always been platonic but I consider us very close. I’m annoyed because one of these times he ignored my messages for 24 hours after I had an important question about something I was purchasing for his mom while in an airport. This current time, he had been drinking and was upset so I asked him to let me know when he was safe or at least open my message if he didn’t feel like talking so I knew he was ok.  He has now been ghosting me for 3 days and will not open my message. \nI would love to continue our friendship but it is very intense when we are in communication and then quite saddening when he disappears as I never know if it’ll be for 24 hours or 3 years. \nI know he’s going through some stuff but as I’ve gotten older I just don’t have the time for one sided friendships where I feel like I’m chasing the other person half the time. I don’t have the energy to beg someone to stick around and then wonder if they’re ignoring me or if they’re in trouble. \nWould I be the asshole if I just don’t respond to his next text when he (inevitably) resurfaces? \n\nTL;DR - wibta for ending a friendship the other person clearly doesn’t care that much about ",

      "description": "One of my play aunts (aka not actually a blood relation) passed away recently. When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? ",

      "title": "AITA For Not Paying Ex's Rent When I'm On Lease?",
      "description": " \n\nTLDR: AITA for not paying my portion on my ex's rent, even though I signed the lease?\n\nI broke up with my girlfriend of two years. We had just moved into an apartment with eachother and signed a lease, but things didn't go well for the first week. She ended up breaking up with me and I left. We then agreed that she would leave as well and we could talk about breaking the lease with the landlord. In addition to that, I would help her cover her expenses (damage deposits, fees for breaking lease, etc) so she could set herself up (she also owes me $850 for another thing- would happily ignore that). I also told her I would pay my half of the current lease for the next three months. She agreed.\n\nShe then didn't want to do that, and so we decided she would find a room mate to cover at least a part of my portion.\n\nEventually she changed her mind and decided to stay there and have me cover 30% of the rent for the next year (grand total $5350 for about 5 days of rental benefit to me).\n\nAs it stands, it's a bad situation for me, her, and the landlord. Bad for me because the extra money for nothing (also having to support my ex's lifestyle), for her because she could barely afford 50%, let alone 70% of the lease and would be better off in something affordable, and for the landlord because both his current 'tenants' were financially devastated, uncommitted, broken up, and were likely to default at any moment. Instead of moving on and trying to get to a better position, the other two parties were relying on me to cover the damage and keep the status quo. I would rather pay them out and immediately break the agreement, but because their end is covered they would rather not.\n\nI consulted a lawyer, did some thinking, and eventually came to a solution: I decided to stop paying rent.\n\nIf I don't pay, she can't pay. If she can't pay, the landlord by law has to evict and find a new tenant. We can both equally or individually be sued for lost rental income, but no more.\n\nI'm not happy with it, and I really don't like doing this to a person that I loved and still love. It is also really disrespectful to my landlord. I know that if I was in either of their shoes I would take the opportunity to get out while it was available. I have been forthcoming in helping with penalties and expenses but they won't budge. This position is one of desperation and I feel it will be very damaging for all of us, but I don't mean it as retribution. I love my ex, respect my landlord, but when it comes to this situation I know I have to do what I feel is right by law and by my heart. The apartment should go to someone who can afford it, my ex should be living somewhere she can afford, and I shouldn't be the one filling in the blanks with absolutely 0% benefit.\n\nAm I the Asshole?  \nBonus: Am I right? I want to know what you think.",

      "description": "Small history - My parents gifted me a car when I left for my sophomore year of college, registered it with my name and everything, only they paid for it. I've had this car for about two years or so now. I'm back home for a bit and my brother (who is in college, two years behind me) was visiting for the weekend. He's had my mom's old BMW for about a month now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly don't know if I'm in the right to be pissed about this, but here it goes. My brother was about ready to drive back up to school (about a two hour drive away) and it turns out the wiring is messed up in it because he had been trying to install some stupid new lighting system in it to make it \"cooler.\" Somehow, he fucked up the brake lights and they aren't working at all, so obviously he can't drive it now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parent's brilliant solution to this is to give him my car until they can fix the BMW and drive it back up to him. Which I'd be fine with for a bit, except for the fact that no one knows how long that will take or even if they can be fixed at this point, and for the fact that EVERY car he's ever been given to drive he has fucked up in some way or another. His first car: a classic Corvette that he crashed following someone that had stollen something from the side of our house. Second car: a Firebird trans am (super nice and that my dad was going to resell one day) he crashed because he was tailgating someone and they decided to brake check him. Third car: the BMW whose brake lights wiring he ruined. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI offered to drive him back to school and take him wherever he needed to get stuff until he'd have his car back to do it on his own, but my parents said because it's snowing he needed the transportation. (It snowed where I lived too and I got around without a car just fine my freshman year, I might add.) They wouldn't let him take any other cars (my mom's truck and my dad's 300) because they're scared he'll wreck them and then they'll be out of a car. They also insisted I didn't need it because I'm taking a break from school this semester and I don't have a job yet, even though I have an interview thursday which they said they would take me to now. They didn't care about the plans I've made with my boyfriend (we live across city from each other so we generally meet in the middle to avoid both of us driving far) or any other plans I had for the week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand they paid for my car, but they said it was a gift and it's registered under my name. Why do I have to give up my means of transportation because my brother ruins every car he's ever had? If he ruins it, then I'm fucked out of a car now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being pissed here or are my parents in the right to give it away because they paid for it?",

      "description": "For some context on our relationship, my girlfriend is great. We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?",

      "description": "I'm (19m) halfway through my second year of college and there's this girl who was in a class of mine my first semester here. She seemed friendly enough and we got along pretty well. I ended up being closer with other people in the class, and we never ended up really being close friends.\n\nAbout a year ago, me and my friends ran into her and her friends while drunk, and she spent that time feeling up my arms and I was very drunk and didn't really say anything because I didn't know what to do, but it made me very, very uncomfortable. It's weird, but I put a lot of stock in who I'm okay with physically engaging me and I only really like it from people I feel like I can trust. My ex-girlfriend both physically abused me and pressured me into sex when I didn't want it, so I have some trouble dealing with girls I don't know trying to get physical with me and I get really uncomfortable really quickly.\n\nThis past weekend, I was on tinder and saw the girl mentioned above and I swiped right because I knew her, as I normally do when I bump into people I recognize on tinder. She swiped on me, and we exchanged hello's. She asked me what I was doing Halloween weekend and I didn't reply, because I wasn't really interested in talking to her and she already has my phone number from a group project during class.\n\nTwo days later, she messaged me, \"Really??? No reply [my name]?\" and I apologized and told her to text me if she wanted to talk. She messaged me Halloween night at 1 am what my plans were and what I was up to, but I didn't reply and texted her the next morning that I had gone to sleep because I had early classes. She is now texting me asking what classes I'm taking next semester, from electives to things in my major, and I had given tepid responses over and over until she texted me \"Take [a class] with me next semester\" and I responded with \"Do I get a choice in the matter?\" and felt bad because I didn't want to be a dick so I apologized and played it off as me making a bad joke and she laughed it off and asked me again what classes I need to take. I haven't replied to her next text.\n\nIs my past trauma making me lash out and be an asshole at someone who's being perfectly reasonable and trying to express romantic interest? I can't tell if I'm overly sensitive or if I'm being reasonable about this.",

Then my friend saw him and added him too so now we both talked to him.\n\nFast forward to about two days ago when I got a dickpic from him that I didn't want (I didn't flirt with him in any way) so I just kinda let it slide since i kinda knew him. But i still wanted an apology. So i reminded him about it and he left me on read.

      "description": "Usually at first I would just silence my phone and ignore these calls, but that didn’t help. Then for a while I’d answer and if it was offered I would press the button to be put on their do not call list, which I probably don’t need to tell you also does nothing. Finally, I started pressing through to speak with someone and I would kindly request to not be called again. No such luck with that tactic either. And it must be the same few companies/people since it’s always either calls about treating my “chronic pain” despite being a relatively healthy 30-year old, or about winning a vacation from a drawing that I never entered.\n\nI got another call today and just sort of snapped. No kind request, no introducing myself, as soon as I heard an actual person on the other end I just yelled at the top of my voice directly into my phone’s microphone - “STOP CALLING ME!” There was brief silence, and then they disconnected.\n\nTo be honest, I instantly felt a bit of regret. I rarely ever lose my cool like that, and the rush of adrenaline was making me feel a bit ill. That person didn’t personally call me, they just happened to be the one on the other end of the line. They’re just doing their job, after all.\n\nAnd yet... I feel that they *must* know that the calls they are handling are unwanted, if not even illegal. (The phone numbers that show up on caller ID are always spoofed, after all.) Surely they would expect to receive reactions like mine, if not even more harsh. And I can’t help but feel that doing something illegal and/or socially unacceptable should have some level of repercussion, even if it is just someone yelling at you for a brief moment.\n\nTL;DR - Am I the asshole for losing my temper at an unsuspecting spammer/potential fraudster?",

      "description": "Background info: My hair and scalp are very weird and sensitive. It's very long, thick, and wirey and has to be washed every other day with a certain quality shampoo conditioner. Otherwise, it gets oily quickly, my scalp breaks out, and it gets scaly and flaky. I am 19, and my stepsister is 16. We share a bathroom\n\nLast night I visited my mother, and mentioned the shampoo and conditioner I was using was pretty crappy, and my head was breaking out. We stopped by Target and picked up some medicated shampoo, and some pretty expensive conditioner(both about $35 together). Tonight I went to take a shower, and texted my step sister(she had gone to her room for the night) to please not use the shampoo and conditioner, as it was very expensive, and I needed it. I told her if she had any dandruff, she could use the shampoo and it would clear it up really fast. She has several shampoos/conditioners in the shower already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got out of the shower, I opened the door to my dad pretty much screaming at me that I shouldn't have said that, and she could use it if she wanted. Stuff about sharing. I pretty much just explained to him what it was for and went to my room and closed the door. He proceeds to yell \"I'M NOT DONE TALKING TO YOU!\" and barges in my room. Keep in mind, I JUST GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER. I had closed my bedroom door and was about to remove my towel as he walked in. He proceeded to chew me out more and I told him to get out. I've called him out on barging in after showers before, and he knows it. Once I left the house for several days after an incident when I suspected he was just trying to see me naked. AITA for asking her politely to not use the shampoo my mom had bought me to keep my head healthy? ",

      "description": "Hello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fiancé and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "My friend (let's call him Bob) and I have been best friends for about a year and a half at this point. We met in high school but didn't really become friends until we started working together. \n\nSince then we would frequently go out partying together and hang out; Which is funny since I never would have thought the two of us would become friends.\n\nI ended up moving into a house with my mum that was on the same street as him, so we saw each other frequently. When he broke up with his girlfriend of 5 years (Sarah, we'll call her) I was the closest and most available person to offer him support, which brought us very close together.\n\nTogether we worked though our mental health problems, helped each other with girls and were like brothers. When he suggested me move out together, I was hesitant at first, but later jumped at the idea of living out of home with my best friend; So, we started renting a flat together.\n\nThen he met 'Kate' on tinder. Bob has always been a very sensitive person and being single after 5 years really got to him, so when Kate came along, he was enamoured with her immediately. They had sex on the first night they met and within a week he told her he loved her (and meant it). Two weeks after meeting her he told her on drug and alcohol fuel rant that he wanted to marry her and have children. It is not healthy to become that attached to someone that quickly.\n\nOne night, Bob, Kate and I went to a hotel to have dinner and drinks. As we were waiting for our food, Kate pointed out one of the waitresses (Tara) and went on about how that Tara bullied her in high school. As more friends joined us, Kate would go on to rant about how awful Tara was, until I drunkenly joked that Tara couldn't be that bad because she was pretty and I wanted to date her. This cause Kate to snap at me, calling me the \"Biggest cunt\" she had ever met and storming out to have a cry in the parking lot for 2 hours. Bob (being in love) followed and comforted her. This event was the first sign that Kate wasn't quite right.\n\nEventually Kate and I got past this incident and become friends. Over the next 2 months the 3 of us would hang out a lot. However, I came to notice that Bob and Kate would argue constantly over the smallest things and Bob's mental health began to deteriorate. Sometimes the two would argue and I would take Kate's side because Bob would get enraged over nothing.\n\nI eventually learned that Kate had borderline personality disorder and was on medication.

      "description": "So my GF and I are planning a week long vacation to a country we’ve never been to before. We are excited and looking at tons of different activity ideas. \n\nShe is extremely adamant about doing something active. Typically on vacation I like to maximize my “touristy” activities, especially since it’s a country we’ve never been to before and not “waste time”. \n\nNow what she wants to do, is take a 30-50km “bike tour” outside of the city to go see certain famous areas. \n\nI am not against going to see that area in any way, in fact it seems amazing. I’m also not against using bikes as a mode of transportation as long as it’s reasonable (just getting around the city limits, biking to restaurants for dinner, etc.) \n\nWhat I don’t want to do, is spend an entire day of a week long trip essentially just biking from one place to another. Neither of us are huge on biking, we don’t even own bikes. I think it’s an incredible waste of time to bike somewhere simply for the experience of biking that distance, rather than taking a train or bus to the place that’s so far away. \n\nShe was extremely upset when I told her my thinking on this. She doesn’t think it’s a waste of time and is calling it an “adventure”. \n \nAITA for not wanting to do this? ",

      "description": "To start out I currently share an apartment with two other guys while going to school. We got stuck together in the dorms last year and decided to move out together. Last year we did birthday gifts for the other two guys and a third who lived with us at the time. I spent \\~$30 or so on each birthday. Their birthdays were all during the school year so before we moved to where we are currently. My birthday was in June right in between moving out of the dorms and moving into our apartment so we weren't together for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe original plan for my birthday was I was going to buy something nice online and they were going to buy needed accessories for it but I later decided to not buy it and to save my money instead.After moving into our apartment I asked them if they would be okay with us going to the store and buying a cheaper item would they be willing to just reimburse me for that. That way it would be nearly the same as the other birthdays, I just would've been able to choose what item I wanted instead of them choosing it for me. He flatly said he didn't want to come and that he did not want to do that because he didn't want to just venmo me money for my birthday or what not. I was annoyed at this point told him to do what he wanted to do and left with my other roommate to the store.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ended up picking up the item that I wanted and my other roommate helped me buy it as my birthday gift. We returned home and it hasn't been mentioned since. It hurt my feelings for a while and we weren't friends for a bit after that but now we hang out and get along fairly well. WIBTA if I don't get him a present for his birthday in a few months, I don't like letting people walk over me but I know it will hurt his feelings and drive a rift between us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR. Got roommate a gift for his last birthday, he skipped mine. WIBTA if I don't get him anything this year?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I'll try my hardest to keep this short (probably won't), thanks for your patience.\n\nMy mom (\\~40) and I (18M) live together in a small apartment near my sister's (22F) house. Both my sister and I grew up young -- she's married with one kid already and a really nice house, and I have almost two years of college and living by myself already -- and after learning I could pick a few extra cheap college credits where I'm at, I moved in with my incredibly helpful sister and her husband for a few weeks before I picked up an apartment, got a job, and enrolled in classes. My mother, coming from Michigan where her sister's store closed down for the season, came with me. As I got a job first and had a good chunk of money saved up, I offered to help my mother out by letting her live with me until she got on her feet. My sister also offered to help, lending her extra car for us to drive.\n\nSo it's my mother living with me and my sister living down the road.\n\nWe've been here for three months now, and she just about refuses to get a job. I'm stuck paying rent -- thank God it's cheap -- food, gas, and everything. I wouldn't mind doing this for the person who raised me, but considering I'm a full time student and even while working as often as possible, I can't keep up. She keeps promising me that she's actively searching for a job, but I've caught her in many lies. One example: our car has a breadcrumb feature where you can read where someone drives it; when she says she's out talking to businesses she's actually at home. She also continues to claim she has a lot more money than she really has, but whenever it's time to pay for rent she \"doesn't know where it went\" and after pulling her bank statements (admittedly behind her back) I found she never had much at all. \n\nShe's also incredibly bad with money in general. To put it in perspective, while I was in my freshman year I had student loans. College is expensive, I should have went somewhere cheaper, but that's my mistake. However, I was determined to work my hardest to get a head start on it. And, because my freshman year college billed per semester and not per credit, I was determined to take advantage of it. For that entire year I was working 60+ hours a week on top of 20 credits, averaging 4 hours of sleep per night. It was incredibly hard but somehow I even got decent grades. My point is I worked myself to the bone to get a jump on my loans. However, because I was still under 18, those loans were all through my mother, and I had to pay through her as well. Whenever I would get a thousand dollars in my bank account -- about once a month -- I'd ask her to pull it out and pay my loans. I could see she pulled the money out (joint account) the next day and thought nothing of it. Cut to when I turned 18 and took the loan upon myself. I found out I was 6 thousand further in debt than I expected.  I ripped all her bank statements and found out she was sealing money from me and not paying my loans. She did this, I assume, to supplement her lack of income because she hasn't had a steady job for most of her life. She swore innocent but given her past I honestly don't expect to ever be paid back.\n\nSo I and my sister have been doing our hardest to support her but she's too expensive to take care of, and too ungrateful for it. She lies about trying to get a job, stole thousands of dollars from me, and has the \"I don't want to talk about it\" or the \"I'm in a really bad place right now\" mentality whenever we press her on anything financial. My sister has given up on her already because she feels like my mother is taking advantage of her, and I'm hard-pressed not to. But, at the same time, she's my mom. I'm supposed to be looking out for her because she looked out for me when I was young.\n\nPlease, AITA?",

A few of my friends in other business majors struggle with the subject (some more than others), and I always am happy to help them with homeworks and understanding concepts. \n\nHowever, a few nights ago a friend I usually help with more upper-level accounting courses texted me a picture of a homework question asking how to do it. I responded detailed instructions *with the answer* **and** *backed it to the explanation of a general concept of accounting* and that was that. Then he sent me another picture for a second question and I realized the content was too beginner-level for his rank and asked if he was doing one of our mutual friend's homework assignment. He says yes and I know for a fact our mutual friend pays him to help with homework so I said if I do the questions for him and he is getting paid, he should give me half.\n\nNow normally I wouldn't care to help for free, I have done so many many times in the past. But knowing he was getting paid for work that I was solving irritated me, so I said I wasn't going to answer any more unless he gave me half. Then he got mad at me for saying that and cussed me out because \"it's one fucking question and you know how to do it.\" At that point, I stood my ground and he hasn't talked to me since...\n\nAITA for not helping out my friend with basic level stuff I could do in my sleep because he wouldn't give me half his earnings?",

I ask where, he says a mall on the literal other side of town (30mins away). I’m sick and I had no plans of leaving the house at all but I ask what time because I was just going to throw on sweats and not get out the car. He says 3:30pm. Not that’s what time we need to leave, but the movie starts at 3:30pm. Sir we are a full 30 mins from the movie theater and you want to be there at 3:30 and you just now asking? I told him he’d be late. Because he will be. And then boy goes upstairs and turns the shower on... you haven’t showered yet and you’re trying to be somewhere by 3:30? Whatever I’m not worried about your schedule you’ll get there when you get there.\n\nI go upstairs and tell him to ask his friend if he can drop him off because I am frankly not his personal Uber. He says his friends parents are driving him and they live in the opposite direction, I roll my eyes and he says I’ll pay you. This hit me for a second because I remember a conversation we had yesterday where he told me he was broke and couldn’t buy me a Christmas gift. And I said with what money? And he said when he finds his wallet he’ll pay me, I had no intentions of taking his money but then I asked how he was going to the movies without his wallet. His wallet has been lost for at least 2 days. He told me idk and that he fully intended in going to the movies with no wallet and no money. \n\nSo here’s where the asshole part kicks in. I’m not broke and I could have slid him a $20 without crying about it, but I didn’t. Now my reasoning for this was because i didn’t know if his intentions was to bamboozle me into taking him and then we get there and he’d tell me that he had no money with him so I felt obligated to give him money and not leave him there broke? \n\nTo add. I took him, his brother, and his brothers girlfriend to the movies yesterday. So I feel like the asshole for not allowing him to have fun with his friend when his brother got to have fun with his girlfriend. (I paid for everything for him even his dinner yesterday so I was really not trying to buy him another movie ticket which is part of the reason I didn’t offer).\n\nAITA for not taking my brother to the movies with his friend yesterday?",

She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.",

I ain't got much experience right this second but everyone reckons I'm catching on quick enough. \n\nSo anyway I feel like a pig in a prom dress around these guys and they're accents that make mine sound like I've just fallen off the apple pie and freedom cart with my johnson in my hand. Luckily they've been acting real nice to me so far. \n\nI was in a small group looking over this machine with me basically still shadowing this half manager guy when he asks me to \"get John's arse over here\". So I went up to John and said \"Adam wants you to get your *arse* over there\" with me copying the way he said 'arse'. John for sure looked like he wasn't impressed by that for a second. And this kept happening my whole shift.\n\nI really want to immerse my self in their culture and leave my old country behind. Best case scenario for me in a month no one could tell I'm a foreign to this new place. \n\nAfter a few other instances of me adopting their lingo and phrases a couple of these guys were acting real strange to me like they weren't sure what I was doing. \n\nI really like this new country so far and I don't know why they would be pissed about me using everyone elses vocab.

      "title": "AITA For dumbing my bf based on his personal quirks and beliefs?",
      "description": "I had a bf for about a year and things were going pretty well. He was sweet and tried his best to make me happy and I did the same in turn. We got each other little gifts when we saw something the other person would like and frequently went out on dates. Nothing fancy, just a nice walk or playing video games at each other's houses.\n\nThere were a few things I couldn't really stand though. My ex was really passionate about DnD and when we were hanging out or on a date he'd go on for hours about the game. I do enjoy playing the game but he never gave me a chance to speak and would keep going until I eventually got so bored I made an excuse to leave. \n\nHe was also very clingy. I have an aversion to physical contact and have a hard time even hugging family members. He would always try to hug me whenever he saw me or give me a kiss on cheek. Ive told him multiple times I don't really like physical contact but he never stopped. \n\nHe would also get super paranoid when I didn't answer his texts. If he texted me and I didn't respond within an hour he'd text me again and again, getting more frantic with each passing minute. An example was when I was helping my grandmother tend to her garden because she was old and couldn't take proper care of it anymore. After two hours of pulling weeds and placing mulch down I took a break and checked my phone to notice over 20 texts from him asking where I was and what I was doing. This happened constantly. \n\nTRIGGER WARNING FOR THE TOPIC OF ABUSE \nI REPEAT TRIGGER WARNING FOR MENTIONS OF ABUSE\n\nOn my birthday I had my then bf and two mutual friends over so we could hang out and go to a local carnival. We talked and went on rides and stuff. I worked as a camp counselor then and one of my friends worked at a daycare. We shared stories about the kids and the stuff they did that got them in trouble. My bf then said \"If a kid misbehaved I would hit them to teach them a lesson.\" I was shocked and replied, \"You shouldn't hit a kid, it's not good for their development and won't teach them anything.\"\nWe got into an argument over whether or not it was okay to beat a child instead of any other form of punishment. He didn't think that telling them what they did was wrong would good enough and the only way to properly teach them a lesson was to literally beat it into their head. \n\nI broke up with him a week later and he got super depressed, talking about how I was the only girl who ever gave him a chance and how perfect I was. I got a message a few days ago from him saying he still had feelings for me.\n\nSome friends have told me that I'm in the wrong for dumping him because we did get a long great and that one incident shouldn't have made me break up with him. \n\nAm I in the wrong?",

      "description": "Context: So my bf's mom has always been crazy. There have been several events over the year and a half that my bf and I have been together involving his mother. For his 18th birthday back in December of 2017, he wanted me to come over to the apartment that he shared with his mom and his little brother. He asked his mom if I could come over and stay the night. She agreed. I got there and a little later into the night got drunk and called the police. Claiming I had broken into her home and then had them threaten to arrest me and lock me up in jail. I forgave her for this. However, she pulled this same stunt again a few months later in March. In April when my bf and I were going through a rough patch and had a really bad fight, she called me a whore and inmature. This all basically culminated into one event. I ended up staying at their apartment for the few days before my bf, two roommates and I moved into our first apartment. All was well and good until the day we moved out into our apartment. I still had a few things in the apartment like my laptop, PS4 and Xbox 360 and we had left our cat there so he wouldn't run out of the house while we were moving things in (he was a 5 month old kitten at this point and no bigger than a 3 month old kitten). Bf gets a call from his mom and she starts yelling at him and accusing him, me and our friends that helped us move, of stealing a check written out to her and 300 dollars cash. He insisted we didn't have it and asked her to look for it in a place she didn't think it was. We head over there for the rest of our stuff and the cat. My bf grabs the cat while I get my gaming consoles and laptop, all the while his mom is screaming about us stealing her money. It escalates when she starts punching me and tries to grab my stuff from me. Screaming in face \"You won't get this til I get my fucking money!\" and \"You're a whore! You're gonna fuck everyone who gives you a second look!\" and a bunch of different insults. She tackles me onto the couch while my bf is on the phone with the police. When his mom realized that he was on the phone, she started punching him and grabbed his phone from him, grabbing a guitar stand to smash it with and then tries to hit me with the stand when I grab the phone away from her. She does eventually stop and go into her room but comes back out again about two minutes later, trying to grab our stuff and bring it into her apartment again. I grabbed it back and she began punching and clawing at me, I pushed her back in self-defense and she started screaming that I hit her. I had several bruises after the incident and my arms were bleeding where she had scratched me. The police arrived, but we decided to not press charges. We went back later that night to collect the rest of our things and she tried to apologize to us. She had found the money less than a half and hour later after this incident. Well, I ended up eventually forgiving her but she was still not allowed into our apartment, which was my bf's choice and not mine. Fast forward a little and she throws my bf out of her house because he didn't bring her weed when he went to visit her. On my bf's 19th birthday, she invited me over and when I went outside to get something from the car, she started urging my bf to dump me. About 2 weeks ago, she posted an insulting facebook post towards me, calling me an unforgiving whore who is selfish. I commented back on her post and basically called her out on all of this publicly, ruining some job offers and career opportunities. My bf's family now insists that I apologize to her and forgive her because I ruined a good job for her because of what I said publicly about her on Facebook, but I feel that I shouldn't have to since I have tried several times to and she always does something again? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Bf's mom assaults me and my bf and then insults me on Facebook, I ruin a job offer by calling her out on assaulting me and her son.",

      "description": "So I come home one day to find my SO at the end of folding our clothes. Tbh, compared to how I was taught to fold clothes, I feel they're not well folded. But that's not where the problem really was. I only use one small dresser drawer for my shirts, so instead of the basic way of folding shirts, I fold them into tight rolls so I can fit them all into the drawer; that allows me to see all the shirt colors, patterns, etc I have available as well as letting me get them out without having to lift a pile of shirts to get to them. (My pants are the same way too.) So I told them thank you for folding my stuff, I appreciate it, but I need to fold them for what I need. So I do just that. They then say that I was very rude for doing that, and that folded clothes are still folded, it doesn't matter how they're done. \"There's more than one way to skin a cat\" was something they said which I fought back against because the point of my fold was specific to how I stored them. \n\nBut anyway. It turned into a big fight somehow. I just want to know if I'm an asshole for this, because I do unfortunately have a history of being a little insensitive. I just want to see if this is me being a dick or if I was okay.",

I see the piece of mail, grab it, and get it to my title clerk to process paperwork.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I'm finishing speaking to my coworker my boss asks me if I had grabbed that piece of mail off of his desk, to which I reply yes. He then goes off on me, saying how inappropriate it was that I went into his office and that he has to check all the mail in. Recently someone had stolen something from his office and it really, really pissed him off that I grabbed this piece of mail.  \n\n\nNot 5 minutes later I'm walking back to my desk and a co-worker asks for help with a task. As I am about to start helping my boss comes over, tells me to stop what I'm doing, and go back to my desk because \"he just can't look at me right now\". He also informed me that he contacted my direct supervisor (he's gone for a few days) about the incident and how much he just can't believe that I went into his office.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole for helping my customer?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My moms house flooded and as a result she had to relocate her 2 dogs to my home. She is staying at a hotel while her home is being remediated  and renovated. It has been about two months and realistically it will be another month or two before the dogs can move back in. She has been staying at a hotel for the most part.\n\n\nI have a large dog of my own, and am home now on maternity leave with my 9 month old baby. The problem is her dogs are not trained, and go to the bathroom in the house constantly. I put a diaper on the small one so that fixed that, but the large breed cant wear a diaper. I noticed today since the snow has melted, the large breed female is killing our grass with her urine. There are yellow spots all over our lawn now. Taking care of three dogs and a baby is a lot of work and I am reaching my breaking point. The dogs are constantly barking and waking up the baby, chewing the babys toys, soiling the babys play area, and tracking mud all over the house. They both bark at night if they dont sleep in my room but keep me up all night walking around my room. I am already sleep deprived with the baby, they are killing whatever chance I have to sleep.\n\n\nNow I know my mom has it a lot worse, and she feels bad she has to leave the dogs with me. The insurance pay out is barely enough to cover the repair and her accommodation, she would be out of pocket thousands if she were to board them. I am her only option as far as I can tell. Over the past couple months she has stayed overnight twice to babysit and allow my husband and I to get away for the night. One of the nights she paid for our hotel as well. She also gifted us something we needed for our home which was worth a few hundred dollars. We have a very small home, her staying with us is not an option. I KNOW she has no choice, she always helps us and she is my mom and I love her but I feel like the remainder of my maternity leave is being ruined by these dogs. Its been a very rough patch with the baby and I have no patience left for these dogs !!    AITA for considering giving up and telling her to find another solution?   SORRY SO LONG",

      "description": "BF's son got a cub scout hat somewhere. At first he was just wearing it at home for dress up. Lately he's wanted to wear it everywhere. My issue is that he's not, nor has he ever been, in any scouting organization. \n\nHis son has a bit of a habit of lying and making things up anyway. He probably doesn't know that he's casually pretending to belong to an organization or that people will assume that he does. However, he should be taught that letting people think you belong to something when you don't is a type of lying. \n\nAlso, scouts really care about their organization in my experience. They commit time and energy into being scouts, it's not just a costume to them. It is associated with values and standards that they volunteer to uphold, bf son has not made these efforts or comments. I think if he wants to wear the hat he should join the scouts. He'd probably love it.\n\nI don't want to talk to the kid but I wonder if it's worth even being up to his dad. It probably seems petty but it bothers me. I at least don't want him to do it when he goes out with me.",

      "description": "TW: mention of sexual assault/rape\n\nIt's been a hectic couple of days\n\nBasically, I had to sit down and come to terms with the fact that my home situation is exasperating my depression and anxiety. Long story short, my dad is a narcissist and my mom is heavily depressed but has accepted her situation and tries to minimize things; even though both of them say they want the best for me and care about me, I feel stifled in a lot of ways- I have a strict curfew, friends are vetted, I have to deal with my dad's temper and be careful to not do anything to upset him. \n\nLast year he threatened to kill me and honestly, I haven't felt safe around him since even though he joked that \"it's just how he is\". (I didn't call the cops because I have a younger sister and didn't want to deal with CPS again. When I was a sophomore he also made a \"joke\" about not needing a gun to kill my mom, sister, and I and told my therapist, who was a mandated reporter. My mom and sister were mad at me for telling my therapist that and it was just a stressful time) \n\n I think that getting some distance (just not living under the same roof) with my parents would help our relationship in the long run and let me just recover from stuff that's happened. I am 18 and will be turning 19 soon- I have job experience, and a fair amount of money saved up as well as a network of people I can stay with. I made the decision to leave relatively quickly, as in it was in the span of a couple of days. It might seem a little silly, but the main catalyst was that I wanted to go to have a sleepover at my friends house, and my dad immediately went on a tirade on how \"we don't know these people\", that I was going to be raped in my sleep by my friend's father, that I was being spoiled, etc. My mom wanted me to try to have a conversation with him, but I think those familiar with /raisedbynarcissists knows how difficult it is.\n\nThen my mom said that being 18 doesn't mean that you're an adult. She felt bad, because she said that she'll talk to my dad and tell him if I answer her texts and can drop by something to check out the house then I'll be safe. The sleepover was okay, but I just ended up stressing over about my mom stopping by and being taken home that I ended up feeling shitty. \n\nAnother thing that pushed me was that my mom said my dad supposedly got a tip that I was seen with a guy, or hanging out with a guy, and she was questioning me over a couple of days. I honestly think maybe she saw something, and is just trying to get me to tell her what's going on (I've always been kinda shy telling her about my friends). \n\nI packed a bag, was dropped off somewhere, and after a couple of hours called my mom to tell her that lately things at home have been stressing me out, and I need a couple of days to clear my head, and that I'll contact her soon.\n\nLet me put what happened in bullet points to be concise\n\n* said that I can go spend the night at my grandma's house, that my mom can book me a hotel, or that we can go apartment hunting together as long as she knows where I am at all times (not necessarily a bad idea, but I still wanted some time to myself, and was extremely skeptical because I don't think dad would've been on board- for a decision like that, he'd give a lot of pushback. If it's okay for me to be a little mean, she hasn't shown that she's strong enough to set boundaries with him)\n* started yelling at me \n* said that she was going to find the address of my boyfriend and show up to his house by using Facebook\n* texted me about our \"home situation\" and that we have to maintain it (like isn't that a euphemism for abuse??) \n* went to the bookstore I used to work at and told my friend and I was missing \n* went to the friend's house I spent the night in and got her mom to come to my friend's job and said that she was going to call the police to find me (I called them ahead of time and told them I'm not a missing person, and explained my family situation a bit)\n\nI've been trying to lay low, but I've been feeling a lot of guilt from my family and from myself. From all of the calls and texts I've gotten, they're not mad but are just really worried. My uncle actually reached out and said I can stay with him and he doesn't have to tell my parents, that he's worried I'll be taken advantage of. My grandma has been crying because she's convinced something terrible happened to me, and my family isn't telling her\n\nI have a boyfriend, and since **they have access to my call history and my text logs** they probably know about him. So that's extremely embarrassing :( I love him and he's been really strong and supportive through all of this, and even though I should not worry about this right now, they probably think he manipulated me into leaving if they went through that deep. \n\nRight now, my plan is to just stay hidden, call my grandma to tell her I'm still alive and love her, and just do damage control while moving into my new place soon. \n\nAnyway, I tried to do my best to explain what the last three days of my life have been. Am I an asshole for leaving?? Could I have handled things better? I honestly did not expect **this.** I never said I was running away or never wanted to see them, but I stated plainly that I'm not happy with the way things are at home and needed my own privacy for a couple of days.\n\ntldr; family is Pakistani Muslims who had a collective meltdown to me leaving home and going low contact for a couple of days. didn't want to sit down and tell them because I knew they would shut me down immediately from personal experience. am I an asshole for stressing everyone out?",

      "description": "First off, we’re both seniors in a Nashville high school. Me (M17) and her (F17) have known each other since fifth grade, and had been great friends throughout school. We were in the same friend groups. Then, we decided to get together. We shared all of our firsts, and everything was going absolutely perfectly.\n\nShe has a disorder that doesn’t allow her to drive, so I would be her mode of transport. I was perfectly fine with it, and it was fun, although the rides were needed to a point where my family was mad at me for taking her so often.\n\nFor a weekend in November, we went on an extracurricular trip to this hotel where you were paired into groups and debated and other little fun things. During these two days, a boy, who was also 17 and from Memphis, gave her his snapchat. She took it, and kept snapping him back and forth, and kept insisting that he was just a friend and I had nothing to worry about. \n\nWell even after the debate thing was over, she kept snapping him. I asked her if she could stop cause it seemed as if he kept her attention more than I had. She promised she did. She “deleted snapchat”, and said bye to him.\n\nThen, the next few days, on our days out we were just as happy as we had been, and I was driving her to friends houses and work. Everything seemed great, but I noticed that she was still snapping him, and I asked her about it and she denied, and then I just told her I knew she that she still was.\n\nShe broke down in tears and begged me not to leave her in my confrontation. I felt broken, and I still loved her for sure, and I thought her begging showed that she did too.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t the same after that. She and I still went on car rides, but I didn’t feel the same. I just felt sluggish for some reason. She was peppy and energetic, and was really let down by all this. I started spiraling into a sadness that just seemed to never end, but honestly she would cheer me up so much, just because I felt her love.\n\nOne day, she really wanted to go to her friends Christmas party, but I had a lab after school that day, and I really didn’t want to drive to the party. Looking back, I regret this so much, it really would have made her so happy, and I can’t help kicking myself over it.\n\nThen, a few days afterward, she and I were sitting in my car five minutes before class, and she told me that we needed to take a break in our relationship. I broke down in tears so hard, I still can’t believe how emotional I was. It was bad. She told me that she wanted to become more independent and non-reliant on me, which honestly, looking back I respect a lot.\n\nShe still wanted to be friends, and it was hard for me to do. I still wanted to be with her.\n\nA day later, she texted me and told me that she loved me, not as a friend, but as we were. I didn’t know what to say, so I met her, and hugged her, and she talked about how much she missed everything. I felt amazing. However, at the end of the day when I met up with her, she coldly told me to go away and that she just needed space. God was I confused. I literally don’t understand how that shift could have happened in less than three hours.\n\nI messaged some of her friends who were also my friends about her, and just what was going on. I went WAAAAYYY too emotional and kept saying stuff like “but I want her to know I’m still in love” and stuff, and they told me they weren’t sure what was happening either. She caught wind of this, and was blasting me through texts, and was furious that I wasn’t leaving her space, which in the present, I understand.\n\nI gave her some space, and I started acting as her friend again. Sending her memes and stuff and just having fun with texting. She then called me and was crying and telling me that her parents found out she was buying weed off someone because all of her incoming texts were sent to her parent’s phone as well. And then she mentioned that the guy who she was snapping was bringing her a fake ID, and they knew about that too. Then she casually mentioned that they were going on a date.\n\nI was so disappointed. I don’t know why. I guess I was still into her, but it was only a week since she took a break. I felt like she backed against her word of being independent. I felt betrayed. I didn’t have any motivation to help myself anymore, and I was back on the rollercoaster of emotion I was during the week. \n\nThe next day was the last day of school until our break, and I wanted to talk to her face to face about this. I told her that he destroyed our relationship, and I asked her how she thought that was okay to do to me, as she said I was her best friend. The last thing I said was “you can choose either me as your best friend or him as your boyfriend, you can’t have both”. She stormed out and told me not to talk to her. \n\nShe was throwing nasty texts at me after that, and things just turned toxic. She said that I should feel happy for her, and that this week has been the worst in her life, because her parents acting crazy.\n\nI felt like she totally didn’t care about my emotions at all. She didn’t realize how bad she was confusing me and hurting me I guess. I don’t know. She’d been talking bad about me the whole week apparently, saying that I was “never going to move on”, telling that to so many people.\n\nWas making her choose an asshole move?\n\nEverything is so toxic with her now, and I think our relationship is totally ruined. I can’t stop thinking about it over and over, and I just want some closure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So a bit of background, I met this guy, let's call him Ryan, on tinder around 4 years ago. We got on well when messaging but never actually met in person due to distance. I stopped contact with Ryan when I met my current boyfriend of 3.5 years.\n\nI met Ryan on tinder in the winter of 2014, a little over 4 years ago. We spoke almost everyday for a couple months and got on really well. Due to distance and other circumstances we never met up in person though. In the April of 2015 I met my current boyfriend. We hit it off almost immediately and when things got more serious with him I deleted my tinder and told Ryan that I now had a boyfriend and was no longer interested in pursuing anything with him. I did ask if he wanted to remain friends because we got on but he said he didn't want that. \n\nSkip to a few days ago, I got a message from Ryan on Instagram. It seemed innocent enough so I chatted to him for a bit. We were talking about how we've been getting on and what we've been up to, normal conversational things.\n\nAfter about an hour he asked if I was still seeing my boyfriend, to which I said yes. (Were relatively private on social media and we don't tend to post much about our relationship) Ryan clearly though this meant we weren't in love anymore or that we wasn't happy. I assured him that wasn't the case.\n\nAnyways, he started saying how he was still in love with me and hasn't been able move on because of how he feels. Baring in mind we've never met and hadn't spoken for almost 4 years. I found this hard to believe, I've had guys used the 'L' word to try and get in my pants before o assumed it was the case again. He was adamant it was true and starting listing off the exact dates we started taking, the exact date I told him I met someone, etc. At this point I was getting a little creeped out. \n\nI tend to try and use humour to make situations less awkward, so when he said 'you're the most beautiful and kind girl I've ever met, I'm so deeply in love with you' I said 'you don't know me, I could be a man in real life for all you know haha' I was trying to get this thought out of his mind and say that I've changed a lot since we spoke last. This is when it got weird. He started INSISTING that he knew what I was like in person he that I was just as perfect as he would imagine. He was telling me things about my personal appearance and it was just very strange so I asked him to stop because I was feeling  uncomfortable with the topic of conversation. I outright asked if he'd ever seen me with out my knowledge. He went crazy on me. Sent around 50 messages about how I'm evil for implying that and how I've ruined his life and broken his heart etc.\n\nI've since blocked him but it's been playing on my mind. Did I go about this the wrong way? ",

When I get home from work I ask him \"how was your day\" and he says \"I've recovered\" and I ask \"oh were you feeling sick? \" and he says \"no from my roommate ignoring me on the bus\".

But whenever he gets a new game for the next couple of weeks I am at his beck and call. I don't know why this upsets me it's literally only 5 minutes usually but today I just told him no and to work through it. I didnt get in trouble but I felt really shitty about it. But when I was a kid I didnt get any help, I worked though it with trial and error. I just feel like the biggest asshole leaving him helpless and I need to know if I am being the asshole, thanks!\n\n\nP.S: the game is sleeping dogs on ps4 and he really only needs help with the combat so I'm not knocking his gaming skills, but hes played and beat (with my help) three games with essentially the same combat.

      "description": "First, ever post so excuse my shit grammar, \n\nTo start for contexts, when I was a kid I went through some really bad trauma because of my mom (she was very abusive) to the point that as a survival move my brain turned off my emotions and complete empathy, for comparison like a sociopath but not to that extreme. Over the years as a kid, I had to develop how to communicate with other people and how to read what is happening, like I didn't understand what it is to be happy or the need to cry. I learned everything to appear normal and developed my own personality to connect with people, I think of a response that the personality that I made would have to every possible thing I have to react and act too. It does take a toll on my mental strength to have to think of what someone would have to react to, with that I take brakes from people at times and I have done it to my ex about halfway into our relationship (for about a month).\n\nNow back to the story, our relationship wasn't perfect like most we did fight about a bunch of things but we always did realize what we did and makeup after like a day if that. I found out some things about her past that made me change how I viewed her, she cheated on her ex who I was friends with and she had a not so safe tumbler page which at the time was filled with her own cp ( 15 to about 19 ) which was also the reason one of her exes broke up with her. After finding all that out we did talk about it and she did delete that page but after that I found out that she was still talking to people that she meet from that page and before we started dating she was talking to a guy that was in the area of the college she was planning to go to, it was hard for me to trust her but I did forgive her for not telling those things because we always talked about how cheating is the worst thing you could do to a person, but in the end I kinda ( this will sound confusing to what I said above but this is what I mean when I act with my personality) felt bad for her and if that part didn't happen we would have been a good match , we were really close she told me almost everything that happened to her and her deepest secrets we where really good friends. fast forward some time and we were doing long distance ( i know, not great ), I was taking some really intense insomnia medicine which had the side effect that made me have really bad anxiety and I was in a really rough spot in my life. During that time she basically gave me the cold shoulder and wasn't there for me when I was always there for her. after some time, my dumbass decided to tell her my deepest secret    \n( she already knew some of it but not the full extent of how bad it is) I told her on the phone \n\nme: I don't know the feeling of love\n\nShe: does that mean that all we did was fake\n\nme: no I just can't feel it that doesn't me that what we did was a lie  \n\nshe: did you ever love me? \n\nme: once again I can't feel it so no, I'm trying not to lie to you anymore\n\nshe: you don't love me?\n\nme:  I act in a way where if I was normal, that person would be in love with you, I just can't feel anything. If you still want to date I would like that but if you dont I would understand.\n\nwe broke up after that, and I understand why but I thought with all the things I was there for her that for the one time I needed help she would be there for me. I do go to therapy for the lack of emotions and empathy. \n\nTL DR, I cant feel anything and had to \"lie\" in order to appear normal to people and told my now ex that I didn't love her when I'm not capable to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Poorly written TL;DR version starting in the fifth last poor man's version of a paragraph.\n\nI'm a 17 year old girl currently in my final year of high school. I'm doing okay in terms of grades, and I'm hoping to go to University and then Law School.\n\nMy family has always been very stressful to live with, and I think possibly abusive. My parents are always fighting, for about anything you can imagine. They don't really try to hide it either, and while it's mostly verbal assault, my Dad will sometimes break things, and push me around forcefully.\n\nEver since I was little around maybe 8 or 10 my Mom would cry over the fights. I would try to comfort her, and she would tell me how she wanted to divorce my dad, but wouldn't, for what I assume is financial reasons, although she claims it's for my brother and I.\n\nWith that being sad, my Dad never notices when he's in the wrong, I don't remember him ever saying sorry once. So when these fights break out, he'll sometimes tell me that It's my fault that my family is fighting. I think this is because of my mental health issues.\n\n I have anxiety (which follows with physical pains like chest pains) and OCD; possibly Psychosis too, but that's from my own research.\n\n Sometimes I try to ignore these compulsions and fears but I'll end up crying and screaming in the middle of the night, which I know isn't helpful for anyone, and I feel really bad about it. My dad will come yelling about how much of a terrible person I am, which only makes me want to cry more. My Mom will try to stand up for me, but then my Dad will yell at her for being against him rather than with him.\n\nNothing I do seems to make them happy. Whether I follow my compulsions and fear or not, my family will be mad.\n\nMy Dad often claims I'm just making up excuses to avoid things I don't want to do, like going to the beach because I'm scared of having a heart attack during the drive and no one can help me, or eating at restaurants because I might get an allergic reaction. I don't think he understands my fears, which is fine, but I hate the fact that he acts like he knows everything.\n\nHe never recognizes when I break through my shell. He only comments when I do something bad like following a compulsion. I can't expect him to cheer me on for going to beach like I'm a baby, I just want him to notice that I'm trying.\n\nEven when I say this all, I don't hate my dad; I do love him. He tries to help me, but he's not a very... emotionally intelligent person, even for good things. I recieved a 98% in my English class this fall (hopefully it stays up there) and even then my Dad didn't seem a single bit happy; just cracking a joke that it's not a 100%.\n\nTL;DR Off the long context tangent, and back on track, ever since I went to daycare, my parents would threaten to take me to a mental health hospital, or whatever. Of course, when I was young, being away from my mother scared the crap out of me, but now that I'm 17, 18 in exactly two months from now, I am honestly debating the idea of going. \n\nAt this rate I'm just getting worse, now with the fear that my Dad is going to kill me, or something is going to possess him to do it because I'm ungrateful. In terms of my anxiety, it has gotten worst, once being a \"social\", happy kid, to a high schooler's definition of a \"loser\".\n\nI feel like an asshole for thinking my family is not helping me, especially when I know they're trying. I recognize their hard work as immigrants, and I appreciate it with all my heart. They just make everything so much worse. I feel bad enough about my stupid problems, and they only make me feel worse.\n\nAm I a bad person for feeling like this?\n\nSorry in advance for any mistakes and poorly explained thoughts, and thank you in advance for your opinion on this trivial thought I have. And if you can't tell, I'm a terribly sensitive person, so please... just... don't be too harsh UwU or do. Whatever you please! Thank you!",

      "description": "Like sometimes I feel bad for homeless people and want to help but I’m in no better position myself. I literally live of the clothes I make and sleep in my car. My mom moved to America wen I was 9 and I later joined her when I was 15 and because of certain “immigration” laws I couldn’t even hold a minimum wage job. I had to find a way and even to this day I have to find a way. Most homeless people are born i here in America and could easily clean themselves up and try and sort themselves out. I just feel like if I can do it so can they. This year I don’t plan on being “homeless” and I think I might make a lil booklet and hand it out to other people who want the help or at least guidance ",

      "description": "This may be long, sorry. \nBasically, 7 years ago my family got a cat and it was dubbed as mine. I love this cat a lot and it has helped me with some really dark times. I was 15 when we got this cat so naturally I have moved a few times away from my family.\n\nI live in a country where renting is HARD and even harder with animals. When I've gone flatting I havent been able to take him. \n\nThe last house i personally rented last year, i was able to get a dog which i was over the moon about. Since then I've moved back into my family home due to finances. Now my husband and I are back on track with money, we want to move out. We may get lucky finding a rental that allows a single small dog, but it will be hard to find one with a cat and a dog.\n\nMy sister moved into my mums house, too, with 2 of her own cats. Before this, my cat was fine, but now my sisters cats try to antagonize him as well as attack him. Hes only had a few scratches but the other cats have been a bit more significantly injured. (Just bigger scratches, nothing life threatening)\n\nMy family want me to either give my cat away or take him with me, which I've explained I cant. My dog isnt very good with cats (which isnt a problem at my mums because we have our own seperate area where they dont cross paths) and she chases him which obviously my cat does not like. My cat is also not very good at changing houses and plays up for a while, which is too risky for a rental where we have to be intense about not damaging it at all. Also, I've noticed a lot of people have outdoor cats so I worry that moving my cat would just cause problems with other peoples cats in a new area.\n\nMy cat has lived with these same people for his whole life and has only had issues since these other animals were introduced (1 year ago), yet they want to get rid of him. I dont want any animals to be given away, but theyve been making me feel incredibly guilty about all of this. My cat seems to mind his own business and just retaliates when hes approached.\n\nSo, AITA for not taking my cat with me or wanting to give him up?",

I am fat, but not *super* fat.\n\nAnyway onto the story. I have a big group of friends, we all sot together at lunch and some are better friends than others. For the last few months a \"friend\" we will name J had been making endless fat jokes. Its most of his greetings and it does get to me. Ill walk in school and he will go \"Hey it's big boy [my name]\" even more sometimes but I won't go I to detail, he is short amd skinny by the way but I digress. Recently I've been talking to my friends about my birthday party, who I'm inviting, my plans, ECT. I openly talk at lunch about this and I'm not inviting J. He's asked me and bribed me but I'm stern on not inviting him. Last party I went to he was relentless. No. Matter. What. Everything was a fat joke or just some bullying torward me.\n\nHe has stopped me from going to things I really want to go to because I know ill just feel bad about myself in the end. He has said he'll give me money and big gifts and says he'll stop. When I still said no he barraded me with fat jokes. Some of my friends think I'm an Asshole. I don't.

I moved here to China a just two months before and wanted to travel, but my girlfriend was always busy with school and applying to universities. I always wanted to see memorials in Nanjing which is an hour away, talking to my coworkers about it and one says we should do it on our day off. I dont see why not, I got nothing else to do and we book the day trip together.  \n\nThe day comes and I get a message from my girlfriend saying the day is now free and is on her way to the train station to come to my city. I say that I'm going to Nanjing with my cowoker but you're more than welcome to join us. Then a massive argument ensued saying I made her look like a slut for having a man run off with other girls, I explain I have no friends here as I just arrived and I only wanted to see the museum (I even said this since coming to china I want to see the museums, I love history). She then decided to come to nanjing, so we wait for hours for her to come, as she didn't book it in advanced and got a later train. It was an awful experience, with an obvious atmosphere and my girlfriend making jabs and me, dumping me (she didn't mean it) and  making comments about my coworker being a lesser person, because her job isn't so great salary wise. I explained it was just Nanjing with my cowoker, a friend and that I wouldn't' gone with her or anyone else but it was the same day off and why not.   \n\nAm I the asshole for going on a day trip with my coworker, a female?",

I have never liked my grandfather because he is one sick man, he's the kind of person who sits and wishes death upon anyone who talks against him. So far he has prayed so that my dad would have died, and when my mother's sister's husband had a stroke he seemed like the most happiest man. Yet my mother is a very emotional person and always keeps asking him to move in with us because he is so poor, he doesn't want to because he is aware that none of use like him.  \nIn a few months he is likely to be homeless, and I don't really care for such a person. He never took care of all his children, yet here at this moment he is depending on my parents for [food.](https://food.My) Both my parents feel a lot of empathy and give him money every month. I have nothing against this.  \nBut a few months ago he showed up to our house for a few days and I didn't talk to him. He immediately started talking shit about me not succeeding in life and pretty much ending up like him. He said he'd pray for that to happen to my mom and I overheard everything.  \n\n\nHe left the every next day and has practically disappeared. My mom keeps trying to reach him and has been crying occasionally. She puts the blame on me for not talking to him. I do feel guilt that he's an old man and is about to be homeless, but from his character and the fact that he started talking shit when he came to our house I believe I did the right thing. If he stayed with us I think there would be more and more problems. My mom thinks that won't happen because he is depending on us at this moment. Am I the asshole like my mom says I am?  \n\n\n  \n",

My partner and I have been wanting a simple wedding for a long time, just a ceremony and a dinner. We had a guest list of 30 people, immediate family, well, mother in law wants to invite so and so, wants to decorate like this and like that. Our little plans turned into a bigger budget and a guest list of over 50 which stresses me out. We wanted a stress free wedding. Yesterday we went into the courthouse and got married today at 1pm. We told her last minute last night to be polite, I told my mom after the fact. I told my siblings 1 hour prior, and his siblings found out after as well. Now everyone is “mad” because they weren’t told or invited, and while I feel slightly guilty I’m also trying to shake off the feeling. My marriage was exactly what i wanted, just me and  y partner, just the two of us! We’re still thinking of doing a post party later in the summer. Was I wrong? I feel that being my wedding I can do what I want. AITA? ",

I have a good relationship with my father, a rocky relationship with my mother, and a terrible relationship with my sister, to the point where I no longer want her to be apart of my life. Today, we finally had that conversation about the elephant in the room about why we've had minimal communication unless necessary for the past 5-6 years.\n\nFrom my point of view, I have a rocky relationship with my mother because she's not ok with me being gay, and she doesn't like I have a bad relationship with my sister. My reason for hating my sister is that nearly every single interaction I have with her is negative. No matter what our interaction is about, I'm wrong, I did something wrong, or I'm somehow being unreasonable, and of course, she is right. When I was trying to explain why I felt the way I did towards her, she would cut me off saying I wasn't being honest, and that it must have something to do with me being gay and hating women in general, or about how I can't get over something that happened long ago. Every chance I got to explain, she would cut me off, and tell me how she thought I really felt, even though I was being completely honest in my explanation.\n\nI don't know if she refuses to accept it or why she wouldn't let me explain completely, but over the years, it's gotten to the point where I am no longer interested in trying to fix the relationship. I've experienced more pain, discomfort, and worry about how interactions will turn out, than good times I've had with her. I don't want to go through more worry to try and fix this relationship which I don't think can be fixed. I'd honestly rather avoid her as much as possible until I can properly cut contact by moving out.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to remove my sister from my life?",

      "description": "Some background info first - Sorry for format first Reddit post and on mobile\nA year ago I started dating this girl and we hit it off really well and I've been on cloud 9 for a long time but recently we've been having problems in our relationship\n\nWe would have been together for a year on the fourth of next month recently I moved away to get my degree and the distance has been stressing us out a lot and I visit her every month for a few days (usually four or five) and dedicated all my time home to her and taking her out on dates to make the most of our time\n\nNeither of us are perfect and we have our issues that we fight over but we always ended up kissing and make up but recently she wanted to have a break this isn't the first time she's suggested it but we've always decided on not going for it instead looking for other ways to figure out problems out \n\nLong story short while I'm away she wants to be able to have sex with other people since I'm not readily available to be with her when I deny her when she asks if she can sleep with so and so she threatens me with other men and she wants to have an open relationship and add people to our dynamic she yells at me me for going to get my degree and rarely supports me in my choice when we were together if she had a bad day she would take her anger out on me and I can't help but feel terrible about myself as a person and I always apologise\n\nSex and physical intimacy is extremely important to me emotionally it's not for the sake of feeling good physically but knowing that someone accepts me for who I am and the feeling of love and being wanted by someone means a lot to me I couldn't function in a relationship with more than two people I'm not afraid that I get jealous sometimes either\n\nSo I caved and we took our break starting a few days ago it was supposed to run until the 6th of next month (the day I'd be on break for college) so we can get back together on our anniversary and try and start over\n\nShe said she was sorry for how she acted and that she wanted to be the best version of herself for me that although she (in her words) \"I feel like you trapped me into this bullshit relationship with you being so far away I feel like I'm single but I'm not allowed to fucking act like it\" that ultimately I'm the best thing for her in the long run and I accepted the break thinking maybe she needs time to cool off and that I would just be giving her some space... And then she started texting me about her dates...\n\nWe had discussed already that I was NOT comfortable with either of us talking to anyone else on our break that I wanted to stay exclusive with her through this \n\nMy older brother found her on tinder an hour after we started our break and 4 hours after that she texted me how she has a date already\n\nTonight she went on a date with someone and sent me a text saying how she wants to fuck and dropped acid with him\n\nFor those who don't know Acid is an EXTREMELY INTIMATE drug it makes people vulnerable and brings them closer we took it together a little while back and while we were on it I have never had a more profound feeling of love and affection in my life \n\nThat was it for me she had broken my heart so many times and this was the last straw if she wanted to get back together with me so bad like she said she does and of she really missed me like she claims why would she do this to me? I was never perfect and I won't pretend to be but I don't think I deserved this \n\nI'm going to copy and paste my last text to her below if it helps sorry for the long read \n\n\"I can't take anymore heart ache I don't want to get back together with you I don't think you love me I doubt you loved me the way I love you I feel you're irresponsible with drugs and you've hurt me so bad the last week was pretty much just pain for me while you go on without me and keep me in your pocket as a backup you never wanted to get older with me or marry me there's no way you could have you're taking an extremely intimate drug with someone else and tell me about it while we're supposedly on a short break I have a way  home for the 7th but now idk if I'll take it I was so happy to see you and try and restart things I'm not perfect I never was and never will be but you killed us you finally got the relationship you want hope you enjoy the college life doing whatever you want and here I thought you were my rock goodbye ***** don't text me maybe I'll text you in a few days I can't take anymore heart ache that's all you give me\"",

      "description": "I've lived in my townhouse for a couple years now, and the nice old guy in the adjacent unit moved out and was just replaced with neighbors I haven't met yet. Tonight, I was sitting in my living room and started smelling weed. Curious, I opened my back door a crack to investigate and got hit in the face with a strong smell of weed coming from the neighboring unit. I don't smoke. I've never smoked. I have no interest in smoking. And I don't want to smell smoke in my house.  \n\n\nMarijuana is not legal where I am, but I don't want to narc on my neighbors. I would just prefer that if they're going to smoke they do it somewhere that I can't smell it. Functionally, this would mean they'd have to do it inside their house or garage, or somewhere else away from home, since I'll smell it if they're on their deck or in the driveway.  \n\n\nI don't want to get into an altercation, so I'd probably just leave a note at the community mailbox. The next point of escalation (which I'd rather not do) would be involving the HOA.  \n\n\nSo WIBTA for telling my neighbors not to smoke on their property so I can continue enjoying mine?",

      "description": "I currently live at home with my parents and we have three dogs between us; my dog (age 12) my dad's dog (age 2) and my mother's dog (age 6 months). My brother and his wife live in the downstairs/basement half of the same home. My brother is not interested in owning another dog after his dog passed away this past fall and has said as much. However, SiL has never owned a dog, and is desperate to have a dog of her own but refuses to interact with the dogs we currently have because she doesn't want a \"used dog\" and she's holding out for a puppy that can be \"just hers\".\n\nLast night I mentioned to my mother that I have been looking into estate planning/advanced directives/final will and testament as I am hoping to move out once I finish my master's degree later this year and if I do, I will be taking my dog with me. I want to make sure that my dog will be cared for in the event that I suddenly die or become incapacitated and I told my mother that I planned to name her designated caretaker for my dog should something happen to me. She agreed to the idea and eventually the conversation turned to who would be caretaker for my parents' dogs.\n\nMy mother told me that she and my father were planning to designate my brother and SiL as caretakers in the event of their deaths, because SiL really wants a dog and they're already living in the same house. I reminded my mother that my brother doesn't want to own another dog and that SiL goes out of her way to avoid our dogs because she doesn't/can't have one of her own right now. I also pointed out that I also live in the same house as they do (currently), and I help care for all three dogs. Given that I already have a relationship with with them, so it would be more logical for me to be the caretaker. My mother then accused me of being selfish and wanting to deny my SiL the joys of owning a dog. We ended up arguing about it.\n\nSince I am currently the secondary caretaker for my parents’ dogs (which includes helping to pay for food/vet bills/toys/training/etc. and daily interaction), I kind of expected them to designate me as caretaker. My SiL has had zero interaction with my mother's dog and very minimal interaction with my dad's dog. My brother will occasionally come upstairs to play with the dogs for an hour, but not very often (maybe once or twice a month). Neither of them contribute financially towards food/vet bills/training.\n\nAfter we argued about who is getting my parent's dogs should my parents die, my mother stopped speaking to me for the rest of the night. She's still mad at me this morning about it.\n\nSo, AITA for thinking I should get the dogs if my parents die?",

      "description": "I'm on mobile and riding shotgun traveling. Sorry for any misspelling and grammar.\n\nI have to give some back story. My original best man passed away this last summer from an overdose. He was pretty much my brother. We traveled to go to Narcotics Anonymous conventions together. Gamed together every night. Lived together for a bit. He was solid and always had my back and I miss him every damn day. I was getting sized up for a suit to be in his wedding the weekend he passed. He had his demons as well do I and many other people.\n\nI had put thought into who would be my best man in his place and I came to the conclusion that my sponsor would be. It feels odd ranking friends like that. But my sponsor has always been there for me as well. He reached out to me in the most terrible moments of my life. He motivates me. Pushes me. I can trust him with vulnerabilities... He is the best man in my life.\n\nMy friend I asked to be my best man in place of my friend who passed has also been a very good friend. When I asked him to be my best man it was at a time after the death of our friend and I had given up 5 years of recovery. I was at a weak point and didn't apply stepwork to my life in a time of tragedy. (I currently have 5 months again). I was high when I asked him...  He is a good guy but we don't talk or hangout as much as we used to. There are some things from the past I can't get over that are making me rethink my decision. There was a girl I was dating a few years back and she was fucking my best friend at the time (not any friend mentioned thus far. We don't talk anymore.) And my friend I asked to be my best man was roommates with him. And knew for months and never said anything to me...  \n\nI wish I didn't ask him to be my best man, not only for the reason that he didn't tell me what was going on, but also the fact that we aren't super close anymore.\n\nWIBTA to ask him to be a groomsman instead and tell him it was a mistake and that I was in a relapse when I asked?\n\nTL:DR  Asked friend to be best man. Was not in a right mindset. Intended it to be someone else. Asked him to make him feel better about death of a friend.\n",

      "description": "My SO and I have been together for a year and are currently living together while I attend school. We talk about most things and have good communication for the most part.\n\nAfter the holiday break (which she was away with family on a ski trip for) she randomly told me she was going on a trip in May to Croatia for 10 days. This surprised me as she hadn't mentioned anything about it beforehand. \n\nAfter some discussion she explained she was going on a trip with two girls she used to work with whom recently got out of relationships. She didn't give me much info outside of that and I didn't want to pry further. \n\nLater we ended up going to the place where these two girls work and one of them comes up and goes, \"I can't believe you're actually coming! You're so spontaneous.\" Then she turned to me and goes, \"you'll be lucky if she comes back alive with the parting we'll be doing!\"\n\nI also discover in this conversation that she's already made a deposit on the trip to guarantee her position. All of this without even mentioning it to me\n\nAt this point I'm starting to wonder wtf her intentions are behind this trip so I look into it. I find it's a 10 day tour where you hop between islands to party at the local beaches and bars with a crew of people the same age. Essentially it's for people who have nothing tying them down and want to experience their youth, uninhibited. \n\nWhy would someone in a committed relationship want to do this? \n\nI confronted her and she got defensive. It devolved I to a fight which we've put on the back burner for now. Nothing has been discussed about it because she's been sick with a cold and as sensitive as a cat whisker. \n\nTl;dr: girlfriend of a year whom I've been living with in a committed relationship spontaneously put a deposit down for a 10 day island hopping party tour in Croatia with two recently single friends without talking to me.

      "description": "My fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. ",

Her friend in the background chimed in agreeing, yeah maybe he likes her too which got me more flustered. I immediately responded with no I would never sleep with someone 300 pounds. I said this to her in confidence, I thought her BFF would never hear it, I said it to her to get to stop thinking I liked her friend.   \n\n\nCut to now my relationship, it having its problems, she says I disrespect the people she loves and I call her friends fat and that shes going put this on public and I can see how many people think I was wrong for even commenting on someone's weight. It was ONE time, and the only reason her friend knows is because my girlfriend told her.  \nMy response is go for it, I said what I said defending myself and I had no ill intentions. I don't think her friend is 300 pounds and if it was meant to be disrespectful it would of been. She doesn't see any wrong in telling her friend what I said, I should be able to trust and talk to my girlfriend.   \nThis is my first post so let me have it, I don't think I'm the guy shes painting me to be, a rude unloving judgmental person because I defended myself. I have apologized to the BFF, but every time I defend where I was coming from. Her BFF isn't even overweight, I said it out of pure exaggeration. Joking and judging people on looks has never been me. I'm 130lb World of warcraft nerd. ",

I ran away from my home when I was in 3rd grade because my mom threatened to hit me ( I remember a day in 2nd grade that my dad belted the living shit out of me, They tell now that never happened but why would a small kid run away from home, reach across a mid-size town, all while thinking I don't care what happens to me ( dark thoughts ) I AM NOT going back home.)\n\nAfter that I was asked If I wanted to go to a residential school for a year. I said yes. I cried my eyes out my first night there (4th grade) . they came every two months for a PTA. The next year they didn't take me back home but I was okay. I thought maybe next year. 6th grade not only was I there alone but they started coming only to pick me up for vacation. I think in 7th grade they only came at the start and end of the school year. I would go by myself home for vacation. I didn't want them to come.\n\nAfter that my dad had a heart attack. and was paralyzed on the left side. It was bad at the start but he recovered 40%. This is when everything started spiraling, family finance, relation with extended family, everything. Now my dad is so  fragile that I'm walking on egg shells around him. I don't know what will set him off. And when he is stressed out, I automatically match it. And my mom and sister walk on egg shells around me because they don't know what will set me off. I'm always screaming at them for one thing or another. I don't wanna be like my dad towards my mom and sis but I can't control it. \n\nI want to just move out and cut all communications. But I already feel guilty was even considering cutting all communication because I don't know what that'll do to them. But whenever I'm with them it makes me feel so emotionally drained and stressed and angry and resentful. AITA?    ",

I did everything I could when she needed help, and she even told me I \"saved her life\", but it hurts some that she's getting back with him and, more importantly, I'm genuinely scared now of thinking of texting/calling/or hanging out with her.

      "description": "My girlfriend gets drunk in our apartment almost every night. We have been together over 7 years but she has become an alcoholic in the last year.\n\nShe is a wonderful woman. The times we are together and she is sober are amazing. She is my favorite person in the world. But when she is drunk it feels like there's a stranger in my home trying to hug me and kiss me. I don't want that person anywhere near me.\n\nMy coping mechanism now is basically trying not to look at her, talk to her, or engage with her when she is drunk at home. I get frustrated and feel like I am dealing with an idiot when she is drunk.\n\nToday for example, I came home from work at 4pm and she is drunk. I decide to take the dog for a walk to get out of the apartment. I tell her I am texting her that I'm going to walk the dog. I also write a note with the the time on it saying I am going to walk the dog. I placed it on the table in front of her. Five minutes after I leave she calls, worried, wondering where I am. I kept telling her and ended up snapping at her because she didn't understand where I was. I could hear her tearing up on the phone. \n\nAfter I came home, I realized I had 4 missed calls and a text wondering where I was. I was very annoyed. I put my headphones in to listen to music while she went into the bathroom and vomited (bulimia) because I don't like vomit. It gives me a lot of anxiety when she does that. After she came out she was crying and came over to get affection from me. I didn't give it back. She got up, crying, and walked to the bedroom, shutting the door behind her. I could hear her still crying. She isn't going to remember any of this tomorrow. I still feel like I am doing something wrong by not helping her in some way. But at the same time I feel like I don't know this tortured, crying woman in my apartment. I guess I am trying to ride this whole thing out. She got a therapist recently so I am hoping that will help. I have encouraged AA and she knows I still love her. I don't try to shame her about it when she is sober. Obviously she has a lot of problems and I sometimes feel like I am wrong for not being more helpful while she is drunk. But at the same time, it's like my anxiety and frustration paralyze me in the moment. AITA?\n\n",

Long story short apparently she hasnt realised (impossible since I've told her before) and that she'll do better in the future (,, she'll pay me more attention\"). \nThis makes me feel like a childish asshole who asked for more than he deserved.\n\nSo AITA for wanting more attention?

      "description": "This past New Year's my husband I went out with my friend (also my boss) and her boyfriend. New Year's Eve is always a crap shoot for me so I had little expectations other than to have some fun. I was down for whatever. My friend suggested a venue and show. I wasn't terribly interested but I'm always down to try something new and normally so is my husband. When we got there my husband was put off,it wasn't his scene,mine either really but I was trying to make the best of it and have fun with him and the couple.\n\nWhen it comes time for the countdown I give my husband multiple 'peck' kisses but he leans forward wanting more. I tell him I don't want to smear my lipstick, of which I am wearing a lot. This spirals his mood completely into a bad mood. After that he is like a wet blanket sulking in the background. My friend (boss) tries to 'cheer him up' and does a silly dance at him and he essentially just stares at her and doesn't reciprocate. Eventually he stops talking to the couple completely making things more uncomfortable. We move to the next location and he has shut down completely, even though normally he's like a fish to water at the gay bars. I decide that I am going to power through and try and have a good time because I can't control his mood. (He has pretty turbulent moods).\n\nThere is a disclaimer here that my husband and I have major intimacy issues. I have sexual trauma from a young age I haven't fully been able to work through. I've been in therapy for a long time, on meds, and I've been trying to address it-work through it. I've made a huge effort to be affectionate to him, although the sexual portion just isn't happening. It's something I beat myself up over constantly and he is very aware of these circumstances. He tried to leave me at the bars and go home which made me mad because I wanted to spend time with him. I ended up leaving with him and he didn't speak a word to me then went and slept in the other bedroom. We didn't speak a word to each other yesterday and I ended up having my son sleep in the bed with me because I didn't want to sleep with him either.\n\nHe has contacted me today via email confirming it was the kiss and how I will never be intimate with him and I cared more about my friends having a good time. I am just pissed that all the work I've made towards working on being more touchy feely with him has been thrown out the door and he shat on my night and embarrassed me in front of my friends. I understand he is upset but he waited two days to tell me, decided to sleep in another bed,and gave me the silence treatment until today when he emailed me.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for abruptly kicking out a pianist out of an amateur musical comedy project?",
      "description": "I am currently involved in an amateur musical comedy project in which I am the composer of the songs. The texts are written by a friend who is the Master Brain behind this project. Let's call him \"Master Brain\"', shall we?  \n\n\nI am basically given carte blanche regarding the musical direction of this project. I had to compose more than a dozen of songs in which the melody mustn't be too hard to sing (as several people participating in this project are totally tone deaf), but it still has to have some catchy moments so the singers would enjoy working on these songs. I also ensure myself  to have a piano part that is not too easy, but not too hard to play either so the musics don't sound \"flat\". I eventually add a drums part in order to have the audiences hooked to the show and help the singers as a sound aid so they can sing at the right time.  The shows are due on May and June of the next year.   \n\n\nI presented the final result of the songs to the singers that were going to be involved. Although there were some flaws here and there, they loved it and I was even surprised that my songs were already in their head as they were humming them. Music sheets and audios are produced in order for the singers to capture the gist of the songs, even if not a single one can actually read music.  \n\n\nThen,  I realized that I wasn't going to perform both the piano and drums parts. We needed a pianist to perform the accompaniment so I could focus on the drums part and let the pianist work in autonomy. I am then presented an elderly man, in his 80s, which is a pianist enthusiast and owned several pianos in his house. Let's call him \"P80\".  \n\n\nI am told P80 was excelling in sight-reading and could work very effectively. One thing was that he played only classical music, so my music style being heavily influenced by [City Pop Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/City+Pop/), French Pop Music of the 70s-80s and lots of chords with major sevenths might surprise him, to say the least.  \n\n\nAroused anyway by his piano skills, I decide to send P80 the music sheets of three of my songs in August that I think are the easiest ones, without giving any clue so I can figure out how autonomous he was. Therefore, he could discover the piano parts and then, if he likes it and if he's willing to, work on all the songs later. A first appointment was set three weeks later with Brain Master and I in September, which would give him enough time to perform correctly each music sheet. These were one to three pages long, with five or six staves of four to six bars per page.  \n\n\nOne first problem that occurred was Master Brain and I weren't given the precise hour of the appointment in September. Therefore, we  called P80 in order to set everything correctly. P80 didn't answer the phone despite leaving several voicemails. We decided then to send e-mails. No answer either. We sollicited a friend that is more likely to have some answer from P80. Still no answer. We imagined the worst. Suddenly, out of nowhere, late in the evening, we finally receive a mail from this friend confirming the exact hour for the appointement the day after. Phew.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere, I was able to discover his big house and a splendid wooden grand piano sitting in the living room. As almost expected, P80 told me my harmonization was dissonant for him. I told him that this was my way of composing songs and these were the definitive version as all the scores were printed for the musicians and the singers. Later in the discussions, I realized that he didn't really read the scores and had hard times to read these because he couldn't understand how my music was written, despite I was being told he was excelling at sight-reading music. I had then to play all the piano parts of the songs for him so he could have the gist of these in order to have something to start with. I didn't play some of these scores very well as I didn't bother to practice at the time. I eventually propose another appointment with P80 whenever he wants so we could work together on the songs. P80 accepts and claims to be keen on this project.  \n\n\nLater in the evening, I decide to work myself on these piano accompaniments because I felt like a fraud if even the composer of the songs isn't able to play correctly the scores he writes. Done in 4 hours. I noticed several flaws in the music sheets that can be circumvented if I'm asked on these.  \n\n\nTowards the end of September, I decide to call him in order to check the progression of his work. P80 doesn't answer the phone. I leave both a veeeeeeery long voicemail detailing which songs he has to work on first and a written e-mail. No answer. No feedback. Nothing. Several days, I decided to try my luck again by phone. Still no answer. Aw, f\\*k it, I have better things to do, like playing /r/Smite.  \n\n\nFast forward to mid-October. Monthly workshop time for the singers and the musicians in which everybody gathers and is conducted by a singing teacher. We are told the workshop starts at 9:30 AM. P80 is late. I was however playing the piano for the singers. Good for me I don't sing in this musical project. P80 finally shows up at 11:30 AM. I decide to ask P80 to play the piano parts I hoped he worked on. The result was… meh. He was still sight-reading the music as if he received the scores one week before. He still had difficulties on some points in the music sheets, yet he didn't ask me for help.  \n\n\nI had to take him apart asking what he was doing during the end of September as I wasn't able to reach him. He said he never received my calls, nor my e-mail, nor my voice mail. As I am a tech-savvy person, I had the sense that P80 was lying to me. You can have a shitty phone that misses calls (I'm looking at you, Samsung Galaxy Note II and LG G3), but having on top of it a shitty phone provider that doesn't even register voice mails is barely believable, at least in France. Plus, he added that he didn't ask to be in this project, which surprises me as I was told P80 liked the project. However, I decided to not to be too harsh with him and let him work a bit on the music sheets. We even agreed to bring our keyboards each.  \n\n\nLater in October, I FINALLY received a call from P80 asking me for help. Unfortunately, I missed the call, but I call him back. He doesn't answer, AGAIN, but I leave a voicemail telling him how I write music, how the small details he points in my writing are not that relevant and that he can download the audios of the music sheets in order to capture how these must be played. Meanwhile, I got to the point where I was training so much on the songs I was distorting them.  \n\n\nEventually, we are at the beginning of November, where the monthly workshop has to take place. Singers, musicians and singing teacher. Still starts at 9:30 AM. P80 still doesn't show up. Finally shows up at 12:00 AM, but leaves quickly until 2:00 PM because he must pay visit to his sick wife. When he comes back, I don't even notice his return. When I am finally noticed of his presence, I'm going to talk to him and ask him to show me the result of his work on a song so I could take care of the drums part. The result was even worse. Working with him on the piano was a let-down, still looked like he got the music sheets several days ago. We got to the point I had enough and had to impose myself to replace him in order to finish the training of the singers. The singing teacher thanks me for getting the things back in track.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, he complains that he only has piano parts and I should have kept the voice parts so he can figure out exactly where to restart. I tell him the bars are numbered, and either the singing teacher or I would just have to tell him the correct bar numbers.\n\n  \nThen, we proceed to work on another song, with P80 sitting in the back of the room, doing nothing. Meanwhile, I was thinking to myself whether I had to keep him as a pianist in the project. P80 had the music sheets since three months. His work was non-existent.  I already previously warned Master Brain after my unsuccessful attempts to communicate with P80 that if there wasn't more commitment from P80, I would end immediately this collaboration that actually never was.  \n\n\nThis was it. I isolated myself with P80 and Master Brain and announced to P80 that due to his poor performance and his personal reasons, he didn't have to bother coming back the next month. P80 got mad and answered me: \"You are too full of yourself! And as you so want to tell the truth, you know what? Your music is boring and repetitive! I am more a musician than you! I conducted a choral, so I know jackshit! Why did you ask me to join you in the first place!\". And then leaves.  \n\n\nAfter having heard these complaints, I feel now somehow relieved, thinking I extinguished a nasty fire that was going to blow up in the long term. At least, I regained the control of my own music. As for the drums, another person proposed to me to perform this part; I know I can rely on this person so I don't have to worry about her commitment.  \n\n\n*TL;DR: Wrote some songs for an amateur musical project, with piano and drums. Got presented an elderly pianist who didn't work on the music sheets he got for three months, wasn't responding to my phone calls and my e-mails and showed late on monthly workshops. I relied on his abilities, and assumed he was autonomous enough to play the music sheets correctly and communicate with me. After seeing no progress in his work, I got tired of this shit, told him to leave the project after only three months and made him understandably angry. AITA?*  \n",

Single. Day.\n\nAlso she never wanted anyone to know we were dating, I personally didn’t care but I decided I didn’t want to embarrass her.\n\nBut then she started doing embarrassing things like, getting irrationally angry at ppl for pointing out how cute we looked together.\n\nI was so embarrassed by her it got to the point where I would hide from her at recess.\n\nI was a coward and I couldn’t say no to her, and things moved way to fast for me.\n\nThen came field day, she insisted I dance with her outside with tons of ppl watching, and I said no.\n\nShe kept doing this until I eventually gave in and danced with her.\n\nAfter it was done I kept my head down and walked to sit down.\n\n(Side note: she talked about her ex a lot and kept all his gifts. He had to move)\n\nA couple of days later I was so fed up and decided to break up with her. During those 2 days I wouldn’t talk to her and hid and looked really sad.\n\nOne day she asks me\n\nGf: “What’s wrong?”\n\nMe: “I think we should see other people ”\n\nGf: “Ok”\n\nThat was it, no shock, no surprise just “ok” I knew she wasn’t over her ex. But we still did the things we did when we were together which really pissed me off.\n\nNext year whenever she would try to talk to me I would outright ignore her and be visibly angry.\n\nThis all came to a stop when she asked me why I was ignoring her.\n\nI told her\n\n“ I don’t think we should be friends can you leave me alone”\n\nAnd she did, we’ve never talked since\n\nSo AITA?\n",

I reply with a “yeah they mark bank but it’s quite hard to be chosen to be one” and she goes on to talk about how much money they can make for carrying a baby but how she would never do it. She then goes on to the question that in my mind is just a lose-lose nonsense question, asking if I’d break up with her if she were to be surrogate. I’m 24 she’s 22, I could just butter it up but I answered it plainly , yeah I would most probably break up with you if you were carrying someone else’s baby for 9 months while we live together, I just personally wouldn’t want that experience right now in my life, it’s not like I said fuck You I don’t love you.

      "description": "I love my mom. But she has the worst taste in men *ever*.\n\n(Almost) Every one of her past boyfriends we're abusive or cheated on her. And the few nice ones she broke up with. Her last ex boyfriend, a really good guy, she left for my stepdad.\n\nMy stepdad is in debt, emotionally and mentally abusive, grumpy, mean, has a credit score of 583, is extremely quick to anger, obsessively neat and orderly and exact and does routines to the point where there's DEFINITELY something wrong there (can't drink out of any other cup, won't sit down if someone is using *his* chair, paces around the house at night in an exact way, gets irrationally angry if anything is out of place).\n\nHer ex was so sweet, kind to me, and her, and the deer and wild animals that lived near his house like a Disney princess. He had an amazing job, didn't come home burnt out, was pretty wealthy, patient, loved all of us, and was just... Great. I miss him.\n\nI was 6 when she started dating my stepdad, and I repeatedly told her I didn't like him. I remember this over a decade later. She made me come with her to his house, where we did nothing, I had nothing, it was overall boring as shit. She wouldn't let me stay at my grandma's house where we lived.\n\nOne day, my hamster got very sick. He was definitely going to die while I was gone. She forced me to come with her, even though my grandma said she would love to watch me. So I was dragged into the car and we drove there, while I cried my eyes out because I had to leave my dying pet alone with my grandma. He died over that weekend and I didn't get to hold him in his last moments, instead he died scared and alone.\n\nHe constantly degrades me, calls me bitch, cunt, asshole, basically all of that. Whenever I do something a little wrong, I get screamed at. Or if he thinks I did it. If my mom did it, he doesn't yell.  My mental health plumetted at 7 the fuck years old because of his constant assholery.\n\nThe only times he was ever nice to me were the times I tried to kill myself. He's sent me into panic attacks constantly, then screams like a child when I WAS a child. He's 40+ years older than me.\n\nHe is... \"Inexperienced\" with kids. Youngest child, never had kids, little cousins, nieces or nephews, etc. He treated me like a short adult, not a kid.\n\nHe also never acknowledged my disability. I'm autistic, and he fought me constantly on it, saying I'm just lazy/stupid/overreacting. ~~How am I overreacting but you screaming at me because there's water on the sink is fine and mature?!??~~ I have a few things wrong with me, including ADHD, bipolar, cptsd (from him), etc. \n\nMy mom has seen all of it. It's not a secret. Since I was little I didn't like or trust him. I didn't want him in my life. But she never wavered, just went along with my screaming and crying and begging to stop because I HATED him, and ended up marrying him.\n\nI know some of you will say \"just move out\". I'm disabled. I have tried to get a job, every single one I've ever applied to threw out my application or something because half I never even got a call back. I've applied to over 80 places within 20 miles of me. (Yes of course I called and they said it was rejected, I asked why they never say why, they say they don't know).\n\nMy mom calls me selfish for still holding a grudge for it. And they both gang up on me and blame me for everything. My therapist who's heard both sides of the story told my mom that SHE is/was in the wrong anyway. She also calls me lazy after I do everything for her because she's physically and mentally disabled because I'm tired after going to school for 6 hours dealing with animals and taking care of them for free.\n\nTl;dr AITA for hating my abusive stepdad who my mom married even though i constantly said I hated him and her seeing the abuse,(I liked her past boyfriend so you can't say that everyone hates their stepparents)  blaming my mom, and trying to commit suicide and self harmed multiple times because of him?

      "description": "So, a little bit of backstory.\n\nI am 14 and a freshman in High School, and I am just a little bit overweight. It all started on the 15th of September. I remember being so shy and anxious, but looking forward to this day. On the big day, i was seated next to M (i'm going to censor their names for the sake of privacy). In front of us were D and R.\n\nAs soon as i saw them forming a friendship circle, i knew i had to join in. It started out with small jokes, and soon, we were all like best friends. We hung out every week after school, gone out to movies once a month or so and even gone to a party. I particularly liked R's jokes and complimented him for his advanced humor. I thought of him as a perfect friend as he had exactly the same type of humor as me (and we shared memes alot). \n\nI don't know where it went wrong, but i soon noticed manipulative behaviour in R. We rode the same bus to School and back home. I haven't realised until then, but he was always dragging me into supermarkets without my will (by blackmailing) and putting his snacks on my line so i paid for them. It started small with stuff like 1$ but soon got worse and one day i had to spend 8$ for his sake. He didnt even share the snacks, and he ordered me to share mine.\n\nA week passed after i noticed his toxic behaviour that i started avoiding his bus. He would ask me why and i would just make up random excuses.\nWhen he figured out i wasn't going to pay for his food anymore, it all started.\n\nAt first, i didnt notice it. But weeks passed and his jokes started turning against me. He was continuously making fun of me and punching me \"for fun\", and when i told him to stop he did his fake laugh and kept pressing on. \n\nThis happened a month ago. For a whole month after, i had to endure his insulting jokes because i did not have the courage to say it to him, because he always made fun of me more when he saw that i got offended. He was making jokes about my looks, even though we have 2 obese kids in our class and i am three times thinner than them. I couldn't put a stop to it no matter how much i tried.\n\nThen, i had a brilliant idea. Blackmail. I was going to text him that if he did not stop i would make fun of his grades (he had really low grades, his average was 6.70/10 while mine was 9.30) and of his stupidity. \n\nWhile on the bus home (took a different one than him) i wrote the exact words to him:\n\nme:\"You know, you don't have to remind me of my weight with your \"jokes\" everyday. I know that i'm overweight.\"\n\nme:\"You have the intelligence of a snail, and you see me making fun of you?\"\n\nme:\"Today's jokes really offended me to a personal level. If you go on with this toxic and manipulative behaviour, i will have to ignore and take you out of my life forever. I will not torelate jokes adressed to me anymore.\"\n\nThis time, he seemed to take me serious. He apologized and said i should have told him (even though i did multiple times) and that he knows people that are fatter than me, and that he didnt want to offend me.\n\nSo, what do you guys think of this mess? AITA?\n\n\n",

What? Am I supposed to eat the shit with my fucking hands? \n\nAnyway, my gf is retarded and I don't think I am at fault for her putting the god damn gravy on the bed. I didn't even touch it.

      "description": "I go to an art school, and since art supplies tend to be quite cumbersome to carry around and set up, my school provides studio spaces to students to use as a workspace.  Basically like office cubicles but a bit more spacious (depending on your major.)\n\nI am someone who easily falls prone to sensory overload when I'm trying to concentrate on something difficult and important, like homework.  For me, I most easily affected by this when it comes to sounds.   \n\nThe person in the space right next to mine tends to be really loud.  He often eats in his studio while he's working.  The sound of people eating is distracting for me as is, but for him it's amped up because he eats out of glass and ceramic dish ware.  So I always hear him chew, and the clinking of spoons against his mugs/bowls, and can smell whatever he's heated up.  (The smells don't distract me too bad but they still are rather irritating)  It's a nightmare trying to concentrate when he's present.  \n\nI've tried putting on music or a podcast or something to drown him out.  Sometimes it works but not always.  The problems I've run into with doing that is sometimes whatever I'm listening to still doesn't drown him out, and I don't want to up my earbuds on full-blast day in and day out just because of him.  Also sometimes what I'm listening to just ends up contributing to the sensory overload anyways.      \n\nI know I can just go find somewhere else to work.  But the whole point of the workspace is to get work done in there.  Why can't he go find somewhere else to eat?  Just down the hall is the student center that has tables and booths and stuff.  Whenever I'm at my school late and need to eat something I always go and eat it there.\n\nI haven't actually talked with him about this because I'm not 100% sure how to approach it.  I don't want to force him out, but I wish he would be more considerate in what's supposed to be a quiet workspace.  I'm worried that if he gets defensive or mad at me over this, 1) I will have created an enemy that I still have to see on a regular basis, and 2) he'll continue to do this and nothing will change     ",

      "description": "WIBTA if I told my friend she needs to get her act together or have lower expectations? My friend wants to become a surgeon, but has not good grades, doesn't like working hard at school, and regularly skips school to line up and attend concerts.\n\nIt seems like she wants to become a surgeon to make a ton of money, she specifically said that she wants to make at least $500,000 a year. We were listening to a talk, and he mentioned high paying careers usually held by women, and at the top of the list was a OB/GYN and their salary was listed at around $120,000. She turned to me and said that all the careers listed didn't earn much. I asked for clarification, and she definitely included the OB/GYN. I feel like she has totally unreasonable expectations for the amount of work she puts in.\n\nIn addition, she wants to go to college near Major City because it hosts many concerts. If she goes to one of those schools, I feel like she will spend all of her money on concerts, and skip class all the time to go to those concerts. Even if she doesn't go to a school near Major City, she has gone by car to concerts 6 hours away.\n\nShe expects to have predictable hours as a surgeon, and not have any emergency surgeries that she will have to skip concerts for. She is fully expecting to attend many concerts as a surgeon. She has told me that she doesn't particularly like other people very much, so I think the medical school admissions people will see through her very quickly even if she does have the grades for med school. I've always heard that people become doctors to help others, but this is a secondary reason to her.\n\nI too am not the most studious, but I never skip school, and I try hard. I want to be a physical therapist, which earns about 70,000 in my area in the beginning, so I feel a bit insulted when she said that 120,000 is not much. She would be very good at math if she tried, but not as strong in the humanities, and I'm not sure about the sciences. I also think she is underestimating how much malpractice insurance will be. \n\nAITA for thinking about all of this, and WIBTA if I talked to her about this?",

      "description": "I (M, 36) got married two years ago and none of my paternal cousins came to my wedding. Some of them didn't even RSVP. My father passed away when I was young and I've lived far away from them most of my life. I always tried to make it to family events and holidays. Even before I was old enough to drive I would take the bus to see them. As the years passed I ended up moving even further away but I always tried to make it to the events or send a card, etc. Those trips made me appreciate the difficulty of travel, so when some of my cousins weren't able to make it to my wedding I understood. When I realized that none of them could make it I was actually a little hurt, but I understood. I was miffed that some of my cousins whose wedding's I had gone to responded in the negative.\n\nWhen I got married I was in grad school and living within proximity to them and saw them regularly. I flew home to get married and some of their parents were in attendance and my mother's side of the family, who I'm not close with, attended. I did see that they'd posted on my FB. When I was around my family no one said anything to me about it. Literally nothing except from some uncle who my aunt was in the process of divorcing. What I took from this was that if they weren't going to make the effort to have a relationship than neither was I. Apparently they noticed this and one of their parents reached out and asked why I was being distant and if I planned on approaching my cousins about what was bothering me. I told her that I wasn't necessarily being distant and that my interactions with them were as much their responsibility as mine and that if there was something bothering them, that they could reach out to me. She implied I was being ungrateful and I just left it at that. I was around them a handful of times and they always left me alone. One of my cousins did get drunk and apologized about not RSVPing and I told him that I appreciated his apology but that I thought our relationship had meant more, he said that it did. I ultimately told him that what he was saying didn't line up with how he was acting and that I was no longer willing to carry our relationship. We said goodbye in the morning and he texted me once when there was a natural disaster in my area. I didn't respond.\n\nEventually one of my cousins did send us a wedding present, and I was very grateful and wrote a card thanking them and I do respond to their texts. They occasionally post on my FB and one of them won't stop texting me on holidays, but I just feel like they need to recognize my marriage in some capacity other than posting on FB. I don't feel like I've ever really asked them for anything and I understand and we can't always make it to events. I'm not demanding a specific reaction from them more than I simply found their reaction to not be in line with what I thought family was and acted in response with what I thought was best for my wife and I, which was to let the relationships drift away.\n\nSo, AITA?",

When I was trying to get the tv to work to have something to listen to/watch when making it, he asked me to help him in the basement. I told him I was selecting a movie and I was still trying to make the monkey bread and kept with that answer. He then said \"You know, never have daughters, have sons (I'm one of three daughters and I have an older half-brother). This made me very upset as it pretty much sounded like \"I wish I had three sons instead.\" Told him \"F\\*\\*\\* you\" (I've never cursed at him before) and ran up to my room. \n\nThat point he grounded me for cursing at him but I didn't really care and I was really upset at what he said. My sisters asked me what was wrong and everyone managed to scream at each other for a bit where he understood why I was upset. He said it was just a joke but he sounded completely serious when he said it. I calmed down and went back downstairs where he apologized to me later saying he didn't mean me to take it that way but I told me to leave me alone and I just wanted to finish the monkey bread at that point. He said he was sorry again and left to Target for a few things.\n\nFast forward to an hour later where the bread is done and Dad's home. He got me some chocolate and flowers to apologize and I did accept his apology, but I'm still really hurt and mad. He did seem really genuine in his apology earlier that day and when he came home. Am I dragging this out for too long, am I justified for being mad at all, or is this it ok to still be mad?\n\nTL;DR: Dad said \"never have daughters and have sons\" to which I said F\\*\\*\\* you.

      "description": "Background: My (ex) wife is Korean and I basically knocked her up briefly after we met. I married her after our son was born and we moved to the US about 2 years ago. \n\nI knew from the start wasn’t quite right with her, but she didn’t tell me until much later she has borderline and bipolar. That said, she could be sweet and was relatively smart. \n\nAfter our son was born, she started drinking heavily. She would be violent towards me (arrested a few times, but I always dropped the charges... I know.) and would attempt to commit suicide about once a month (mostly pills). \n\nI filed for divorce and left her a few months ago. She cleaned up her act, got some new doctors, and sobered up. She begged me to take her back and give her another chance because she had “changed”, so I caved. \n\nSince then, things had been ok. Not awful, but not normal either. She definitely wasn’t what I needed in a wife or our son needed in a mother. I grew impatient with her lack of progress, but to be fair she was making some progress. She was just unable to help with all the responsibilities involved in having a child, was a drag financially, didn’t make me happy, and was simply a bad role model for our son with her fits, outbursts and screaming. \n\nSo one day after a particularly bad set of fights and her relapsing into violence and suicide attempts, I told my lawyer that I wanted to continue with the divorce and no longer wanted to sponsor her visa. \n\nSo obviously I stuck it out with her longer than I should have and have go ven her plenty of chances, so I don’t feel bad for leaving her. But I feel like an asshole because unlike most people who get a divorce, now she won’t physically be around to see her son grow up since she was deported and can likely never come back (due to some visa issues since before we met). Does that make me an asshole?\n",

My dad comes home and turns of the wifi( he has been doing this inconsistently for weeks). Me somewhat agitated asks him why. He says it's a distraction. I reply If it was a distraction I could go downstairs out of the living room. He says that's not the point I'm your father and listen to me. I'm thinking, I'm Fucking 20 years old , the only reason I listen to you is because I respect you, and I'm an honor roll student. I replied that isn't right. He again says I'm head of the family listen to me. My mother takes my side saying we(my brother and I) are doing well in school and cause no trouble so why not. My dad proceeds to say I am head of the family and if you(my mom) disagree it does not matter, you just have to shut up and accept it. At this moment I'm tearing up because I never thought my dad would have this way of thinking. Just thinking about the way he treated my mom disgusts me. He is a firm Christian and yet I am able to question God,but not my father's authority.  I think his way of thinking is disgusting and needs to go through family counseling if he truly thinks like that. I understand I should listen to him as he is providing with a roof and food, but I think there is a line that has to be drawn especially with how he treated my mom.

      "description": "Hello everyone. Refinery workers have been on strike for a few weeks where I live. They blocked access to the trucks and gas stations can't get refilled. So putting gas in your tank became an overnight problem. I travel 50 kilometers a day for work and finding a gas station that's not empty is a real challenge. You basically have to rely on word of mouth and pray you get there in time to fill up.\n\nAnyway last week end i got word that some gas station located 15km from where i live still had gasoline. So i get there as soon as possible only to see the worker closing off the gas station. I headed to the nearest station that had gasoline but E10 was all they had left. It's a mix with 10% ethanol only recommended for cars built after 2000, mine is from 1997. Since I had no choice I put 20 liters in my car, it's a small car with a 40 liter tank, enough to last me a week if I drive carefully.\n\nThe next day after finishing work I drove by a gas station on my way home, and to my surprise it was packed with people waiting in line, so I joined the fun. My turn came and there was a notice saying that due to the current situation, the pump is locked to 10 Euros per customer (not even liters, go figure). So I put my credit card in and finally got some real gasoline. Now normally I would stop after one serving but since I had E10 in the tank I wanted to limit the damage it could do to my engine by mixing it with as much gasoline as possible.\n\nThe pump automatically stopped when it reached 10 bucks so i put it back in place and proceeded to put my credit card in once again. Typed my code and the delivery started again, that's when some old dude 50, 55 got out of his car and started yelling at me: \"You don't have the right, it's limited by law (the moment I knew I was dealing with some sheep who believes everything he sees on TV), that if everyone does that there will be none left for the rest of us!\".\n\nI kept looking at him with a blank expression while taking gas. I wanted to tell him \"I'm taking your share!\" but I didn't. Seeing I didn't care he said he took my plate and he will call the cops on me to which I replied \"Do it\", and he angrily got back into his car. I didn't care because it was limited only by the gas station and not by law, even though there was some instance where it was.\n\nSo reddit, do you think I'm an asshole?",

I did this by hiding my phone and secretly texting him that I was a different person and found this phone on the bus. He took this VERY seriously, I might have took it a bit far because he started telling me that if I was pulling a prank on him, he would smack me. So I went far and he told me he would see it on Find my IPhone, so he finally ruined the joke and saw it, and now he’s yelling at me to stop pulling stupid pranks because it’s not funny, am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: pulled an April fools prank on my brother, got mad, yelled at me.",

College students come back to work around the winter and summer time and that means the year round employees lose shifts to the college students. I request a lot of hours because I like big pay checks and having money to buy weed, booze and hockey tickets during school semesters. Most coworkers don’t really mind because they’re still in high school and don’t like to work, however, there is one, a lady in her 60’s who passive aggressively goes off on college students working more than 20 hours per week (I try to work 30 whenever I’m back) for “stealing” her hours. \nShe complains that it isn’t fair that I only work 5 months out of the year yet seem to get priority over her. She may be right about how it’s not fair, but I like having money so I’m not gonna acknowledge that to my boss.  I do tell her that if I need a shift covered she can have it but otherwise I’m not gonna take a pay cut.  She complains that it’s harder to buy gifts around the holidays and pay her rent when the college kids come back and it’s honestly getting more and more difficult to tell her that I frankly don’t give a shit. I technically have 2 other jobs, shooting music videos for local rappers and delivering for Uber eats and she says I should focus more on those gigs. The thing is, it’s hard to get music video gigs consistently and working outside in the freezing cold delivering food sucks so I stick to the rink most of the time. \n\nI just feel if she’s having a hard time making ends meet because of college students daring to have some money saved up,  she should take some initiative and look for a second job.

      "description": "My [26m] girlfriend [24f] often brags about “making it in the big city” because she escaped her small town in the MidWest and achieved her “dreams”. She would adamantly proclaim that she did everything herself.\n\nAside from a few modeling gigs here and there, I never saw her work in a day in her life but she had a nice car, a spacious apartment in a nice neighborhood, and luxury brand items everywhere. What’s even more odd was her relationship with her former and significantly older employer [50s m]. As in, she would always talk to him on the phone and constantly complain about him to me - how his wife doesn’t love him, and how his children keep wasting his money.\n\nOn the other hand, she would get extremely and oddly jealous of my female assistants and secretaries to the point that she wanted me to fire them for doing their jobs. She would act disgusted and shamed sugar babies/sugar daddies on the street. Moreover, she would hate on her employer for sleeping with other young women while married - saying that adultery is a sin. Overall, she presented this pious and righteous image of herself that she was really not.\n\nAnyways, her employer confronts me one day and tells me the truth. Turns out she slept with him and continued the affair while knowing that he was married. She later broke it off with him and she dated his son instead. However, after her son and her broke up. She continues the affair with her employer once again. She stops being physical with him after she met me but he continues to support her financially. Mostly because she threatened to expose their affair to his wife if he didn’t gave her monthly allowances.\n\nI never forgot what he told me: “I was once a young man like you, I fell in love with a girl and she turned out to be a sugar baby for an older man. I wasted too much time trying to solve something that couldn’t be resolved. When I found out that you were becoming serious with her, I believed you deserved to hear the truth.”\n\nI confronted her about this. She cried and admitted it was true. I broke up with her same day because it was too much to deal with. At the time, I was starting a new business and simply could not burden the stress of the drama. More so, I didn’t know who she was anymore and I felt sick about the whole situation. So I left.\n\nAs I was leaving, she kept crying that I was abandoning her when she lost everything she worked for in the past four years. According to her, if I truly loved her, I would have stayed and worked things out with her. \n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend slept with her boss and his son in the past. Hid it from me until her boss revealed it to me. I broke up with her.",

      "description": "This happened actually a couple months ago, but everyone keeps bringing it up lately so I'm wondering if I was the asshole:\nEverything started when I was little, and my cousin thought it was alright to force me to have oral sex with him (I'm talking about a period between 4th and 7th grade, while he was 14-18 yo). Even though this happened more than once, I completely removed it until last november, when, because of therapy, these memories came back to me. I am now 18, and I'm still dealing with this. I've been diagnosed with depression and tomorrow will be my first day on anti-depressants (yay!). Anyway, back to the story: after telling what happened to my close family (father, mother and brother) my mother felt the need to spread the word to all my relatives, even people I didn't know the existance of (of course this genereted a pretty bad fight, but that is another story). I've always thought little about my family, they are narrow-minded homophobic racist bigots, so I never wanted anything to do with them, therefore my relationship with them was never good, and they considered me the black sheep of the family: I have long dyed hair, I'm bisexual, I don't want to kill every black person, I listen to the Devil's music and I'm an atheist. Nevertheless, I expected them to show me at least some solidarity after getting to know what happened, or at least I didn't expect them to react how they did: they blamed me, they said \"I'm not going to believe you against your cousin 'cause we know you and we know your soul is corrupted and that probably you just want something out of this\". Pretty much everyone in the family told me something along these lines, so I told them all to fuck off and went on with my life, since I didn't really care about what they thought. But then, my grandfather got sick, they found a 4th stage cancer in his lungs, and in december he died. I never once went to his hospital room, despite my family calling me multiple times, my grandfather telling me he loved me no matter what and so on and my parents trying to convince me, and when he died I decided I didn't want to go to the funeral, I didn't want them to think I felt for his death (cause I didn't) and I didn't want to console them. Of course they were gdeatly offended by this and told me I am a cold-hearted piece of shit sociopath, but once again, I wemt on with my life.\nBUT, starting last week, they called me and texted me bringing this thing up, asking me why I didn't go and saying I really hurt them by not going. My mother and I had an argument about this (it was her father) and my grandmother called me three or four times syaing that I was being unfair to people who loved me and so on. I pretty much think I'm in the right here, but I'm having second thoughts about my reaction, maybe it was excessive. So, am I the asshole? \n\nP.S.: I'm not a native english speaker, so I'm sorry for any mistakes.",

      "description": "I moved in with my late grandmother (RIP) about 3 years ago when I transferred to a college in the city I currently live in. She lived in a 2 bedroom apartment using a city government housing assistance program for low income individuals, so moving in with her was just a matter of filing a few papers saying that I was family. Now, when she passed on nothing really changed about my situation, other than the monthly rent going from $75/mo to $50/mo. I was ecstatic, because I live in a good part of an expensive city, and I was only making $15/hr at the time. After a while living on my own, I managed to land a new job that dramatically increased my income, such that I could afford to live in a decent normal apartment in my city and not live paycheck-to-paycheck. The thing is, the housing authority here audited my grandmother's income *very* infrequently, on the order of years, because she joined the program decades ago and her paperwork is very old, so for a decent time now I've been paying a monthly rent of $50 with an income that could afford that rent 20 times over. In addition, the housing authority here is very well funded, so my apartment was recently renovated with a new floor, appliances, etc. and my rent stayed the same.\n\nI feel guilty all the time because I know my housing is subsidized by public funding. I have a feeling I'm being an asshole, because there is a long waiting list of people to get on this program. On the other side, it logically doesn't make sense to move out when I'm able to put so much away in savings and take advantage of an opportunity that few people find themselves in.",

Right now, I just don't have the time or frame of mind to be in a relationship. I just want sex to blow off steam. \n\nSo clearly, we're incompatible here, because Grace is now suddenly wanting to go on dates and cuddle and all that. So yesterday I told her straight up: 'You obviously have feelings for me, but I don't have any for you. This makes us incompatible. If you're willing to set aside your feelings and just have sex, we can continue. If you aren't willing to just be fuckbuddies, I'm sorry, but I think it would be better for both of us if we broke up'. \n\nI expected her to get sad, but she actually started crying.

      "description": "TL/DR my best friend who I was confiding with while going through a breakup was pursuing the girl I was confiding about while we were still together.  Am I the asshole for feeling betrayed and stabbed in the back?\n\n\nDETAILS:\n\nI'm a male in my late 20's and I've been seeing this girl non-monogamously for 2 years.  Even though it's non-monogamous we still had a connection and love for each other, it's not just a friends with benefits type of relationship to either of us.  She has often expressed to me and other people in our friend circle that she wants to be in a committed monogamous relationship with me.  She wants more then I'm giving.  I have a lot of other things going on in my life, I travel a lot, and truthfully I'm afraid of commitment and truly enjoy my space and alone time and just being single.  It's not like I'm going out and banging a bunch of chicks all the time, it has very little to do with that, its complicated.  \n\nI'm also a very stoic person.  I'm not very emotional and I have only 2 or 3 friends that I really share my deepest feelings with and open up to.  The friend that I open up to and talk to the most often about my conflicts or emotions lives across the country, we speak to each other every couple days, and he's really someone who I trusts opinion, he's a good listener, and I feel like I can bounce anything off of him.  He's my best friend.\n\n\nOur mutual friend was having a birthday party where I live and my friend who lives across the country (lets call him Adam) is really strapped for cash right now but I felt that he should be here for the party and I'm doing well at work right now, so I bought him a plane ticket out here and he surprised our friend at his party.  Later in the night, A got extremely intoxicated and I told him to take a nap in my tent that I had set up for me and the girl I was with (lets call her Becky) to sleep in.  I got him to drink a big glass of water, took his shoes off, tucked him in and told him I'd wake him up in 2 hours.  2 hours later I come back to wake him up and Becky is in the tent and they are spooning eachother, I was a little annoyed with Adam because at of anyone, I felt like he would be the one to know my feelings for her, I paid for his plane ticket, picked him up from the airport, he was sleeping in my tent, and now he's making a move on the girls he knows I'm seeing?  I didn't let it kill my time the rest of the night and ended up just sleeping in the bed that he was supposed to sleep in.  The next morning he swore that it meant nothing, apologized profusely, said \"I would never do that to a brother man\", said nothing sexual happened, said they were just cuddling because they were cold... I genuinely accepted this and moved on.  He went back to the West Coast a day later and we continued our friendship.\n\n \n\nAbout 2 weeks later is when it all started to unravel with B. She cut our relationship off and just said she needed me to commit to her and be in a traditional relationship or we needed to give eachother space.  We ended up giving eachother space.  I was pretty upset about it and confiding to A about how I felt, sharing the conversations I was having with B and trying to figure out the proper way to go about it.  His suggestion was to give her the space she needs, STOP TALKING TO HER, and let her figure out what she wants.  I took his advice.... about a month later, I get a phone call from Adam and I could tell something was wrong.  He pretty much said that he's fallen for Becky and theyve been talking to eachother since that night of the party (while we were still together mind you) and that she was going to fly out to visit him and he was wondering how I felt about it.  I pretty much told him that I didn't feel good about it at all, and out of anyone, he should know that I still have feelings for her and was hoping Becky and me could work things out.  He knew we had begun talking again and hanging out too.  \n\n\nAfter that we began speaking with less frequency, maybe once a week instead of a couple times.  A day after speaking to Adam and a few days after hanging out with Becky, I see a picture on social media of Becky on the West Coast where he lives.  Neither of them mentioned that they were going through with it in our conversations leading up to it, and neither of them reached out or texted me while they were together, which is unlike both of them.  I feel betrayed and I feel like I cant talk to Adam with the same deepness that we had before.  My trust for him is gone.  I told Adam that I need some space to digest this and he thinks that I'm being unreasonable and immature. \n\n\nI'm feeling very conflicted and I've come here in hopes that some of you could chime in and tell me if how I'm feeling is in appropriate or if I should just let it go and continue my friendship in the same way.  I don't want to feel this way, I hate drama, but I can't help it.  I also don't want to hold Becky back and not let her pursue what she is looking for.  I know she's not \"mine\" and I honestly want her to be happy and to find the love she deserves.  Help me out!",

      "description": "Context: I’ve never been a religious person before although my dads side of the family is Jewish and recently my dad has tried to get more in touch with his heritage, even going as far as taking Hebrew lessons. I’ve always seen religion as something irrelevant in my life and I’ve never really felt a spiritual connection or anything. \n\nStory: So last night I was working downstairs when my mother comes down and tells me that my father is about to light the Hanukkah candles. I tell her that I’m busy and I don’t really want to do it (when also it’s because I’m not a big fan of religious activities). She calls me selfish and shouts at me and I was kind of angry at her for expecting me to participate in something I don’t want to do just because it’s “technically my heritage”.\n\nI’m half angry at my parents for expecting me to try and be religious like them but I also feel a bit like an asshole for not respecting my heritage and stuff\n\nAITA?\n\n",

Eh whatever, it’s cool. \n\nI always pay in cash, I went to the bank yesterday and took out $200 in 2 one hundred dollar bills. (I never use my credit card, I leave it at home usually. I put Netflix on it and pay it off each month) \n\nSo, I take this girl out to eat at a place, and they didn’t have change for a $100. (Which pissed me off btw, but whatever) I had no other way to pay, so I asked if she could pay and I pay her back later She said “fine, whatever” In kinda a mad voice. After dinner we talked in the car and she said she was mad because usually the man always pays, etc etc \n\n\nI felt bad after the date. I paid her back through PayPal tho. ",

      "description": "Semi-long story, this happened awhile ago but still bugs me.\n\nBasically my wife went on anti-depressants and it killed her libido. Sex is pretty important to me, but if she's not feeling it, then obviously I'm not going to push her about it. We had some talks and she said she'd take some time to adjust and see how she feels after some time. Flash forward a few weeks.\n\nShe texts me at work sending me pics of her in lingerie asking me to order her sushi while she's home. Of course I order the sushi instantly (which i would've done anyway, i did the weeke before). On the way home she texts me asking me to get firewood and wine for tonight.\n\nI get home, we have some wine and a fire and she says \"hey, btw i dont want sex tonight.\"\nI'm clearly disappointed and let her know i felt really jerked around by the earlier interactions.\n\nAm i the asshole for thinking things were gonna happen?\n\nTLDR - Am i an asshole for thinking my wife wanted to hook up after sexting me when we have had a dry spell?",

      "description": "Sorry if the layout sucks, I’m on my phone. Also sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors. \n\nSo a bit of context, I(21F) started a friends with benefits relationship with a good friend(23M, let’s call him B) back in July. It was fun and we had a good time but in September he started dating a girl (let’s call her L)so we stopped hooking up. They broke up in December. Ever since B started dating L, L made him unfollow me on social media because she didn’t like how close B and I were. L made B stop talking to me and we talked everyday for about a year up until that point. Ever since L and B started dating, B and I never were the same. Even after they had broken up, we never really started talking again. But recently, B messaged me and we started  flirting again. We had planned on seeing each other again once we were both back in the same city. \n\nNow to the asshole situation! Last night I was pregaming to go out and was scrolling social media. (I follow people that pop up in my recommended because I like finding new content)  I guess in my drunken haze I followed L.  I get a DM from B that night about how L bitched him out for it, and for me to delete his number and never speak to him again. I replied confused since I hadn’t realize I had followed her, he once again said to never speak to him again. I blocked him on Instagram because I didn’t want to be attacked for an accident. B then went to his second account and continued to bitch at me through text about how I can never speak to L, that he now needs to quit his job since he works with her. I had just decided to not respond to him because I felt as though he was being petty and childish about the whole situation. He kept messaging me for an hour, so I responded saying he needs to grow up, that they had been broken up for three months, and they both live in different cities until the semester ends. \n\nSo AITA in this whole situation? I honestly don’t have an idea and I can’t talk to anyone about this since we said we wouldn’t tell anyone about our relationship. \n",

      "description": "Basically what happened is I came home from work and needed to walk my dogs and get some shopping so I grabbed my dogs and went down to the local dairy (corner shop), brought some stuff but part way back home I realised I had ran out of dog poo bags. I began heading home as fast as possible but then one of my dogs decided to take a dump right there, in front of this bald guy’s house who was watching me. \n\nI couldn’t think of a way of picking it up in that moment (spoiler warning, I figured out a way) so I turned to walk away but the guy called me back quite aggressively. \n\nAlso, side note, this wasn’t directly in front of his house. His house was a house on a street corner and my dog decided to poo on the side in the gutter, so he had to poke his head around the side of his house and over his fence to even see me.\n\nI apologised and told him my situation and that I didn’t plan on running out of poo bags but he wasn’t having a bar of it. His tone was kinda like the one you hear before a asshole would break your nose and I didn’t want a fight so I asked him if he had a plastic bag I could borrow. Then he said for me to empty my groceries from the plastic bag I was using and pick it up with that. I told him I could for the obvious reason I wouldn’t be able to carry my groceries but then he threatened me that he’d come down to me and force me to use the groceries bag.\n\nThat’s when I had the pretty shitty idea (no pun intended) of emptying the biscuits I brought for snacks later and used the wrapper for them to pick it up. Satisfied, he walked back into his house.\n\nI recognise that what I did could go on r/trashy if I plan for it, but I didn’t, so am I the asshole for letting my dog poo outside this guy’s house in a gutter or is the bald guy the asshole for going out of his way to threaten me unless I ruined my groceries?",

I HATE being associated with a bird. Top three on the list of things that piss me off. [It's relevant, I promise.]\n\nI've been dating this girl for just under 5 months. It's been going well, we're taking things slow and generally have a good time together. A couple weeks ago she went to see her tattoo artist and came back with a really big tattoo of a robin on the side of her neck.  Right up near her ear, no chance of covering it up. \n\nI asked her why she chose that design, and her answer was that she wanted to get something that was symbolic of me. Her brother loves tigers, so she's got a tiger tattoo on her leg for him,  same concept.  I asked her if she knew that I hated the bird association, and she said she did but decided to get it anyway. She said that she thought over all the possible negatives and decided it was worth it. \n\nSo am I an asshole for being unhappy about it? It is her body,  and she can do whatever she wants with it, but I really wish she'd chosen something else if she was that dead set on getting a tattoo to represent me. ",
